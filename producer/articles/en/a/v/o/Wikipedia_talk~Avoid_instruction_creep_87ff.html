<p><b>Page Title</b>: "Avoid instruction creep" <b>From the top of the page</b>:"This page is a proposed Wikipedia policy, guideline, or process." <b>Further down</b>: "All new policies should be regarded as instruction creep until firmly proven otherwise."</p>
<p>So... Isn't this page an example of itself? Isn't it just saying, "Gee, there are getting to be too many stupid rules, processes, and procedures here on Wikipedia...It would be better if everyone were supposed to avoid making new rules. I know! I'll propose a new rule that says no more new rules!!! Yeah!!! That'll work!!!" 14:05, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>The page originates from meta (<a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/instruction_creep" class="extiw" title="m:instruction_creep">m:instruction creep</a>), was written in 2004 and has been a guiding principle since before it was written. There appears to be some confusion here about what a guideline is (see <a href="../../../p/o/l/WP%7EPOL_b383.html" title="WP:POL">WP:POL</a>) and how they are made (see <a href="../../../p/p/p/WP%7EPPP_34c4.html" title="WP:PPP">WP:PPP</a>). Specifically, Steve seems to allude that there is a formal process that needs to be followed to make a guideline - but we do not in fact have such a process. We should ask ourselves whether this page is (1) actionable and (2) consensual. The first is obvious, as it specifies a course of action. The second is visible all over the wiki where we, indeed, avoid instruction creep. Note that the talk page lists a total of 43 users who concur. The counterquestion is, can you find me anyone who thinks we <i>should</i> use instruction creep, or bureaucratic instructions for the sake of covering every possible angle? "It sounds like an essay" doesn't really mean anything.

<ul>
<li>"Instruction creep" is too vague a terminology to possibly be of any use as a guideline, and if it is indeed a guideline, we need to start rolling back policies that have been "creeping" by some measure. This should not be considered a guideline. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 13:07, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>It's not analogous at all. We want to avoid incivility, but we've shown no record of actually wanting to reduce so-called "instruction creep" as a community. Our CSD, AIV, DRV pages have all "suffered" from instruction creep relatively recently, and all for the better. If we "avoided" it, we'd be worse off. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 13:32, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You appear to misunderstand what "instruction creep" is. It is not simply the writing of instructions; it is the writing of instructions that are needlessly complex, overly bureaucratic, or that solve no actual problem. An example of instruction creep would be anything written in legalese.

<li>Then please do point out what parts of CSD, AIV and/or DRV were recently added that are needlessly copmlex, overly bureaucratic, or that solve no actual problem, and please explain why you consider this to be "for the better".

<ul>
<li>I suggest looking at the actual policies and seeing how they've evolved. I'm not going to spend the next 30 minutes mapping out every complex, bureaucratic, useless change to these policies, or point out the "creepy" changes that actually improved them. They're plain as day on the policies. The necessity for this to be a guideline is nonexistent, and there's no consensus to make it as such, nor has an effort been made to get consensus for it. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 13:51, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am fully aware of how those policies evolved, and I note that about a week ago I had to inform you of a monht-old change in DRV that you were unaware of. So it would seem that you're merely handwaving. The long list of users above is a good indication of the consensus behind the principle here, as are the age of this page and the length of time it stood undisputed, and even you appear to be in agreement that changes that are bureaucratic or legalistic are to be avoided. It's a simple corollary of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a bureaucracy, and has proven a useful meme.

<ul>
<li>So you're aware of how they evolved, and yet accuse me of handwaving. There's no consensus for this to be a guideline, and you've done nothing to demonstrate it. A meta page isn't much of an indication of anything, and practice demonstrates otherwise. No need to make such grand accusations when you certainly know better. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 14:06, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Alleging to something and then, when asked for specifics, refusing to provide any and stating it speaks for itself, is handwaving.

<ul>
<li>Then, please, stop handwaving and begin demonstrating where the consensus is and how WP:CREEP is common practice. I've given you specifics on three policies/guidelines/processes that have encountered creep recently, simple statement of fact. So where's your consensus? Where's the common practice in regards to policy and process? --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 14:14, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm glad to see some discussion. My concern is both how this became a guideline despite little discussion and no consensus (as I outlined on Village Pump) and the language of the current version. I find it (as I wrote on VP) unspecified and sort of saying that our policies and guidelines aren't that important. I know I can't support this in its current form. I think the problem with Wikipedia procedures has more to do with language, that is, if you can actually find what you need in the first place. But the answer isn't, in my opinion, fewer procedures first and foremost, but simpler and more open-ended ones. -- <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Hart_8ceb.html" title="User:Steve Hart">Steve Hart</a> 18:16, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Carcharoth. I do think the core principle is a good one, and there should be something here that's a guideline. However, the current writeup does seem a bit essay-ish ("insidious disease", "tends to antagonize others", etc.). Also per Carcharoth's and Badlydrawnjeff's comments, if the principle is being overused, if editors are misinterpreting "simplification is good" as anything remotely like "simplification trumps substantial improvements to policy", then the writeup should try to head off this misuse. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 20:36, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>(1)"Note that administrators should always verify the legitimacy of a speedy deletion candidate before taking action. It is the administrator's responsibility to make sure that speedy deletion tags are accurate." (version before 13/10/2006)</li>
<li>(2) "Note that administrators should always verify the legitimacy of a speedy deletion candidate before taking action.

<li>(3)"Administrators must verify the legitimacy of a speedy deletion candidate by checking the history of a page before deleting it." (current version - 07/12/2006)</li>

<p>Okay. Still, after reading the article, I still don't get where instruction creep would come into the Wikipedia setting. By "page instructions" does it mean Wikipedia policy like for nominating an article for FA, or does it mean instructions for how to do something in an article? <a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDroEsperanto_f401.html" title="User:DroEsperanto">DroEsperanto</a> 16:00, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>It refers to unnecessary instructions. For instance, if you want a page merged, you can either do that yourself or propose and discuss. Instruction creep would be "every merger must be noted on the merging noticeboard, kept there for at least 48 (forty-eight) hours, and acquire the assent of at least three (3) editors of good standing (meaning not having been blocked within the last fourteen (14) days and having over a thousand (1000) edits), after which it passes to the next stage of process where it requires 75% support in a vote with a quorum of twelve (12) people lasting for 8 (eight) days". I'm only slightly exaggerating; people can and do propose such bureaucratic measures. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 16:14, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, I'm correct. Meta is meta. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:58, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'd agree with that statement if it were a language-specific page being moved to meta, but not vice-versa. Pages on Meta should theoretically apply to all Wikipedias, including en. I'm not sure how its origin on Meta somehow makes it less applicable to the English Wikipedia. Out of curiosity, if the page had been here on en since 2004, would that make a difference? <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperMachine_4dd5.html" title="User:SuperMachine">SuperMachine</a> 17:22, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, it would. It would have had years of experience specific to this project, and have wider support than what's indicated here. Many of the points brought up back in December have either failed to be addressed or outright ignored, and no efforts have been made to gain consensus for this to be a guideline here. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 17:31, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>That is incorrect. Since it came from Meta it definitely applies to the English Wikipedia. There was a brief discussion last year about whether people actually agree to this principle, and the response was that yes, they were.

<li>I'd like to hear an actual argument against this guideline; so far the only thing we have is meta-arguments. Is there anyone here who thinks instruction creep is good? If not, what exactly are we talking about? At any rate, this is not a <i>proposal</i>, for that term implies it would be something new, when in fact this page has been here for a long time. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 09:24, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I've given you actual arguments, you've, as always, either ignored them or dismissed them without a thought. We don't avoid instruction creep, so this doesn't reflect current practice, and there's no evidence that this has wide acceptance, as noted above. You <i>cannot</i> simply force your way on this and expect everyone to fall in line. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 12:26, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As usual you haven't given arguments, but some handwaving, and as usual you are contemptuous and insulting to other people. Guidelines don't force anyone to fall in line, since as you should know they aren't binding. We do discourage instruction creep; there are probably a few instances where the instructions have crept anyway (although I note you have so far failed to point out any) but that doesn't mean we don't discourage it. Similarly, we discourage page protection, regardless of the fact that some pages are protected anyway. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 12:58, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Ah, yes, the old "handwaving" standby, perfect for when there's no other argument.

<li>You are, I hope, aware that <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> is a fallacy?

<ul>
<li>PS: note that also the <i>Argumentum ad Metam</i> can in certain circumstances be a logical fallacy, e.g.: "We need a project namespace page in Wikipedia stating clearly that friends of gays should not be allowed to edit articles: there is <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Friends_of_gays_should_not_be_allowed_to_edit_articles" class="extiw" title="m:Friends_of_gays_should_not_be_allowed_to_edit_articles">such article at Meta</a>, where it is uncontested for several years now." Logical fallacy, because it is nowhere said that all of meta's <i>humor</i> pages should be copied in Wikipedia's project namespace. There isn't even a rule that all <i>other</i> long-standing pages from meta should have a similar page in Wikipedia's project namespace.<br />
Frankly, I couldn't care less whether <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_instruction_creep_eb96.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid instruction creep">Wikipedia:Avoid instruction creep</a> is a policy, a guideline, an essay, or a <a href="../../../s/o/f/Wikipedia%7ESoft_redirect_2a27.html" title="Wikipedia:Soft redirect">soft redirect</a> to the similar page at Meta.

<li>Silly argument. Perhaps we should have a new policy on editing policies about policy? Oh, wait, that would be instruction creep. Jeff, what is your substantive dispute with the idea that instruction creep should be resisted? Note that instruction creep is in respect of prescriptive instructions, not informative meta-discussion, which is always fine. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 13:53, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Because instruction creep <i>isn't</i> avoided, per discussion above, and because "avoiding" instruction creep is not always best practice, depending on circumstances. We do not generally frown upon such "creep," and partake in it in our general processes regularly. Furthermore, there is no evidence that there is wide acceptance of this, and the appearance is that Radiant believes he's above consensus building on the issue.

And it <i>should</i> be a guideline, and should be <i>discussed</i>, rather than demoted to a proposed guideline. I believe this guideline does have wide acceptance, it is just precisely what people mean by instruction creep, and where to draw the line, that seems to be disputed. We need to discuss and give actual examples, preferably on a subpage to avoid accusations of, er, instruction creep.

<p>{{<a href="../../../e/d/i/Template%7EEditprotected_d7e4.html" title="Template:Editprotected">editprotected</a>}} Until the recent kerfuffle, I hadn't noticed that this page doesn't technically apply to guidelines, only to "page instructions" and "new policies." Should we amend <a href="../../../i/n/s/Wikipedia%7EInstruction_creep_1318.html#Instruction_creep_on_Wikipedia" title="Wikipedia:Instruction creep">the relevant section</a> as follows?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Page instructions may have to be pruned at times. Feel free to remove excessive requirements <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">as you see fit</a>. All new policies <b>and guidelines</b> should be regarded as instruction creep unless it can be proved they will actually be helpful.</dd>
</dl>
<p>(The bold text above indicates the proposed addition)</p>
<p><b>Pro:</b> My understanding is that the primary reason the page doesn't discuss guidelines is that it was largely taken from Meta, and Meta doesn't have guidelines. The spirit of this page would seem to support limiting guidelines as well. Given that guidelines are actionable instructions to editors, they arguably should be guided by the spirit of WP:CREEP at least as much as "page instructions."</p>
<p><b>Con:</b> On the other hand, leaving guidelines <i>out</i> of CREEP does have the advantage of eliminating the logical contradiction. If CREEP doesn't present an obstacle to guideline proliferation, then it is logically incorrect to argue that CREEP counsels against its own adoption. What do people think?

<dd>Ha. Kerfuffle... <i>Anyways</i>, I've always thought of it as referring too guidelines too - only now do I see that those aren't mentioned. Your proposed addition seems reasonable enough. In my view, its not so much a new idea as it is a clarification. Nevertheless, too much clarification will make this page large, complicated, and an example of instruction creep - which, like you said, is something that would make it look just plain silly.

<li>Is this a guideline?</li>
<li>If yes, does it reflect current practice? I don't believe it does, as demonstrated above.</li>
<li>If yes, is there consensus? I don't believe there is, as demonstrated above. Certainly, no one has demonstrated as such. The closest point made is its existence on meta, which doesn't register here.</li>
</ol>
<p>So if a page does not reflect current practice, and lacks consensus, how is it a guideline? Can anyone who prefers this explain as such? --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 15:40, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, it's common practice, as evidenced by the fact that whenever someone makes an overly-complex, bureaucratic, or unnecessary proposal, other people will object to that on grounds of instruction creep, and that such proposals have a strong tendency to be rejected on those grounds. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 15:46, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But we don't avoid it, as demonstrated above. Some people respond to vandalism pages per <a href="../../../d/e/n/WP%7EDENY_da3a.html" title="WP:DENY">WP:DENY</a>, it doesn't make that common practice, either. It also lacks consensus - it needs both. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 15:56, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We do avoid it (although admittedly not always, but then there's extremely little that we always follow). This is demonstrated by several recent policy rewrites/simplifications, and by the fact that we don't stick tightly to procedures anywhere on the wiki, and by the fact that overly-complex, bureaucratic or unnecessary proposals are rejected. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 16:10, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Proof of <i>any</i> of that being true? --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:13, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Easy enough.

<ul>
<li>So what about the expansions of policies and guidelines as cited above. Did those not happen? As for number 2, the AfD and MfD ones in particular are always controversial, and do not help your argument one bit. As for #3, that's not in support of WP:CREEP anyway. They're not rejected because they creep anything, but because they're poor proposals. The newer policies that <i>have</i> been approved can certainly have some bureaucracy and be "creep"y, see above. Also, consensus? --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:49, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, I'd hate to sound like little echo, but do you have proof of any of that being true? First, of course, expansions of p/g happen, but it <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non_sequitur.html" title="Non sequitur">does not follow</a> that every expansion is creep. Second, at present the MFD page contains seven early closings, none of which appear controversial, so your claim that they are "always controversial" is obviously false. And third, your last argument is a straw man, since any CREEPy proposal is by definition a poor proposal. Please point out any proposals that were adopted despite being instruction creep. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 14:13, 12 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Proof of what being true? Second, I see seven controversial closes there. Not false at all - quite true, in fact. Third, that's simply your opinion and not based on anything other than that. Please see above for actual examples. And I'll note that you <i>still</i> haven't demonstrated consensus. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 14:43, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Proof of it being controversial? Your apparent dislike of early closure doesn't make them controversial. If you actually believe them to be controversial, you should take them to deletion review; that's what it's there for.

<ul>
<li>I don't quite follow you. Do you mean that (a) your apparent dislike of early closure <i>does</i> make them controversial, (b) controversial closes should <i>not</i> be taken to deletion review, (c) if any of these seven would be taken to DRV, the outcome would <i>not</i> be clear-cut, or (d) something else (please specify). <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 13:27, 13 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The third. I have had positive outcomes in challenging early closes in the past, as have others.

<ul>
<li>Wikipedia customs and common practices are, in proper circumstances, policy or guideline.

<dd>This discussion (and the state of our policy set overall) are good examples of the fact that we <i>don't</i> follow this principle, although we ought to do so. Instead we tack a policy or guideline tag onto anything we manage to agree on. As a result, our manual of style is as long as the AP's and our list of rules to observe runs to hundreds of thousands of words. I don't see a value to adding this page to our policy set, especially since if we are actually "not a bureaucracy," the tag at the top of the page shouldn't determine the force carried by the contents. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 23:09, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Chris - while I fully agree that we have way too many guidelines, you're using that as an argument against the very page that recommends <i>against</i> making more of them. To reduce our guideline complexity, a better approach would be to look over <a href="../../../p/r/o/CAT%7EPRO_40c8.html" title="CAT:PRO">CAT:PRO</a> and see which of them can be added to existing pages (I tend to recommend that a lot), or look over <a href="../../../g/_/_/CAT%7EG_2fde.html" title="CAT:G">CAT:G</a> for items to merge. I've started a list <a href="../../../o/v/e/Wikipedia%7EOverlapping_policies_and_guidelines_bdf2.html" title="Wikipedia:Overlapping policies and guidelines">here</a> (please comment); it seems we could roughly halve our current policy set through some effective merging, although I should note that the community has rather strongly objected to such merges in the past. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 10:12, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>If this were "the very page that recommends against making more of them," it would be a good guideline. But it is in fact the third page to recommend against making more of them (on en.wp alone). Two are already policy. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>: "Instruction creep should be avoided." <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>: Less explicit, but if people are free to ignore instruction creep, why implement it?

<dd>I think you have it backward. Existing policies grew out of Avoid Construction Creep; which has been around as a general concept implemented here since 2001 when this project broke off of <a href="../../../n/u/p/Nupedia.html" title="Nupedia">Nupedia</a> as an antithesis of it's controlled, editorial board concept. The whole idea of WP is to make it as free of bureaucracy as possible to keep an open community ... open. The "avoid construction creep" concept was just so obvious to most of us in the first few years, that no one bothered to write it down until just recently. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavodd_2d13.html" title="User:Davodd">Davodd</a> 17:45, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't really see what this has to do with what I said.

<li>Jeff - I don't think that moving our problems to meta is really resolving anything.
