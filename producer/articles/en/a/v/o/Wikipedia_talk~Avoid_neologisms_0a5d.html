<p>What does the sentence "Sometimes, experienced grammarians who know the meanings of prefixes, infixes, suffixes, and other -fix words might make articles about those words." have to do with neologisms?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I believe the intended meaning is "A word that is formed by taking an existing word and adding an appropriate suffix or prefix such as 'non-' or 'anti-' is not necessarily a neologism, even if that particular combination of root word and prefix/suffix doesn't get many Google hits. For example, if there was a philosophy called Fooism, which had equal numbers of supporters and detractors, it would be unfair to give Fooism its own article but insist that Antifooism is a "neologism" and shouldn't have an article. -- 192.250.34.162 17:00, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have just read this guideline page on neologisms and have been deeply disturbed by what it said. This guideline is anti-invention, anti-thought and anti natural-selection. It posits a hard strategy for dealing with new words that is quite merciless really. "Wikipedia does not accept articles on fan-made neologisms unless they have realistic evidence of existence via verifiable usage data..." is plain nonsense because the fact that someone has created it provides it with realistic evidence of existence. To then throw away these words because they are not popular or someone is trying to force them to be popular needs to have set limits. Wikipedia is in danger of stifling thought as thought depends on words and new thought depends on new words; if we are to communicate these new thoughts using language they are critical. So its an important issue to consider. Note I am only talking about new words describing new phenomena. Also would a wikipedia article that I start creating about an imaginary novel whose name is even a neologism be pulled because there is none of this evidence for the existence of the novel that you require? Wikipedia IS the evidence! This guideline is almost <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nineteen_eighty-four.html" title="Nineteen eighty-four">Orwellean</a> or <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_speak.html" title="New speak">New speakesque</a> in strictness when the actual <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">wikipedia</a> entry of <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a> speaks quite glowingly of the things. Neologisms are "..especially useful in identifying inventions, new phenomena, or old ideas which have taken on a new cultural context." or neologisms occur "...in situations where there is easy and fast propagation of information.". Now, telepathy aside, if any new conceptual framework needs any new words to convey it from one person to another, then are neologisms critical for the development of thought and so expand consciousness? Was 'wiki' not once a neologism to you? Dont you realise most of humanity would have no idea what you would mean by 'wikipedia' as it is a complete neologism for them? If they worked by the guideline proposed here, global humanity would delete the wikipedia!</p>

<p>I wrote something similar to the following passage in response to a discussion over in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_T14_df57.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/T14">an AfD</a> and thought it might actually be useful if something along these lines was included here in the guideline. If there is no objection I'll try to incorporate it into the page:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Some neologisms and protologisms can be in frequent use and it may be possible to pull together many facts about a particular term and show evidence of its usage on the Internet. It may be natural, then to feel that Wikipedia should have a page devoted to this new term, but this is not always the case.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It must be remembered that Wikipedia eschews <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> and that support for article contents must come from <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a>. Wikipedia is a tertiary source that includes material on the basis of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>, not truth; as such we must cite reliable secondary sources like books and papers <i>about</i> the term — not books and papers <i>that use</i> the term. An editor's personal observations and research (e.g. finding blogs and books that <i>use</i> the term) are insufficient to support articles on neologisms because this is original research.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Neologisms and protologisms that are in wide use but for which there are no treatments in secondary sources are not yet ready for Wikipedia. They may be in time, but not yet. The term does not need to be in Wikipedia in order to be a "true" term, and when secondary sources become available it will be appropriate to create an article on the topic.</dd>
</dl>
<p>What say you all? -- <a href="../../../c/m/h/User%7ECmh_f246.html" title="User:Cmh">cmh</a> 23:01, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Further to this, the current guideline actually seems to contradict policy. <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> specifically says it is original research if an article <i>introduces or uses neologisms, without attributing the neologism to a reputable source</i>. Yet this guideline says <i>Wikipedia does not accept articles on fan-made neologisms unless they have ... at the least, search engine hits</i>. Search engine hits are not a reputable source. I am going to draft a new version of this guideline for discussion. I'm going to try to keep the spirit of this guideline (as found here on this talk page) but make it more clear. -- <a href="../../../c/m/h/User%7ECmh_f246.html" title="User:Cmh">cmh</a> 23:15, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree, but there is a big gap between the official policy: "cite reputable sources" and practice: use large number of Internet search engine hits as correlation to whether something is notable. I think the page should say: if it has no Google hits it's almost certainly not to be included; if it has a ton of Google hits that suggests it might be notable, but is not proof. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../a/p/r/April_12.html" title="April 12">04-12</a> 07:54Z</small></i></span>
<dl>
<dd>Well, that was probably the intent...using search engine hits is to make a guess about notability, which is a separate consideration from original research. But when it comes to neologisms, verifiability is often harder to come by than notability (unlike with people, for instance). <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickelShoe_2d9b.html" title="User:NickelShoe">NickelShoe</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickelShoe_8b97.html" title="User talk:NickelShoe">Talk</a>) 14:31, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The fact that a term is in widespread use does not guarantee that it is clearly defined or even that its meaning is stable or lasting. Why should Wikipedia be on the leading edge of the definition of these terms?

<li>Looks pretty good. I think you could leave out the part explaining that neologisms are OK on talk pages and project pages. It's true, but in my opinion unnecessary and perhaps a little confusing to the neophytes who get pointed to this policy. The difference between namespaces can be covered elsewhere. More to the point, I'd also eliminate the exception for knowledgeable grammarians. Wikipedia measures contributions by merit, not contributors by qualification. For the rare cases where it might be ok, let it be hashed out in case-by-case discussion, not anticipated by policy. In most cases anything that would be accepted as valid by a grammarian would already be in use enough to pass one of the other qualification. I appreciate making the distinction between articles and article text. --<a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 03:31, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks for your constructive comments. Both the talk/project and grammarian parts were moved from the current page. I agree with you on both counts.

<dd>I like it a lot better than the current version. It actually explains the problems with neologisms and references important policies. I made a slight edit getting rid of the word "eschew". Sometimes the users we refer to this page don't have the best vocabulary, and the meaning isn't entirely clear from the context if you aren't already familiar with the policy. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickelShoe_2d9b.html" title="User:NickelShoe">NickelShoe</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickelShoe_8b97.html" title="User talk:NickelShoe">Talk</a>) 03:53, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the page should be rewritten to reflect <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>, of which this is just a special case. If the article is about a word or term, delete it (perhaps after transwiking to Wiktionary). If it is not about a word, but about a <i>thing</i>, then the notability of the <i>thing</i> is what is important; the article can be separately renamed to the most prominent name. This page should only exist as a reminder of two core Wikipedia policies/principles: 1) Wikipedia is not a dictionary, and 2) notability. Neologism = dicdef + not-notable, two reasons to delete. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../a/p/r/April_12.html" title="April 12">04-12</a> 08:00Z</small></i></span></p>
<dl>
<dd>I like the emphasis on original research better than notability, which is not really a core principle. This guideline also says not to use neologisms <i>in</i> articles, which is a separate concern from WP:WINAD. A reference to notability could be added, but since we don't have a neologism notability guideline, I think the original research thing is best at giving help at what to actually <i>do</i>. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickelShoe_2d9b.html" title="User:NickelShoe">NickelShoe</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickelShoe_8b97.html" title="User talk:NickelShoe">Talk</a>) 14:36, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your comments Quarl. I don't think dictionary prohibitions are strong enough. <a href="../../../t/o/p/Top_Fourteen_ee5a.html" title="Top Fourteen">This article</a>, for example, is more than a dicdef, but is still an article about a neologism. Sources are cited showing its use, but the article, which pulls together its <i>meaning</i> out of those uses, is original research. This is because <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> says <i>it is essential that any primary-source material, as well as any generalization, analysis, synthesis, interpretation, or evaluation of information or data, has been published by a reputable third-party publication...</i> and also because there is no secondary source to attribute the <i>meaning</i> to. That's what I'm trying to get at with the clarifications here. -- <a href="../../../c/m/h/User%7ECmh_f246.html" title="User:Cmh">cmh</a> 15:10, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay, true, original research is another reason to delete articles that happen to be about neologisms. In my mind original thought is analogous to non-notable thought&#160;:) <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../a/p/r/April_13.html" title="April 13">04-13</a> 12:01Z</small></i></span></p>
<p>As for the T14 AFD, I'm not sure I agree with your position and the outcome to delete (I saw it just now and haven't had time to think about it). The idea of a first tier of law schools is legitimate and non-original, even if this particular name for the top tier is new; only part of the article was about the name itself. Also I see 80,000 Google hits for <tt>"top 14" law</tt>, and all the ones I looked at were relevant; the term does not look "too new" to me. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../a/p/r/April_13.html" title="April 13">04-13</a> 12:01Z</small></i></span></p>

<dd>I read Leiter's blog entry and based on that I now think that 1) the "top 14" idea is relatively new, and probably believed more by pre-law students than by past law students / lawyers / judges / et al; but widely known enough that there is a growing counter-reaction to it, and 2) there's a pre-existing idea in the law community that about 15 schools are in tier 1 and a couple more in tier 1.1. The Top Fourteen article was missing the counter reaction and info on the pre-existing idea. So information on all of the above is valid, whether in the law school article or in a separate article named say "Top tier U.S. law school controversy". I don't think "avoid neologisms" should be used to justify deleting T14; use WP:NOR if anything. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../a/p/r/April_13.html" title="April 13">04-13</a> 12:15Z</small></i></span>

<dd>Stop supporting hatred and bigotry against Islam. Islamophobia is more than just criticism of Islam. Hate crimes, discrimination, and persecution of Muslims are also Islamophobic. Criticism of Islam <i>usually</i> degrades and insults Islam or Muslims, rather than being constructive criticism. Yes it may be a neologism. But so are "<a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a>", "<a href="../../../w/a/r/War_on_terrorism.html" title="War on terrorism">war on terrorism</a>", and "<a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamism.html" title="Islamism">Islamism</a>". How come you don't object to those articles? To me, it seems like you are trying to defend anti-Muslim bigotry and limit a word that has a legitamate and widespread use.

<dd>It is false to accuse me of "supporting hatred and bigotry of Islam" when nothing could be further from the truth. What's a bit unfortunate is that you're illustrating perfectly why I have the stance that I do about this term: "<i>Islamopobia is more than just critcism of Islam. Hate crimes, discrimination, and persecution of Muslims are also islamophobia.</i>" You have verified what I am saying in that the term "islamophobia" is used against critics of Islam, this is very <b>wrong</b>. When I see individuals like the former muslim <a href="../../../a/y/a/Ayaan_Hirsi_Ali_4cc6.html" title="Ayaan Hirsi Ali">Ayaan Hirsi Ali</a> frequently labeled with this term I take issue. This term is <b>bad</b> for discourse when used to shut down critics of Islam (as it frequently is used to do). I don't take issue with the concept of "Islamophobia" but merely the false utilization of the term and as such just like the term "islamofascism" it should not actually be used by Wikipedia outside of quotes and citations about it. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a> 09:10, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>There are fast-changing disciplines that tend not to be documented in formal publications. Computer technology is natorious for this for at least two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It changes so rapidly that significant trends may already be in place before there are sufficient publications.</li>
</ul>

<li>The technology and changes tend to be documented on the Internet and often in informal ways because heavy technology users tend not to purchase printed materials or subscribe to formal publications.</li>

<p>I just proposed <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santorum.html" title="Santorum">Santorum</a> for deletion, since I don't think it meets the notability criteria. However, it apparently does have citable articles about it; see that article or <a href="../../../s/a/v/Savage_Love_b882.html" title="Savage Love">Savage Love</a>. It was coined as a political act (quite openly) and was, I suspect, reported on by the mainstream media primarily because it is intended to outrage. This certainly makes it a successful political act, and it is described in that way in the Savage Love article (Love helped facilitate the coinage). However, does that make it a notable neologism for our purposes? I think it doesn't; the secondary source policy we're defining here is intended to establish that the neologism has currency <i>as a neologism</i>, and the citations should be to sources such as a dictionary of neologisms that include it. Not to say that the political act should not be mentioned; just that the neologism doesn't need a separate entry if it is not verifiable in usage as opposed to a well known act.</p>
<p>I don't know if there are other words that could fall into this category, but if so some clarification of the policy here might be appropriate. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> 04:27, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In my opinion, an article about the political act is verifiable if there are news citations. The word 'santorum' is clearly an integral part of that act, and its usage and meaning within the context of the political action is verifiable from the news sources. However, it would not be OK to go around adding santorum as a technical term within articles on, say, <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anal_sex.html" title="Anal sex">anal sex</a> (although again mentioning it within the context of the political act would be ok). After all, there are lots of words made up as, say, company names etc. that are technically neologisms; we use them because their meaning is verifiable but only within the context setup by the discussion of the company. I think the guideline as it is now is sufficient to support this reasoning so I don't think we need to change it. -- <a href="../../../c/m/h/User%7ECmh_f246.html" title="User:Cmh">cmh</a> 15:45, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that this needs to be clarified. Neologisms are sometimes <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">notable</a>. The response to the question "For how long is a neologism a neologism?" shows the current confusion: since neologisms are "words and terms that have recently been coined, generally do not appear in any dictionary, but may be used widely or within certain communities," either it all boils down to dictionaries (do Wiktionary and the Urban Dictionary count?), or the time period behind this so-called recent coinage really matters. That is, unless we're given a clearer idea about when "Avoid neologisms" reaches the edges of its usefulness as a way to decide the notability of words and terms. <a href="../../../i/e/d/User%7EIEdML_c29e.html" title="User:IEdML">IEdML</a> 21:03, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is a response to "Clarifying when articles are okay", above.</p>
<p>If neologisms are a distinct problem under the subset of OR, I think WP should create a "no neologism" tag that redirects here. The problem with tagging articles on neologisms as OR is that while yes it's technically OR, the terms being written about <i>do</i> have <i>some</i> real world existence (even if that's limited to a particular TV fan base or whatnot). Labeling it as OR without further explanation that it's OR <i>not because WP denies its existence, but because it's a neologism</i>, would clarify the situation especially when someone RfD's such an article.</p>

An article was created for a "law" that didn't really exist; it was just the title of a magazine article. After the Wikipedia article had been around a while, the term started to be used by people. Now it is failing a deletion attempt <i>because</i> people have started using it, mimicking the Wikipedia article.

<p>Protologism is quite the protologism itself and it seems rather silly to instruct writers not to use neologisms and "protologisms," all the while using "protologism" as if it itself were not such a word. I'd think it'd be best to strike use of protologism from this document, except perhaps as a footnote or parenthetical if you wish to acknowledge it's existence.

<dd>It's still a bit of a problem to use it as an article title, because it can make it sound like a specialized term. But all else being equal, I'd go with "unused highway."

<p>This guideline lacks a "nutshell" caption. I propose the following:</p>
<p><b>Just because a term or set of terms is in wide use by certain communities does not mean it belongs in Wikipedia. An article <i>about</i> a neologism must cite reliable secondary sources that have the neologism <i>as their subject</i>, not that merely <i>use</i> the term. Wikipedia should never be the first place an article appears about a neologism or set of neologisms.</b></p>

<dd>I wouldn't italicize "about" since it's not clear what it's being contrasted with. The long explanation can distinguish between primary and secondary sources.

<dd>The second version of the nutshell doesn't state the standard is for articles <b>about</b> a neologism (as opposed the use of a neologism in an article which should have a lower hurdle. So the nutshell I'd suggest is similar to the first suggestion:</dd>
<dd><b>An article <i>about</i> a neologism must cite reliable sources that have the neologism <i>as their subject</i>, not that merely <i>use</i> the term.

<p>I think Nickelshoe's original is best. The guideline is not just about articles <i>for</i> neologisms, it also says that generally they should not be used within articles: <b>New terms don't belong in Wikipedia unless there are reliable sources about the term</b>. It is a nutshell after all, not a replacement for the full text. -- <a href="../../../c/m/h/User%7ECmh_f246.html" title="User:Cmh">cmh</a><sup><small><a href="../../../c/m/h/User_talk%7ECmh_3aa0.html" title="User talk:Cmh">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cmh_e692.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cmh">C</a></small></sup> 04:49, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think Nickelshoe's is a bit <i>too</i> brief and does not contain enough of the core essence of this guideline. How about this:</dd>

<p>This guideline should not treat neologisms as the subject of an article the same as neologisms used in an another article. It's reasonable to expect new articles about a neologism to undergo enough research to find a reliable source that has the neologism as its subject. But many expressions that would be a valuable addition within an article will never have a reliable source written solely about them or finding such an article would pose too high of a hurdle for minor additions. Such a guideline for new terms within articles would stiffle the use of contemporary speech in WP and would justify deleting a huge amount of good existing content. <b>The existing guideline sets a different standard for use <i>within</i> articles and so should this one.</b> A good guide for use within an article would be an entry in wiktionary. <a href="../../../h/_/b/User%7EH_Bruthzoo_d149.html" title="User:H Bruthzoo">H Bruthzoo</a> 04:15, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This content guideline should be brought to a larger audience of policy wheels, although everything I have to say on the topic is right here. My concern is with the use of neologisms within articles, not neologisms that are the subject of articles. Specifically, I see the policy for deletionists to use this guideline to justify quashing words that have become fairly established, possibly including usage in mainstream publications. Demanding that all neologisms in WP have an reliabe source specifically about the term sets a high hurdle for new language. Neologisms in some subcultures (e.g. the drug world) are not well documented in reliable sources. More importantly, many very well established neologisms could be deleted because it would be tough to find a reliabe source about them, particularly if they are pre-internet.</dd>

<dd>Deletionists are concerned with articles about neologisms, not language within articles. Regarding within-article language, the standard is high, yes, as this is an encyclopedia, not a corpus of newspeak. In general the encyclopedia must use accessible language in order to be readable worldwide, and to ensure everyone will be able to understand the terminology. Regarding your specific example of drug names, likely the encyclopedia should not refer to drugs with local slang terms anyway; should there be a need to use these terms there are plenty of news magazines that likely can be used as sources. If the terms haven't appeared in these kinds of sources then they are precisely the terms that should not appear in wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../c/m/h/User%7ECmh_f246.html" title="User:Cmh">cmh</a><sup><small><a href="../../../c/m/h/User_talk%7ECmh_3aa0.html" title="User talk:Cmh">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cmh_e692.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cmh">C</a></small></sup> 19:06, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
