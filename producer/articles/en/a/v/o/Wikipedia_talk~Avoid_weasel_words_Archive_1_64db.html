<li><a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParanoid_098f.html" title="User:Paranoid">Paranoid</a> 21:28, 30 Aug 2004 (UTC) Looking at the editing patterns, too often the terms are used to "weasel" the negative comment into the article (see recent history of <a href="../../../t/h/e/Final_Fantasy%7E_The_Spirits_Within_893c.html" title="Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within">Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within</a>) for this and my attempt at fixing. The biggest problem is not with the words per se (the Tolstoy example below is fine with me), but with sneaking POV into articles using them.</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenc_2795.html" title="User:Benc">•&#160;Benc</a><a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenc_b8ae.html" title="User talk:Benc">&#160;•</a> 00:36, 31 Aug 2004 (UTC) Weasel terms can be useful as quick NPOV band-aids, but a band-aid is not a permanent solution</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolemnavalanche_41ef.html" title="User:Solemnavalanche">Solemnavalanche</a> They sneak POV in, but worse, they're just plain bad writing. Vague. Trite. Boring to read. Often imprecise. And you can avoid them so easily -- just a few details, a couple of citations make them unneccesary 90% of the time. Why say "some people" when you can say which people? Perhaps "Many believe Brahms to be a great composer," but does a statement like that really belong in a rich, lively, engaging article? In my opinion, no. There are much more interesting things to say about Brahms than that. Perhaps weasel terms are necessary sometimes, but why use them when they aren't? This is an excellent rule of thumb, to be broken when neccesary, as with all style guidelines.</li>
<li><a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> Weasel terms are, almost always, bad and lazy writing. They do serve one useful purpose: they are red flags pointing out where an article needs work! Nothing is "widely believed" or "claimed by many critics" without leaving some record of those beliefs or claims -- and that record can be found and cited. Moreover, we must always be careful of writing "it is thought that" when in fact the only people who think that are the writer and his pals.</li>
<li>--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheodore_Kloba_cbef.html" title="User:Theodore Kloba">Theodore Kloba</a> 15:52, Dec 10, 2004 (UTC) I agree with <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenc_2795.html" title="User:Benc">Benc</a> that "weasel terms" can be useful temporarily. I also agree with <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUtherSRG_e5aa.html" title="User:UtherSRG">UtherSRG</a> that we need a new name for "weasel terms." I like <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenc_2795.html" title="User:Benc">Benc</a>'s term, "NPOV band-aid" but since it relies on a trademarked name, I made this template: Template:NPOV-patch</li>

However, it should not be interpreted as being an absolute principle. I.e., it is a suggestion to avoid relying on weasel terms as lazy way to murkify POV issues rather than an absolute rule that weasel terms should never be used.</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/a/l/User%7EJallan_8e41.html" title="User:Jallan">Jallan</a> 21:56, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC) <i>Very</i> weak support. Try to avoid that kind of writing if you can. Often I can't and there are cases where these supposed weasel words are the proper thing to use. But throwing this out altogether would be worse. I should be reminded when I am writing such words that there might be a better way, or that such words should be cleansed by being backed up by a reference. Often they can be avoided. Say, for example, "one belief is" instead of "many believe". It seems to me that many voters on both sides here are in fact largely in agreement. What is needed is a better statement.</li>

<li>Avoiding weasel words is a good idea that improves our authority and helps find hidden POV — <i>do not use</i> weasel words is a terrible, terrible idea that is impossible to implement. <a href="../../../d/c/o/User%7EDcoetzee_a2a7.html" title="User:Dcoetzee">Deco</a> 05:04, 4 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalicocat_8d97.html" title="User:Calicocat">Calicocat</a> - Weasels mostly speak in the <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passive_voice.html" title="Passive voice">passive voice</a> -- "some say," "it is thought," "critics say" and are most often examples of <i>"stealth-POV."</i> Weasels are an enemy of accuracy and understanding. So many of the pages tagged as POV are replete with them. However, one of the more over used weasel words I've seen is "controversy." Stealth-POV, a subject that deserves a discussion of its own. Please leave the weasels <i>out</i> of articles! <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalicocat_8d97.html" title="User:Calicocat">Calicocat</a> 02:18, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Weasel words should be <i>minimized.</i> for the reasons above. It's lazy. It preempts sources and specifics. It's passive voice. The distinctions between "many," "most," "some," "a few," and so on are themselves a kind of meta-weaseling. Often, the whole issue can be circumvented with a source or two. My only quibble is the name.

It is possible that on a givven subject a dissentive view is widespread and of interest to the reader and it should be written, but agreed, not solely to portray the opinion of the writer, but even so, if this writer's opinion is widespread, then his opinion is also of relevance.</li>

I've had this rule thrown in my face in a way I consider to be overreaching, making it hard at times to write a decent sentence that is accurate. As a loose rule of thumb, it might be generally OK. That is, if it were "Generally avoid Weasel terms when you can and when it doesn't detract from accuracy", it might serve us well. But it too often, in my experience, it is interpreted as "Weasel terms are hereby banned from Wikipedia at all costs", which is nice cudgel for POV warriors to use in edit wars.

<li>This policy is nearly completely silly. The various suggested ways to avoid so-called "weasel" and "peacock" terms are generally turgid and uninformative, and suggest extreme political correctness to avoid saying anything at all. The New York Yankees example is illustrative, in that the author rejects the statement "one of the greatest teams in baseball" in favor of "one of the most successful teams in baseball." Both phrases are superlatives, the latter not one whit less subject to interpretation or refutation than the other.

<p>I think that it's too easy for a contributor to get his own opinions into the articles w/o technically using weasel words by simplying finding some high profile nut who agrees with you and quoting him.</p>

<p>So what are we meant to do when something really is "widely believed"? Attaching one name to a widely held opinion seems a worse violation of NPOV (because it draws undue attention to that one name) than just leaving it at "widely believed" would. I'm thinking of statements such as "Brahms is widely considered one of the greatest of all classical composers". --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Two different ways to deal with this. If the real point of the sentence is discussing the wide belief, then, sure, leave it in. "It was widely believed at Copernicus's time that the sun revolved around the Earth."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If the point of the sentence is Brahms himself, and not the belief, then talk about Brahms: "Brahms is one of the greatest classical composers." (But also see <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_peacock_terms_1e8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid peacock terms">Wikipedia:Avoid peacock terms</a>.) There's no point hedging on Brahms's greatness if it really isn't questioned. If it's <i>not</i> a widely accepted fact, the next editor through will change it -- not to worry!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(But the point is that Brahms greatness <i>is</i> questioned (<a href="../../../b/e/n/Benjamin_Britten_c36b.html" title="Benjamin Britten">Benjamin Britten</a> thought he was lousy, for example).

<dl>
<dd>If there's a controversy worth discussing -- like, say, there's a minority that claims that Brahms is in fact not all he's cracked up to be -- concentrate on that: "Music historian Arnold Fahrquardt has claimed that Brahms' music was in fact written by his pupils, and that Brahms had no musical ability whatsoever."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(Great if possible, but a source for such an opinion isn't always available, and in any case, you still have to somehow say that this is a minority opinion (see, for example, the last paragraph of <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symphony_No._7_%28Beethoven%29_13dd.html" title="Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)">Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)</a>). --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a>)</dd>

<dd>Agreed. Sometimes there's no particular source. You can characterize the people that hold the opinion, like "<a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christians</a> believe Jesus was the Messiah." Other times there's no cohesive group or person that holds the opinion: "Some people say dogs are the best pet; other people prefer cats".

<dd>In the latter case, you can always cite a survey: "In 1999, the Zogby Pet Poll determined that 30% of Georgian households owned cats, while 35% owned dogs." As for the former case, it isn't just that there's a strong correlation between <i>Christians</i> and <i>people who believe Jesus was the Messiah.</i> The latter is practically a definition of the former. "Christian" is a label for a complex of beliefs that <i>includes</i> the proposition "Jesus was the Messiah." --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 02:35, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can we get some help on <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Marie_Le_Pen_39bd.html" title="Jean-Marie Le Pen">Jean-Marie Le Pen</a>? The neutrality of the article is disputed, and the use of weasel terms doesn't seem to help. -- <a href="../../../m/i/g/User%7EMiguel_74e3.html" title="User:Miguel">Miguel</a></p>
<p>It's a bit painful. Le Pen has basically been criticized by political leaders and journalists in Europe and the United States - basically anybody who mentions him, except for the far rightists, is highly critical. No major French political leader outside of his party (and the Megretist spin-off) wants to have anything to do with him.</p>
<hr />
<p>To return to the discussion from a month ago (when I actually missed it totally, despite having been interested&#160;;-):</p>
<p>I think this advice is <b>a very important advice</b> (although not neccessarily given its optimal wording yet), which ought to be stressed in the <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a>-policy.</p>
<p>But at the same time I would like to give an example where I myself (for the moment at least) believe a phrase of this style being appropriate. See: <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stauning.html" title="Stauning">Stauning</a> for an article on a Danish politician. In its current version it ends with the statement: <i>There are many reasons to consider him the greatest figure in 20th century Danish politics.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree, that's also a problematic example. The article <i>ends</i> with these words? Then simply say something like <i>For the reasons cited in this article, many in Denmark consider him...</i> - <a href="../../../m/i/g/User%7EMiguel_74e3.html" title="User:Miguel">Miguel</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Being a politician, he was of course not un-controversial. And some of his political adversaries (to which I belong, sort of, altough I only work in Denmark without the right to vote) can of course, for pure prestige, not really agree. But <i>factually</i> this man is widely recognized among his fellow country-men as the greatest (or one of the very greatest) since Denmark became a democracy, and politicians became worth considering.</p>
<p>And in my opinion, it is of great importance for non-Danes (as myself - who lack a great deal of the contextual knowledge the Danes have) to get this kind of clues. You don't want to litter your memory with all kind of second- and third-rank personalities when your memory is limited.</p>
<p>I would appreciate comments.<br /></p>

<p>I have written a bit about mexican politicians, and I have similar problems. Weasel words seem to crop everywhere, and I keep them mostly because</p>
<ol>
<li>Political atmosphere is hard to measure. Polls aren´t that reliable, sometimes they skip minor events. I think having weasel words is better than simply ignoring the subject, and if you put the subject you have to explain why it was relevant in the first place. Think 500 years from now, or a different culture.</li>
<li>Putting a single if influential opinion as example isn´t enough. You are supposedly talking about the population as a whole (I think) not about the political and journalistic class, but the latter is a lot louder.</li>
<li>It is subjective. Take the Clinton impeachment example -he admitted he had an "improper relationship" with Monica, yet opinions ranged from "So what?" to "He should resign" to "Let´s move on". Writing simply "Clinton admitted an improper relationship and he was fined $..." and so on without saying something about public opinion (which is probably a weasel term) loses a lot. I think the debate wheter he had sex or not with Monica, which was important outside and inside the official procedure would tell a lot to future generations not only about ourselves but about Clinton.</li>
</ol>
<p>My intended and temporary solution is to add references and try to use weasel words for both sides. If I write "Critics said this", try to add "but supporters argued that". It's not perfect but at least you can weigh arguments. It could be better by supplying more and specific references, but brevity suffers, and I have no way of knowing if the reader will be inclined to follow. Paper enciclopedias are usually dry, but I think that's because lack of space. It is hard to decide how much to say, and my personal view is that to understand politics you must understand the people and viceversa. And as <a href="../../../r/u/h/User%7ERuhrjung_40b8.html" title="User:Ruhrjung">Ruhrjung</a> said, foreigners don't have context. Sometimes I think if this isn't a clue politics shouldn't go into an encyclopedia, but where else then?</p>

<p>For long these kind of expressions has been one of my main points of critics against the Wikipedia project, and of course I can blame myself for my bad command of English and my too superficial study of Wikipedia policies, that I in several months haven't understood that my critic actually "is" answered in Wikipedia-policies, but on the other hand it turns out from the <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_terms" class="external text" title="http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_terms" rel="nofollow">what-links-here list</a> that at least the <i>page</i> on "weasel terms" is unknown by most wikipedians.</p>
<p>A few question raise from this:</p>
<ul>
<li>is the term really good?</li>
<li>is this issue really considered important by other wikipedians, or is it a policy which is made and accepted in order to be put in the drawer and forgotten?</li>

<p>It is all well and good to make a bald statement like that and recommend to "find some evidence that backs up the statement...", etc., but I am afraid it is good procedure in that encyclopedias use anonymous controversialists. Take the Oxford Companion to the English Language in one of its paragraphs in the article on <i>Phrasal verbs</i>: "Grammarians have adopted two main positions with regard to the nature and use of phrasal verbs: (1)... (2)..." There is no mention whatsoever who these grammarians are, and why should there be? If there is a general acknowledgement that there are two or more sides to an argument then that should suffice. This happens often enough, especially if controversies stretch back in time, and it is impossible to find the original speaker. I am sorry, if this is an example of "weasel words" then I am all for it. :) --<a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDieter_Simon_f22e.html" title="User:Dieter Simon">Dieter Simon</a> 00:04, 18 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hear, hear! There's no weaseling going on when one is fairly attributing a widely held view to a class a people, such as grammarians in the example above. It's not weasling even to write "some grammarians say," so long as it's true and the "some" represents a significant faction. <a href="../../../1/6/8/User%7E168....html" title="User:168...">168...</a> 07:03, 18 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
"Two main positions" that's pretty balanced and complete. "Some people still believe that the Earth is flat." this could be viewed as fact.</p>
<p>This is not exactly the same as "Jacques Chirac is a communist" such an assertion need serious sources and serious arguments even if you wrote "Some people think that Jacques Chirac is a communist". Of course the problem appear only when the subject is controversial nobody will Discuss "Hitler was Nazi" and nobody will try to write "According too some Hitler was Nazi" to fit NPOV policy. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricd_0c9b.html" title="User:Ericd">Ericd</a> 07:29, 18 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think it depends on what is meant by "weasel terms/words". Are they different opinions that when quoted together result in a libellous article directed at individuals or institutions, and in which the opinion formers try to evade their share of the libel by remaining anonymous? If so, yes, it would indeed be a misuse of anonymity.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I must stress that it must be permissible in genuine discourse, to argue from different sides about cultural, scientific, or philosophical themes and to cite anonymous general trends of opinions either because the holders of these opinions are too numerous or the tradition of the (anonymous) opinion goes back too far in time to ascertain the individuals by name.

<p>I'm not particularly well-informed about Wikipedian policy, and am not sure if this point has already been debated, but I think the page title here, should read as "Avoid Passive Voice".</p>

<p>The problem is not the grammatical voice, but when the (grammatical) agent is omitted. Passive voice is splendid to focus on what's important, when that is what is done, or to whom it's done, but it doesn't say you have to leave out the agent.<br />

<p>I just don't like the term, but I appreciate the guideline behind it. Whenever someone declares "weasel terms" on something I've written, it feels like they're calling me a weasel in public, even if what I've written was an innocent grammatical mistake.

<p>This uses weasel words, but I don't think it's inappropriate because it's an artistic interpretation that is always subjective, and can't be reduced to objective terms.</p>

<dd>A statement expressed this way is not that useful, if you think about it. Who are these "many numismatists"? Presumably not all of them, or you could say "all numismatists". 80%? 50%? 20%? In fact, there are a lot of numismatists, so "many" might just mean 1%, and maybe the coin is really an ugly duckling that some collectors like anyway. You could support the statement by adding something like "in an informal 1996 poll, 89% of collectors considered the double eagle to be the most beautiful US coin". (I've seen these for stamps, presumably coin rags run the same kind of thing from time to time.) In practice, since coin beauty is not usually a controversial topic, an opinion will likely be unchallenged for a long time, but without objective facts in support, some random editor may come along some day and say "I've seen the coin, ugh", and summarily delete the statement. We've all done weasel wording, but to me they're kludges waiting to be upgraded to facts. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 18:21, 29 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The policy on "Avoid weasel terms" is overly broad.

For example:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><i>...is widely thought to be the work of...</i> (good)</li>
<li><i>...who claimed they were forced from their homes...</i> (bad)</li>

<dd>"Avoid unnecessary vagueness" is itself unnecessarily vague. This policy is not about being vague ("The United States of America is really big", "Einstein was born quite a while ago"), but more specifically about using certain phrases to put non-NPOV words into the mouths of unidentified sources. It's a sneaky dodge around NPOV, and it should be avoided.</dd>

<p><i>&lt;&lt; "Avoid unnecessary vagueness" is itself unnecessarily vague. &gt;&gt;</i></p>
<p>How about "Avoid unnecessary vagueness about sources." As set forth by other commentators above, attributing statements of general belief to specific sources puts a very bizarre spin on widely-held beliefs. Even a controversial assertion can and should be generalized in many instances. To wit, "Many conspiracy theorists believe that the CIA planned the assassination of John F. Kennedy." Too much specificity about who these conspiracy theorists are would cloud the issue. At the same time, the commentary of certain conspiracy theorists may be unique and noteworthy enough to include a more specific reference. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetesq_c7fc.html" title="User:Netesq">NetEsq</a> 22:30, 18 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Anyways, yes, there are some cases where you just can't name the source (dog people and cat people, for example). There are other times that you're discussing the belief in particular ("Most people believed the Sun moved around the Earth"). As with most rules of thumb, there are exceptions. If you have some good ones to add, and you think people can't figure that out for themselves, why don't you put them on the page itself? --<a href="../../../e/v/a/User%7EEvanProdromou_ecbd.html" title="User:EvanProdromou">ESP</a> 23:02, 18 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>In my opinion, it is helpful to think of this guideline as an ideal golden standard that we should always strive towards, even if it may not be perfectly attainable. Another way to view this issue is that weasel words tend to <i>hide</i> the <i>context</i> surrounding a claim, and the remedy is therefore to elaborate on the context more, hopefully to the point where the weasel word or phrasing becomes completely unnecessary. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Most people believed the Sun move around the Earth": the context is people in the modern age (as opposed to, say, medieval times); the history of thie belief stemmed from science and astronomy, while the mirror belief (Earth moves around Sun), stemmed from religion, Aristotelian natural philosophy, etc.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"dog people and cat people": are you 100% sure it is truly a universal concept? Maybe some cultures/tribes up in a remote mountain in Asia have no analog to this concept. See also <a href="../../../l/i/m/Template%7ELimitedgeographicscope_d6a3.html" title="Template:Limitedgeographicscope">Template:limitedgeographicscope</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias_28de.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias">Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, <i>context</i> is the useful keyword to think about here. The weasel word <i>may</i> be tolerated if surrounding sentences provide enough context to a reader of any background in evaluating the claim.</p>
<p>And don't forget that sometimes <i>less is more</i>—for example, calling something "a simple dish" is either redundant or offensive if you already give an example recipe on it: let the reader decide on the simplicity for themselves based on the facts (the recipe). Remember that people have different backgrounds and abilities; to someone with <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parkinson%27s_disease.html" title="Parkinson's disease">Parkinson's disease</a> for example, the "simple" task of dressing oneself can be a daily struggle. 131.107.0.81 20:43, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>STUBBISH WEASELY OR INADVERTANT?</b> It must be considered fine if one person knows they read a POV somewhere but can't remember much about the details mustn't it? They can write "a minority opinion is that..." this is enough to trigger a memory in the mind of a later reader who may know the details of that belief on a subject and fill in the ambiguity. In this way many an obscure source or topic has become expanded to an authororative article on a little known subject making Wiki in some ways a superior source of reference. The only problem is if the opinion is actually a little known but indisutable fact in which case the use of a term like "minority" may inadvertantly become weasely.</p>

<dd>It's "fine" in the same way spelling mistakes or grammatical errors are "fine". Creating Wikipedia articles is an iterative and collaborative task. Like other guidelines, this one simply points in the direction of "better". --<a href="../../../e/v/a/User%7EEvanProdromou_ecbd.html" title="User:EvanProdromou">ESP</a> 19:47, 5 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I disagree with the name and spirit of this page. So called "weasel terms" are indeed legitimate rhetorical devices (though, of course, they may be abused, as can as any other rhetorical device.) Any such statement as "Some people think X" or "Many people believe Y" should be carefully reviewed through the ordinary peer process, (just as any statement at all must be peer reviewed.) If the editorial community on the Wikipedia finds that these statements are accurate, then there is no reason not to have them.</p>
<p>Substantiating every single observation running through society with specific citations would make the encyclopedia boring and tedious to write and read, and, moreover, incomplete -- if a view is very widespread, it becomes pointless to list long source citations of everyone who holds this view, and it distorts the spirit of the statement by making it appear as if <i>only</i> those listed hold this view. At some point, it is only necessary to report on the view itself, rather than upon every single person who has ever expressed it. When writing about anything related to the arts (an inherently subjective area), or indeed, when writing any sentence that is not merely reporting on a physical fact, the article text would become awkward and overwrought with lengthy, yet incomplete, lists of attributions.</p>
<p>Let's look at <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mona_Lisa_763f.html" title="Mona Lisa">Mona Lisa</a> for an example. Taking only a few of the many "weasel statements" on that page, we find:</p>
<ul>
<li>"It may be the most famous painting in the world"</li>
<li>"Few other works of art are so romanticized, celebrated, or reproduced."</li>
<li>"The enigmatic 'smile' is the picture's most famous feature..."</li>
<li>"Others have described it [the smile] as both innocent and inviting."</li>
<li>"The most probable suspect is the wealthy Florentine Madonna Lisa del Giocondo."</li>
</ul>
<p>According to whom? Many, many people have uttered support for these positions. Are we to list them all?</p>
<p>These are all "weasel statements", according to the definitions set forth on this page. 80% of the articles in the Wikipedia use technically unsubstantiated statements like these, and there is nothing at all wrong with that, if the peer review process achieves consensus as to their accuracy.</p>
<p>It's tedious and contrived, bordering on absurd, to write articles according to the tenets presented on [[Wikipedia:Avoid weasel terms]]. I wholeheartedly oppose this page. <a href="../../../k/w/e/User%7EKwertii_f6e2.html" title="User:Kwertii">Kwertii</a> 08:07, 23 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Indeed it is, and such personal opinions must certainly be removed. However, this does not imply that we shouldn't include any useful common knowledge information in the Wikipedia simply because the language used to describe common knowledge is similar to language used to describe personal opinions. <a href="../../../k/w/e/User%7EKwertii_f6e2.html" title="User:Kwertii">Kwertii</a> 23:55, 24 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Avoid" does not mean "forbid". The question is whether adding a single layer of redirection is a fair application of a neutral point of view.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also don't see any particularly weaselly terms in the Mona Lisa quotes you've called out, with the exception of "Others have described it...". This policy is not the same as requiring people to cite sources; it's a style thing. If a sentence can't stand on its own as without a "Some have said" or "some people think" in front of it, it lacks NPOV, and needs to be better defined. --<a href="../../../e/v/a/User%7EEvanProdromou_ecbd.html" title="User:EvanProdromou">ESP</a> 21:16, 8 Feb 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that the policy on weasel terms is overly broad indeed. There happens many times where a certain person or corporation is widely said to have certain positions, but denies it himself. For instance, many people in France contend that the <a href="../../../t/f/1/TF1_62c2.html" title="TF1">TF1</a> TV-channel tends to exhibit right-wing bias; but of course, this is very difficult to substantiate precisely, and they won't admit to it. Yet, I think that the fact that many contend that this channel is biased is in itself a good piece of information. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 18:05, 2 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Disclaimer" id="Disclaimer"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Disclaimer</span></h2>
<p>I moved the disclaimer about the policy to the bottom. I think the policy page should be <i>about</i> the policy, and discussion should be on the discussion page. It doesn't make sense to tell people "see the talk page" without first having explained what's being talked about.</p>
<p>Please don't move the disclaimer again. --<a href="../../../e/v/a/User%7EEvanProdromou_ecbd.html" title="User:EvanProdromou">ESP</a> 22:17, 8 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Exceptions" id="Exceptions"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Exceptions</span></h2>
<p>So, this style guideline has been pretty controversial. I revised the description to specifically call out some exceptions, and to point out that as with all rules of thumb, it should be balanced against other considerations. I'd love to see some feedback from some detractors. Does including exceptions make this style guideline at least somewhat less worrisome? --<a href="../../../e/v/a/User%7EEvanProdromou_ecbd.html" title="User:EvanProdromou">ESP</a> 01:47, 23 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I thought that the addition of a list of exceptions was a good step, but that the article ended up reading a little funny: the beginning seemed to suggest you should never ever do this, then at the end it says it's okay sometimes. I took the liberty of trying a re-write to incorporate both points of view throughout, softening the point (but hopefully without weaseling out on it; I agree that it's important).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By the way, "weasel words" is an okay term in my opinion: it may be a little excessively negative, but at least it's clear and memorable. You don't want the style guide to be so bland no one can stand to read it.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So, I kinda worked this out differently. Presenting this rule of thumb as an on-the-one-hand-on-the-other-hand isn't really that helpful. I'd prefer to explain the rule, and have the exceptions at the end.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I also changed some of your wording that seems to be aimed at a single author. This is a rule about text, not about authoring. If I see some weasel terms <i>you</i> wrote, I should change them, just as if they were my own.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>

<dl>
<dd>No, the revisions are not much better. The designation "weasel term" is, in itself, inappropriate; it imparts negative connotations and stigma to a very common category of phraseology used to express consensus opinions or general knowledge. This category is perfectly acceptable in many, if not most, circumstances in which it is used on Wikipedia. Further, simply saying "Writing weasel sentences like these is bad, except for exceptions in situations A, B, and C" is no good; one cannot possibly list all potentially valid exceptions. (I expect the exceptions would far outnumber "evil" uses of these phrase patterns to avoid NPOV.)</dd>
<dd>This sort of situation defies simple codification that doesn't rapidly devolve into a muddled, arcane mess. Eventually, there will be 10 exceptions, and each will have 10 counter-exceptions, and those will have counter-counter-exceptions, and so on. This is needlessly bureaucratic and complex. We (editors) don't need a document to refer to in order to determine if a sentence is no good. If, in a specific instance, a particular usage of a so-called "weasel term" violates NPOV, then change it. If it doesn't, then leave it. We don't need this policy to find these instances or identify them, but it <i>will</i> be used to justify the culling legitimate consensus opinions among given groups, and thus reduce the quality and comprehensiveness of the information in the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../k/w/e/User%7EKwertii_f6e2.html" title="User:Kwertii">Kwertii</a> 20:15, 5 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wholeheartedly agree with you, Kwertii. To lay down any rules about "weaseling", would be a Sisyphean task. As you quite rightly said, one set of rules would lead to a countervailing set of rules, and to what purpose? Having been given this charged expression "weasel" removes it from its real purpose, namely that of being a rhetorical device which makes for an easy smooth style, removes pedantry and repetitiveness. And it just might hit the nail on the head in what it wants to express.<br />
The adverbial phrases <i>for example</i>, <i>such as</i>, or <i>e.g.</i> are precisely such devices. They are all there to save you having to quote every damned one of a sometimes huge number of examples that also belong to that same category you are referring to, but which would make the article you are writing almost unreadable. Thank you for standing up for this rhetorical device called "weasel word". --<a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDieter_Simon_f22e.html" title="User:Dieter Simon">Dieter Simon</a> 00:09, 6 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why should it be in an encyclopedia? That's a kinda silly question: if you're interested enough in a writer to look up the guy's name, you'd probably like to be pointed at what is <b>generally regarded</b> as his best work.

That is, how to do <i>Some people think...</i> or <i>Geographers generally believe...</i> in a good way? We can make a "See also" pointer on the weasel terms page, so they point to each other. The two rules of thumb, though contradictory, can stimulate contributors' minds and hopefully get better writing in one or another way. --<a href="../../../e/v/a/User%7EEvanProdromou_ecbd.html" title="User:EvanProdromou">ESP</a> 21:49, 6 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was reading some of the discussion that's occurred here over the last few months. I've also been thinking about sentences like</p>
<dl>
<dd><i><b>The Adventures of Foobar</b></i> is considered by many to be John Q. Nobody's greatest work.</dd>
</dl>
<p>While I agree that we neither need nor want long lists of citations for every sentence, I think it is useful to try to write in ways that hold up both stylistically and factually. For instance,</p>
<dl>
<dd><i><b>The Adventures of Foobar</b></i> is usually considered to be John Q. Nobody's most significant work. Writing in the <i>Oxbridge Dictionary of Literary Snobbiness</i>, Xerxes Solomon called it "the most important work ever to be published on a Tuesday morning".</dd>
</dl>
<p>The second form informs a reader who has never heard of J.Q. Nobody before that the work is significant and provides an authoritative source where one can find out more. On other issues, such as "The belief that the Sun revolves around the Earth was practically universal in Europe before the 16th century", simply appending "(<i>see</i> <a href="../../../h/e/l/Heliocentrism.html" title="Heliocentrism">heliocentrism</a>)" would probably suffice (although the actual heliocentrism article could probably use some more sources for reference or further reading).</p>
<p>One difference between Wikipedia and a conventional encyclopedia is that it should not be assumed <i>a priori</i> that the authors and editors of a Wikipedia article are well-versed in knowledge of the article topic. It is therefore up to the Wikipedian to demonstrate that, in fact, the article is a fair representation of the topic. The reader should be able to learn the basics of the subject from the article and other Wikipedia articles linked to it. External links and references are provided for more in-depth knowledge. Thus, the Wikipedia writer should back up assertions as much as possible so that the reader is confident that she is getting a well-rounded overview of the topic. It is a fine line between "stating common knowledge" and "pulling something out of one's [hat]". <a href="../../../g/w/i/User%7EGwimpey_8c96.html" title="User:Gwimpey">Gwimpey</a> 01:02, Jul 14, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Minimise weasel terms</span></h2>
<p>It seems to me to be the case that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most people agree that there are circumstances that it is easy to improve an article with a POV-problem by adding weasel terms, but hard to improve it in a non-weaselly way, in the sense that the attributions may not be known by any contributors, nor may they know how to find them;</li>
<li>Most people agree that any article employing weasel terms could be improved to a NPOV article that is not weaselly by adding the appropriate context, that is, the information exists, if only it can be found;</li>
</ul>
<p>(I should add that I think that the solution to the Brahms example above is that the use of "widely considered" is not a weasel term in this context: that is, one cannot tell by purely syntactic means whether a usage is weaselly or not, but rather the list of terms should be considered to be danger signs: this point is really beyond the scope of what I want to say here)</p>
<p>We say that an article that asserts controversial opinions directly has a POV problem. Equally we could say an article that dresses such opinions in weasel terms has a WNPOV problem (weaselly-neutral point of view). Then we could say that</p>
<ul>
<li>If a POV problem can be solved by introducing non-weaselly context, then apply these edits;</li>
<li>If for some reason it is not possible to find proper attributions for context, then changing the POV problematic article to a WNPOV problematic article, then go ahead: this ameliorates the problem with the article, but please indicate the continuing existence of the issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>To put this another way: POV problems are an intolerable violation of Wikipedia goals, and although WNPOV is not ideal, it is very definitely an improvement.</p>
<p>I'd suggest that the policy is best known as <b>minimise weasel terms</b>, since <b>avoid weasel terms</b> might be likely to discourage edits that improve Wikipedia. ---- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 17:51, 31 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree. Weasel terms should be avoided if possible, but they are somewhat better than flat-out POV (Although, POV will get noticed more and perhaps changed... but often in a weasely fashion anyway). Weasel NPOV seems to be a transitory stage between POV and "true" NPOV. "Minimize" instead of "Avoid" recognizes that:
<ol>
<li>Some action should be taken to correct existing weasel terms, in addition to doing your best not to make new ones.</li>
<li>Weasel terms are sometimes necessary or acceptable. (<a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_peacock_terms_1e8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid peacock terms">Peacock terms</a>, on the other hand, should be eliminated)</li>
</ol>

<dd>Although, I think the presence of such a policy is more important than the verb used in the title of the policy, and we <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_statements_that_will_date_quickly_074a.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid statements that will date quickly">already have</a> <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_self-references_3b86.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid self-references">a couple</a> "Avoid XYZ" named policies, both of which address times when it is acceptable to do XYZ or something that is almost like XYZ. Plus we'd have to decide "minimise" vs "minimize" ;) I do think that some more-descriptive phrase should be chosen instead of "weasel term"... although none come to mind. The best I can think of right now is "wishy-washy", which is probably even more colloquial than "weasel"! (Do weasels act weasely in other cultures?)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proposal to consolidate advice on writing better articles</span></h2>
<p>At present there are many articles in the Wikipedia namespace that seek to give guidance on how to write better articles. I propose consolidating these into a much smaller number. On <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJongarrettuk_Better_writing_guide_4535.html" title="User:Jongarrettuk/Better writing guide">User:Jongarrettuk/Better writing guide</a> I propose how these could be consolidated. The proposal is not to change advice, just to consolidate it. If I have inadvertently moved what you consider to be good advice that is currently in the Wikipedia namespace, please re-add it. I'm hope that the proposal to merge all these articles, in principle, will be welcomed. Of course, it may be preferred to have 2, 3 or 4 inter-connected articles than just one and would welcome advice on how this could be done. (In particular, perhaps all the guidance on layout should be spun off into one consolidated article on layout.) I'm also aware that putting lots of different bits of advice together may throw up anomalies or bits that people now disagree with (including bits that I myself disagree with:) ). I ask for support for the consolidation. Once the consolidation has happened, the advice can be changed in the normal way. Please feel free to improve on the current draft consolidation, but don't remove or add advice that is not currently on the Wikipedia namespace. If all goes well, I'll add a new <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_writing_better_articles_3c0a.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to writing better articles">Wikipedia:Guide to writing better articles</a> page on the 19th, though maybe some bits of the new article will need to be phased in over a longer period.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"weasel terms" bad, but only when disgusing NPOV issues</span></h2>
<p>It would be nice if the world were so simple that we could always find bad uses of "weasel terms" with a regular expression match. Sadily, that isn't the case.</p>
<p>'Weasel terms' can be a good indicator of poor english (excessivly passive voice), but they can just as easily be the only brief way to reference an undisputed opnion. If these were the only places they were used, the subject wouldn't be worth discussing. The real problem with 'weasel terms' is that they can be used to disguise NPOV problems, so we must consider the usage of "weasel terms" in that greater context. The million potential arguments about the valid use of the strings suggested as weasly is just a strawman argument.</p>
<p>I found out about "Avoid weasel terms" because an article I'd been watching with a horribly non-neutral point of view, which I was intending to correct sooner or later, was 'fixed': Some goodhearted NPOV warrior went and fixed the NPOV issues....</p>
<p>Except this person didn't fix them at all. What was actually done was just some phrasing changes that removed the keywords that would allow a reader to reconize the significant bias of the author right away. At first blush the article now looks much more neutral, but the changes only amounted to a few word removals and 'weasel term' insertions... the agenda of the non-neutral author remained.</p>
<p>I believe that fixing NPOV via 'weasel terms' is much worse than just leaving in the non-NPOV text in place, since it disarms some of the reader's natural defenses against biased authors.</p>
<p>Is it Wikipedia's goal that articles will actually be neutral, or is it more important that they just look neutral?<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 23:48, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>These tools still seems a basic necessity to NPOV though. If there are other POV issues in the text itself, they need addressing independently, but it's still a fact of life that these terms express differences of opinion reasonably accurately. I've run across many issues which, since they were appropriately qualified, I've left because I could agree with the qualified statement. Without them, things might easily have degenerated into edit wars. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Rodgers_82ba.html" title="User:Chris Rodgers">Chris Rodgers</a> 00:36, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, we now have people "fixing" articles by removing "weasel words" and replacing vaguely attributed statements with unqualified assertions of these statements as true!! e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aryan_race&amp;curid=42277&amp;diff=59255343&amp;oldid=59187125" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aryan_race&amp;curid=42277&amp;diff=59255343&amp;oldid=59187125" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Surely this is the reverse of the desired result of the "weasel words" policy?

<dd>Hmm... native speakers please help me :) Honestly, I had never heard the expression "weasel words" before joining Wikipedia. When I first read about it (on our guidelines) I thought "weasel" meant something like "weak", or "vague". Then I went to my dictionary and saw it indicates the animal. Now, as I intended the expression, the term weasel is absolutely not referred to the writer! It's referred to the words: the same way a weasel can suck the inside of an egg leaving it appear intact, weasel words "suck" all the meaning of the words which follow while appearingly leaving them intact. The result is that the whole sentence (weasel words + following statement) becomes an empty egg. Am I wrong? I don't see anything offensive about it. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGennaro_Prota_b0f2.html" title="User:Gennaro Prota"><span style="color: #000080; font-weight: bold;">Gennaro Prota</span></a><a href="../../../g/e/n/User_talk%7EGennaro_Prota_0c38.html" title="User talk:Gennaro Prota"><sup style="color: #006400;">•Talk</sup></a> 23:52, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Political/Religious Movements</span></h2>
<p>Political/Religious Movements don't like to say that their doctrines are something they hashed out at a committee meeting. They try to represent their doctrines as some ancient yearning of some "people" or "nation". So we get statements like "the X people/nation have long considered Y territory to be their spiritual/ancestral home". The notion of "people/nation" is purely a Political/Religious belief - there is no scientific basis for these concepts. But if you admit this notion then by definition, the belief of the self-defined "people" in their claim of territory becomes NPOV. It is not necessary to prove that anyone but the self-defined "people" actually believes it - if they don't believe it they are not the "people".</p>

<p>Not to be too cynical, but how many articles have we now got on Wikipedia that have such poorly written phrases? For instance, sneak a peak at <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zoroastrianism.html" title="Zoroastrianism">Zoroastrianism</a> - apparently Paul B feels that <i>everyone</i> knows that the majority of scholars agree with certain points of view. Apparently this is good enough not to tighten up the article. And there are hundreds of other instances, just like this one. What will it take? A wholesale rewriting or removal of material from an article to have it tightened up? I really won't be doing this, because it's not constructive.

<dd>ESP, I agree. What is the value of accepting a non-binding policy? What, exactly, is one accepting when you accept a rule that isn't a rule? If this is how it is, that this policy is non-binding "advice" or some such, then it shouldn't be called a policy at all. Having a "policy" implies that there are penalties for non-compliance with said "policy". In this case, compliance or non-compliance gives penalties only for those trying to determine what the policy really means for them ;). So, can we have a conclusion on this soon, please? Right now, it's really just fodder for flame-wars and edit-wars.

<dd>Also, as a side comment, I realize that I shouldn't have characterized this as a "policy", but as a "guideline". I guess, with that in mind, I shouldn't be so quick to judge this.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Relatively" - weasel word or not?</span></h2>
<p>I'm having a small disagreement with an editor on whether the word "relatively" is a weasel word or not. The context is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Relatively few</b> senior Japanese officers and officials were tried or convicted, and a <a href="../../../c/l/a/Class-A_war_criminal_1f49.html" title="Class-A war criminal">Class-A war criminal</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/s/Kishi_Nobusuke_ab54.html" title="Kishi Nobusuke">Kishi Nobusuke</a>, later became prime minister.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which I changed to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Just a few</b> senior Japanese officers and officials were tried or convicted, and a <a href="../../../c/l/a/Class-A_war_criminal_1f49.html" title="Class-A war criminal">Class-A war criminal</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/s/Kishi_Nobusuke_ab54.html" title="Kishi Nobusuke">Kishi Nobusuke</a>, later became prime minister.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since "relatively few" doesn't tell you how few there really were, since there is no comparison mentioned for the "relative" statistics, and that everyone has a different idea of how "relatively few" is "relatively few", I thought it pretty obvious that it is a weasel term, but the other editor disagrees. So I'm seeking opinions here whether "relatively" should be considered a weasel term or not. Or at least, avoided.<br />

<dd>I think that the difference between "relatively few" and "just a few" is essentially semantics, both could be considered either as or not as weasel words.. I think it should be stressed that the problem is not so much particular phrases or words, but rather the way in which they are used. In the example you gave, "relatively few" seems an acceptable term because it is a fairly lucid phrase implying, roughly "compared to the number of people who could have been arrested, not many were", and this interpretation is reinforced by the last part of the sentence.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think, therefore, that the article itself needs to be worded more clearly, because the use of a "weasel term" lies not so much in the term itself but rather the context. Something along the lines of "Avoid vague attribution" seems better. Consider "A number of people were injured in the explosion". Should this be regarded as a weasel term? Should we have a list of all the people? Ideally we would have a referenced number but if one isn't available, the phrase would be fine, surely? The main problem with weasel terms is when they are used to anchor disputed points of view. He who says zonk 16:23, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Poorly illustrated exception</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>When the holders of the opinion are too diverse or numerous to qualify. For example, "Some people prefer dogs as pets; others prefer cats."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a really poor example for two simple reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>There actually are statistics as to how many people hold what kinds of pets. These do not translate to preferences per se, but they would arguably be more informative to begin with.</li>
<li>The sentence as presented is content-free. "Some people prefer listening to <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johann_Sebastian_Bach_d0b5.html" title="Johann Sebastian Bach">Bach</a>; others prefer the <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_Pistols_b1a7.html" title="Sex Pistols">Sex Pistols</a>." It's all true, but what article could use <i>any</i> sentence of this form?</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't have them handy, so that's why I'm asking you: can we find actual examples, in well-written articles, of opinion holders being too diverse or numerous to qualify, where it still makes sense to mention the opinions? If not, what is this exception trying to accomplish, and can we improve on the wording of that? <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.92.119.11.html" title="User:82.92.119.11">82.92.119.11</a> 22:39, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is still a perfectly valid example. You can consider each half of the sentence separately as a possible use of weasel words: "some people prefer dogs as pets," is a separate clause from "some people prefer cats as pets." The clauses are presented together simply so NPOV is not an issue. The preference is assumed to be between these two common pet categories. Your counter example trying to illustrate that it is content free is a moot point because it removes the context that it is discussing the popularity of the most common types of pets.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That said, the reason this is still a perfectly valid example, is because it is trying to illustrate that this type of statement does not merit citation. Furthermore, it is ridiculous to propose that statistics has anything to do with this example because we can only guess at the context. "Most people prefer dogs as pets" on the other hand, would require citation of statistics.<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaggorama_a518.html" title="User:Shaggorama">Shaggorama</a> 13:56, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>

<dd><i>The preference is assumed to be between these two common pet categories.</i> In which case it is a given that these categories are not empty, so the sentence conveys exactly no meaning. This has nothing to do with weasel words; you might as well write "dogs and cats are kept as pets". That some people will prefer one thing and other people another (and yet others like both where the choice is non-exclusive) is a universal constant.</dd>
<dd><i>That said, the reason this is still a perfectly valid example, is because it is trying to illustrate that this type of statement does not merit citation.</i> These examples are supposed to be illustrative; things you could encounter in actual articles. There is no point to coming up with hypothetical abstractions if they have no conceivable actual instances. I do not dispute it does not merit a citation. Lots of things do not. Not all of them should be in an encyclopedia in the first place.</dd>
<dd><i>Furthermore, it is ridiculous to propose that statistics has anything to do with this example because we can only guess at the context.</i> I actually guessed at the context as it could appear in an <i>actual article</i>, but your rebuttal is that my guess is ridiculous.

<p>The article, to which the reference is made, states: <i>Some say he joined the Chechen guerrillas fighting on Azerbaijan’s side during the 1992-93 Nagorno-Karabakh war, though Ashurov and the Ministry of Defense’s spokesman dismiss this idea.</i> <a href="http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav051402.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav051402.shtml" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"It should be noted that"</span></h2>
<p>I have a question. Why is "It should be noted that" considered an example of a weasal phrase?

For example, "John killed the man; however, it should be noted that Maryland County investigators found he was suffering from Schizophrenia at the time of the attack and that, consequently, the act may not be murder."

<p>I daresay if every instance of 'many believe', or 'it is widely accepted' were to be removed from Wikipedia, it would become a less interesting and informative resource. In my experience, when someone tries to sneak in their minority point of view as being fact, using weasel words or otherwise, the change will not last long.</p>
<p>'Many believe' can be a useful phrase, if in fact the author is actually well-acquainted with a good number of other parties who have expressed opinion on a particular matter. To categorically frown upon this type of language is, I'm sorry to say, a rather sad and anal-retentive gesture by those who consider themselves to be the intellectual elite here at Wikipedia.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, there are some who seem to suggest that a statement made without a citation is worthless at best. Well, ultimately the buck has to stop somewhere -- you eventually follow ideas back far enough and you run out of works to cite. People express opinions. Some are dubious, some are sage. To declare anything using 'weasel words' or 'without proper citation' as invalid and unfit for publication on Wikipedia is a relic of the 'boys club' mentality of the scientific community in the 20th century. And although I cannot provide a citation, many believe that we are now in the 21st century.</p>

<p>I retain a lot of information of which I don't remember the source, including opinions that a substantial number of people do indeed hold.</p>
<p>As someone wrote long ago on this discussion page, do we really want information to be withheld from an article because someone can't remember the source?</p>
<p>I realize there can be abuse using "weasel words." An example I read on this page was "Some people believe Bill Clinton is evil." Obviously, unqualified, that is a horrid NPOV violation, even though the statement that SOME people believe it is true.</p>
<p>However, suppose someone wrote, "Many of Bill Clinton's critics considered him awful, to the point of labelling him as evil, even though polling data showed that as he left office he had high approval numbers, such that that opinion was shown to be a minority one."</p>
<p>That's NPOV enough for me, a Clinton supporter. It gives both sides.</p>
<p>There are reasons that if that line appeared in Clinton's page it might reasonably be deleted due to the lack of relevance that a small number of people did in fact see Clinton as evil. However, if that line would be retained if it began, "Many of Bill Clinton's critics, such as Ann Coulter,..." then it should be retained without such a citation.</p>
<p>Or things like "the scientific community"...does it really require a citation to say that "Creationism is rejected by the vast majority of the scientific community"? Wouldn't most Creationists admit that was true? How do you cite sources to prove it, though? Depending on context, it might need a statement affirming that some people hold to the belief due to their faith, but again, it shouldn't require a source. Would it make a real difference if one listed a scientist who has been critical of Creationism with a link? That alone wouldn't prove that the "vast majority" held the view.</p>
<p>It comes down to the truth of the statement in question, its relevance, and whether opposing views are presented. That is a looser policy than this page states.</p>

<p>Weasel words are words that create a false appearance of stating a significant fact (a fact being objectively verifiable at least in theory), but actually either express nothing of a factual nature or express a true-but-trivial (and hence defensible) assertion.

<p>"100% effective" sounds like a very high level of effectiveness (assuming that "effectiveness" has a meaningful definition in the context). In fact, that's the highest effectiveness possible. However, by adding the words "up to" before "effective", it totally changes the nature of the statement. The modified language now states that the effectiveness is bounded from the above by 100%, which true but very trivial. --68.238.243.228 12:18, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Regarding anthropomorphism</span></h2>
<p>One of the items in the list says:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthropomorphism.html" title="Anthropomorphism">Anthropomorphisms</a> like "Science says ..." or "Medicine believes ..."</li>
</ul>
<p>But I'm wondering if this is better classifed as a <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synecdoche.html" title="Synecdoche">synecdoche</a>, since we are not so much assigning human qualities to these ideas but using them to represent scientists or doctors as a whole. This is probably entirely unimportant. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 15:00, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
