<li><a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Wincoote</a> It breeds unnecessay nervousness that worthwhile truths will be subjected to inappropriate pov allegations, for example a non-British user who thought it was pov to say that the Royal Opera is the leading opera company in the UK. This is fact not opinion (and I go to its rival on the London opera scene more often - because it is cheaper), and what better way is there of getting it across to people who don't know than just telling them directly? <a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Wincoote</a> 02:40, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>People make "POV accusations", and sometimes they're wrong.

Only the last of those is a POV -- unless, of course, the article says "The IBCECC considers the Royal Opera to be the leading opera company". --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 17:02, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sometimes it is more effective to rapidly communicate a point and summarize. If articles only provide facts, and not any analysis or interpretation of these facts, what if the reader does not know how to take them? I use the example from this article, <i>William Peckenridge, 1st Duke of Omnium (1602? - May 8, 1671) was personal counselor to King Charles I, royalist general in the English Civil War, a chemist, poet, and the director of the secret society known as The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. He expanded his family's possessions to include the proprietorship of the Province of New Hampshire and the hereditary Lord High Bailiffship of Guernsey and Sark.</i>. Now when I read this, it does not give me any sense of the importance or relative accomplishments of this person. Using a "peacock term" that simply outright states he is "considered, by some people, to be the most important man ever to carry that title," much more effectively communicates the point than giving the reader a handful of facts that may or may not have any meaning. Therefore I support peacock terms that are backed up with facts. <a href="../../../e/x/c/User%7EExclusive_bad_apple_3de5.html" title="User:Exclusive bad apple">Exclusive bad apple</a> 05:30, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>too broad; does not work well when applied to the arts in particular - you would just be left with loads of "major"s, "significants" and "importants" (which will not in fact be affected by this). Or, much worse, people will work these in by quotation from historians etc, which will usually make for very turgid reading. But obviously terms to be used with care and restraint <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnbod_859e.html" title="User:Johnbod">Johnbod</a> 00:44, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I sort of half-buy this. The words can be used carefully, for instance, on a graded scale of "the most important", "one of the most important", "important", "notable", and "obscure". These are all somewhat subjective, but not POV if all the editors agree on the ranking, and serve the important&#160;:-) purpose of telling readers whether the subject of the article rate. Consider "random page"; if it brings up one of the ten Dukes of Omnium, I'd like to get a general idea of how this duke rates compared to the other Omnia, other lords, Englishmen as a whole, etc, and preferably in the lead paragraph so I know whether I want to bother reading further. In practice of course, the terms are misused a lot, reducing the value of the grading system. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 17:26 18 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that it's possible to use these in some kind of true way, like <i>Albert Einstein was the most important physicist of the 20th century.</i> But there's really not much information there -- it's kind of just noise. It'd be better to say, <i>Albert Einstein created the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theory_of_relativity.html" title="Theory of relativity">theory of relativity</a>, which changed how scientists view the universe.</i> I think it's a lot better to give the concrete particulars of a person's achievements than to say, <i>This person was really really really really really really important.</i> Again, though, this is an "avoid", not an "avoid like the plague". -- <a href="../../../e/v/a/User%7EEvanProdromou_ecbd.html" title="User:EvanProdromou">ESP</a> 00:25 19 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's alright for Einstein, but what about (say) Mozart or Bach? Do we have to start the article with quotations from musicians and music critics to establish that these were Great Composers (tm)? I'd say: always consider if you can replace a peacock term with impressive facts, if you cannot, then just put it in and let the Force of Wiki sort it out. In extreme cases this could be a NPOV issue, but for most peacock terms it doesn't get half as serious. I think the problem here is caused by the word "avoid". Just turn it into "replace", and voila -- constructive! -- Anonymous Mar 30 2004</dd>

<p>I agree. Peacock terms (great name for it, btw) usually seem to be placeholders used by editors unprepared or too lazy to make good well-researched statements. Obviously, it's much easier to write "one of the most important" than all the concrete statements in your above example. (that example should go on the policy page itself, I think). One of my creative writing professors always told me "show; don't tell." As placeholders, however, such terms serve much the same purpose as stub articles; they give interested editors an opportunity to expand and improve the article. This is a good policy! -- <a href="../../../w/a/p/User%7EWapcaplet_7f49.html" title="User:Wapcaplet">Wapcaplet</a> 02:14 19 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I <b>half</b>-agree because indeed specificity is good; but part of our task is to condense and summarize. To use the Peckinridge example above, the second example buries the reader with detail without placing in context - was Peckinridge the best personal counselor ever, or an embarassing failure because he spent too much working on a crackpot theory organizing chemical compounds by musical notes? If the reader doesn't even know where or what Guiana is, the specific description gives no hint as to whether the Guiana protectorship is of any general interest, or just a factoid added because the encyclopedist is showing off. Or to come back closer to reality, the Einstein example saying his theory "changed how scientists view the universe" is specific and accurate but useless, because NASA says that about everything they do these days, down to and including Jake Garn's barf bag. The ideal lead paragraph needs to include the overall assessment/context, and the rest of the article can then support that assertion with specific and detailed explanations. I do agree, however, that the terms are overused; only 1 in 20 senators should get to be "one of the most important", the others are just "served", and maybe "notable for X". <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 04:57 19 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I disagree with this guideline, and also with the pejorative designation "peacock terms" for this category of words, for much the same reasons as I've already stated on <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia_talk%7EAvoid_weasel_terms_05a7.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Avoid weasel terms">Wikipedia talk:Avoid weasel terms</a>. We're not writing a math textbook here, and it is not fitting to always use exact, scientific language when talking about qualitative rather than quantitative fields of study. Certainly, these "peacock terms" <i>can</i> be misused to convey a POV, but this doesn't imply that there are not legitimate uses for this category of phraseology. If a particular duke is generally regarded by historians or others who study dukes as the best/worst/whateverest person to carry the title, then that is important information to have in the article. Better than either example above (assuming that William Peckenridge is, in fact, widely regarded as one of the most important Dukes of Omnium ever) would be:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i><b>William Peckenridge,</b></i> <i>eighth <b>Duke of Omnium</b> (<a href="../../../1/6/4/1642.html" title="1642">1642</a>? - <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_8.html" title="May 8">May 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/6/9/1691.html" title="1691">1691</a>) was personal counselor to <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_I_83ee.html" title="James I">King James I</a>, general in the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Wars_of_the_Roses_8104.html" title="Wars of the Roses">Wars of the Roses</a>, a <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemist.html" title="Chemist">chemist</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bandleader.html" title="Bandleader">bandleader</a>, and the director of the secret society known as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_League_of_Extraordinary_Gentlemen_eb8f.html" title="The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen">The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</a>. He expanded the title of Omnium to include protectorship of Guiana and right of revokation for civil-service appointments in <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>.</i> Peckenridge is widely regarded as one of the most important men ever to carry his title.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Likewise, I think the Tolstoy example over on <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia_talk%7EAvoid_weasel_terms_05a7.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Avoid weasel terms">Wikipedia talk:Avoid weasel terms</a> presents a perfect instance of the type of situtation where so-called "peacock terms" and "weasel terms" are entirely appropriate. If a qualitative point is generally accepted by those who study a topic, then it should be so noted in the article in the clearest manner possible - which necessitates the use of "weasel" or "peacock" terms. Count my vote against this one, too. <a href="../../../k/w/e/User%7EKwertii_f6e2.html" title="User:Kwertii">Kwertii</a> 00:27, 7 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The thing is that this policy (call it a strong suggestion?) addresses a real problem. Have you ever noticed how so very many obscure rock bands or albums are vastly influential and highly critically regarded, going by their articles? "Avoid peacock terms" or something synonymous is pretty much the appropriate response. (Look at some versions of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mariah_Carey_467b.html" title="Mariah Carey">Mariah Carey</a> for an egregious example.)</dd>

<p>The example used here is highly confusing: "and the director of the secret society known as The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" -- is this an attempt at humor? Or is it encouraged practice to mix real and fictional identities in this way?</p>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>hehe. I see your point. Though, I think that the obscure rock band articles will continue to be like that, even with this policy. That's just unavoidable; everyone's going to write up their friends' band as vastly influential and highly critically regarded; all that can be done with that sort of thing is just to fix it when it happens.</dd>

<dd>It's nice having a <s>policy</s> <b>style suggestion</b> to refer them to.

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>On the other hand, having a formal policy like this will frequently be used as justification for editing out "good" uses of "peacock terms", removing potentially vast amounts of useful information like that War and Peace is generally regarded as Tolstoy's best work, or that the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings are Tolkien's best work, or that most people who study dukes think that Duke Peckenridge was the best Duke of Omnium ever, etc.</dd>

<dd>There're just waaaaaaaay too many cases where this sort of wording is "good" and should be used - not to mention that having a negatively cast title for this type of word automatically biases the sort against using these terms. <a href="../../../k/w/e/User%7EKwertii_f6e2.html" title="User:Kwertii">Kwertii</a> 01:36, 7 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it having a negatively cast title like "peacock terms", and the resulting bias against their use, is a good thing in general. It's a phenomenon I've always wanted a term for so I could gently suggest not acting otherwise, and "peacock terms" is an excellent one. (Perhaps I've been appalled by too many press releases.)</dd>

<dd>I'm opposed to this entry for the same reasons I've stated in the "weasel words" discussion (I'm glad to see someone likes my Tolstoy example). I have to say that I think that the "But it's only a rule of thumb!" defense is pretty weaselly in itself. Far from being something to avoid, the usage of peacock and weasel terms are an absolute necessity to present a quick, general, summary of why anyone would care about a topic. It's often desireable to go on and provide more detail later, but trying to do it all at once is a formula for incomprehensible expository lumps, and it's one of my major peeves with a lot of wikipedia writing. Factual writing need not be dry, tedious and boring, and you will not achieve total objectivity (or even neutrality) no matter how tedious you're willing to get. - <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoom_99f0.html" title="User:Doom">Doom</a> 22:10, 29 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>David Gerard writes: '<i>Absolutely. However, "try to avoid value judgements without substantiation" is an entirely suitable rule IMO.</i>'</p>
<p>First of all: that's not what this rule says, is it? If you believe that sentences should have verbs with their subjects, you don't recommend that people avoid using subjects.</p>
<p>(And: how hard do you try and avoid it, and how much substantiation is necessary? I also claim that reference to a general consensus view is often okay, though that's derided next door as the use of "weasel terms".)</p>

<dd>Well, "weasel" isn't unusual as slang, but the article is using it in an extremely specific way that *is* unusual. Non-specific attribution certainly isn't the only form of "weaseling", and maybe isn't *always* a form of "weaseling" (this is one of the points of contention). -- <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoom_99f0.html" title="User:Doom">Doom</a> 05:53, Jun 11, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I understand where you're coming from. NPOV make it difficult to use peacock words in an article. We end up using a lot of verbiage to explain whether or not someone was really one of the most important great poets or not. The thing is, readers don't care. A sentence like <i>Some people may think that Gary Snyder was one of the greatest poets, but others think he was among the most influential</i> is just devoid of content. It's much better to stick with the facts, and let the reader decide how great or influential he was. It reads better, and it's more informative. --<a href="../../../e/v/a/User%7EEvanProdromou_ecbd.html" title="User:EvanProdromou">ESP</a> 05:20, 12 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I'm pretty sure you don't.

<dd><b>A special case is the expression of aesthetic opinions. Wikipedia articles about art, artists, and other creative topics (e.g., musicians, actors, books, etc.) have tended toward the effusive. This is out of place in an encyclopedia; we might not be able to agree that so-and-so is the greatest guitar player in history. But it is important indeed how some artist or some work has been received by the general public or by prominent experts. Providing an overview of the common interpretations of a creative work, preferably with citations or references to notable individuals holding that interpretation, is appropriate. For instance, that Shakespeare is one of the greatest authors of the English language is a bit of knowledge that one should learn from an encyclopedia.</b></dd>

<p>Doom, et al, I understand your concerns. Frankly, almost every example you cited, I don't have the slightest problem with. (The example where text is bolded.) Certainly, making a statement about the general concensus of someone or something is not out of line. I don't think David or I are saying otherwise. HERE is an example of what we ARE talking about, and maybe you will see the difference. This is a version of the opening paragraph of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> from around February 2004.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Beatles are <b>the most influential popular music artists in modern times</b>, ranking alongside <b>with Bach and Beethoven</b> for <b>sheer historical impact</b>, <b>affecting the culture of Britain and America and the postwar baby boom generation, and the entire English-speaking world</b>, especially during the 1960s and early 1970s. Certainly they're the most successful, with global sales reaching past 1.3 billion records sold as of 2004. Their influences on popular culture extended far beyond their roles as recording artists, as they branched out into film and even semi-willingly became spokesmen for their generation. The members of the group were John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr (Richard Starkey), all from Liverpool, England. <b>The effect of the Beatles on Western culture (and by extension) on the rest of the world has been immeasurable.</b></dd>
</dl>
<p>Notice how much more is bolded here than in the examples you gave. Also notice how much more boring, fluffy, and devoid of content it reads. (It has changed somewhat, since then, I should mention.)</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> 00:27, 20 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I wouldn't say that it seems boring and fluffy exactly, but it doesn't read much like traditional encyclopedia writing either. It's overblown, and needed to be toned down -- much like the Gary Snyder example I was talking about above -- and you're right, the current version has indeed been toned down... but according to the weasel/peacock rules, there's still a lot of stuff in there that's supposed to be avoided. You're supposed to feel guilty for saying that the Beatles was the most influential rock band of the sixties?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My contention is that the problem isn't the weasels or peacocks, the problem is in the attitude of the person doing the writing. Telling someone to fix the symptom rather than the problem is just wrong -- it's like slapping make-up over the measels. (Though actually, I guess the real thing that's bothering me is these two rules don't make any effort at distinguishing between measels and freckles.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Look at the wording of the current version of the "avoid peacocks" rule: what it literally tells you to do is to launch into a bunch of factual statements that're supposed to <i>imply</i> what you're getting at without actually saying it. My claim is that we shouldn't be encouraging that style: it's really okay to just tell them. -- <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoom_99f0.html" title="User:Doom">Doom</a> 07:06, Jul 20, 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree, this should be an informal style guideline, not an actual policy. How to word a style guideline that aims to discourage the "problem" rather than the "symptom"? It's hard to give clearcut norms that would apply in every case, so in that sense it's a matter of judgment often. But then again, so are most things when it comes to good writing, but that doesn't stop us from making informal guidelines or suggestions.</dd>
<dd>As for feeling guilty to say they were the most influential rock band of 60s, that's not what the article originally said (I would say what it says now, "among the most influential popular music artists"...even if you disagree, it's hard to say that Chuck Berry, Ray Charles, James Brown, or the Rolling Stones aren't very closeby in the running.) The Bach/Beethoven analogy is a red herring, and the last sentence says nothing. The stuff in the middle is not really so bad. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> 21:15, 20 Jul 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I would add, even the way it's worded now, it says "<b>avoid</b> peacock terms", not "<b>abolish</b> peacock terms". "<i>But according to the weasel/peacock rules, there's still a lot of stuff in there that's supposed to be avoided.</i>" Again, boils down to subject interpretation of peacock. "Among the most influential popular music artists" or "an enormous impact beyond music" or something I wouldn't consider as such. "Ranking with Bach/Beethoven for historical impact", or "The effect of the Beatles on Western culture and the rest of the world has been immeasurable [without some kind of description]" I would. If someone has a problem that guidelines are subject to apply, I'm not sure what to say. That's something inherent about laws or even informal guidelines -- they can't cover all possible cases. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolver_5a6c.html" title="User:Revolver">Revolver</a> 21:22, 20 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've repeated this a few times now, but let me try another paraphrase: there are limits to how far the "but it's just a rule of thumb!" defense can be used to cover a dubious rule. If the idea is that anything that can be misused should be avoided, then we've got a general rule to avoid using everything. Even if the idea is to avoid things that are <i>frequently</i> misused, that still covers a huge ground (e.g. statistics).</dd>

<p>At present there are many articles in the Wikipedia namespace that seek to give guidance on how to write better articles. I propose consolidating these into a much smaller number. On <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJongarrettuk_Better_writing_guide_4535.html" title="User:Jongarrettuk/Better writing guide">User:Jongarrettuk/Better writing guide</a> I propose how these could be consolidated. The proposal is not to change advice, just to consolidate it. If I have inadvertently moved what you consider to be good advice that is currently in the Wikipedia namespace, please re-add it. I'm hope that the proposal to merge all these articles, in principle, will be welcomed. Of course, it may be preferred to have 2, 3 or 4 inter-connected articles than just one and would welcome advice on how this could be done. (In particular, perhaps all the guidance on layout should be spun off into one consolidated article on layout.) I'm also aware that putting lots of different bits of advice together may throw up anomalies or bits that people now disagree with (including bits that I myself disagree with:) ). I ask for support for the consolidation. Once the consolidation has happened, the advice can be changed in the normal way. Please feel free to improve on the current draft consolidation, but don't remove or add advice that is not currently on the Wikipedia namespace. If all goes well, I'll add a new <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_writing_better_articles_3c0a.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to writing better articles">Wikipedia:Guide to writing better articles</a> page on the 19th, though maybe some bits of the new article will need to be phased in over a longer period.

<dd>What the self-described opponents of this guideline seem to be saying that 'absolutely best' is OK if the person really is the best, even if it can't be justified somehow. The problem is that when there isn't a way to justify something, it's sometimes because it's not true. So we have two choices: we allow unsubstantiated claims or we don't. And according to <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, we don't. That means that instead of "most popular" or "best" we say "$RECORD spent $NUMBER_OF_WEEKS in the top 10", or we say that "$EXPERT said $BAND was the best in $WHATEVER".</dd>

<dd>I also note that it's in direct contrast to various guidelines for deleting articles that make no claim to notability. There's also a slight problem with claiming that the reader will judge whether the ice hockey player, canton or species of beetle is worth the reader's time. I suspect in many cases they aren't, and they are not notable, but are included for completeness. Is it worth in that case actually including the words "An unremarkable ice hockey player who received an NHL ring (or whatever) by being part of the winning team in 1983, although he never played a game." <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevage_a8b0.html" title="User talk:Stevage">Stevage</a> 17:53, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Such a player (assuming no other notability) doesn't deserve a page. An entry in the main article about the 1983 whatever is enough, probably more than enough. Using peacock terms about such a player would not make an article about the player any better, or any less deserving of an AFD. It might make an AFD harder to determine, but I don't see that as an argument for allowing peacock terms.

<p><b>These terms do not help establish the importance of an article. Let the facts speak for themselves. If the ice hockey player, canton, or species of beetle is worth the reader's time, it will come out in the facts. Insisting on its importance clutters the writing and adds nothing.</b></p>
<p>IMHO, this is totally incorrect. The introduction should establish extremely quickly the notability of the subject. Example of an overly modest intro that obeys this rule: <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freddie_Mercury_ddca.html" title="Freddie Mercury">Freddie Mercury</a> "Freddie Mercury (September 5, 1946 – November 24, 1991) was a British Asian singer, pianist and songwriter for the English rock band, Queen." If you weren't familiar with the band, you could be forgiven for thinking we were talking about an un-notable singer for some tiny garage band.<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevage_a8b0.html" title="User talk:Stevage">Stevage</a> 07:11, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You're right about that article, it needs some serious fixing and an intro that does what you say. But sprinkling peacock terms through the intro wouldn't be an improvement. It needs a complete rewrite; start with a summary of the man, his talent, his popularity, his controversial nature, then work through all of those things and more. If that sounds a lot harder than just saying "he was the greatest", it is.

<dl>
<dd>Yes, a complete rewrite would be the solution to most problems. But I argue that sprinkling a few phrases like "exceptional voice", "phenomenal stage presence" and "very successful songwriter" would improve the article as it currently stands. It could be improved further, of course - but these "peacock terms" would be in the short term an improvement, not a detriment. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevage_a8b0.html" title="User talk:Stevage">Stevage</a> 21:33, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I just wanted to point out that the Freddie Mercury example above isn't really valid here. For purposes of determining notability for Wikipedia, notability of the subject is demonstrated by the article <i>as a whole</i>, not just by the introductory paragraph. Freddie Mercury and Queen have many, many albums, awards and historical, verifiable information that can be included in their article, all of which serve to objectively prove Mercury's fame and importance. You can, in fact, simply say he was "lead singer of Queen" in the introduction, then follow that up with a long list of his actual accomplishments, and that would leave the reader just as impressed with his background as if you included the phrase "leader of the famous rock band Queen", etc. No reasonable person is going to read only the first sentence or two of an article and claim the subject is notable/not-notable without reading the rest of the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So in reality it's not actually necessary for an article about Queen or Freddie Mercury to literally say he's "groundbreaking" or "famous" or whatever. You can list his actual accomplishments, and thereby demonstrate directly to the reader just how important they are.<a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:05, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Another thing to consider is that this guideline can also cover exagerated negative comments. For example, an article shouldn't normally use phrases like "hideous", "reprehensible", "one of the worst", without proper citation of a reliable source using those words. Just as you shouldn't heap unverified praise on someone, you likewise shouldn't pile unverified scorn.</dd>

<dd>With that in mind, I agree that "peacock" is misleading, since it implies only positive phrases are a problem. How about calling it "Avoid uncited descriptions"?

<p>Because I am a massive dork, I have changed the Duke of Omnium example around so that (aside from the joke reference to the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen) he has become a plausible 17th century English nobleman. I've put his birth rather earlier, made him a counselor to Charles I instead of James I, changed the war he was a general in to the English Civil War, changed him from a bandleader to a poet, and changed his additional titles to being Proprietor of New Hampshire and Lord High Bailiff of Guernsey and Sark. I also changed him from the 8th duke to the 1st Duke, as duke creation really only got going again under Charles I, and really not until Charles II. I hope this is all acceptable. I found the anachronisms of the previous version distracting. (Now I am half-inclined to write an entire fake biography of this imaginary duke - I imagine he became Marquess of Omnium in 1641, when he became one of the moderate constitutionalist peers who switched over to supporting the king due to the overreach of the Long Parliament. He spent the Interregnum years on his estate, writing poetry and conducting his chemistry experiments, and generally avoided royalist conspiracy. At the Restoration, he was honored with the title of Duke of Omnium, and was given various honorary positions, but didn't participate too actively in the politics of the day...I am an enormous dork, I know. ) <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 13:59, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I get the idea behind this policy, along with that of "weasel words". I see what they are meant to accomplish, and I'm glad that there aren't tens of thousands of articles running around pretending to be the most important this or the most influential that. But some topics are genuinely worth the term, and I think that using it truly does impart something.</p>
<p>First of all, Einstein really was one of the most influential and important physicists of all time. The "one of" is crucial, but so is the "most influential and important" part - that's something that I think the vast majority of people in the field, and outside of it, would agree with. Marco Polo genuinely is one of the most famous European explorers of the Far East. And <a href="../../../s/h/%C5%8D/Sh%C5%8D_Sh%C5%8Dken_cea9.html" title="Shō Shōken">Shō Shōken</a>, even though none of you have heard of him, genuinely was one of the most influential native historians of the <a href="../../../r/y/%C5%AB/Ry%C5%ABky%C5%AB_Kingdom_a342.html" title="Ryūkyū Kingdom">Ryūkyū Kingdom</a>.</p>
<p>Secondly, when used discriminately enough, these terms can be extremely important. "Albert Einstein created the theory of relativity, which changed how scientists view the universe." Well, so did a lot of other people; Galileo, Kepler, Copernicus, and whoever it was that invented string theory have also to a great extent "changed how scientists view the universe", each in their own ways. This sentence does not sufficiently convey that Einstein was, you know, Einstein.</p>
<p>"William Shakespeare wrote 38 plays and 154 sonnets, on a variety of subjects" or any variant of that which allows the facts to speak for themselves do not sufficiently convey what the current opening line on his article does: "William Shakespeare was an English poet and playwright widely regarded as the greatest writer of the English language, as well as one of the greatest in Western literature, and the world's preeminent dramatist." Now, that sentence is almost entirely peacock terms, but it's all completely true, and is essential to imparting the extreme importance of Shakespeare.</p>
<p>Without using peacock terms - where appropriate - it becomes difficult for readers to be sure of the importance or significance of something. Proper scholastic writing uses peacock terms all the time - where appropriate. Now, we all know the Beatles, Einstein, and Shakespeare. But if I gave you <a href="../../../l/a/f/Lafcadio_Hearn_9c1f.html" title="Lafcadio Hearn">Lafcadio Hearn</a> or <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Said_407a.html" title="Edward Said">Edward Said</a> without ever using words like "first to..", "significant", "influential" or "important", how would you, as the stereotypical naive reader, have any idea how crucial these two writers are to their respective fields?</p>
<p>Thanks for letting me share my two cents. Again, I think that having guidelines on these things, and keeping an eye on less responsible editors, are important. But bringing the axe down on all use of "peacock terms" is a mistake. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordAmeth_30dd.html" title="User:LordAmeth">LordAmeth</a> 22:25, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Can we add these three terms as "peacock terms"? Any objections?

<p>I proposed this by template but it was removed because "(these are distinct pages; no discussion on talk". Here is the discussion on talk. No they are not distinct pages. They both, actually with wessel words three, pages talk about words to avoid. From various reason, but these are still words and constructions to avoid. Actually "legendary" is in both of them. This only proves that having three separate pages will only lead to duplicity. Actually I think that all three pages are too wordy. This is a wikipedia guideline not an essay. Having only one page would make editors to shorten it. Splittin it to three later five, ten pages will only prolong the text.</p>
<p>Actually what made me to propose changes to MOS is my experience with Wikifiing pages. I went to pages with template "Wikify" and tried to improve them. But it is often impossible to say what is the reason of the tag. It only leads you to Category:Wikipedia style guidelines, that has so many pages it is impossible to read them all. Especially when they are changing. I do not expect that even administrators read them all. Can you expect occassional users to read them and follow them? What we need is much shorter MOS, that will contain all important information. There can be essays, but this binding guideline should be much much shorter.</p>
<p>BTW.: I do not really think that all these words should be avoided. For example saying Pele is considered to be greatest footballer of all times cannot be replaced by saying he scored so many goals, win wordl champs, etc. The reason for saying this is that when you ask somebody who is the greatest footballer of all times, he will very likely reply Pele. It does not have anything to do how good he really was, it has more to do with legend about Pele. So carefull with those lists of words to avoid. It is mostly true, but not always. --<a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJan.Smolik_bd31.html" title="User:Jan.Smolik">Jan.Smolik</a> 15:46, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm curious to know to what extent the non-English Wikipedias have some of these same guidelines; I'd urge that anyone who knows for sure that they <i>do</i> have them, please add the inter-wiki links to the appropriate pages. More than once, for example, I've wanted to be able to point someone to this topic when I have been editing the Spanish-language WP, but I don't know if the topic exists there or what it is called (obviously, I can't just translate it literally into Spanish and expect people to know what I'm talking about). <a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawikitejana_e1b6.html" title="User:Lawikitejana">Lawikitejana</a> 20:59, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"<b>William Peckenridge</b>, 1st Duke of Omnium (1602? - 8 May 1671) is considered, by some people, to be the most important man ever to carry that title." To me, this example of peacock terms looks to be just the same as <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_weasel_words_0886.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words">weasel words</a>. Who are some people? It should be possible to identify which people held this opinion or which poll determined that some protion of a population held the opinion. I would argue that the peacock phrase is "<b>William Peckenridge</b>, 1st Duke of Omnium (1602? - 8 May 1671) is the most important man ever to carry that title." MCG 16:20, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>That is why people say that weasel words should be merged into peacock terms...And I agree. As you have shown, they are both the same, really.71.107.40.194 07:01, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The concepts are similar, but they're not identical. For example, the unreferenced sentence "William is the most important man to ever carry the title" is an example of a peacock term, because it is asserting high importance without verification. By contrast, the sentence "Some people consider William to be a notable title bearer because (examples given)" is an example of a weasel wording, since you are asserting that "some people" express this opinion without specifying who.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Of course, as I said, the concepts are similar, so merging the articles would probably work too. But I wanted to clarify that there is a slight difference between a peacock term and a weasel word. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 18:20, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Seriously. Somebody reading an introductionary paragraph of a person is helped more by peacock-terms than by useless lists and desciptions. Euler was one of the most important mathematicians. But nobody besides a phd in maths would understand a list of his archivements for their influence. Does just listing how many compositions bach and beethoven made give any sense of the relative position their work takes in music?</p>
<p>"peacock terms" are absolutely required for any kind of usable encyclpaedia. They are the editorial touch that seperates lists of facts from a good article.</p>
