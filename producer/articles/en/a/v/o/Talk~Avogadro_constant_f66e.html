<p>The following statement is incorrect:</p>
<p>Such an atom consists of 6 <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proton.html" title="Proton">protons</a>, 6 <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutron.html" title="Neutron">neutrons</a> and 6 <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electron.html" title="Electron">electrons</a>, and N<sub>A</sub> is therefore equal to 12 grams divided by the sum of the masses of a proton, neutron and electron.</p>
<p>While an atom of Carbon-12 does include the various subatomic particles mentioned above, it also has some mass due to the nuclear binding energy. Therefore, the sum of the masses of 6 free protons, neutrons and electrons will be different from that of an atom of Carbon-12. -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Stoker_2291.html" title="User:Matt Stoker">User:Matt Stoker</a></p>
<p>Ah yes, that makes sense. I originally added the above sentence, and I was a little worried that the numbers didn't come out quite right...&#160;:-)</p>
<p>But now you've got me thinking. The example on <a href="../../../m/o/l/Mole_unit.html" title="Mole unit">mole unit</a> adds molecular masses like this: atomic mass of carbon is 12, atomic mass of hydrogen is 1, so molecular mass of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> is 2*12+6 = 30. This is incorrect, isn't it? It neglects the mass in the binding energy. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a></p>
<p>Strictly speaking, you are correct that the chemical binding energy contributes mass. However, this mass is very small compared to the mass due to the nuclear binding energy and so can usually be neglected. For example, the chemical binding energy in a hydrogen molecule contributes a mass of ~2.4E-9 g/mol. By contrast the nuclear binding energy in Deuterium contributes a mass of ~0.0029 g/mol (over six orders of magnitude greater than the chemical binding energy). For the purpose of defining Avogadros Number to arbitrary precision, both nuclear binding energy and chemical binding energy must be accounted for and I would assume the definition refers to 0.012 kg of free Carbon-12 atoms (ie. no chemical bonding), since graphite or diamond would have a slightly different mass. However, for most other applications the chemical binding energy contribution to mass can be neglected, so the example under <a href="../../../m/o/l/Mole_unit.html" title="Mole unit">mole unit</a> should be fine. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Stoker_2291.html" title="User:Matt Stoker">User:Matt Stoker</a></p>
<p>I see, thanks. This is interesting stuff, too interesting to be hidden away in Talk:. It would be nice if we had this information either in <a href="../../../m/o/l/Mole_unit.html" title="Mole unit">mole unit</a> or <a href="../../../a/v/o/Avogadro%27s_number.html" title="Avogadro's number">Avogadro's number</a>.</p>
<p>Also, am I correct in assuming that free protons have a higher mass than nuclear ones? <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a></p>
<p>This last question is not as simple to answer as it sounds, since there is no way to independently determine the mass of a proton bound into a nucleus. However, it is true that the atomic mass of an atom is always less than the sum for a corresponding number of free electrons, protons and neutrons. This mass deficiency corresponds to the nuclear binding energy (E=mc^2) of the atom and represents the amount of energy that would have to be added to break the atom into its component subatomic particles. If you plot the mass per nucleon (neutrons and protons) vs. number of nucleons for all of the isotopes, you will notice that it initially decreases, reaches a minimum at 56 nucleons, then gradually increases. (This is why fusion is possible for light elements and fission for heavy elements). --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Stoker_2291.html" title="User:Matt Stoker">User:Matt Stoker</a></p>

<dd>It's a Good Thing that such discussions take place and result in encyclopedic material. However, I think that the section <i>Connection to the mass of protons and neutrons</i> has become a little unwieldy (like its title).

<dd>Currently the value stated on the page is a plus or minus value. That is, an experimentally determined number. Keep in mind, when you see a number expressed in scientific notation, especially when it has many decimal places and a very high power of ten, is probably not precise. The trailing digits are likely to be non-zero; however, we do not know (or are not concerned) about what they are. Avagadro's number is not, as far as has been shown yet, an integer. Unless, of course, as stated above, we redefine the kilogram. However, the <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilogram.html" title="Kilogram">kilogram</a> is defined, and there is no reason to think Avagadro's number is an integer.<a href="../../../v/r/k/User%7EVrkaul_a410.html" title="User:Vrkaul">Vijay</a> 05:24, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Avogadro's number is essentially just a conversion factor between the microscopic mass system (<a href="../../../a/t/o/Atomic_mass_unit.html" title="Atomic mass unit">atomic mass units</a> or Daltons) and the <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilogram.html" title="Kilogram">kilogram</a> system. The microscopic mass system is based on the mass of Carbon-12, while the kilogram system is currently based on the mass of a particular "standard" lump of metal in France. So naturally there's no clean integer conversion relationship between the two. However, it wouldn't be totally outlandish to redefine the kilogram in terms of some particular number of atoms, rather than an arbitrary lump. If the atoms picked were Carbon-12, then you would end up with an integer relationship (because of the nuclear binding mass/energy, it would have to be Carbon-12, see above).</dd>

<dd>Essentially, this discussion shows that whether or not Avogadro's number is an integer isn't a very interesting question; Avogadro's number is simply a conversion factor, not some fundamental physical value, so whatever number it happens to be is just not that significant. --<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChinasaur_7224.html" title="User:Chinasaur">Chinasaur</a> 01:12, 14 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In chemistry class, we always looked upon Avogadro's number as an almost magical physical universal cosmological constant. Yet I think this type of thinking could lead to a severe misunderstanding of subject (I didn't argue with the professor because I wanted good grades).</p>
<p>Isn't the number simply the number of amu's in a gram? That means that it is no more than a convertion factor, like 2.45 cm = 2 inch, or 1 pound = 4.45 newtons. There is nothing "special" about the gram; it's just an arbitrary unit, as is the amu (albeit less arbitrary).</p>
<p>So then, if you consider avogadro's number a "physical constant," that you might as well consider 2.45 and 4.45 "physical constants" too. The magical avogradro's number is in no way even close to being in the league of true constants, such as the gravitational constant, or the cosmological constant, or planck's constant, or the fine structure constant etc.</p>
<p>This artical does not reflect that. It seemes we are elevation this number to a place it does not belong. GWC Autumn 57 2004 13.10 EST</p>

<dd>That's right, Avogadro's number is just as "thingys in an arbitary wossname" type of number, caused by the fact that the original definition of the kilogram had something to do with the density of water. There's no real reason why the mass unit should not be defined in some other way involving the other fundamental units and dimensionless constants: in fact, there are a number of efforts to do exactly that. -- Anon 18:36, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>quote: "The value of Avogadro's number depends on the definition of the mole, which depends on the definition of the kilogram. Both definitions, especially that of the kilogram, are arbitrary: the kilogram system is currently based on the mass of a particular "standard" bar of metal in France. Clearly, this means that the value of Avogadro's number is less fundamental than other physical constants in the sense that there is no physical reason for its particular value. However, Avogadro's number is still a fundamental constant: all constants depend on the units used and on the definition of the units, and therefore, such a dependence does not exclude that a constant can be called fundamental."</p>
<p>Isn't that just plain nonsense? Avogadro's number is just a conversion factor. What's so fundamental about that? And the claim that "all constants depend on the units used" is just plain wrong. For example the really fundamental <a href="../../../f/i/n/Fine_structure_constant.html" title="Fine structure constant">Fine structure constant</a> is dimensionless.</p>
<p>I'm not entire sure about the exact definition of a "fundamental constant", so I won't edit this now. But I hope someone can look into it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, surely at least it should match with <a href="../../../f/u/n/Fundamental_physical_constant.html" title="Fundamental physical constant">Fundamental physical constant</a>, which says it should be "independent of systems of units". By that standard, Avogadro's number is not fundamental. I think a good operative definition of a fundamental constant is whether space aliens can be expected to know the same numerical value as we do.
<dl>
<dd>I edited the paragraph now. I hope it's correct now&#160;:)

<dd>Unfortunately, physicists do not agree on a single definition for "fundamental constant". <a href="http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/" class="external text" title="http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/" rel="nofollow">NIST</a> and <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/constants.html" class="external text" title="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/constants.html" rel="nofollow">John Baez</a> use the term not only to refer to dimensionless constants but also dimensioned ones, which are not independent of units.

<dd>It's probable slightly redundant, BUT not in the way you are surgesting, the Avogadro's number/Constant, is ment to be a constant so it can be used as a conversion factor... basicaly the sample is ment to be "number of atoms in 12 grams of pure carbon-12" (therefore they should all be caron-12 atoms).</dd>

<p>The article states</p>
<p>"Another common sense application shows that without determining the actual weight of a substance, a good rule of thumb to use is that a cubic centimeter of solid matter contains about 10^24 atoms [4]"</p>
<p>Is this really a "good rule of thumb"? The density of iron is 7874 kg/(m^3). This would mean 1 cc of iron has a mass of 7.874 g and would be 0.141 moles, or 8.5 x 10^22 atoms, two orders of magnitude lower than that "rule of thumb".</p>
<p>Gold has a density of 19300 kg/(m^3), or 19.3 g/mL. That means 1mL gold contains only 0.0980 moles, or 5.9 x 10^22 atoms; and gold is very dense. Pt's density of 21090 kg/(m^3) and the most dense element, iridium (22650 kg/(m^3)) put them in the same range, still 2 orders of magnitude less than the suggested "rule of thumb" in atomic count.</p>
<p>If you refer to the wiki page on density, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density</a> simple calculation will show none of these "representative substances" have densities even beginning to approach one where you would expect to find 10 moles of a substance in 1 cc.

<dd>Yes, it's pretty wrong. 10^22 would be more accurate. Even for water the correct number would be 3 * 10^22. (Of course, dense elements are dense more due to the mass of the atom than due to the number of atoms per cm^3, which explains why they don't go far from this range.) <a href="../../../i/t/u/User%7EItub_c2f2.html" title="User:Itub">Itub</a> 11:37, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that 10^24 seems too high, this implies that the majority of solids will lie in the range 5.0 x 10^23 to 5.0 x 10^24. By the example given above, however, both iron and gold approximate to 10^23; i.e. one order of magnitude lower. The difficulty comes when dealing with non-elemental solids e.g. polymers: how are we to estimate the number of atoms in 1cm^3 of polyethylene? And what about natural substances such as wood or stone?</dd>

<dd>However, 10^24 is a convenient number if you want to take its cube root.

<dd>The mass of the electron is not really negligible. However, it can be neglected as a first approximation, in the same way that the mass of the proton is approximately the same as the mass of the neutron. The initial part of the paragraph as it is is qualitative, or rather semi-quantitative.
