<p>Question from an amateur: are AVL trees generally considered worse (in terms of performance) than red-black or splay trees? Also, are they easier to implement? I suspect both to be the case. If so, someone should mention that in the article. <a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMIT_Trekkie_1e9d.html" title="User:MIT Trekkie">User:MIT Trekkie</a> 17:44, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>AVL Trees will give better search times than Red Black Trees. I believe the Splay Trees give better performance if you're consistently searching for a small subset of all the items in the tree. I'm not sure, but I think that AVL Trees give better search times if you do approximately the same number of searches for each item in the tree, and you do the searches in a random order. I couldn't tell you how the insertion and deletion operations will compare. --Ryan Stone 01:16, 12 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>AVL Trees and also Red Black Trees both perform in O(lg n). However, for AVL trees it is &lt; 1.44 lg n, whereas for Red Black Trees it is &lt; 2 lg n, hence AVL trees are faster. However, AVL trees are much more complicated to implemenent. Gulliveig 04:47, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The various operations need to be considered. AVL tree has quite excellent search, and sometimes poor insert characteristics. To make a statement so general isn't neutral in my opinion. For large database operations on disk, for example, especially for permanent records which are never deleted, AVL outperforms practically all other types of trees. So not only should the performance of various operations be compared, but also the type of application to which the structure will be used. Ste4k 18:25, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How can anyone claim that Red-Black trees are easier to implement? There's no obvious justification for this argument, and given that they both do the rotation thing (which is the only hard part) I'm having trouble imagining a justification. I'm betting Red-Black trees were merely described in detail in some textbook in whcih AVL trees were summarized. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.169.10.74 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.169.10.74_ddbe.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.169.10.74">contribs</a>) .</small></dd>

<p>Quoting from the article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Deletion from an AVL tree may be carried out by rotating the node to be deleted down into a leaf node, and then pruning off that leaf node directly. Since at most log n nodes are rotated during the rotation into the leaf, and each AVL rotation takes constant time, the deletion process in total takes O(log n) time.</dd>
<dd>Practically, this is a large overhead and complex to program. Therefore, it's more common to implement a lazy deletion -- leave the deletion target in place, flag it as "deleted", and replace it with an inserted node if they would occupy the same spot.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I assume that the tree will not (usually) be balanced after a lazy deletion, so an implemention which uses lazy deletion is not strictly an AVL tree.--<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalcohol_18a5.html" title="User:Malcohol">Malcohol</a> 15:53, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, as long as you "clean out" the tree whenever it falls below a certain percentage full, such as 50%, I think you still get amortized O(log n) operations. In any case, whether or not this is "properly" an AVL tree, it's pretty clearly a very simple variation on one. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 11:54, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>While we're on the topic of deletion (operation description missing btw), the text quoted above mentions rotating a node downwards into a leaf. One may also rotate a node downwards until it has only one child, and delete it by replacing it by its only child. Jesselong 18:45, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/v/l/Talk%7EAVL_tree_fad7.html" title="Edit section: Insert Operation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Insert Operation</span></h2>
<p>Quoting from the article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Insertion into an AVL tree may be carried out by inserting the given value into the tree as if it were an unbalanced binary search tree, and then retracing one's steps toward the root, rotating about any nodes which have become unbalanced during the insertion (see tree rotation). Since at most 1.5 times lg n nodes are retraced on the journey back to the root, and each AVL rotation takes constant time, the insertion process in total takes O(log n) time.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is correct, but imprecise: After the insert, only one single or double rotation is required. Afterwards, the tree will be balanced, and no more rotations are necessary. However, finding the node that needs to be rotated about requires a recursive ascent, along which one may update the balance factors. See Knuth, Art of Comp. Prog., Vol. 3, Section 6.2.3, p. 454ff (for example, p. 454 "the new trees have height h + 2, which is exactly the height that was present before the insertion; hence the rest of the tree (if any) that was originally above node A always remains balanced", or p. 456f Algorithm A, which executes either A8 or A9 exactly once, or p. 461 Table 1, which gives probabilities when each case occurs etc). marcus</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure I understand what you're quoting. what does h represent?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Hmm, I don't believe that this is correct. Feel free to grab a sheet of paper or a white board, as I'm not going to be doing the ascii drawings here.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>h refers to the height of the rotated subtree, starting at the root of the rootation or double-rotation. Please look up Knuth for more specific details. If you think this is incorrect, you may just as well provide some drawings: If you submit the to Knuth, you can cash in some real money (he rewards bug spotting with cash). marcus</dd>

<p>Imagine inserts into a BST in the following order: 3 1 8 2 5 10 4 7 9 11 6. This is now still an AVL tree with no rotations necessary. Then, if a 6 is inserted, it is unbalanced. No single or double rotation at any level, will fix this imbalance. This structure can similarly be represented infinitely up the tree, requiring that each rotation fix the level above it, thus requiring a non-constant number of rotations. I can't prove that it is Log(n) rotations (like it could be log<sub>2</sub>n or something), but I'm sure it's more than one. In fact, I think that, the simplicity of what the article currently states might not be enough, because I think that actually getting this table into an "AVL" balanced state requires a much more complicated algorithm than just the analyzing the heights of the nodes on the way up the tree. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 19:27, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I believe you mean inserting 6 after "3 1 8 2 5 10 4 7 9 11" (without the trailing 6). After that, the root has 3 with balance factor "+" (right subtree larger than left by 1), and the right subtree starts with 8 and is perfectly balanced (all balance factors 0). Now insert a 6 in the right subtree, then the balance factor of 8 becomes "+" while the tree is now unbalanced at the root (because of the 3 "+"). A single double rotation at the root makes the tree balanced, as it must. The new tree is [5: [3: [1: nil . 2] . 4] . [8: [7: 6. nil] [10: 9 . 11]]]. marcus</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Another note: O(Log n) rebalances can be necessary after a delete operation. The worst case example are "Fibonacci-trees". Also, insertion of course remains O(log n), because the place for insertion needs to be looked up and the right parent node for a rotation or double rotation needs to be found, updating balance factors on the way up. marcus</dd>

<p>I reverted quite a bit of work done by User:Toby Douglass. I've got reasons, so I'm writing them here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AVL_tree&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=77164114" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AVL_tree&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=77164114" rel="nofollow">first edit</a> Not all AVL trees are balanced after every insert. If many operations are going to be performed, sometimes the tree doesn't always meet the requirements. It is possible to have a balance factor off by more than 2. Also, insertions aren't always this simple. Take for example the example I gave above, under "Insert Operation"</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I could be wrong, but I think the normal case is to insert or delete and then rebalance; it's not that common for a tree to bear multiple inserts or deletes and then be rebalanced. For sure this happens, and obviously it helps optimise the tree since you don't need to do a slow rebalance so often, but it's a more advanced use and I would say doesn't rightfully belong in an initial explanation of the tree.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I would definitely disagree here. Which is more common? I'm not sure, but if there are several inserts or deletes to be performed it is more efficient to hold the balancing until it's done. I think the article should mention both.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have no objection to both being present, but for sure, the simple, *pedagogical*, case where a single insert and rebalance should be present. It is this approach which is most useful to someone learning how AVL trees work, since it is the simplest AVL tree. If you wish to document the more sophisticated trees, please do so. I won't be doing that, since the tree I've done rebalances after each insert and so I'm not familar enough with the solution to write it up. Toby Douglass 21:17, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

What if the deleted node has both left and right children, and the inorder successor has both left and right children. Two children will be lost in the shuffle.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I could definetely be wrong here&#160;:-) I'm under the impression that it is impossible for the in-order successor to have both left and right children; if it were so, the in-order successor would actually be the left child of that supposed sucessor (assuming a tree with smaller nodes to the left side). Note also that this is the method used in the AVL applet linked to from the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, you are mostly correct in this case. I was mistaken in this fact. The inorder successor (or predecessor) can't have both left and right children. But in my defense, the description you gave <i>did</i> forget to mention what should be done with the successor's children.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>This notation is used in one of the links from the AVL page, which goes to a University study by a couple of professors comparing AVL with RB. Also, I think it is normal practise to write order-of to whatever degree of accuracy is appropriate for the point you're making - and here, although it's quite right to say both AVL and RB are log n, AVL is a *better* log n than RB and I assert that is the correct notation to represent that information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Just because it's used elsewhere, doesn't mean it's right. Saying O(2) is wrong, because you should be using O(1). Smiliarly O(1.44 log n) is also wrong. If you want to talk about the order without using Big O, that might be appropriate for this article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<p>I'm not saying that the page can't be improved. Far from it. I think it's got a lot of necessary changes that need to be made, but I can't work on it right now.

<dd>Let me know what you think of my rebuttals. Right now I accept your point about multiple inserts, and that should be explained in the text, and I'll point out the algorithm description presumes a single insert/delete; we need to discuss the in-order successor issue and see if delete can be done in that way or not; I disagree that the O() notion is improper.

<dd>Well, I'm pretty sure that it is incorrect. Feel free to read up on <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_O_notation_de3e.html" title="Big O notation">Big_O_notation</a>, and tell me where I'm wrong (my argument is the line that says "coefficients become irrelevant as well" and "Big O captures what remains"). One "additional" point of my argument is that you use the tightest Big O possible, and while something may take f(x) = Log<sub>2</sub>n, The big O is O(g(x)), g(x) = log(x). The definition of Big O says that as long as I can come up with constants to satisfy</dd>

<dd>My Big O is satisfied. So in all cases, I can choose a<sub>0</sub> = 3, c<sub>0</sub> = 3. Now I can say that all are identical from a big O perspective. log x, 2 log x, 1.44 log x. Each can be said to be big O of both of the other two. Coefficients should be ignored in big O. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 15:57, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're both right. For the purposes of the discussion, it is important to note the constants hidden by the O-notation, but it is technically inappropriate to use O(c*n) for c a constant. Thus, unless exact runtimes are known (up to a scale), the best wording for comparison of algorithms asymptotically equivalent is e.g.: "Both are O(lg n) but the constants hidden by the notation are much smaller in algorithm X." --Quintopia 22:19, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Very very close. The purpose of big oh, is for order of magnitude differences of the worst case scenario with respect to n. Because of this, constants are necessarily removed for the purpose of Big oh. "Constants hidden by the notation" is a wee bit misleading, because it's actually more precisely "constants hidden by the worst case scenario are much smaller in algorithm X" Big O was chosen to do a purpose, and it does it well (order of magnitude differences of the worst case scenario with respect to the size of the input set), but it need not be used in every case. Saying "constants hidden by the worst case scenario are much smaller in algorithm X" is almost worthless. A much more valuable approach would to probably do a big Theta, or an average case. The problem here is that average case for an AVL tree and for Red Black trees is non-trivial to calculate. So, the better way of comparing algorithms is using the easy Big-O, "Both are O(log n)" talking about the "constants hidden by the [Big-O] notation" is demeaning (for lack of a better word) to the notation, and doesn't really mean much. Who really cares if red black trees are actually 1.333 times worse in the worst case. These worst case scenarios aren't even likely, so the Big-O is sufficent. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 08:48, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Some people care deeply! this is why Oracle uses AVL trees and not red-black trees. Also, if you come to choose a tree, why choose the less efficient tree when you could just as well choose one that is better?</dd>

<dd>Order-of is usually used in the way largely described here - you deal, as the name implies, with the order of magnitude of the operation. However, I see absolutely no harm and instead, benefit, in also using the notion to express smaller differences when the point of that particular use is simply to indicate that that information is available.</dd>

<dd>My view in this is that this deep concern to be exactly legal in the use of order-of notation is harmful. It's unimaginative and impedes explaining the concept in hand to the reader. Toby Douglass 21:17, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the depicted unbalanced and balanced trees, the balancing of the leftmost 3-element subtree doesn't appear to be able to be done by tree rotations as they are defined on the tree rotations page. When the 9 is rotated out and the 14 in, the twelve will switch to the opposite side, maintaining the imbalance. When this imbalance is "fixed" by another rotation, it will simply be returned to its original state. Thus, this subtree can never be balanced by rotations. Clearly, it is a special case for implementation, and should be noted either on this page or the tree rotations page. I intend to do so if no one objects. --Quintopia 22:13, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I don't think the article necessarily needs to explain how how to convert an arbitrary binary search tree like that 3-element subtree you mentioned into an AVL tree. But I agree, it would be interesting to state an algorithm how to do it. A simple one might be to create an empty tree, then walk the original unbalanced tree in-order, and insert each node into the new tree, using the AVL-insert. That should take O(n*log n). --<a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllefant_55f5.html" title="User:Allefant">Allefant</a> 14:24, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
