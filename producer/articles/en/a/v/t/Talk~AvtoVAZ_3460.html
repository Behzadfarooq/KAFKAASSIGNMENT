<p>Some of the information is not up-to-date. E.g., there are new models like the 20111 etc., and there is a new off-road car (in the making?); these new cars are much more "modern" in their appeal.

<p>According to a lada expert, the diesel lada was only built for domestic markets, and not, as the model list suggests, only for export. Now the page is in conflit with itself. However, I do not know the source for the listing, but did not want to go mess with it.</p>
<p>I wonder what the source for the list is, as it has british names for the cars listed. I added a comment saying that the names differ from market to market so they should only be referred to as model number. As this is an international/english speaking site I suggest the model names be removed from the list (i.e. Riva/Nova). I will do this at a later date.</p>
<p>I made a few other changes too, and intend to add some modern information as well. Also there should be more written on the Kalina as it has begun production and is looking to be a best seller.</p>

<dd>There were no diesel car engines on the domestic Soviet market. Soviet diesels were designed for tanks and army trucks, not consumer cars. I did find a Russian source that says 21045 is using modern (licensed??) VAZ-343 diesel engine made in Barnaul, but it seems the producion of this car is very low, for testing purposes mostly; you can't find it in dealerships outside <a href="../../../t/o/g/Togliatti.html" title="Togliatti">Togliatti</a>. I'm just too lazy to incorporate lots of this and other useful information available on many Russian sites. Sorry.</dd>
<dd>The source for the names is the official corporate history of the VAZ, <a href="http://history.vaz.ru/cars/" class="external free" title="http://history.vaz.ru/cars/" rel="nofollow">http://history.vaz.ru/cars/</a> Numeric model numbers like Lada 1200SL were the most used internationallly, and the Soviet "AutoExport Corp." wouldn't be so flexible to appoint different naming schemes for each market, maybe excluding some major ones like the UK. I don't see any point in removing model names. Noone should remember all those crazy manufacturer codes, that's too much for cars that all are based on the Fiat 124 and differ only by say front fascia, like 21063 to 21033.</dd>
<dd>Don't bother with the Kalina, it's getting mostly mediocre reviews even from the loyal press. The promises were high but the build quality seems to stay on a level typical to VAZ (see The Object of Jokes) and the parts quality is not catching up. The sales of VAZ cars are falling since last year while the sales of foreign cars are increasing, and no further raise of the import tax will help if the VAZ won't improve, but just don't seem to be able to, as shown by the fiasco of their efforts to adapt <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chevrolet_Niva_8f25.html" title="Chevrolet Niva">Chevrolet Niva</a> for export. They'd better license some designs from <a href="../../../g/m/_/GM_Daewoo_f51a.html" title="GM Daewoo">GM Daewoo</a>, quick, while GM is still not afraid to lose their image once and forever.</dd>
<dd>I'll be uploading some official imagery from www.lada-auto.ru files some time later. --<a href="../../../d/m/i/User%7EDmitryKo_2815.html" title="User:DmitryKo">DmitryKo</a> 19:35, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, won't mess with names. Found some info on the Samara engine, will be adding that.</dd>
<dd>The diesel engine thing should perhaps be cleared up in some short way.</dd>
<dd>Wether the Kalina is any good or not I guess is beside the point, it seems to be the model Lada is betting on for the future so we should add info as it comes available.</dd>

<dd>I would rather keep them separate and link within the Lada article to AvtoVAZ. The name Lada was not used for the domestic market AFAIK.

<p>Even though it wasn't used, still it was well known due to reexports (not to mention that these were the same cars), and currently it IS used. I see little point in having duplicate articles on the same subject.

<blockquote>
<p>The original Lada is often thought of as a 'rugged' car, lacking in most modern luxuries expected in modern cars. While sanctions banned their export to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, Ladas were available in several Western countries during the 1980s, including <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">Britain</a>, where, due to a perception of poor quality and their low price, they became the subject of jokes such as these (which were also frequently used for <a href="../../../y/u/g/Yugo.html" title="Yugo">Yugo</a>, <a href="../../../s/k/o/Skoda.html" title="Skoda">Skoda</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trabant.html" title="Trabant">Trabant</a>):</p>
<dl>
<dd>Q: How do you double the resale value of a Lada?<br /></dd>
<dd>A: Fill it up with petrol.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Q: Why do Ladas come with rear window defrosters as standard?<br /></dd>
<dd>A: So your hands stay warm while you're pushing it.</dd>

</dl>

<dd>Q: Have you heard about the new Lada 16-valve?<br /></dd>
<dd>A: Yes. Eight in the engine and eight in the radio.</dd>
</dl>
In 1982 Lada became the sponsors of the <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classic_%28snooker%29.html" title="Classic (snooker)">Classic</a> <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snooker.html" title="Snooker">snooker</a> tournament and offered any player who made a <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highest_snooker_break.html" title="Highest snooker break">147 break</a> a Lada; <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Davis_6bb4.html" title="Steve Davis">Steve Davis</a> (who achieved it) later commented that the players had joked that the prize for nearly doing so but missing the final black was two Ladas.</blockquote>
<p>It's unsourced and Wikipedia is not a collection of jokes. No other car marque has a jokes section (altough I did try do add one to <a href="../../../a/u/d/Audi.html" title="Audi">Audi</a> and <a href="../../../b/m/w/BMW_bcb4.html" title="BMW">BMW</a>). // <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELiftarn_fddd.html" title="User:Liftarn">Liftarn</a></p>
<p>I personally believe the joke section does have a place in Wikipedia, as long as it's kept short. It is a fact that such jokes have been circulating about Ladas, particularly about Ladas imported to the Western Europe, and I think there have been more jokes about Ladas than any other brand. Also, those jokes are dieing as there are very few old-style Ladas left in the Western Europe. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobixen_2f4f.html" title="User:Tobixen">tobixen</a> 03:15, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I believe that one picture on the page has been tagged incorrectly.</p>
<p>The third picture says the model depicted is 2106, while in fact it is 2103. The main visual differences between the two models were the interior and the grill. 2106 had plastic housing for the headlights, while 2103 did not. I know that because I used to live in the Soviet Union where my father owned a 2106 and my uncle owned a 2103.</p>
