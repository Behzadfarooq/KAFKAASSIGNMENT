<p>Thank you for contributing to the different articles on second-person narration. It is very much needed with some qualified help on this issue! I see that you have added an eample of "Jonathan Garg's New Moon" to the point of view article. Who is this Jonathan Garg? I have never heard about him and I have not been able to find anything on him, and the link that you have added seems to lead to a website that does not quote its sources whatsoever!? Thanks again! <a href="../../../j/e/p/User%7EJeppebarnwell_5179.html" title="User:Jeppebarnwell">Jeppebarnwell</a> 10:43, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Glad to help. Actually, all I did was try to clean up the confusion between <a href="../../../p/o/i/Point_of_view_%28literature%29.html" title="Point of view (literature)">Point of view (literature)</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narrator.html" title="Narrator">Narrator</a>. A lot of POV material was in the Narrator article, so I just cut and paste and tried to make that somewhat coherent. I didn't evalutate the content as such. I'm not the source of the reference to Jonathan Garg. Part of my purpose was to add clarity so that it would be easier to research some of the details. When I discovered the subordinate articles, it seemed to me that a lot of the detailed material could go into the subordinate pages, so there's still work to be done. But when I saw the debate about merging going back months, untangling the pages looked like a soluble first step. <a href="../../../a/v/t/User%7EAvt_tor_cbb9.html" title="User:Avt tor">Avt tor</a> 14:55, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Agree with your edits to the lead, but I think it would be better to correct problems (mentioning Jewish in the opening line, dropping phrase "anti-Palestinian") without characterizing them in the summary line as anti-Semitic.</p>
<p>It is important to Lieberman's bio that he is Jewish, more important than noting Dodd's religion, whatever it may be. I think we can agree though, that it does not belong up top, without resorting to charges of anti-Semitism. Likewise, he is one of the most anti-Palestinian legislators in Washington. But we agree that the use of that phrase (instead of pro-Israel) is inflammatory. Toning down rhetoric is a good thing. It would be just as good to talk about toning down rhetoric instead of characterizing factually accurate but inappropriately placed comments as anti-Semitic.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's my two cents. <a href="../../../j/d/2/User%7EJd2718_bc8a.html" title="User:Jd2718">Jd2718</a> 20:33, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Singling out public figures for being Jewish, in a way that isn't applied to other public figures, is a method used by anti-Semitic groups to isolate and marginalize Jewish personalities. It's not harmless or neutral, regardless of how factual it is. There is a way to put relevant background in context. Someone keeps injecting this material back in, and their agenda should be exposed. <a href="../../../a/v/t/User%7EAvt_tor_cbb9.html" title="User:Avt tor">Avt tor</a> 20:50, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think there are two problems here. We don't know the editor. And as much as you dislike the edits or I think they are inappropriate, we do not know the editor's motivation. By labeling them anti-Semitic you may be in violation of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_Good_Faith_ad0e.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume Good Faith">Wikipedia:Assume Good Faith</a>. And while the violation may be minor, it is worth reading the policy.</dd>
<dd>Second, there is a need for editors to revert anti-Semitic editing on Wikipedia. But I am talking about the real thing (try <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> or <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jew</a> for lots of examples. I would not count these edits in the same category. <a href="../../../j/d/2/User%7EJd2718_bc8a.html" title="User:Jd2718">Jd2718</a> 01:03, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fair enough. I'll take your word about those other articles. I don't think I can edit my earlier reason, but I won't phrase the objection that way in the future. <a href="../../../a/v/t/User%7EAvt_tor_cbb9.html" title="User:Avt tor">Avt tor</a> 15:15, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your heart is in the right place, but I hope you're ready for a serious battle. I went through a tremendous amount of conflict when I wrote the notability guideline for royalty, and that's nothing compared with the number of editors that will show up to tear this one apart. Fans of Star Wars, Star Trek, Firefly, Battlestar Galactica, Dragon Ball Z, World of Warcraft, Pokemon, and pretty much every other pop culture genre are going to be all over this.</p>
<p>I have two suggestions to make this easier. First, try to make everyone happy (within reason) even if it means ruining the guideline. If it can't hold together after massive changes, it wasn't meant to be. Second, answer questions and requests for a few weeks, just to get the ball rolling, then bow out. Just take it off your watch list and let the changes go on without you. Check back once in a while to see how things are shaping up, but don't drive yourself crazy trying to defend it for months on end. If it's been turned into a good guideline, other people will step up to defend it for you. If not, then the people have spoken.</p>
<p>It would take a serious miracle to get this one to fly, but if you can keep your sanity then at least it will make for some interesting discussion and a good learning experience. Good luck! <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/f/User_talk%7EKafziel_9d20.html" title="User talk:Kafziel">Talk</a></sup> 17:15, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I need a guideline to help me in editing other pages. I'm not interested in imposing my will on the community, I'm asking for opinions as to where the lines should be drawn. There are pages for people whose major accomplishment seems to be posting to other people's blogs or having some cute schtick at cons. If the bar is lowered that much, it would call for hundreds or thousands of pages to be created, which IMO would overstate the importance of fandom, and in practice would mean that people who have friends who edit Wikipedia would be overstated in importance relative to others of greater note. I hope you're right that many people will have opinions; that should help make this useful to people. It's not the media stuff that needs to be fixed, as the existing guidelines work fairly well for content related to TV shows. <a href="../../../a/v/t/User%7EAvt_tor_cbb9.html" title="User:Avt tor">Avt tor</a> 17:25, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Don't get me wrong - it looks like you're doing well so far. But things are just getting warmed up. I just wanted to give you a couple of pointers, as one of the most recent editors to have gone through the process. Some won't like it the way it is, some won't like the fact that it exists at all, and some will say it's already covered by a different guideline and should be deleted. Don't lose sight of <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> and you should do fine. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/f/User_talk%7EKafziel_9d20.html" title="User talk:Kafziel">Talk</a></sup> 17:40, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not to worry, I barely own things that actually are published commercially under my own name.&#160;:) The purpose of this, from my perspective, is to ask the community where we should be drawing the line. I proposed this because the existing guidelines don't clearly cover the situations I'm seeing, or rather, the existing guidelines seem to lead toward deletion and I want consensus in the grey areas before doing anything like that. In most cases I am at least slightly personally acquainted with the people in question and I wish to be extra careful. <a href="../../../a/v/t/User%7EAvt_tor_cbb9.html" title="User:Avt tor">Avt tor</a> 17:56, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You obviously have some expertise in these areas. I haven't broached the articles to do with fandom, but I wanted to let you know that I can see you know what you're talking about. I'm not just flattering you on this - it's an assessment I've made. The hard part with the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> article is finding sources that will satisfy people; almost anything on that article is likely to be contested, no matter how uncontroversial it may seem to the person making the statement. I'm not sure what can be done to make progress, but I'm happy to talk about it if you ever want to kick it around. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 09:33, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I suppose I have been at this for a while. It can be hard finding definitive sources, though I do know who to ask about things. One of the problems with Wikipedia is the hyperincrementalism that happens; without a clear outline, a page can become an odd aggregation of not-closely-related comments. I've been thinking about how to rewrite the science fiction page. Hopefully I can resist the temptation to publish essays in relevant publications just for the purpose of citing them in Wikipedia.&#160;:) <a href="../../../a/v/t/User%7EAvt_tor_cbb9.html" title="User:Avt tor">Avt tor</a> 16:07, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Lol, yeah I know the feeling. Actually, I am sometimes tempted to cite my own publications, but I then feel I should be discussing it on the talk page first ... which opens a can of worms. I started to rewrite the science fiction article at one point, but eventually gave up. It currently seems to be a morass. But I reckon I'll at least pay a bit more attention to the talk page for awhile. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 22:47, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>I think the bot is working fine, it's the changes that caught my attention. For example, on January 24, you marked Hugo Award as "Top" importance (I might consider it "High", but whatever) and "B"-class. Where is this discussion happening? Avt tor 21:52, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm not really discussing it with anyone, just going by feeling. I'd consider the Hugo Award top because people who aren't interested in SF at all would know about it. ie. it's (one of) the most famous SF award(s), and sometimes it gets on the news. I rated it as B because the text is reasonably mature, (length-wise, depth of coverage) but it hasn't been formally awarded a GA class. B is the highest ranking that can be given to an article without formal approval by non-involved editors. If you disagree with any of my assessments, you are free to change them.&#160;:) - Malkinann 22:00, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Is that the usual practice? Somehow I got the impression there was discussion first. I'm a bit new to this. I suppose if I objected to something I'd take it to the talk page. <a href="../../../a/v/t/User%7EAvt_tor_cbb9.html" title="User:Avt tor">Avt tor</a> 22:06, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>You're right, of course. I tend to think WP needs some kind of chatty level, too; non-inflammatory vandalism showing up on talk pages doesn't come across on my radar as vandalism. We all get a bit goofy at times, and doing so on a talk page is considerably better than doing so on an article page. As well, I suppose I'll become more vigilant with time. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamwaltz_5483.html" title="User:Samwaltz">samwaltz</a> 21:18, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Heya, thanks for the perspective. I guess I could see grey areas - I've never had problems with phrases like "10 Jews, 11 opinions", but, I suppose there's a degree to which a statement becomes more acceptable as it's more *cough* accepted; ah well, it's still an ambiguous enough concept, considering how deeply racism and homophobia are still rooted/institutionalised in parts of the world, so I suppose there are other important criteria. Hrm. Well, anyway, I will be trying to keep my eyes wider open in the future.</dd>
<dd>Btw, I've noticed you tweaking a number of pages on my watchlist. I'm curious just how much overlap there is. Heh. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamwaltz_5483.html" title="User:Samwaltz">samwaltz</a> 17:43, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hrm, okay. Yah, I've gotten involved in geographically local pages (currently commuting between <a href="../../../k/o/%C5%A1/Ko%C5%A1ice.html" title="Košice">Košice</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vienna.html" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>, but still peeking in on <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delaware.html" title="Delaware">Delaware</a>-related articles). I've ended up crossing into a few other languages; I still do on occasion, but the <i>feel</i> of German Wikipedia is qualitatively different. I've tried adding a <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Talk_Like_A_Pirate_Day_ecdf.html" title="International Talk Like A Pirate Day">International Talk Like A Pirate Day</a> page there, at which point it got deleted as vandalism. (*sigh* Germans) When the mood takes me, I'll dabble in some gaming things. Play around with <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarianism.html" title="Libertarianism">libertarianism</a>, political philosophy and literary theory when I get a chance. Being an expatriate develops some really interesing ideas about political participation and <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_suffrage.html" title="Universal suffrage">universal suffrage</a>. The guilty pleasure, of course, is anything science fiction, esp. alternate history. Of course, my exposure to Sci-Fi is more limited when I'm not in English-speaking territories; I use Wikipedia to keep me in the loop. (I do thank the gods for QuantumMuse and Baen's online library.)</dd>
<dd>Now, I haven't really gotten involved with various WikiProjects as much as I'd been meaning to (in my copious free time&#160;:) ). How much work goes into developing one? <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamwaltz_5483.html" title="User:Samwaltz">samwaltz</a> 16:17, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was wondering whether we could assist the working relationship between <a href="../../../n/o/v/WP%7ENOVELS_3258.html" title="WP:NOVELS">WP:NOVELS</a> and <a href="../../../s/f/_/WP%7ESF_153e.html" title="WP:SF">WP:SF</a> by extending our "Task Forces" further.</p>
<p>What I had in mind was one rather like the style of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Korea_Military_history_6605.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Korea/Military history">Wikipedia:WikiProject Korea/Military history</a> where there is a subject overlap between the Korean project and the Military History project. We have our first task force established which is <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Novels_Short_story_task_force_1657.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels/Short story task force">Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels/Short story task force</a> and we are looking to gradually extend these to cover different arreas of special interest, probably "lliterature type" (as is the first), "genres" and maybe nationality or country based. However what I am proposing is a "Science fiction novels &amp; prose task force" which would be as much part of <a href="../../../s/f/_/WP%7ESF_153e.html" title="WP:SF">WP:SF</a> as <a href="../../../n/o/v/WP%7ENOVELS_3258.html" title="WP:NOVELS">WP:NOVELS</a>.

<dd>So protentially that might give us one shared "task force" with yourselves, and you might find there are room for say three, one with us for "Novels and prose", one with the "Television" wikiproject, and one with the "Film" wikiproject. But those co-ops would depend on those wikiprojects of course. We could get one up and operational and then tout the idea to the others once operational.&#160;:: <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevinalewis_f9e4.html" title="User:Kevinalewis"><span style="color: #33C;">Kevinalewis</span></a>&#160;: <a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevinalewis_47c9.html" title="User talk:Kevinalewis"><span style="color:#CC9900"><sup>(Talk Page)</sup></span></a>/<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevinalewis_Desk_00cd.html" title="User:Kevinalewis/Desk"><span style="color:#CC9900"><sub>(Desk)</sub></span></a> 15:46, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for writing. I did go to the <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worldcon.html" title="Worldcon">Worldcon</a> article. From the number of uncited, "insidery" assertions, it gives the impression of having been largely written by someone associated with Worldcon, rather than an objective editor.</p>
<p>The article really doesn't address the points I brought up. Is Worldcon mounted by a volunteer organization, with no salaried employees? The article doesn't say. Does it have sponsorships? How does it pay for itself every year? The article doesn't say. The point about guests of honor being who is available comes from experience in the profession. I feel badly that my comments were taken personally.

<p>why you little trumped up ... just kidding. In reality, thank you for the consideration of letting me know. <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 16:00, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well <a href="../../../e/l/r/Elron_Awards_5945.html" title="Elron Awards">Elron Awards</a> might be a useful search term and already seems to be the main part of <a href="../../../v/c/o/VCON_0960.html" title="VCON">VCON</a>. How about simply redirecting there? --<a href="../../../t/i/k/User%7ETikiwont_2b2d.html" title="User:Tikiwont">Tikiwont</a> 13:17, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thnak for elaborating. I would not insist in redirecting this, so I left the prod tag. Even if someone later creates such a redirect, it would be without the categories. --<a href="../../../t/i/k/User%7ETikiwont_2b2d.html" title="User:Tikiwont">Tikiwont</a> 09:18, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you very much for your careful policing of the <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Lieberman_34c5.html" title="Joe Lieberman">Joe Lieberman</a> article. (Sure seems to get a lot of vandalism!) After this recent sweep of vandalism, I think we did a lot of good by noting on these people's pages what they did. We even blocked one especially obnoxious guy.</p>
<p>I am saddened to know that we have to share a planet (not to mention an online encyclopia) with these people, I'm just glad we're doing something to prevent this kind of stuff from happening.</p>
