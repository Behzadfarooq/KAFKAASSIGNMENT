<p>Here's an example of why your edits are POV:</p>
<p><i>Chrysostomos was savagely lynched by the Turkish mob</i></p>
<p>Savagely? What's up with that? <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> means including all sides of an issue, no matter how ridiculous you perceive them to be. --<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoikhoi</a> 03:11, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My version would not use POV adjectives like that. You also need to <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">back up your claims with neutral sources</a>. Other examples:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The Greek army liberated the city from more than 800 years of Ottoman occupation</i></dd>
<dd>This is completely from a Greek perspective - how do you think that the Turkish inhabitants of the city felt?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Within a few days, more than 3000 years of Greek presence in Asia Minor, and in the greater Izmir area in particular, ended in an unprecedented bloodlust</i></dd>
<dd>Bloodlust?? You're making the Turks sound like the worst people in the world. If you could just state the facts without POV then you'd be fine.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>No problem. You shouldn't be using adjectives in this way at all. It is not up to us to determine how the readers should see these things, it's up to them. That's why we need to be neutral on everything. I understand how you feel about these events, many of my relatives were killed in the Holocaust, but I'm not going to go to that article and say that Jews were killed by the "savage bloodthirsty Germans".</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not saying that these events should be censored, I'm saying that they have to be said in a way that is acceptable to both Greeks <b>and Turks</b>. See the <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adana.html" title="Adana">Adana</a> article for example. In the section about the Adana massacre, it shows both sides of the issue. --<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoikhoi</a> 03:58, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You know, I am a little tired of what is going on during the last days. I am all new to Wikipedia and I have to admit that I made some stupid mistakes in my first edits for which I honestly apologize to you and to everyone involved. I don't mind your bitter comments about Greeks or myself (man you have been very very mean, and your english is not that good!) it's clear that you have the wrong idea. Anyway, maybe you don't give a s*** about my apologies. I don't believe, though, that you are what your nickname denotes.</p>
<p>My grandmother was born in Sevdikoy, near Izmir. My grandfather was born in Aydin. As most of the Greek inhabitants of Asia Minor, they were not in favor of the Greek offensive. In fact, there were only a few Greeks in Asia Minor that participated in it. My grandparents told me stories about some atrocities that Greek soldiers commited against the Turks. However, in 1922, almost 1,500,000 refugees came to Greece from Asia Minor. They had many stories to tell about the way they were treated (as the Turks that left Crete or any other place in what is now Greek territory might have, I won't doubt that). They didn't give a s*** about propaganda and nobody can claim that they were all suffering from some kind of delusion. So that the Turkish atrocities, including the lynching of Metropolitan Chrysostomos, are nowadays common knowledge in Greece.</p>
<p>Please don't let yourself be carried away by stereotypes, nobody said that the Turkish troops that entered Izmir pulled out their machettes to cut the throat of every christian that was unlucky enough to get in their way. Just the "normal" things that happen in time of war when soldiers, tired of fighting and marching for miles and miles, enter the last stronghold of the enemy, to find people whose guts they hate, lying at their mercy.</p>
<p>My grandmother used to tell me that Greeks and Turks in Smyrni (allow me to spell the word just once) were getting along with each other. Her words never showed any hatred against the Turks. Moreover, you, as I, are not to blame for things that belong to the past.</p>
<p>I understand that in a page that was built by some Turks out of love of their city, words like "atrocity" and "lynching" do not fit, even if some crazy and stubborn Greek insists that truth (his own truth, if you will) and facts should prevail. I won't revert it anymore.</p>
<p>Farewell</p>

<p>P.S. Keep it cool.&#160;;-)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for speaking from the heart. As I said before, Greeks being forced to leave their homes in Asia Minor is of course tragic. The Greek-Turkish population exchange in 1920s is actually a tragedy <b>as a whole</b> and the problem is an issue of trust. After the Greek Army occupied Western Anatolia through Izmir (Smyrni), that was the beginning of the end for the Greek population of Asia Minor. I don't expect you to sympathize with the Turkish side but you should at least be able to understand and reason their actions. We can mention the Greek Metropolitan being lynched, we can also mention the Turkish villages burnt down by the occupying Greek forces, should we? As long as it is NPOV I don't mind, I am only afraid it will only make the section unnecessarily longer if we mention every single atrocity, after all it is an article about <b>the city</b>, not any particular event or events.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for Greeks. I don't have any problem with Greeks who don't have any problem with Turks but you have to admit that most of them have enormous bias towards Turks and Turkish history. To be honest, when I see these people editing Turkey related articles on Wikipedia, it really boils my blood. We have to write history, not his-story, that's how we ensure the mistakes of the past won't be repeated. There is no good in winning back battles on Wikipedia which Greeks lost on the field. There is no point in exaggerating facts or ignoring them wholly. There is no point in always trying to portray your side as the <b>just</b> and the <b>righteous</b>. There is no point in making your losses look like nothing like Miskin did in <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Manzikert_b26d.html" title="Battle of Manzikert">Battle of Manzikert</a>, write the truth even if it is a humiliating battle for your country, trust me, there is no good coming from distorting history.</dd>
