<p>I've been cleaning this article up, adding links, correcting madeup words such as "inexistent", and I recently added the NPOV tag after reading the 1st paragraph of "The Federacion and the labour movement in Greece". The "rivers of blood" and "socialist democratic propoganda" seem suspicious. I would encourage some major fact checking. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreestylefrappe_d689.html" title="User:Freestylefrappe">freestylefrappe</a> 22:07, May 22, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The page appear to contain a number of serious factual errors. I just finished reading Mark Mazower's "Salonica: City of Ghosts" , which talks about the period in question extensively, and devotes a couple of paragraphs to Benaroya specifically.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>"an even crueller blitzkrieg erupted in which Greece and Serbia took from Bulgaria most of her spoils". In fact, the second Balkan war was initiated by a Bulgarian attack on Serbia.</li>
<li>"violent ethnic cleansing of hundreds of thousands Jews, Christians and Muslims alike, in Macedonia, Thrace and Asia Minor". In Macedonia and Thrace none of the four sides involved (Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, Serbia) can be said to have engaged in ethnic cleansing. Salonica Jews especially were relatively safe during that period as Salonica was handed to Greece without a fight, and the Greek government followed a policy friendly to the Jews of the city. Mazower describes acts of disorderly conduct by some soldiers and newly-liberated Greeks wanting revenge against muslims, but they were soon brought under control (page 300).</li>
<li>"Chaos reigned in the New Provinces of Greece, where central authority was either unable or unwilling to protect the so-called "foreigners" from spoliation and persecution." While this was partially true in the countryside, in Salonica the picture was very different.</li>
<li>"The wily, Liberal Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, opted for conciliation with its Jews". Again, Mazower paints a very different picture. In the first election after 1912, the Jews of Salonica almost universally voted against Venizelos' liberal party. Venizelos lost, and the conservative governmnent that was elected had excellent relations with the Jews. When the Liberals got back in power, they sought to reduce the power of the jewish voting block by establishing an restrictive voting policy. From 1922 until 1944, the Liberals and the Jews rarely saw eye-to-eye, and jews consistently voted anti-liberal (to the right, or to the left).</li>
<li>The rest of the article is esoteric at times. The struggle between republicans and socialists from 1922 to 1949 is a highly debated topic, and probably the best policy for this article would be to link to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Modern_Greece_0fbe.html" title="History of Modern Greece">History of Modern Greece</a>, the <a href="../../../k/k/e/KKE_d237.html" title="KKE">KKE</a> and the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_Civil_War_e2ef.html" title="Greek Civil War">Greek Civil War</a>.</li>
<li>the epilogue seems highly POV, esp. the paragraph that begins "Strolling around Salonica". Considering the street-renaming frenzy in Greece between 1981-1987, i'd like to see a list of streets named for dictators in contemporary Salonica. At the same time, there aren't any streets named for any communist leaders; that Benaroya does not have a street named after himself can hardly be seen as a sign of anti-semitism.<a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysin_4c8f.html" title="User:Sysin">Sysin</a> 18:01, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>I'm trying to fix these errors and so I think I've dealt with 1,3,5 and 6. I got rid of 2/3 of the epilogue as it was pointless, rambling and far from neutral. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreestylefrappe_d689.html" title="User:Freestylefrappe">freestylefrappe</a> 04:53, Jun 19, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Fact checking is always welcome, ideological bias checking equally so. However it is as folly to search for words that are not 'made up', as it is megalomaniac, to say the least, to claim objectivity in history. Without claiming to be objective, and while it does not focus exclusively on the person of Benaroya but tries also to present the context, the article is based on thorough archival research and comprehensive knowledge of the relevant scholarly bibliography. Does it contain factual errors? This remains to be seen. But none of the six points raised by Sysin can be characterized as such. Kekszakallu</p>

<p>from the Wikipedia NPOV tutorial Often an author presents one POV because it's the only one that he or she knows well. The remedy is to add to the article—not to subtract from it. Kekszakallu</p>

<p>Things not to avoid</p>
<p>Some Wikipedians, in the name of neutrality, try to avoid making any statements that other people find offensive or objectionable, even if objectively true. This is not the intent of striving for neutrality. Many groups would prefer that certain facts be stated euphemistically, or only in their own terminology, or suppressed outright; such desires need not be deferred to. On the other hand, these terms should be presented, explained and examples given, perhaps with views of other groups of why the term is used as well as the group itself.</p>

<p>i have restored the original version of the article, enriched by the links added to it by various contributors. may i be permitted to note, as regards the recent adventures of poor Benaroya, that: 1. The habit of imposing censorship on an article without declaring the reasons, or giving any explanation whatsoever, brings to mind bad old times. Namely, Nazism. 2. Encouraging 'major fact checking' and not doing it for four months, and yet insisting on arbitrary censorship, testifies to authoritarian tendencies compounded by a certain lack of seriousness 3. Talking about undefined suspicions and neglecting to explain them shows intellectual sloppiness, and also an undemocratic mentality. 4. In any case, i cannot comprehend the objections to phrases such as "rivers of blood" and "socialist democratic propoganda". As regards the first, does anybody think that the bloodletting in the Balkan Wars did not qualify for that expression? Should one prefer terms such as 'collateral damage' instead? I am sickened by people who glorify war and wish to hide its less savoury aspects - they are worse than the ones who do the actual bloodletting. So, do we have here not only antidemocratic obscurantism, but also militarism and chauvinist nationalism? A nice mix indeed! 5. As a professional historian of the period, i can only ascertain that the six points raised by Sysin betray wholesale ignorance of the recent Balkan history and almost certainly of the greek language, and are themselves irrelevant and in thrall to nationalistic interpretations of history (1), or factually incorrect (2, 3, 4, 5, 6). 6. Given their ignorance of a subject, it is entirely logical that people may condemn its presentation as 'esoteric'. This speaks volumes about themselves, not about what they read. Of course, any interest on Benaroya today cannot but be highly esoteric, what else? But if people do not care about his life and ideas and struggles, why do they so fervently wish to spread their ignorance to others? 7. I see that the article on Benaroya tends to be deleted by people without any obvious or declared interest in the period or in the issues covered by it. I can only speculate on their reasons. Imposing censorship on a project based on openness, like Wikipedia, brings to my mind Hitler's use of the democratic process to destroy the German democracy, such as it was. Continue your good work, guys! Bravo! Go on for the Iron Cross!</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia, 'Vandalism is any addition, deletion, or change to content made in a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of the encyclopedia. The most common type of vandalism is the replacement of existing text with obscenities, namecalling, or other wholly irrelevant content.'</p>
<p>In this sense, i do not see how restoring the original text can have been accused of vandalism. Rather the opposite is the case.</p>

<dd>Thank you for turning this into a personal attack against my person, and my knowledge of the Greek language (μήπως τα δικά σου ελληνικά είναι καλύτερα; το αμφιβάλλω). I was quite surprised, esp. since I've never made a comment about you or your edits.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I came across this article while reading Mazower's book (he had a few pages on A.B. and I was looking for some additional information). I found some major contradictions between Mazower's book and the article. I also found some paragraphs to be of an editorial nature and (in my opinion) POV.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I didn't start hacking the article to my POV. I didn't start comparing the previous editors to Hitler. I posted my opinion in the Talk page, pointing to Mazower's book as a support (very lazy of me, since it was still on my desk). Freestylefrappe was kind enough to listen to my objections and make some changes to the article, but I never tried to force my opinion down his throat. Can you be a part to a constructive debate in this manner?</dd>

<p>1. There have been no 'personal attacks against persons' in my previous interventions in the current discussion. I do not know personally any of the participant persons, of course. And i have not the slightest idea about their person or character. But could not refrain from criticism of certain actions. Yes, i insist that the arbitrary censorship imposed on the article can plausibly be considered as showing antidemocratic obscurantism, militarist tendencies and chauvinistic nationalism. And such traits really bring to mind Hitler and his Nazis. No personal offence here. But political and ideological demystification.</p>
<p>2. As regards Sysin's command of the greek language, it now seems to be proficient but not perfect. As attests the solecistic phrase in greek used (το αμφιβάλλω). But i do not accuse anybody, believing as i do in everybody's democratic right to language, as a means of communication at least. Anyway, this knowledge might be put to good use… lots of relevant bibliography in greek await conscientious readers.</p>
<p>3. Sysin is certainly commendable for being the only contributor to the article, so far, who takes the pain to note down objections and sources, even without proposing any alternative view. And also for making the one valid criticism, that i do not wikify the original form of the article. As a newby, i unfortunately happen to lack the technical skills, at present. If he (or she) wanted to do something constructive, he (or she) might well wikify it, and add his or her POV at the points on which he or she disagrees. Instead of deleting them. For which work, of course, more familiarization with the facts would be welcome; a cursory reading of Mazower's fine book is but a good start. Among other sources, for a second start, could well be the recent History of Greece in the Twentieth Century, edited by Christos Hadjiiossif, of which four volumes have already been published.</p>

<p>One more demonstration of brute force by Freestylefrappe, without any consideration for argument whatsoever. Will it again be called a personal attack, to remind the affinities of this practice with trademark nazi style?</p>

<p>I will believe when i see solid argument. Which seems slow in coming.</p>
<p>Insinuation is far easier than argument. A rhetorical device, in fact, currently connected with neofascism a la Georg Haider. Which, fortunately, doesn't go far. And utterly out of place in civilized discussion.</p>
<p>By the way, your last entry exhibits some more characteristic traits of generic fascism: wild generalizations, ponderous assertions of collective responsibility, and a telling depreciation of university and intellectual activity in general.</p>
<p>But what better to expect from somebody who claims that has read Mazower's book and has not noted that there were not many jews left in Greece in 1944? Or imagines out of thin air that "The struggle between republicans and socialists from 1922 to 1949 is a highly debated topic"? Some slight terminological confusion here, my dear colonel.</p>

<dd>Actually the Jews in the Italian sector (Athens, etc) were not deported until April 1944, and the left/right stuggle is still the most debated topic in Greece today, perhaps half the ink consumed every year in the country is on that subject. <a href="../../../s/y/s/User%7ESysin_4c8f.html" title="User:Sysin">Sysin</a></dd>

<dd>We had an article here that was the product of a civilized debate. It wasn't perfect, but you could have helped improve it - by participating. You are new here - you said so yourself. Look around and learn. You don't need to study political science for four years to learn that barging in and calling everyone a nazi is not the best way to get your point across.

<p><br />
Sorry, but you are wrong. I did not call anyone a nazi. I just noted the affinities of certain actions and implicit ideological positions to the ideas and practices of nazism, which is a very different thing. And which affinity, i think, is a bad, very bad thing. That should not characterize our actions and ideas, and if it did characterize them should not be left without comment.</p>
<p>Of course, i am new here. But i learn. In other things, in which i am less new, i ask from others to learn before deleting other peoples' opinions. And looking around i found elsewhere in this site a nice proposal: When you disagree, the remedy is to add to the article—not to subtract from it. And another one: If another disagrees with your edit, provide good reasons why you think it's appropriate. And a third: Concede a point, when you have no argument against it. Declare when your disagreement is based on intuition or taste. Nowhere did i find advice of the type 'delete ad lib'.</p>
<p>All the best,</p>

<dd>So you didn't call us nazis, you just said that we behave as nazis? I feel much better.

<dd>Your redirects were my main concern. I have to say, blanking and rewriting from scratch would be a bad move, but editing out unrelated info is fine. You do not need to put the "|" between the page you want to link to and the reference that shows up. The word to the left of | is where it links to, to the right of | is what you see. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreestylefrappe_d689.html" title="User:Freestylefrappe">freestylefrappe</a> 21:27, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>My redirects all ended up where they were supposed to; I do think it was rather petty of you to revert <i>some</i> of what I had changed and retain other parts. I could see nothing consistent in your edits: you reverted but/becoming to but/but, retained Slavo-Macedonian (as opposed to your anachronistic Republic of Macedonia), and but reverted to the hyphen and the word Jewish. I think the content of articles is far more important than where the "|" goes.--<a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamac_3b4a.html" title="User:Damac">Damac</a> 21:49, 17 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In AB's time there was no concept of "Slav-Macedonians" as a group separate from "Bulgarians". This explains why BA, who tried so hard to include everyone, only published his paper in Bulgarian, and not in the (then non-existent) Slav-Macedonian language.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Of course, you're right. I'm glad there's someone else out there concerned about these attempts to rewrite history. --<a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamac_3b4a.html" title="User:Damac">Damac</a> 20:46, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I agree. But to use the term Slavo-Macedonians, as Freestylefrappe did is only to offend ethnic Macedonians, as someone says that Freestylefrappe is Shiptar, which is not uncorrect as far as I know, but it would be offencive for him. So I propose to use the neutral term "Macedonian Slavs" here. Freestylefrappe, stop using the Wikipedia to satisfy your nationalist frustrations.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is still problematic as these people - Slavo-Macedonians/Macedonian Slavs - saw themselves as Bulgarians at the time. This is reflected in one of the languages of Benaroya's newspapers, which was published in Bulgarian, and not the language now referred to as Macedonian.</dd>
<dd>What is also interesting is that when this ethnic group was expelled from the city, they were sent to Bulgaria.--<a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamac_3b4a.html" title="User:Damac">Damac</a> 08:45, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This entire article is comprised of 95% unsourced assertions at variance with basic general texts on the history of Greece, in facts large and small.</p>
<p>The basics of Benaroya's life belong, and his views, quoted FROM him, but this is not what this text comprises. It is a polemic.</p>
<p>It makes wild and absurd genalizations and my guess is lifted verbatim for a highly pov screed.</p>

<p>I have added a section detailing Benaroya's efforts to assist his community and his awareness of his Judaism. This should be evident from the books he wrote, the commitees he founded and his final decision to emigrate to Israel.
