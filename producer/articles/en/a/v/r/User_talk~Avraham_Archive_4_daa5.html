<h2><span class="mw-headline">Barbara Bauer</span></h2>
<p>Hi. I read the info at the link you posted with the latest Barbara Bauer edit, and find it difficult to see that it quite applies here. At the time the sentence about the Google search result was written, it was easily verified by doing a Google search - in fact, the SWFA list was briefly #1 on some of the Google servers. This was reported in several comments on the <i>Making Light</i> site around May 27th <a href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/007577.html#127538" class="external autonumber" title="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/007577.html#127538" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Making Light was pretty much ground zero for the controversy at the time, and the thread made numerous mentions of the Googlebombing in progress, both explicitly and implicitly. Is it truly the case that these comments are inadmissible, and that Google itself was inadmissible at the time, in a factual claim about the Google search itself? The fact of the Googlebombing is not particularly in dispute; cf. several reverted article edits by (presumably, from context) Bauer herself<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barbara_Bauer&amp;oldid=60283537" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barbara_Bauer&amp;oldid=60283537" rel="nofollow">[2]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barbara_Bauer&amp;diff=63350617&amp;oldid=63335657" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barbara_Bauer&amp;diff=63350617&amp;oldid=63335657" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. (The username Cannoliq matches Bauer's posted email address, the claims in the historical edits seem to match things said by Bauer elsewhere, and the anonymous IP edit is similar in some respects to the Cannoliq ones.) As of today, the SFWA list is the #3 result, which has been the case for several weeks at least in my personal experience. Right or wrong, the concerted effort of large numbers of people to link Bauer to the list in search results is a legitimate part of her notability, I think, as it speaks to the degree of rancor Bauer incurred, deserved or otherwise.</p>
<p>Perhaps I'm off base here, but it seems that the bar on some of the sourcing for this article is set impossibly high, beyond the reach of facts or common sense. See, for example, Jules' reply to your point about the Usenet dating. Can I perhaps persuade you to research this a bit further and offer guidance on acceptable sourcing for the specific circumstances? Several people have done extensive research on what was said where and when, but I'm a little unclear (as are others, most likely) on which if any such citations will pass muster, and why or why not. It also seems that pretty much everyone involved is heartily sick of edit wars and incivility, and consequently hesitate to do anything likely to unleash another round of unpleasantness.

<dd>Thanks for the great edit! It's much cleaner than mine. The more detailed reference format kind of confuses me, so I'm grateful that you took the time to make it all consistent, and work out the best way to present the relevant citations. <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMavarin_fb6d.html" title="User:Mavarin">Karen</a> 03:59, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hello again. Sorry to bother you, but things are getting out of hand again over on the Talk:Barbara Bauer page, especially at the Verifiability and Blog citing guidelines sections. In the former, <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarky48_ac6f.html" title="User:Marky48">Marky48</a> is attacking the edit on the basis of a) reading in things that aren't there, and b) drawing the conclusion that if there's no citation of the links list or the PublishAmerica connection, the whole paragraph is invalid and an attack. (These happen to be two links that you removed as unnecessary, but I haven't told Mark that.) In the other section, he's essentially calling one editor a liar, and accusing another of "bullying insulting trollery." Sometimes a kind but corrective word from an admin gets Mark to calm down and ease off on the attacks for a while. Is there any chance you could stop by and give it a try? Thanks! <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMavarin_fb6d.html" title="User:Mavarin">Karen</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/v/User_talk%7EMavarin_8ade.html" title="User talk:Mavarin">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mavarin_e910.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mavarin">contribs</a> 05:14, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, that's an interesting response. I do like your most recent edit. The only thing I would mention in that connection is that the only evidence that Barbara Bauer has ever placed any books for clients is a) the front page of her web site, which generally provides no details, and b) claims made in several unsourced edits to the article (some anonymous, some not) as a glowing endorsement of Bauer and/or attack on others. That's why the text said "mostly self-reported," because there was nothing to cite in her favor. However, it's probably better to give her the benefit of the doubt wherever possible, even if it means taking her word for it on things that don't attack someone else. <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMavarin_fb6d.html" title="User:Mavarin">Karen</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/v/User_talk%7EMavarin_8ade.html" title="User talk:Mavarin">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mavarin_e910.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mavarin">contribs</a> 06:08, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"generally prior to their involvement with Bauer." I probably should had said, "at least some of them." This was in replacement of Mark's version, "Several authors have had their previous books issued by self-publishing houses and <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanity_press.html" title="Vanity press">vanity</a> publishers...." What we know for sure is that Field Rue published with both PublishAmerica and AuthorHouse before signing with BB. Quoting from someone on the Talk page: "I did some poking around on this author's web site and found that his PublishAmerica book was released in August of 2004 <a href="http://www.fieldruwe.com/falluvial.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fieldruwe.com/falluvial.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. His <a href="http://www.fieldruwe.com/fagent.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.fieldruwe.com/fagent.htm" rel="nofollow">agent page</a> states that Bauer has been his representative since July of 2005. There are two other books listed on the author's <a href="http://www.fieldruwe.com/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.fieldruwe.com/index.htm" rel="nofollow">home page</a>, but no release date or publisher has been provided. I found the author and work also represented <a href="http://homepages.which.net/~j.fish/rowsela.htm" class="external text" title="http://homepages.which.net/~j.fish/rowsela.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It's a division of a Welsh publisher, but doesn't mention whether they are publishing that particular book." The significance is that if such people self-published after signing with Bauer, then they paid an agent as well as the publisher, and Bauer did nothing they could not do for themselves. Saying they self-published before finding Bauer actually makes her seem less predatory. However, one example is not the same as going over the entire client list again to see whether the word "generally" is justified. No reference to her involvement or non-involvement with these titles is perfectly fine with me. The rest of my edit was to clarify that she may have placed books with major publishers in the 1980s and possibly 1990s (giving her the benefit of the doubt on several books and authors she's mentioned), and it's largely her recent track record that is at issue. I think Mark's concern is that she not be shown as leading people to PublishAmerica, which would be a rather large strike against her in the eyes of those who consider PA to be predatory. <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMavarin_fb6d.html" title="User:Mavarin">Karen</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/v/User_talk%7EMavarin_8ade.html" title="User talk:Mavarin">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mavarin_e910.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mavarin">contribs</a> 03:46, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Apartheid</span></h2>
<p>In the ArbComm case on the article, Arbitrator Fred Bauder has cited an earlier edit which added the article to the cat <a href="../../../a/n/t/Category%7EAnti-Semitism_9b00.html" title="Category:Anti-Semitism">Category:Anti-Semitism</a> as an example of "extreme bias". That is why I removed the Islam and anti-Semitism cat and similar links, they seem to be an attempt to make a POV comment on the phrase.Homey 21:34, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>While your edits can be viewed as biased, categories are a special item. For example Golan heights can legitimately be included in both the geography of Syria and Israel. Inclusion in a category does not signify a fact, only that information regarding a matter may be found there. Certainly there is information extant which paints discussion of Israeli apartheid as anti-Semitism.

<p>When you read explainations of jewish and islamic circ practices ... there's room for debate. Regardless, "requirement" is too strong for the majority, who don't even go to worship.

<p>I hope this won't be seen as a cheeky request, but I wonder if you would consider withdrawing the AfD against the Prometheus Society? I realise that the article is even more of a stub than the others, but being a stub is surely a reason for encouraging people to add to it, not to delete it? Just a thought.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">FYI Mega Society Judgement</span></h2>
<p>As you may have heard the Mega Society article was deleted awhile ago, at the end of an acrimonious AfD/DRV process. There is a wide divergence between deletion <i>policy</i> (as defined by various policy guideline documents) and deletion <i>practice</i>, as implemented by admins (who claim to be following the "spirit" of the law). Consequently there are lessons to be learnt from the experience, which will not be obvious from reading the guidelines. Here are some tips for future conduct:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single purpose users are frowned upon and were a frequent bone of contention during the AfD and DRV processes. So I urge you all to "establish" yourself as Wikipedians: create, edit and even ... delete articles! There are plenty of articles that need attention.</li>
<li>It is a <i>very</i> good idea to put something on your user page, (it doesn't matter what) to avoid showing up as redlinked users -- being redlinked will count against you in any debate.</li>
<li>When voting, include <i>brief</i> reasons which are grounded in policy (votes not backed by reasoning may be discounted; too much reasoning will be ignored).</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the bias against soliciting (see judgement) I may not be able to contact you again, so I suggest you put the Mega Society in your watchlists.</p>
<p>The closing admin's comments on the Mega Society:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Within the argumentation of the debate, the most significant point raised by those who supported the article was that a new draft was available. The article is not protected, so this may be posted at any time and (assuming it is not substantially similiar to the older version) it will be judged anew on its merits. This is good news for you.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The bad news for you is that it is well-established practice within Wikipedia to ignore completely floods of newer, obviously "single-issue POV", contributors at all our deletion fora. I'm among the most "process-wonkish" of Wikipedians, believe me, and even process-wonks accept that these sorts of voters are completely discountable. Wikipedia is not a pure democracy; though consensus matters, the opinion of newcomers unfamiliar with policy is given very little weight. Your vote, that of Tim Shell, and that wjhonson were not discounted. The others supporting your view were. I promise you that it is almost always true that, within Wikipedia, any argument supported by a flood of new users will lose, no matter how many of the new users make their voices known. In the digital age, where sockpuppeting and meatpuppeting are as easy as posting to any message board, this is as it should be for the sake of encyclopedic integrity. It is a firm practice within Wikipedia, and it is what every policy and guideline mean to imply, however vaguely they may be worded. (I do agree that our policies, written by laypeople mostly, could do with a once-over from an attorney such as myself; however, most laypeople hate lawyers, so efforts to tighten wording are typically met with dissent.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If your supporters were more familiar with Wikipedia, they would realize that, invariably, the most effective way to establish an article after it has been deleted in a close AfD is to rewrite it: make it "<s>faster</s>, better, stronger." This is, in fact, what you claim to have done with your draft. Good show. Best wishes, <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 16:22, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>So the outcome was not entirely negative, although I was disappointed by the admin's rather cavalier approach evidenced by the response to my enquiry:</p>
<dl>
<dd>.... why did you discount the votes of, say, <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregorB_c220.html" title="User:GregorB">User:GregorB</a> or <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanon_c331.html" title="User:Canon">User:Canon</a>? They are not new users, nor did I solicit them. I presume by Tim Shell you mean Tim Smith? ...... --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelCPrice_72e7.html" title="User:MichaelCPrice">Michael C. Price</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaelCPrice_99ab.html" title="User talk:MichaelCPrice">talk</a></sup> 16:49, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>to which I received this rather off-hand reply:</p>
<dl>
<dd>User:GregorB offered a very brief comment not supported by policy. User:Canon did take the time to offer analysis at DRV, but he had been among the first voters at the AfD to offer a mere "Keep" without explanation; therefore, I assumed he had been solicited by someone. Best wishes, <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 15:50, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>which didn't fill me with confidence about Wiki-"due process".</p>
<p>Anyway, my grumpiness aside, the Mega Society article, is presently under userfied open-development at <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelCPrice_mega_48b7.html" title="User:MichaelCPrice/mega">User:MichaelCPrice/mega</a>, and will reappear at some point, when (hopefully) some of the ill-feeling evidenced during the debate has cooled.

<dd>Removing sourced material and over all disrupting NPOV editing is vandalism. By editing in your POV on just about every article related to Israel you disregard and attack everyone who disagrees with you. Calling people anti-semetic or anti-Israeli IS a personal attack. Posting bogus warnings on peoples user page as you did mine is also a personal attack. BTW I'm Jewish and find being called a ant-semite highly offensive. I believe in a two state system and you are a Zionist. There is no need to attack me. Though I disagree with your viewpoint, I value when you make contructive edits to topics, not POV BS.--<a href="../../../o/i/b/User%7EOiboy77_4787.html" title="User:Oiboy77">Oiboy77</a> 20:14, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Removing my edits and using your POV on wikipedia article</span></h2>
<p>Hey, what the hell are you doing? I'm editing the article, and I am adding the sources gradually. Why do you remove all of my edits? And the article itself is full of your edits, and as you're a Jew, it's full of your POV. Stop removing my edits. Although you're an administrator, you can not use your own view here. Hossein.ir 19:26, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>A few points. Firstly, the fact that I am Jewish has absolutely no bearing on the topic, any more than the fact that I am a male, or that I am an American. You are skirting painfully close to a <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attack</a>. I would suggest you read <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, as opposed to making comments that are likely based on a lack of understanding of the policy. Also, you removed and rewrote the section on Hezbollah using human shields. ALl I did was replace it with <b>seven</b> sources, more than enough to justify it. Throwing in the US military support for Israel has as much to do with the article as does the US military support for Egypt. Also, the heading for the human shields section is perfectly descriptive, and is used against Israel in the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights_in_Israel_6f67.html" title="Human rights in Israel">Human rights in Israel</a> article among others. If it is good enough for the Israelis, it is good enough for Hezbollah. Step back, and try to ensure that both POV's are accurately represented with proper sources.</dd>

<dd>Germans? That's funny. And to many, it's obvous. US is the greatest military supporter of Israel, and most of its attackes are done by the F16s US gave them. Btw, who's Mozart?&#160;:-) I prefer Betthoven. And about being a jewish, I don't think it's bad or good or whatever, but I thought it's the reason you're editing the article, and I thought this caused to edit the article with your POV. Right? this is my thought, and it's not an attack. At least you should tolerate the label of <i>This is a US people idea</i> thing, until I find some good sourcesm by googling, just like you.</dd>

It is essential that doctors perform male circumcision only where this is demonstrably in the best interests of the child. The responsibility to demonstrate that non-therapeutic circumcision is in a particular child’s best interests falls to his parents."</p>
<p>(TipPt .. forgot to logon)</p>
<p>This quote should be included in the upper section. "The British Association of Paediatric Surgeons advises that there is rarely a clinical indication for circumcision."</p>
<p>The whole statement is a "synopsis of the principles the BMA." I feel like most people don't make the distinction between religious and "hygiene" reasons when they read "Non-therapeutic circumcision" The mentioning of divergent doctor opinions (when it is non-therapeutic anyway) misleads the reader. Individual doctors opinions are not relevant to the association level principles.</p>
<p>Can I take out the first sentence?<a href="../../../t/i/p/User%7ETipPt_1698.html" title="User:TipPt">TipPt</a> 01:56, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're right, I shouldn't have added that last sentence to the first statement paragraph ... the meaning is conveyed earlier. I'm sorry.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You seem quote pro-circ for religous reasons, which I respect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You label me anti-circ, and yes I am against parents in the US having their boys circ'd without accurate knowledge ... but with strong bias assuming that there are medical reasons. The practice serves no (see cost/benefit) medical purpose, and can do great harm. I do get carried away, but I'm honest.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For example, if the frenulum is excised, damaged, or reduced (as is common in neonatal circs in US hospitals) erogenous sensation potential is lost. Parents don't have a clue. Know that the frenulum is the primary orgasm/ejaculatory trigger zone. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=7811177&amp;dopt=Abstract" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=7811177&amp;dopt=Abstract" rel="nofollow">[15]</a><a href="http://www.uhmc.sunysb.edu/urology/male_infertility/SCI.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.uhmc.sunysb.edu/urology/male_infertility/SCI.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Do parents know that when they look at their child's circumcision where the scar is within 1/4 inch of the corona?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Circ article is biased pro-circ at this time, and misleads the reader. For example, your mischaracterization of the AMA and BMA statement in the third opening paragraph. You should also object to the listing and detailing of medical aspects TWICE, as though they were particularly important to parental decision making. It becomes a problem when they (parents) want to hear what they expect to hear.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Note that the BMA labels non-therapeutic the same as ritual ... "any reason other than physical clinical need is termed non-therapeutic (or sometimes “ritual”) circumcision."<a href="../../../t/i/p/User%7ETipPt_1698.html" title="User:TipPt">TipPt</a> 15:12, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Citation problem</span></h2>
<p>Hi Avraham, I noticed you're reverting changes to a number of refs in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Israel-Lebanon_conflict_7601.html" title="2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict">2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict</a>, claiming that the refs are being "killed". However, when checking the refs, I found they work fine after having been changed. Part of the problem is that a few users have recently started an almost full version of <a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_web_57d4.html" title="Template:Cite web">Template:Cite web</a> in this and related articles, instead of the condensed version of <a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_news_5e9e.html" title="Template:Cite news">Template:Cite news</a> that has become the established template in these articles. In addition, these users insert the template in a line-by-line fashion instead of the recommended "stream" solution: {{cite web|url= |title= |accessdate= |accessmonthday= |accessyear= |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate=}}, usually which means that the page becomes very cumbersome to work with in edit mode (especially when people add 5-6 references after each other), as every section becomes a mile long.</p>
<p>Using the line-by-line mode is fine in other types of articles, where the number of references are limited, but in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Israel-Lebanon_conflict_7601.html" title="2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict">2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict</a> we already have some 140, when including those pointing to the same reference, and if all those would consist of eight lines instead of one, the article becomes 980 lines longer in edit mode!</p>
<p>The modified Template:Cite news looks as follows: {{cite news | url = | title = | publisher = | date = }}, however, the order of the items is usually thrown around {{cite news | title = | date = | publisher = | url = }}, as that is how the template finally displays it in the reference section irrespective of the order of the items. It is the ideal template for a developing story article which quotes newspapers, as there is no need to insert the name of the writer, coauthors and the date the news article was accessed.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with reference losses in these articles is the stupid practice by some to use the pointer form of the &lt;ref name= XX /&gt; command, i.e. you point to an existing reference simply by inserting <sup id="_ref-XX_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-XX" title="">[1]</a></sup>, as that will only work as long as the reference starting with &lt;ref name= /&gt; exists, and in an environment where references quickly become obsolete and there are hundreds of people editing and re-editing, such pointers will quickly have nothing to point to. Using the &lt;ref name= &gt; is a good thought, as several references will point to one line, but in this environment even using the &lt;ref name= &gt; command is risky unless the name chosen is very unique, as two users may very well start two different references with for instance &lt;ref name=BBC&gt;, in which case the system will only display the first and point the second reference to it.

<dd>Hello all. I saw the RFC and wandered to see what all the hullabaloo was about. May I suggest including the (admittedly bizarre) Times reference but following it up with a statement to the effect of "However, the Jerusalem Post has questioned the credibility of the Times' coverage of Israeli issues" or something like that. Additionally, if any others have questioned the credibility of this report then those sources should also be included. I think that TheronJ is right that WP:V demands we include the Times' article. I would further suggest that this issue be revisited in the not-too-distant future (a month or two) and if no other sources have reported anything about this it be deleted to prevent from giving undue weight to what would then appear to be a very minor issue. --ElKevbo 03:33, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
