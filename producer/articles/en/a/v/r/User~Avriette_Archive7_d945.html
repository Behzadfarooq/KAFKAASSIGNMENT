<dd>Note that he's using a script to notify you, so he wouldn't see the notice. Also, you are <i>not</i> being careful enough. GFDL by itself is meaningless; if it's your image, you have to tag it with GFDL-self, or state the website, or whatever. It would be even better to say that you took the image, so us copyright fanatics can tag it with GFDL-self. Also, more descriptive image titles would be more helpful - i.e. <a href="../../../1/9/8/Image%7E198488096_7903b9466a_o.jpg.html" title="Image:198488096 7903b9466a o.jpg">Image:198488096 7903b9466a o.jpg</a> could be renamed Image:Turbine_outlet.jpg. Third, you can't expect us to peruse contributions - there are thousands of uploads to examine, and the images are heavily backlogged. The image description page should stand for itself, not your work.Hbdragon88 02:52, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, there are <i>thousands</i> of images to upload. By your logic, I simply don't have <i>time</i> to be using the correct license when uploading. Perhaps you should think about this "nag script" a little. If we shouldn't be using {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL_bb04.html" title="Template:GFDL">GFDL</a>}}, then <i>delete the damn template</i>, or at least deprecate it. Maybe I'll spend a day or two going through and re-tagging a couple hundred images, just to appease the drones. <b>...&#160;</b><span style="background-color: #11cbc4;width:52px;height:16px;font-size:12px;p{text-align:center}"><a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvriette_f119.html" title="User:Avriette">aa</a>:<a href="../../../a/v/r/User_talk%7EAvriette_2538.html" title="User talk:Avriette">talk</a></span> 13:05, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>GFDL is still perfectly usable - just that a source description needs to be added. It's like any other fair use template. Hbdragon88 22:25, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>By the way, yes you do have to put the correct licensing. The onus is on the uploader to supply licensing and source information. Just because "they don't do it" doesn't excuse you from not doing it. Hbdragon88 17:53, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It <i>isn't</i> a fair use template. It is <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a> because I uploaded it and tagged it as such. I took the picture, I licensed it, I uploaded it. I'll be going through and changing all the images I took to {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}}, but I think it's ridiculous that I have to do that. If you don't want people using GFDL, tell them NOT TO. Don't threaten to delete them. It's asinine. <b>...&#160;</b><span style="background-color: #11cbc4;width:52px;height:16px;font-size:12px;p{text-align:center}"><a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvriette_f119.html" title="User:Avriette">aa</a>:<a href="../../../a/v/r/User_talk%7EAvriette_2538.html" title="User talk:Avriette">talk</a></span> 23:17, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Eh. Not very easy to negitoate images, here. If you had written "This is my photograph" or something, I'm sure that Nv8200p would have taken your word for it and tagged it with {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}}. But you didn't, and thus the assumpetion is that it was ripped from a personal site or something, and the copyright status cannot be verified. Only tags that are self-referential, like PD-USGov or PD-self or GFDL-self, can survive without any kind of source description; GFDL <i>by itself</i> <i><b>needs a source description</b></i>.</p>
<p>You think that it's disruptive to ask for source descriptions, copyright tags. On the contrary. Most of my experiences is that they don't even care; I've noticed that the numerous IFD notifications and "no source" warnings have disappeared from user talk pages a few days after I append them. In the realm of fair use, Jimmy Wales has voiced the opinion that it's better to have no image than a fair use one, and thusly pariahs like me are more aggressive on those types of images.</p>
<p>I do take caution when there's reason to be cautious, but, as in the case of this particular photo, I (like Nv8200p) saw no reason why to be cautious. GFDL is not {{<a href="../../../p/e/r/Template%7EPermission_8737.html" title="Template:Permission">Permission</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../n/o/_/Template%7ENo_rationale_e501.html" title="Template:No rationale">No rationale</a>}}; there is no set date. Even if GFDL-self appeared after the majority of your contributions, adding even just "I took this photograph myself" would have been more than enough to satisfy pariahs like me into retagging it with GFDL-self.

<p>I found your first post on my talk page insulting and condescending. It seemed to be for informational purposes and I didn't think you wanted a response.</p>
<p>I speedy deleted the mortar image you orphaned as a redundant image of the one you preferred and struck the listing at <a href="../../../i/f/d/WP%7EIFD_bb01.html" title="WP:IFD">WP:IFD</a>.</p>
<p>As a personal choice, I have decided to abide by and enforce, Wikipedia policies when I can; otherwise, I believe Wikipedia would collapse in chaos. Images with no source or no/incorrect copyright tag or orphan images, etc. can be deleted by policy. I would love to delete them on sight, but the rules say I have to post it here or there, notify the uploader and wait a certain number of days, blah, blah and so I do. Then someone else actually has to do the deletion.</p>
<p>As Wikipedia evolves, the rules change and unfortunately, there is no "grandfathering" in of what we have already done, so images have to be maintained to comply or we risk losing them.

<dd>If you're taking it upon yourself to uphold new rules regarding old images, it isn't <i>my</i> responsibility to keep track of them. Many members of the project simply move on.

<dd>When did he ever imply that it was your responsibility for everybody else' images? He simply informed you that your image is subject to deletion as they did not comply with the new rules. He can't read those members' minds about where they got the images or what license they are. Therefore, he's nominating them for deletion, tagging with them no source, etc. and <i>informing them of the pending deletion</i>. That's his responsibility - to inform thsoe who uploaded the image and request for clarification. Why are you giving him flack for doing that? Hbdragon88 18:07, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flak.html" title="Flak">flak</a>, spanky.

If is the wanton carelesslness of you people with your scripts doing this that pisses me off. Why don't you got and <i>take some pictures</i> and upload them, instead of pissing people like me off?

<dd>Oh for fuck's sake. Are you really being serious? First and foremost, have a look at some of the images at <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Asbury_Park_e0b7.html" title="Operation Asbury Park">Operation Asbury Park</a> (<a href="../../../2/2/n/Image%7E22nd_meu_marines_8_june_2004.jpg.html" title="Image:22nd meu marines 8 june 2004.jpg">1</a> <a href="../../../i/e/d/Image%7EIed_munitions.jpg_809f.html" title="Image:Ied munitions.jpg">2</a> <a href="../../../a/b/_/Image%7EAB_Cobra_22_meu_ab.jpg_4626.html" title="Image:AB Cobra 22 meu ab.jpg">3</a>(. I know those were taken by marines because I know the marines who took them. In fact, when they came back from their tour, I helped them take the images off the media, and burn a CD for them with all the pictures they'd taken on their tour. When it comes to pictures of the <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sea-based_X-band_Radar_0fe2.html" title="Sea-based X-band Radar">SBX</a>, I know they were taken by employees of the US <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missile_Defense_Agency_99a7.html" title="Missile Defense Agency">Missile Defense Agency</a> because anyone else close enough to the SBX to take that picture would be slag at the bottom of the ocean, camera included. As regards the '252, I pulled that directly from the USMC website. Since you're being so <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICK_0b34.html" title="WP:DICK">persistent</a> about this, I'll point you in the direction of the image in question, as well as a veritable cornucopia of images of USMC hardware. In the case of <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Restore_Hope_b08f.html" title="Operation Restore Hope">Operation Restore Hope</a>, I took the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Image%7EOperation_restore_hope_battleplan.png_413f.html" title="Image:Operation restore hope battleplan.png">battle plan</a> directly out of the OPLAN powerpoint deck. You may be military, but I am a defense contractor, come from a military family, and you could even call me a fanboy. I love me some hardware.

<p>Hi AA, thanks for the hint. I wasn't aware that there is an actual policy about using images in signatures. I see that very code-intensive as well as image-using signatures are controversial and understand the reasons but from what I understood in the end its up to the user? <a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplette_f9f1.html" title="User:Splette"><span style="font-weight: bold; color:#104E8B">Splette</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplette_1607.html" title="User talk:Splette"><font style="color:#104E8B">Talk</font></a></sup> (for you without the pic&#160;:)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think that's exactly right. That it <i>is</i> up to the user, but that it is "suggested" that users not use images. The reason for this is not exactly clear, other than it can mess up browsers for some people with sight disabilities, and be harder to render on a slower connection. Some people, for example, insist on viewing the wikipedia in a text-only browser. If you ask me, the whole thing is silly, and I rather like your signature. But somebody may complain at you later. Just fyi. As I said, I do like your signature and wish more people were as "smiley" in their interaction with others.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>You miss several important things. First, an oppose vote in a RfA (and a support vote too but less so) must be justified. Indeed, RfA is not only a vote and it is done as to avoid abuses, such as spaming Mustafa was doing (and for which he got blocked btw).</p>
<p>Second, it must not be proven to <i>me</i> that is true. However it must be proven to the bureaucrat(s) who close the RFA. Generally, they're clever enough to not take thiese sorts of "votes" into the account.</p>
<p>And third, I'm not the only one. If you look at the comments, people like Dmcdevit said exactly the same thing (see his reply to oppose #7 - "<i>Do you have any evidence at all for these personal attacks and wild accusations? Well, actually, you can't.</i>"). Consequently, asking for just a minimal amount of evidence when people are opposing based on ridiculous accusations and/or personal attacks is the rule on a RFA.</p>

<dd>And yet nobody is required to list good deeds when supporting. Can you cite something that says a dissenting vote must be justified with diffs? Why is "the user is disagreeable" or "there are people badgering dissenters" not sufficient? Regardless, you should let the matter rest, and cease calling people's votes "void," as you have no such authority. I consider it extremely bad form. <b>...&#160;</b><span style="background-color: #11cbc4;width:52px;height:16px;font-size:12px;p{text-align:center}"><a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvriette_f119.html" title="User:Avriette">aa</a>:<a href="../../../a/v/r/User_talk%7EAvriette_2538.html" title="User talk:Avriette">talk</a></span> 17:51, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>First, I stopped editing that RfA at least 24 hours ago, in case you didn't check the history; so if you call this "let the matter rest", I did. Second, your use of "dissenting" is flawed. What must be backed up with diffs are things like "this user is a POV-pusher" (at least one diff of such a POV-pushing would be a good thing) or "this user is a revert-warrior" (some history?) and things like that. Otherwise, people would be able to oppose based on a pure libel... -- <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrafikm_fr_a2d0.html" title="User:Grafikm fr"><font color="blue"><b>Grafikm</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrafikm_fr_126e.html" title="User talk:Grafikm fr"><b><font color="red">(AutoGRAF)</font></b></a></sup> 17:55, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi Alex, you recently participated in Alex9891's RfA, saying you were neutral with regards to what you call his 'editing philosophy'. Would you mind taking a minute to go back there and clarify what you meant?

<dd>Ah, crap, I left this on the wrong user's talk page. *whap* But thanks for your reply, nevertheless, it was very informative. Personally, I think all we need administrators for is vandal-fighting, deletions, protections, etc. Wikipedia administrators shouldn't be any different from administrators at other websites - they're just policing, that's all. Agreed, we need more editors working on articles, but you don't need administrators to do that. Alex9891 is a capable vandal fighter and I think he'd benefit from the tools.</dd>
<dd>I'm not trying to change your vote, obviously - just stating my opinion on these matters. I'd never support someone on an RfA who seemed to be looking like a reward for good article-space contributions - if they're good policemen, that's what we need.</dd>

<dd>Hi. That image of course isn't mine, it belongs to the US Air Force (although what they're doing with a Claymore, I have no idea). Anyways, it's probably a US Army or US Marines image, and even if it is an Air Force image, it's still copyright-free. I'm not sure how that applies internationally, but I think the wording is "is not copyrightable in the United States." You might consider looking at some of the Air Force's European commands (google for things like EUCOM, EUTRANSCOM and EUSOCOM etc). They may have a more Europe-friendly statement there.</dd>
<dd>At any rate, the answer is I don't think there's any problem with using it unless the USAF gets its knickers twisted about using their stuff in non-US countries (which it does from time to time... this is why they have bombs). <b>...&#160;</b><span style="background-color: #11cbc4;width:52px;height:16px;font-size:12px;p{text-align:center}"><a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvriette_f119.html" title="User:Avriette">aa</a>:<a href="../../../a/v/r/User_talk%7EAvriette_2538.html" title="User talk:Avriette">talk</a></span> 00:23, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello. I was wondering if your only objection to my bid was my use of the word "fighting". First, the term "vandal-fighting" is a fairly common one here.

<dd>What I was getting at is the futility of changing a word describing an action when the action remains the same. If I describe a gunshot wound to the head as an "impact on the cerebellum by a high velocity kinetic weapon" with the intent to not scare children due to the language otherwise used, the act itself is unchanged. Grey matter everywhere. As such, I said that you misunderstood what I said and why. I dislike the act, and the attitude associated with the act. Modifying the description of the act is precisely the attitude I dislike.

<p>Hi there; I feel that contacting you is reasonable, away from my RfA page, because it is quite clear that it will be no consensus and nothing is going to change that this time round. I think, to be fair, that your use of the word "interrogate" is too strong. Don't you&#160;? Two staightforward questions for purposes of clarification, and a couple of explanatory comments, do not in my book add up to interrogation. You will note that I have not argued or objected to any comments made except, perhaps, yours. Sorry about that.--<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony.bradbury_30fb.html" title="User:Anthony.bradbury">Anthony.bradbury</a> 01:08, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do feel the word is correct and merited. As you can see from the charming discussion immediately above this one, some users feel compelled to quiz users who do not condone their RFA. I don't feel that it is appropriate to ask users any more than a casual question in regards to their vote. If somebody does not leave an explanation for their vote, it is fair to ask them. However, if the person responds, and the response is not what the nominated wanted, I don't feel it is fair to continue to ask them for information. Nobody, for example, asks why people who support users with no qualification (to their answer, not to the user) why they have supported. And, I might add, it would be seen as wholly inappropriate if they were to.</dd>
<dd>I'm sorry we disagree on this, but I feel particularly strongly about it. I sometimes do not agree with the answers to questions provided for RFA questions, and I am subsequently hostilely interrogated by said users. It's a personal peeve of mine, and I find the whole process to be loathsome.

<dd>Outcome wasn't hostile last time; the manner of reaching that outcome was. You may be a self-proclaimed "hardass", but I'm not, so your previous conversational style wasn't my bag.

<dd>Aww, bummer. That's too bad. You know, as I said in the RFA, we don't always agree, but you're a principled and honest man, which is what we need 'round these parts. I'm sorry it didn't succeed. It's kind of a bummer that the community has this eidetic memory. Things (such as our argument over the Hawk) which people would have normally forgotten long ago can be dredged up and reinjure like an itchy wound. It leaves little room for people to grow. Seems somebody's always looking for a way to shoot people down, meaning one of two things (or perhaps both): 1) they are too new to have pissed anyone off (thus almost assuring they aren't fit for the mop) or 2) they are being dishonest or duplicitous in playing WP politics (thus also making them unfit for the mop). It's a sad commentary on our society when quality editors such as yourself are taken to task for being principled and affirmative. I wish I had something more positive to say or some advice, but I think it's a problem endemic to the community that seems like it won't be fixed.</dd>
<dd>That means the only consolation for people who go through this retroactive lynching process (you're not the first, and certainly not the last) is that The Mop is not really a promotion or a medal in spirit. The Mop is just that -- it gives you a responsibility to clean up after people. It's really only because people have started <i>treating</i> it like a medal that the bemedaled people are fiercely protective of their inner sanctum (otherwise we'd dilute the significance of their medal, wouldn't we?). And so, consolation would be, "do I really want to be 'promoted' into a group of people who would bicker so about things which are obviously past-tense and insignificant relative to the present-day reality?"</dd>
<dd>For me, the jury's still out on that one. Sorry to rant. I see no reason not to continue to support you. I bump into you fairly frequently on my watch list (we have a lot of common interests, I suppose), and I've never seen you do anything that would raise my ire as some of the other editors do. Good luck next time, hopefully people will grow out of this phase. <b>...&#160;</b><span style="background-color: #11cbc4;width:52px;height:16px;font-size:12px;p{text-align:center}"><a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvriette_f119.html" title="User:Avriette">aa</a>:<a href="../../../a/v/r/User_talk%7EAvriette_2538.html" title="User talk:Avriette">talk</a></span> 17:25, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been mostly out for the past few months, but I think I remember an arbcom decision that ED was to not have an article here. Xoloz might have the link to it since he's been active. I believe the points you brought up are the same points that were brought up during the 2? 3? 205324322?

<dd>I don't encourage it. I dislike the mindset of regarding conflict as a sort of badge of honour. And I manage to do cleanup work, RCP, NPP and a lot of other things without getting into disagreements with editors, or having my page touched up too much. My comment was simply a way of introducing a speck of positivity into my vote. I try to only vote oppose when I can see that the candidate is going to significantly harm the encyclopedia with the tools, or is otherwise obviously, laughably inappropriate for adminship. I see no reason to discourage a potentially good editor, and many RfA candidates settle down and do good work once they realise their fun and games isn't being appreciated. I feel Llama Man could be a good editor if he knuckled down, and I see no reason to discourage him with a strongly worded, incivil oppose comment.</dd>
<dd>I totally understand if you can't relate to the 'slay vandal, win vote' type of candidate - you're a different style of editor, and the type we need a lot more of. There are definitely some children playing laser tag with RCP, and this is the sort of editor who finds conflict rewarding. I don't like it. Hence the neutral.</dd>

<dd>Terse is not a problem. You may notice the link on my userpage to an "eliminating wordiness" article I read in college. I am glad that you explained your point of view here (and not just because you seem to understand my position). I seem to run into people who think the biggest problem Wikipedia faces is vandalism — a lot. From what you've said, it sounds like we mostly agree. However, I think what you said was a little misleading. That having been said, I can understand your not wanting to be negative in the discussion. I had a pretty ambivalent stance towards admins throughout my time here, up until about Jan of 06. You most likely remember the userbox and subsequent debacles (yes, plural). We've just had so many problems with these "rouge" admins that I really want to prevent more of it happening. It's my hope that people will start to apply who don't want to collect a posse and lynch people, but rather people who need the tools to do simple gruntwork, like moving or deleting pages (and I don't mean userboxes, I mean more {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-owner_e6e9.html" title="Template:Db-owner">db-owner</a>}} type stuff). Oh well. I suppose what I'm asking for is a sea change, and those don't happen quickly or frequently. Thanks again for being candid with me, and don't hesitate to do so in the future. I try to be understanding and polite (most of the time, we all have our breaking points). alex (<b>...&#160;</b><span style="background-color: #11cbc4;width:52px;height:16px;font-size:12px;p{text-align:center}"><a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvriette_f119.html" title="User:Avriette">aa</a>:<a href="../../../a/v/r/User_talk%7EAvriette_2538.html" title="User talk:Avriette">talk</a></span> 07:54, 3 December 2006 (UTC))

<p>Ah, I wondered if it would be difficult to read when I made it, I could read it ok so I kept it, however I hadn't thought of people who might be using darker screens or something, I will changed the font to make it easier to read. Per your second comment, I assume you are refering to the use of the images as votes in RfA's. Whenever somebody visits that page, the server must send a copy of the page to their computer, which isn't much info for just text, but images take up a <i>lot</i> more. A page of text may take up 15 <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilobyte.html" title="Kilobyte">KB</a> but an image the size of a webpage would be more of the order of 2 <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megabyte.html" title="Megabyte">MB</a>. The servers get a lot of traffic, especially with tasks such as edit counters (which require the server to go through every edit a user has made) and bots (which can work much faster than people requesting many pages in a short time). Images tie up the servers because they require a longer download time than just text, and when you add 4 images (<a href="../../../s/y/m/Image%7ESymbol_support_vote.svg_9978.html" title="Image:Symbol support vote.svg">support</a>, <a href="../../../s/y/m/Image%7ESymbol_oppose_vote.svg_9716.html" title="Image:Symbol oppose vote.svg">oppose</a> <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Symbol_comment_vote.svg" class="external text" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Symbol_comment_vote.svg" rel="nofollow">comment</a> and <a href="../../../s/y/m/Image%7ESymbol_neutral_vote.svg_bbc6.html" title="Image:Symbol neutral vote.svg">neutral</a>) to every RfA it will mean that more is downloaded for each page, rather than about 30 KB (the average size of an RfA) the RfA will now be 51KB (30KB of text + 1KB support + 2KB oppose + 3KB neutral + 15KB comment), almost double. Which may not seem like a lot, but it all adds up. The tool-server lag is currently 175 days and 15 hours because of things like edit counters (which is why they are blocked so often). I opposed the idea because I don't think it will actually <i>help</i> the process of RfA. Sure it would look better, but it's not neccessary and wikimedia servers aren't free (whereas the services they provide are) and it means more would be needed sooner bought purely with donations. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames086_6f65.html" title="User:James086">James086</a><sup><a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJames086_1a79.html" title="User talk:James086"><font color="orange">Talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_James086_7264.html" title="Special:Contributions/James086"><font color="green">Contribs</font></a></sup> 09:34, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The server will send each individual image once (I think you meant once instead of twice), each time the page is requested, which is why I came to the conclusion of 51KB instead of (30x100) about 3MB for a very successful RfA. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames086_6f65.html" title="User:James086">James086</a><sup><a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJames086_1a79.html" title="User talk:James086"><font color="orange">Talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_James086_7264.html" title="Special:Contributions/James086"><font color="green">Contribs</font></a></sup> 09:52, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I appreciate your questions on my RfA and I also appreciate commenting on my talk page as opposed to there. I can definitely understand what you're trying to say. No one likes to see admins running the show and deciding things on a whim. However, that's what the time period is for. There is supposed to be a discussion for 7 days on SFD, so you have during that time to voice your opinion. I would say that is plenty of time to voice your opinion. It's just like voting in the US. If you can't get to the polls on that one day, then you can't vote (well, with exceptions of absentee ballots, etc, but that's another story). Once the 7 day period is over, there's no more discussion. Although, we are attempting to tweak the wording so that it is clear that if the discussion is ongoing or if consensus isn't clear, we will leave the discussion open until consensus can be reached. I am fine with leaving discussions open if I feel that the extra time would benefit the discussion. On most counts, however, the consensus is pretty clear and it should be dealt with. I hope I was able to clarify my position a bit more, and feel free to continue to ask more questions if needed. Thanks for putting the time and effort to read and respond to my RfA.

<p>Thank you for your input on my RfA. I understand where you are coming from. Unfortunately, Wikipedia's greatest strength also happens to be its greatest weakness. While there are many people who are making great contributions to Wikipedia, there are also many people who wish to tear it down. It is unfortunate that this occurs and I really wish that I did not have to do all the vandalism reverts that I do. One of these days perhaps that will happen. We can only hope. -- <a href="../../../g/o/g/User%7EGogo_Dodo_6e56.html" title="User:Gogo Dodo">Gogo Dodo</a> 23:39, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'd just like to let you know that you've received comments to two oppose nominations, each in different RfA's, in case you hadn't seen them and would like to reply.

<dd>I rather resent your insisting I respond to this now. As you may have noticed from the RFA, it closes on the eighth.

<dd>Upon looking at the other one you gave me, I noticed that it ends on December 9th. I will not be pressured into answering questions about an RFA from somebody who is not the subject nor sponsor of said RFA.

<dd>Thanks for all the advice man, but lol, I'm a computer engineer, so I DO know how to use google.&#160;:) It was still nice of you to try and help by giving advice. I didn't look for the image myself, 'cause frankly it didn't cross my mind at the time. And I as a rule don't mess with articles whose topic I'm not very familiar with (except typos and such). -- <a href="../../../x/o/m/User%7EXompanthy_d73d.html" title="User:Xompanthy">xompanthy</a> 20:58, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, I completely agree with you, images are important. But like you said, copyright is the big problem. Or worse, images for the article are practically nonexistent. For instance, when I was writing the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supersampling.html" title="Supersampling">Supersampling</a> article, I couldn't find any that were appropriate AND had the right copyright. So I ended up making my own. And this leads us to my next point: computer graphics (and strangley, computing in general) articles are absurdly few and far between. I could not BELIEVE there wasn't one on SS already. And that's not something small. Also, check the <a href="../../../u/v/w/UVW_Map_1516.html" title="UVW Map">UVW Map</a> article. That's barely a stub. And these are topics that are CORE to CG. So in my spare time (and there's not much of that) I try to either expand related articles or create new ones.</dd>

<dd>But wikipedia has for instance articles for all those ships.&#160;:) I could be wrong, but I honestly can't see someone typing USS Takanis Bay into the search bar. Those people exist, of course.

<dd>Well... you're 100% right in all you said. What you said about wikipedia becoming a tabloid, I was just thinking about that a few days ago. And people not caring? That's just a sad fact. I see articles that are completely POV, yet no one wants to intervene. My best example is the article on <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikola_Tesla_c53c.html" title="Nikola Tesla">Nikola Tesla</a>. Now you have to understand the background here... Nikola Tesla's nationality is a hotly disputed topic between Croatians and Serbs. His father was Croatian, his mother was Serbian, and he was born in Croatia. One of his most famous quotes is "Ponosim se srpskom majkom i hrvatskom domovinom." (trns. I am proud of my serbian mother and my croatian homeland). During his entire life, he directly considered himself Croatian, and said so when asked about his nationality. No document exists in which he says he is Serbian, yet hundreds exist (his letter, interviews etc) in which he always says he is Croatian, making no mention of Serbia (except that quote). He is considered one of Croatia's greatest scientist. Children learn about him in elementary school.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yet, the article states he is a Serbo-American. The first time I saw this, I couldn't believe it. Personally, I think it should state he is Croatian (and that there's no doubt about it), but since I'm biased, and it is still a disputed fact, I changed the article to say "he's nationality is disputed amongst Croatians and Serbs". Of course, I cited a site that stated exactly that.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now, that cited fact got reverted very quickly. A dispute grew quickly on the talk page. And just as I was about to continue the debate, an older friend of mine I was visiting (longtime editor of wikipedia), told me "there's no point". That there were countless efforts by numerous editors before to change that article, that were A LOT better cited than my attempt, and they all failed. Why? There are about 50 serbian editors watching that page like hawks. It seems croatian wikipedians avoid the article like the plague. So I said "screw it", and went on my way.</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And let's not forget, I didn't say he WAS croatian, I just said it was DISPUTED, and no one can deny that's true, be there reason for the dispute or not.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Thats just one small example. I'm sure you know a lot more. And this is why people stopped caring about NPOV for instance. No one needs an exercise in futility. And so the downward spiral into POV, pointless drivel and nonsense continues. Most good editors just give up eventually... -- <a href="../../../x/o/m/User%7EXompanthy_d73d.html" title="User:Xompanthy">xompanthy</a> 15:19, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
