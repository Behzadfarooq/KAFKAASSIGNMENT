<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/v/r/Avram_Davidson_728e.html" title="Edit section: Fiction and articles">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fiction and articles</span></h2>
<p>Davidson wrote many stories for fiction magazines beginning in the 1950s, after publishing his first fiction in <i><a href="../../../c/o/m/Commentary_Magazine_bd6f.html" title="Commentary Magazine">Commentary</a></i> and other Jewish intellectual magazines.</p>
<p>He was active in science fiction fandom from his teens. His best-known works are his novels about Vergil Magus, the magician that medieval legend made out of the Roman poet <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgil.html" title="Virgil">Virgil</a>; the Peregrine novels, a comic view of <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> shortly after the fall of <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a>; the Jack Limekiller stories about a <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian.html" title="Canadian">Canadian</a> living in an imaginary <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South American</a> country modelled after <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belize.html" title="Belize">Belize</a> during the 1960s, and, perhaps most notable of all, the stories of Dr. Esterhazy, a sort of even-more-erudite <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sherlock_Holmes_4282.html" title="Sherlock Holmes">Sherlock Holmesian</a> figure living in the mythical Scythia-Pannonia-Transbalkania, the waning fourth-largest empire in Europe.</p>
<p>In "Joyleg, A Folly", written in collaboration with <a href="../../../w/a/r/Ward_Moore_3de5.html" title="Ward Moore">Ward Moore</a>, a veteran of the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Revolutionary_War_48ec.html" title="American Revolutionary War">American Revolutionary War</a> (and of the <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whiskey_Rebellion_8426.html" title="Whiskey Rebellion">Whiskey Rebellion</a>) is found alive and very well in the <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennessee.html" title="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> backwoods, having survived over the centuries by daily soaks in whisky of his own making to hilariously face the world of 1960s.</p>
<p>Davidson also wrote dozens of short stories that defy classification, and the <i>Adventures in Unhistory</i> essays, which delve into puzzles such as the identity of <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prester_John_7689.html" title="Prester John">Prester John</a> and suggest solutions to them. His earlier historical essays were scrupulously researched, even when published by magazines just as happy to offer fiction as fact.</p>
<p>Much of Davidson's work was characterised by a great deal of erudite embellishment and asides. Very little may actually <i>happen</i> in a Davidson story, but he enjoyed describing it in enormous detail. Davidson succeeded with this technique because of a good ear for the way that people talk, an encyclopedic store of obscure and fascinating knowledge, and an irresistibly comic view of the world that sees virtually everyone as eccentric.</p>
<p>Stylistically, his stories were often as playful as their plots, including many elements that beginning writers are told to avoid, such as page-long sentences with half a dozen colons and semi-colons, or an irrelevant digression in the opening pages of a story. That Davidson was able to get away with such elements is a tribute in equal measure to his chutzpah and his skill with words and narrative structure.</p>
<p>The idea in his story "Or All the Seas with Oysters" (1958), is reputed to have become part of an 'urban legend' in the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Children%27s_street_culture.html" title="Children's street culture">street culture</a> of some children; namely, that <a href="../../../b/i/c/Bicycles.html" title="Bicycles">bicycles</a> arise from a life cycle that involves paper clips as <a href="../../../p/u/p/Pupae.html" title="Pupae">pupae</a> and coat hangers as <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larvae.html" title="Larvae">larvae</a>.</p>

<p>Davidson served as a <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_Marine_Corps_d398.html" title="US Marine Corps">US Marine Corps</a> <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medic.html" title="Medic">medic</a> in the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific.html" title="Pacific">Pacific</a> during <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, and began his writing career as a <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talmud.html" title="Talmud">Talmudic</a> scholar around <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950.html" title="1950">1950</a>. This made his study of and conversion to <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenrikyo.html" title="Tenrikyo">Tenrikyo</a> in the 1970s rather surprising. Although he had a reputation for being quick to anger when anyone tampered with his work or misunderstood it, Davidson was also greatly in demand as a storyteller, and well-known among his friends for his extreme generosity.</p>
<p>Davidson was <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish.html" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> and a scholar of the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talmud.html" title="Talmud">Talmud</a>, but also had a great deal of respect for other religions, and in the 1970s became involved with <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenrikyo.html" title="Tenrikyo">Tenrikyo</a>. He was also a member of the <a href="../../../s/w/o/Swordsmen_and_Sorcerers%27_Guild_of_America_%28SAGA%29_849c.html" title="Swordsmen and Sorcerers' Guild of America (SAGA)">Swordsmen and Sorcerers' Guild of America (SAGA)</a>, a loose-knit group of <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heroic_fantasy.html" title="Heroic fantasy">Heroic Fantasy</a> authors founded in the 1960s, some of whose works were anthologized in <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lin_Carter_ae97.html" title="Lin Carter">Lin Carter's</a> <i><a href="../../../f/l/a/Flashing_Swords%21_d877.html" title="Flashing Swords!">Flashing Swords!</a></i> anthologies.</p>
<p>While editing <i>The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction</i> he lived in <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, later in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belize.html" title="Belize">Belize</a>. During 1971 and 1972, he lived in a small house in Sausalito, California, just outside San Francisco, where fans and friends were affectionately welcomed. In his later years, he lived in Washington state, including a brief stay in the Veterans' Home in Bremerton. He died in his tiny apartment in <a href="../../../b/r/e/Bremerton.html" title="Bremerton">Bremerton</a> on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_8.html" title="May 8">May 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>, aged 70.</p>
<p>He was survived by his son Ethan, and his ex-wife Grania Davis, who continues to edit and release his unpublished works.</p>
