<p>"Avril is only 21, but she must be extremely worldly because on Wikipedia there is a whole section on 'early life.'" — <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Daily_News_8d56.html" title="New York Daily News">New York Daily News</a></i>, Feb. 9, 2006</p>
<p><i>Press accounts frequently credit her, along with singers Vanessa Carlton and Michelle Branch, with bringing a new sense of earnestness and genuine creativity to an often vacuous and pre-fabricated teen pop music market. Whilst her marketing has been every bit as sophisticated as, for instance, Britney Spears and her counterparts, a profile in the Washington Post found her to be genuine and, if anything, something of a wide-eyed innocent, citing the fact that she was intending to purchase her first Ramones CD.</i> In another interview, she listed her current listening tastes as including Blink 182, Sum 41,</p>
<p>and System of a Down - more the tastes expected of a contemporary teenage music fan than an actual artist. <i>- Is this NPOV? -- <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a></i></p>
<p>I love her new CD because she talks about real issues like she wanted to do. I liked her other CD because it was quite the same. Well I don't think she is a poser like everyone else because me and her act the same and I am not a poser even if people say I am. So I believe her and if she wants to do this it is her own god damn business.</p>
<p>--69.241.173.169 00:41, 28 January 2006 (UTC) yeah i HATE her. i USED to like her but she just seems to talk out of her ASS. dumb poser!</p>
<p>has unique ability to rhyme boy with boy</p>
<p>Actually she's rhyming boy (with a "y") with boi (with an "i"), so it's really rather clever.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Punk or Not?</span></h2>
<pre>
<i>"I hate it when people say I'm not a true punk. I don't go around calling myself punk; I never have. That's what people need to know -- it's not me saying that, it's the media. I'm a rocker."</i>
</pre>
<p>- Avril Lavigne</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Actually I have don't much against her but one big thing, I do have against her is that she is constantlysaying she is a pop punker.</p>
<p>Let me be the first to inform you there is no such thing as a pop punker.</p>
<pre>
You may thing bands like Sum41 has said in an interview with spin that they are not punk rock. 
</pre>
<p>She wouldn't be a posuer, if she didn't claim she was a punk rocker. She definitly proved she wasn't when in interview she had said "Forget the old stuff, the clash and the Ramones, I'm the new punk rock" and thats why many claim she is a poseur.</p>
<p>Granted she's doing well for an artist and should be commend for breaking out of the typical tenny bobber.</p>
<p>She still a liar and she in it for the money, like everyone in the pop bussiness. --Starliteentity17</p>
<p>Where has Avril ever said that she is punk? That is just a label that the media has created for her. Until you can site a source with a quote, I know only the opposite to be true. On an ABC Family TV Special on her, she says, "I'm not a punk rocker" and "I don't walk around calling myself punk." She goes on to explain that she is "just a rock chick" and likes to "rock out." --<a href="../../../n/a/b/User%7ENabber00_edc9.html" title="User:Nabber00">Nabber00</a> 19:14, 5 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Myah. The record company put that label on her, and the media saw that it sold, so they said she was punk all the time too. They're not too interested in writing about when Avril denies she never said she was punk either. --Joakim</p>
<p>Well I think that this quote sums it all doen't it? "And if she takes all this time trying to label all of her music, she probably isn't what she says she is, cause she has to prove everything through her clothes. Your personality should come from the music you create, and if you are that pathetic to keep on classifying it, might as well forget it." --Starliteentity17</p>
<p>Where does that quote come from? Does that mean you think she is really a punk rocker? If she "isn't what she says she is," doesn't that mean that she can't be a punk rocker according to your unsubstantiated quote? One of those two statements must be false, which is it? --<a href="../../../n/a/b/User%7ENabber00_edc9.html" title="User:Nabber00">Nabber00</a> 05:01, 6 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>"I created Punk for this day and age. Do you see Britney walking around wearing ties and singing punk? Hell no. That's what I do. I'm like a Sid Vicious for a new generation." Avril Lavigne (Seventeen Magazine, 2002) This quote pretty much confirms it. --TheEye5000</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm almost 110% positive that if you mentioned sid and nancy, she'd ask you if you were talking about crazy town without a clue as to why.</dd>
</dl>
<p>That quote is made up by the record company. Avril Lavigne has never said that herself. --Joakim</p>
<p>"I don't think I'm punk," the Canadian phenom says during a phone interview from New York City. "It really pisses me off when I have labels placed on me like that. People are stupid for doing that, because I'm not punk. It's my pet peeve now." Boston Herald, May 21, 2004 <a href="http://theedge.bostonherald.com/musicNews/view.bg?articleid=28709&amp;format=" class="external free" title="http://theedge.bostonherald.com/musicNews/view.bg?articleid=28709&amp;format=" rel="nofollow">http://theedge.bostonherald.com/musicNews/view.bg?articleid=28709&amp;format=</a> --<a href="../../../n/a/b/User%7ENabber00_edc9.html" title="User:Nabber00">Nabber00</a> 06:39, 7 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm I the only one who knows that Lavigne did not write her songs in "Let Go" and that the new cd is the first showcase of lavigne's songwriting?Lenore</p>
<p>Lenore, according to the CD booklet, she co-wrote the majority of the songs with the pop songwriters known as "The Matrix." Can anyone clarify this? --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorns_among_our_leaves_f163.html" title="User:Thorns among our leaves">Thorns Among Our Leaves</a> 23:38, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Avril did in fact state many times that she was a punk, that she was the new Sid Vicious, etc. She claimed to be punk im YM magazine in 2001. She was also head cheerleader at her high school and dropped out in junior year. What a great role-model. I have more info about her at <a href="http://www.avrilsux.tripod.com" class="external text" title="http://www.avrilsux.tripod.com" rel="nofollow">Anti-Avril</a></p>
<p>You do realize that being "a punk" is much different from creating punk music, right?</p>
<p>That she dropped out is true, very true. The punk and cheerleader part are all lies. And creating an anti-avril site is just pathetic. You're just jealous. --Joakim</p>

<p>Before anyone even tries to say that Avril Lavigne's music can be considered punk rock I recommend they read what categories music as <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_rock.html" title="Punk rock">punk rock</a>. --gimmepunkorelse</p>
<p>The category of her music is pop/rock, not punk rock.</p>

<p>Some idiot is desperately trying to change the "With" in "I'm With You" to "with", just so that it fits proper English style. It seems, even though I've told him that Avril wanted a capital W (just like <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Day_5412.html" title="Green Day">Green Day</a> wanted a small "o" in "Boulevard <b>o</b>f Broken Dreams"), he is trying to lower-case it anyway.</p>
<p>There's a serious problem going on here. <a href="../../../d/r/i/User%7EDrippingInk_8cfa.html" title="User:DrippingInk">DrippingInk</a> 15:33, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ol>
<li>Read <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a>. I've already pointed you toewards this.</li>
<li>You've provided no evidence for your claim that lavigne wanted a capital, though I've provided you with a long list of links to sites in which the "with" isn't capitalised.</li>
<li>In any case, it's not only proper English style, but also Wikipedia style not capitalise preositions in titles (which why "Boulevarde of Broken Dreams" is perfectly correct). <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 15:50, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<p>I am also in favor of uppercase "With", but Mel has previously said it's non-negotiable because correct English style isn't a democratic thing. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 18:55, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's more that following Wikipedia style isn't a matter of choice. If you want to argue that the MoS should be chaged, that's another matter (though I'd strongly argue against a change). <a href="../../../d/r/i/User%7EDrippingInk_8cfa.html" title="User:DrippingInk">DrippingInk</a> (<a href="../../../d/r/i/User_talk%7EDrippingInk_13e6.html" title="User talk:DrippingInk">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DrippingInk_b3d4.html" title="Special:Contributions/DrippingInk">contribs</a>) first claimed that he'd checked "hundreds of grammar and spelling books" whicjh supported his view. Having his bluff called, he retreated to the claim that this is how Lavigne wants it spelt; that's not only unproved, but it doesn't explain his attempts similarly to change every other relevant title in the articles that he edits. He then started pesonal attacks on me, including blanking my User page. It's not clear where he'll retreat to next (after his block is lifted). <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 19:00, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is a simple issue, we just list the song names as they appear on the CD case, if that isn't accurate, I don't know what is. In this case, the 'with' is uppercase. --<a href="../../../n/a/b/User%7ENabber00_edc9.html" title="User:Nabber00">Nabber00</a> 06:42, 8 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So I just pulled down my copy of <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Man_Group_971d.html" title="Blue Man Group">Blue Man Group's</a> <i><a href="../../../a/u/d/Audio_%28Blue_Man_Group%29_39ac.html" title="Audio (Blue Man Group)">Audio</a></i>. All the song titles are in all caps. So, by your reasoning, should all the song titles on that article for that CD be in all caps? <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDismas_8600.html" title="User:Dismas">Dismas</a> 02:28, 13 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I might be willing to consider that a special case, but even so, that still doesn't address the issue of a definitive source for the information. If you look at the Blue Man Group's website it also lists the song titles in all caps, so I would be inclined to think that the intent is to have them all capital.--<a href="../../../n/a/b/User%7ENabber00_edc9.html" title="User:Nabber00">Nabber00</a> 07:05, 13 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>CD cases frequently contain mistakes — sometimes small, sometimes large. There are often discrepancies between usage on different parts of the insert, or between the insert and the label, or between both and other appearances on reissues or compilations, or between the CDs and printed music, etc. The one thing that we know for certain is what standard English style is, which is why it's best and safest to use it. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 11:29, 13 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That is not the case here, you are referring to special cases not relevant to this discussion. Both the insert and case match the capital W, so I doubt its a mistake. All of the reputable websites that I can find use the capital W (probably because that is how it appears on the album). I agree it is safe to use English convention, but it is not necessarily correct, as in this case. By emphasizing standards over correctness, we jeopordize the credibility of Wikipedia.--<a href="../../../n/a/b/User%7ENabber00_edc9.html" title="User:Nabber00">Nabber00</a> 17:12, 13 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you people! Thank you, thank you, thank you! I love each and every one of you!</p>
<p>Let me get one thing straight here: I am a musician. I don't seem like one, I know, but I certainly am. I am also a songwriter. It may be "incorrect English", but that doesn't matter. Song titles have always been capital (as well as "<a href="../../../s/p/i/Spice_Up_Your_Life_5b9e.html" title="Spice Up Your Life">Spice Up Your Life</a>") and just because it doesn't match the English-style, it is by far extremely correct.</p>
<p>Very nice of you to say that CD cases contain mistakes - this would mean that each and every single one of them do.</p>
<p>From this point forward, the "W" will be capital, and not small. Before you came along, it was capital, and it had been the entire time. Your presence is not going to change that. Plus, why do you consist in changing the <i><a href="../../../u/n/d/Under_My_Skin_fe1c.html" title="Under My Skin">Under My Skin</a></i> single style back to the poorly typed one? You created the other one, and it should be just like that one, because I think it is very well spread out.</p>
<p>However, like I mentioned before, the "W" is going to be capital from this moment on.</p>

<dd>You see, through dozens of reverts, DrippingInk never claimed that his version was the way the covers had the title, only that he was right, and that hundreds of style and spelling books backed him up, and that I was an idiot, etc. (the history is there on all the Talk pages).

It shouldn't be on her talk page. Where it should be is over on the Manual of Style's talk page. Not everyone who is putting song titles in artist pages will be watching A.L.'s page. Most of them probably don't care about A.L. more than likely... Take this discussion where it's better suited. As far as my "vote": I was simply following what the MoS says.

<p>Sorry, I am new to Wiki, ( only joined last week ) so please be patient with me. I am refering to her b-sides totally unrelated to her albums.

<dd>Usually b-side refers to a song on a single besides the main single track. So I guess what you mean isn't quite the same as that?

<dl>
<dd>It's as Everyking says: the A-side and B-sides of LPs and singles refer to the physical sides of the discs. In the case of a single, the main song was on the A-side, and the B-side was often thought of as a filler (though B-sides sometimes became more popular than A-sides). Sometimes, confusingly, when the two songs were released as equally important, the single was referred to as a double A-side (topologically impossible, but metaphorically understandable). --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 11:50, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>An anonymous user has recently changed Avril's place of birth from Belleville, Ontario to Napanee. Whilst it is common knowledge that Av *grew up* in Napanee, I am unsure as to which was her actual place of birth (if either).

I fail to see how this can be considered a 'live cover' in the strictest sense of the word, which to me implies that she performed the song seriously at one of her gigs.

That's not all there is. Avril said in an interview with smash hit's magazine that she sang the song a couple of times but Spears stopped her. She covered the song, get over it.

I agree with you that punk means different things to different people but this is not a discussion on what the populous believe punk to be. The topic that this concerns is what categorizes music as punk. Punk as a genre is defined as having lyrics that often consist of strong political or social protest as well as having a fast, aggressive, and raw sound. Also note that punk is an anti-establishment movement. How can Avril Lavigne be categorized as a punk rock musician when her music clearly does not fit under this category and she participates in this mainstream establishment? -Gimmepunkorelse 03:25, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>By that same logic, you should be going around removing the 'punk' references from every 'pop punk' band, or any 'punk' band signed to a major label that has an article on Wikipedia. 'Punk' is not a genere of music - 'punk' is 'music created by punks'. There is no typical 'punk sound' (or at least there shouldn't be), as punk is supposed to be about ignoring the rules, not simply choosing to accept another set. As I have stated before, there is a paragraph in the main article itself - in the <a href="../../../a/v/r/Avril_Lavigne_f30c.html#Image_and_personal_life" title="Avril Lavigne">Avril_Lavigne#Image_and_personal_life</a> section (someone moved a few things around last night) which addresses your point of view and criticisms (you could expand on that, if you wished). Continuing to remove Lavigne from the 'punk rock musicians' category introduces bias into the article. --<a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKurt_Shaped_Box_3207.html" title="User:Kurt Shaped Box">Kurt Shaped Box</a> 13:14, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>I am not going around removing the 'punk' references from every 'pop punk' band, or any 'punk' band signed to a major label, I am removing incorrect references to artists that are listed as punk as well as increasing the information on punk and punk artists. "'Punk' is not a genere of music - 'punk' is 'music created by punks'." I can agree with you on that and since us both find that to be true her music is not punk since she is not a punk. Categorizing information is not putting a set of rules into effect but instead putting common characteristics of an area together for organizational purposes. Continuing to add Lavigne to the 'punk rock musicians' category introduces your bias into the article since you are just a fan. My removing of Avril Lavigne from this category is not bias since I am knowledgeable on the topic of punk. -Gimmepunkorelse 20:43, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</i></p>

<p>I initially removed Avril Lavigne from the "punk" catagory because I don't consider her to be punk. But since the definition of what is punk and what isn't is often hazy at best, and since this has already been argued a great deal on here, I've decided that it simply isn't worth pressing the issue. It would be a good idea, however, to create a new subcategory for "pop-punk" musicians and perhaps place her in it, as pop-punk is a subcategory of punk-rock. <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsarelah_4a68.html" title="User:Asarelah">User:Asarelah</a></p>

<dd>Avril Lavigne is deffinetly NOT a punk girl! Her songs sound like ones that Britney would sing! She may dress different, but that doesnt mean shes a punk! Her stylist chooses all her clothes! So wearing baggy jeans, skater trainers, a vest, a tie and all those bracelets isnt her idea! Her makeup is also done by a proffesional! She cant play the guitar or even skate! She claimed she could at first but then denied it! She is part of major record label, appears on MTV alot, and also in every teenybopper magazine! She was a cheerleadr in highschool and wanted to be a country singer! She once even performed with Shania Twain, wow! thats so punk rock.....</dd>

<p>lyke. what r u talking bout u b!tch! u dont no avril you can judge her! she does too play da guitar i saw her do it in concert once! so there! she wearz wat she wantz! she doesn not have a stylist! she amke sall her clothez hesrslef and writes her own songs and can totally skate! u r just jelius cos avril is like sooooooooooooooo much better than u! any 1 hui dislikes avril is jelius! u suk! she rox1!</p>
<p>Does anyone know the word for that paragraph right above me, for acting like an idiot on the side that you're against to make that viewpoint look bad?</p>
<p>i think that was typed by a real fan, seriously! there are some avril fans who type like that and have huge tantrums when someone says "i dont like avril" even if that person has a good reason to dislike avril! they say that if you dont like avril your jealous cos shes "better" than us, and we dont knowe her so we cant judge her, but its ok ofr avrils fans to judge anyone who doenst like avri (you know, saying we're worthless, talentless, we listen to boybands, we're cheerleaders, we're apparantly spoiled,etc etc) but there all those things!</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Avril Lavigne official website spells "I'm With You"</span></h2>
<p>Look, here's a link if you don't believe me!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.avrillavigne.com/discog/?view=song&amp;id=43" class="external text" title="http://www.avrillavigne.com/discog/?view=song&amp;id=43" rel="nofollow">lyrics page with the song entitled "I'm With You"</a>. Capital "W"!

<p>As you can see, on Billboard (which I'd say strives to be, you know, pretty accurate in their dealings with music, song titles, etc) and Avril's OFFICIAL WEBSITE, the song is spelled with a capital "W" (even though it's not grammatically correct). Keep in mind that there are MANY song titles that don't adhere to proper English "rules" and it's not up to us to change it if the artist has CHOSEN to go with the grammatically incorrect version.</p>
<p>I don't know if anyone has pointed this out yet. I looked through some of the history and didn't see it mentioned so I thought I'd throw it in and check out the responses.</p>
<p>My thinking is that the song should be documented in Wikipedia with the exact spelling that it is OFFICIALLY documented on her OFFICIAL site. If anyone has a problem with that, say so now, but if not, I'm going to change the capitalization of "with". <a href="../../../g/i/n/User%7EGinnna_ea81.html" title="User:Ginnna"><font style="background: #CD5555" face="Century Gothic" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Ginnna</b></font></a> 08:21, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Its also spelled with the capital on the back of Let Go. This has come up before.

<dd>Yeah, I came back to the edit page to point out that although I'd seen the conflict about the capitalization, what I hadn't found was anyone pointing out that it'd been capitalized in her official website. I saw the thing about the "W" on the actual physical albums being capitalized but nothing about the website. The problem I saw that some people had in the talk above is that they thought it was maybe a typo... but then of course it would also have to be a typo on her official website and on Billboard. I was pretty much going to change it anyway but since it seemed like such a big little deal, I thought I'd bring it to the talk page first to be polite. <a href="../../../g/i/n/User%7EGinnna_ea81.html" title="User:Ginnna"><font style="background: #CD5555" face="Century Gothic" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Ginnna</b></font></a> 08:35, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
