<p>I did look at the page, that was why it made me laugh so much. I was a little surprised FF7 would actually report the other guy when he was in such blatant violation himself.

The problem is that this template is almost an exact copy of Bignole's <a href="../../../h/o/r/Template%7EHorror_Icons_2b0d.html" title="Template:Horror Icons">Template: Horror Icons</a>, which was created first as you'll probably remember from my documented "Horror Icons War" on my "Discussion page" [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:FF7SquallStrife7" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:FF7SquallStrife7" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>]. I believe that creating the template is <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">User:Piecraft</a>'s way of circumventing the protection on <a href="../../../h/o/r/Template%7EHorror_Icons_2b0d.html" title="Template:Horror Icons">Template: Horror Icons</a> that resulted after the edit wars on the template so that he can add his own "horror icons" to the list.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>In addition, <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">User:Bignole</a> informed me that <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">User:Piecraft</a> replaced <a href="../../../h/o/r/Template%7EHorror_Icons_2b0d.html" title="Template:Horror Icons">Template: Horror Icons</a> with his Template: Horrormovie Icons on most of the horror-related pages such as <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Myers_%28Halloween%29_9766.html" title="Michael Myers (Halloween)">Michael Myers (Halloween)</a>. Take a look at the history [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_Myers_%28Halloween%29&amp;diff=85969995&amp;oldid=85863731" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_Myers_%28Halloween%29&amp;diff=85969995&amp;oldid=85863731" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>]. By the way, notice how <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Scourge_f8fa.html" title="User:The Scourge">User:The Scourge</a> deleted Bignole's Horror Icon's template and then Piecraft placed his/hers on the page? Conspiracy? Sock Puppets?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyways, can you or another editor please delete Piecraft's template? It's just a sneaky way to get around protections in order to add things of your own.</dd>

<p>Avraham, We are under no intention what so ever to threat anyone on Wikipedia, specially Mr. Kramer. We simply will like to know if he's and admin? If he is we will like to get direct instructions from him that will facilitate the contribution this organization will like to make to the Freaky Ice definition and contect, as well as the information value or facts have that are relative, related and important to the history of this product. This product has a bad or non conforming track record worldwide, and we are not happy to learn how this banned product as hip as it may be, has made its way to other states in our union even though its been banned in NY and other countries in the world for the reason we state. We feel very strong about this becuase Wikipedia is widely used by students and minors worldwide and it wouldn't be right for us to know what we know, and do nothing about it.

<p>Thanks for answering my edit request when the page was still protected. I didn't mean for you to get caught in the crossfire, though! It seemed to me that there wasn't an edit war over his party affiliation anymore so I thought it would be okay and was just trying to reduce confusion. Fortunately, a consensus seems to have been reached.

I did not do so on your questions page to avoid exapanding that section with issues that I believe are tangential. Although tangential to what I was asking, I think they are issues which I believe deserve a resopnse. I will comment inline:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Firstly, let me remind you that you are not informing me of anything I do not know. On the contrary, it was I who provided both the citation, and the quote that you are bringing image:smile.gif.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Not quite accurate. You supplied the citation <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Third_holiest_site_in_Islam&amp;diff=87331684&amp;oldid=87316950" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Third_holiest_site_in_Islam&amp;diff=87331684&amp;oldid=87316950" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>, but the text of what I quoted was supplied by me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Third_holiest_site_in_Islam&amp;diff=87396458&amp;oldid=87394492" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Third_holiest_site_in_Islam&amp;diff=87396458&amp;oldid=87394492" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, and much more unfortunately, you seem to be working under the misconception that the purpose of this article is somehow to demean the importance of al-Aqsa. Perhaps it is poor experience with other editors, perhaps it is Freudian projection, only you can answer that.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is not a question of working under misconceptions, nor of Freudian projection, but of correcting misrepresentations, whether accidental or otherwise. You should <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. See my next comment.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To me, the purpose of the article is simply to document the apparent world-wide disagreement as to the third holiest site in Islam. If that means al-Aqsa is the second, then G-d bless; it is irrelevant to this article. I did not see the need to place it in the text, as it was clear in quote; later on someone added it to the text. Again, I am afraid that was more due to the feelings of "attacking" and "defending" various religious beliefs as opposed to enhancing the encyclopædia, but c'set la vie.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I added the text, not out of "attacking" and "defending", and certainly not out of religious belief. The lead for <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_holiest_site_in_Islam_c5f9.html" title="Third holiest site in Islam">Third holiest site in Islam</a> declares:</dd>

Based on scriptural references, the <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Mosque_3981.html" title="Al-Aqsa Mosque">Al-Aqsa Mosque</a> is widely recognized as the third holiest site in Islam...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Mosques other than <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Mosque_3981.html" title="Al-Aqsa Mosque">Al-Aqsa Mosque</a> have been referred to as the "third holiest site in Islam" based on other considerations. None of these sites are mentioned in the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a> or Prophetic <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">Hadith</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In my humble opinion, a bald assesrtion that for some the third holiest site in Islam is a shrine in Turkey is in this context misleading by omission. A reader who does not read the citation would have most certainly concluded that according to some, the order of holy sites goes Mecca, Medina, location in Turkey.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On this topic, I have unfortunately seen much editing here where wiki guidelines and policies take a back seat to various ideologies, and editing becomes a war. This is most unfortunate.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While I personally have my own points-of-view which are well documented, I have always tried to ensure that the primary motivating factor is to enhance the project in accordance withits policies and guidelines. I am sure you feel the same way, but perhaps you have become sensitized to the point where you find it hard to assume good faith with editors whom you feel have a distinctly different point of view. If that is the case, I hope that you can overcome that cynicism, for your sake and the projects sake. Trust me, i know it is hard, I work on myself in that way constantly.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If the truth be told, I think you need to work on it a little more.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now, as for your point about the paper. Once again, that does not belong here, and I have asked to discuss it in its proper place, the articles talk page.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Again you refer to "the paper". I have seen no evidence that there is such a paper. But the proper place to respond is where I asked the question, on your question page.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For various reasons, you continue to ask it here. Oh well. According to my discussions with the Library of Congress when I was registering a work of short fiction, something posted on the internet is considered published. Now that the legalese is out of the way, I would like to ask you, how is this any different from a news article on CNN or Al-Jazeera?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Um, yes. CNN and Al-Jazeera have fact checkers, editors etc. Is there any evidence that the paraphrase of research performed by Prof. Bowen was reviewed by <b>anybody</b>?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You raised some valid points on the articles talk page about the attribution. Now, I think it is rather obvious that as I have provided more than one link between the name "George E. Bowen" and the paper (Only one Bowen in UofT,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Not true. If you think there is only one Prof. Bowen at UofT, you have hardly done your research very well. But you are correct that the author is George E. Bowen.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>only Bowen Fullbright scholar in Cyprus, paper hosted on UofT server,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No, summary of research hosted on UofT server</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>multiple connections between Bowen and Assesing Cyprus, paper itself taks about Profesor Bowen, etc. )</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Don't you find it odd that the web page talks about Prof. Bowen in the manner that it does?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>that the paper can be reliably attributed to him</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Do you really believe that is an appropriate way to document contentious assertions on Wikipedia? It seems like he wrote it, I believe he wrote it, so what the heck, thats good enough.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While we prefer topics published in peer-reviewed journals, a depiction of the analysis of a Fullbrigt scholar is eminently notable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Who reviewed the "depiction" of the analysis? Who is even the author?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To answer your specific questions, the name of the paper is "Assessing the Isle of Cyprus", it is paraphrased on the servers of the University of Tennessee for all to see (pure poetry, without a fee&#160;;), the parahrase was published on April 3, 2001.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Evidence please that there is a paper with that name?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>More importantly, I am beginning to feel that your problem with this paper is neither the paper nor its source, but the thesis it portrays. You seem to have personalized this article, and feel that it is an attack on you and what you believe. I feel badly that you have become so defensive, and I understand how that can happen. But the nly way this project will succeed is if we are able to all understand that the application of the policies and guidelines trancend each and every one of our personal beliefs, mine, yours, Jimbo's, and how if we were all to abide by them, it would actually serve to remove the negative spin that we each psychologically fear. -- Avi 21:14, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Again, more psychologizing. Please understand that your perceptions of my beliefs are probably wrong. I think it is unfortunate. However, as you state, you have to struggle to assume good faith. I wish you success in your struggles.

<p>Sorry if I offended you. I know from working at a university that it is not always easy for persons outside the university, or even persons inside the university but outside the academic field in question, to evaluate the quality of the content posted on the university's servers. Usually a university, by policy, does not evaluate what particular departments or professors within departments post on what can look like an official page. A university is concerned with the presentation factors of its front page, usibility of the university site for students and potential students, and other such non-academic issues, except as content pertains to the univerity as a whole. Individual departments at a university are free to organize and post content as they like, and departments in academic areas are not neutral. Furthermore, a particular professor within a department may have a disparate viewpoint at odds with the department's stand as a whole on particular issues. Still, that professor would be free to post as he likes on what can be presented as an offical page. Hope this explains what I mean as I have to go now. Please ask more if I have not answered your question.

<dd>When referring to hadith, Muslim's are referring to the Prophet's words or actions - not his companions, other islamic scholars or any old joe blogg. The two primary sources of evidence in Islam are the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Quran.html" title="Quran">quran</a> and <i>prophetic</i> <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith.html" title="Hadith">hadith</a>. The Imam Ali source was clearly referring to the saying of Imam Serdeg. Anyways I earlier clarified the lead section so that it now says "Prophetic hadith". <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipidian_2724.html" title="User:Wikipidian">Wikipidian</a> 01:16, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Avram Admin Glen S has made a totally inapprobriate block here. Please Unblock. There are Two very good reasons. 1- The users are not the same and 2-Just as Important the reason given was evading of block! But the the previous block of 31 hours had already EXPIRED!! 3- As far as I know users do not always choose their ISP address so it wouldn't be intentional (this is moot since these two people are not sock puppets)</p>

<p>I have reason to believe that Glen_S's block of this user therefore was a pretext and possible racially motivated for attempted contributions to the Michael Richards article, which would be a is a serious violation of WP. Thank you. 71.111.117.65</p>
<p>I keep getting harassed/blanked and reverted by User:NetScott also from my userpage and ANI page. Please warn or block him him. Thanks for your help with this intimidation.

<p>Most of what I'm saying is not aimed at you.</p>
<p>I cannot understand why the time of editors is being wasted in this fashion. The inference made is highly unpleasant, and the statement brings nothing whatsoever to the encyclopedia.</p>
<p>We now seem to have reached a consensus that this slur not remain, but that the citation from religious anti-Zionists be cut out too. This is a loss to the article, readers need to know that Giladi's position is shared by other non-Zionists (who, needless to say, are not making allegations of anti-semitism against him).</p>
<p>Many people will come to the WP having only heard claims made by the Zionists, they need links to find other material along the same lines from sources other than Giladi. POV editting has damaged the community, it has also damaged this article.</p>
<p>Why you compare Giladi, a victim of racism in Israel and a victim of malice in his entry in the WP, with Arial Sharon, a racist killer and ethnic cleanser is difficult to understand. See <a href="../../../q/i/b/Qibya_massacre.html" title="Qibya massacre">Qibya massacre</a> for another proven (indeed admitted, perhaps even boasted) example of the evil perpetrated by Sharon on behalf of Israel.</p>
