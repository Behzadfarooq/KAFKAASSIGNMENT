<p>Have anyone realised that Avril Lavigne face has been transformating??

<p>Avril said her last name is legally Lavigne Whibley, I'm sourcing it so quit changing it. If I have enough time I'll do a transcript of the radio show in case the file is deleted. 24.65.196.35 21:01, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The link for the "Keep Holding On" info is irrelevant. It's an older article that talks about her CD, acting career, and wedding. Any KHO info is much newer. For now I'm changing it to a link on her official website about the song, but I'll try and find an article talking about the radio station. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBritishenglish_5c30.html" title="User:Britishenglish">Britishenglish</a> 20:02, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is it really relevant. I mean it's an encyclopedia article, not a news message board.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/v/r/Talk%7EAvril_Lavigne_54c9.html" title="Edit section: This article needs a big clean-up">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">This article needs a big clean-up</span></h2>
<p>I strongly suggest to put a neutral point of view warning above this page, and a clean-up sign.. Two issues bug me with this article:</p>
<p>1. The lack of citations. 2. The selection and presentation of facts.</p>
<p>First, the lack of citations make the article very un-verifiable. For example, the article states that "The media have often compared Lavigne to Alanis Morissette". Comparing to isn't the same as making them (partly) equal. For example, I just read the article "A NIGHT OUT WITH: Avril Lavigne; Punk Rocker, Pop Queen And Tomboy All in One" from the NY Times of November 10, 2002. This article says that Lavigne plays music and has a look that once belonged to Alanis Morisette. It doesn't say anything about artistic quality.</p>
<p>Second, this article is a mess, and the selection of facts is dubious. The previous sample came from the part headlined by "2002-2003". "Image and Personal Life" is mostly about a fight with celebrity Hillary Duff, a tattoo, and wether she is punk or not. Instead of a well-balanced, cited piece on the critical discussion around her image, her musical quality, and her ever-changing image. There is a whole piece on her new 'feminine' look, and the discussion around that. But the citation used (nr 13), only points to a picture with small description of this look. And critisism like this article in the Guardian is hardly represented in this Wikipedia-article: <a href="http://arts.guardian.co.uk/reviews/story/0,11712,1221071,00.html#article_continue" class="external free" title="http://arts.guardian.co.uk/reviews/story/0,11712,1221071,00.html#article_continue" rel="nofollow">http://arts.guardian.co.uk/reviews/story/0,11712,1221071,00.html#article_continue</a></p>
<p>And then the article states: '"Once a "grungy" pop star, she showed her femininity in her new look, becoming the new face of Chanel in 2006.' Saying that Chanel equals femininity. Is that NPOV?</p>
<p>My suggestion: Put a big, fat warning above this article, and clean it up.</p>
<p>Make clear sections: Intro Professional Career (Chronologically. include CD's, awards, etc. State facts.) Discussion about her image. (Well-balanced, cited review of the discussion around her fake or not image. With a well-weighted piece on the whole "punk or not"-discussion. (Who cares, besides punkers and wannabe-punkers?) Tabloid attention. (Hillary Duff, the buttocks thing, etc) Personal life. (Include "early life". And don't tell that she's married to Deryck Whibley trice, like it is now.) --Looskuh 02:25, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>I agree entirely. Reading this page made me squirm knowing how much was wrong. So I took the liberty of editing the most annoying part:</p>
<p>"Lavigne was romantically linked to her former guitarist <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesse_Colburn_2234.html" title="Jesse Colburn">Jesse Colburn</a>, and she acknowledged him as her first boyfriend."</p>
<p>I can't believe any fan would actually think that was true. I tried to change it before but it got deleted, probably because there was no proof (although there weren't any citations for the original paragraph, other than an article that simply stated Colburn was leaving the band). So, I've added this as a reference:</p>
<p>"Lavigne says she writes about her true life events, and boybashing songs would not exist if she hadn't dated before first meeting Colburn. In a J-14 magazine from 2004, she also talks about her first kiss being when she was 14 years old. In M magazine in 2003, an article was published about an ex-boyfriend selling her love letters on eBay."</p>

<p>This is what a parragraf says (At the bottom of Image and Personal Life): "Another thing to note, is she also stated she would never be in her underwear &amp; show off her body in her videos - She actually did both of these things in the first 2 videos from her second album; she was in her underwear for the "Don't Tell Me" video, and in the video for "My Happy Ending" she wore a very short skirt, and performed a piroette, showing off her thighs &amp; rearend."</p>
<p>I think that point of view is TOO subjective (to not mention awkward)!.. I Mean, She wasn't like showing herself off!.. No Way!.. Yes, she was wearing underwear in her video, but she wasn't like: "oh, look my boobs and my butt", if you read and understand the lyrics, you'll see there's a guy in the song trying to pester about having sex... And, in my happy ending, I do not think it was a veeery short skirt, i mean, it's larger than a cheerleaders!...</p>
<p>I didn't cut the parragraf because I wanted to discut this...</p>

This could be better written as "Prior to &lt;date&gt;, Avril travelled with a collection of approximately thirty (neck) ties."

<p>how to become a real punk girl? chinese fan asked by v_v on 10/07/06 Answer: Punk is a way of life. It's political. It's a lot deeper than most people know... and I am not punk.

<p>Pop punk is a good categorization. Avril is less punk than Slayer, and Slayer is thrash metal.</p>

<dd>WHen has Avril done ANYTHING that has to do remotley with punk rock? Why does the article perist to classify her as a Canadian Punk Rock singer? Mabey she's not a "pop" singer. But can we use the term "rock singer" or just "singer"? She has nothing to do with Punk besides her image.</dd>

Lavigne says she's not punk. Her music is clearly not punk. Ergo, she's not punk. 3. "Pop" does not <b>mean</b> popular. It is short for "popular", true; "prog" is short for "progressive", which it isn't. <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_Music_1ab2.html" title="Pop Music">Pop Music</a> is what is meant by "pop".

<p>I have removed pop. Pop stands for Pop music, not popular music. As for as I know Avril is not a pop singer. Even if she does claiming to be pop, I don't care. Britney Spears can say she's Heavy Metal and we won't change the genre. There's a thing called publicity.

<p>"Kurt Shaped Box" gave the excuse that she messes around on the drums on her live sets, so "Drums" was included in her instruments played. Well, in comparison, Kurt Cobain (who is referenced in his/her nick name) also "messed" around on the drums, it's mentioned in <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavier_Than_Heaven_fa79.html" title="Heavier Than Heaven">Heavier Than Heaven</a> the biography of Kurt Cobain. I can type out the quote if you want. But Cobain's Wikipedia entry DOES NOT list him as a drummer, so I do not see why Lavigne is classes as playing drums and Cobain is not, if they both take the drum set during live sets. <a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESpeedboy_Salesman_9141.html" title="User:Speedboy Salesman">Speedboy Salesman</a> 14:10, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Her birthplace is regularly corrected but it taken only a matter of minutes before someone who thinks they know better comes along and puts Napenee in there again.

<p>Possibly there is a problem in that Napanee is not mentioned at all in the biography, particularly when she mentions growing up there in one of her songs. I don't see why that simple addition should be omitted, just because of the know-it-alls. I would suggest adding the information, and leaving it locked. The_Duc 03:04, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
