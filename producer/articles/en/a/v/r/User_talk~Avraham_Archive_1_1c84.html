<p>Hi Avi: Welcome to Wikipedia. Came across the talk page at <a href="../../../p/o/s/Talk%7EPosek_a1b4.html" title="Talk:Posek">Talk:Posek</a>. Please follow Wikipedia protocols: Latest comments are placed at the bottom of the talk page, so there is at least some sort of order and chronological continuity (a "descending order"). This can be automatically and easily done if you click on the "+" sign at the top of each talk page, if and when you want to add new comments. Thank you. Feel free to contact me if you have questions. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 16:38, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The best thing for you to do is click <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Counter_Vandalism_Unit#Detection" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Counter_Vandalism_Unit#Detection" rel="nofollow">here</a>. That you take you to the bottom of the page (if not, scroll down). Click on the "godmode' link. That is what I use, it is very helpful. Also at the top of the same page you will notice a link labeled <i>wikipedia-en-vandalism'</i>, if you click there it will take you to an IRC chat which has a bot that flags likely vandalistic edits. Hope that helps! --<a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilotguy_59e8.html" title="User:Pilotguy">Winter</a> 01:45, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Welcome aboard... you know, the best way to get involved in editing wikipedia is to search for a topic that you know a lot about and just start making improvements to those articles. Another way is to just repeatedly click on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random" rel="nofollow">random article</a> button until something catches your eye.

<p>I removed <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Josey_874c.html" title="Richard Josey">Richard Josey</a> from candidates for speedy deletion as I did not feel it met the criteria. If you think a subject is not notable, it must go to <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">Articles for Deletion</a> unless it "does not assert the importance or significance of its subject". I think many editors would consider the statement that "His exhibits at the Royal Academy extended from 1876 to 1887" as at least an <i>assertion</i> of importance or significance. When in doubt, the safest route is to forgo the speedy process and put it on AfD for community comment. In most cases, when I remove a speedy tag I replace it with an AfD tag but in this case I cleaned up the article instead. At this point, I personally don't believe the article should be deleted but wanted to let you know in case you wanted to put it up on AfD. Cheers. -- <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/s/1/User_talk%7EDS1953_dfdb.html" title="User talk:DS1953"><font color="green">talk</font></a></sup> 06:28, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If you took the time to place the advert tag, why don't you vote in AfD? It is the direct text from their website! I originally put a copyvio, but the publisher's PR person said that they authorized it; but it's nothing more than blatant advertising, and further, it isn't really notable. So, one way or another, let your opinion be heard here: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Gibbs_Smith%2C_Publisher_5b09.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Gibbs Smith, Publisher">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Gibbs Smith, Publisher</a> -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 01:54, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Careful with your speedy tags!</span></h2>
<p>I just reverted your addition of a speedy deletion tag to <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Tosh_74e2.html" title="Daniel Tosh">Daniel Tosh</a>. The article clearly asserts his notability (appearances on multiple TV shows even I, as a non-American, have heard of). This is not really a speedy candidate. Take it to AFD if you really want him deleted. I then checked your other contributions and noted that you had added a speedy tag on <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Catesby_93ef.html" title="Robert Catesby">Robert Catesby</a>, the leader of the <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gunpowder_plot.html" title="Gunpowder plot">Gunpowder plot</a>, without noticing that the page had been blanked by a vandal. I removed that too, and continued to do the same at <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chantal_Claret_dc39.html" title="Chantal Claret">Chantal Claret</a>, lead singer of a band that has an article, and <a href="../../../r/a/k/Rakeshprasadji_Maharaj_2f59.html" title="Rakeshprasadji Maharaj">Rakeshprasadji Maharaj</a>, who is claimed to a religious leader of some kind. In the two latter cases, I can't judge the notability (it depends on the importance of the band and religious group, repectively), but articles like these really should to be discussed before any deletion. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+land</a> 23:37, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there, I noticed that you voted to speedy delete Funeral Folk, which is a correct vote. However, if you vote for a speedy deletion, please add the relevant tag to the page, e.g. {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-band_6234.html" title="Template:Db-band">db-band</a>}} in this case. This way, administrators will see it faster and it will not be clogging up AFD. I have tagged this page for now.</p>

<dd>As I said earlier, you tagged an article which was 6 minutes old. Wikipedia grows best with community contributions, and this does not always happen in 6 minutes. Of coz when I created the article, I have no intention to keep it as a one-liner entry (else I wont have bothered added a stub notice). That said, you appear to have this impression that even if the article becomes 3000 words long, you are still going to flag it for deletion by calling it a "definition". Where do you draw the line between a "definition" and an encyclopedia article? Also, can wikipedia article not start off as one-liner stubs before they see glorier days?

<p><br />
It was very kind of you to say that, Avi, thank you. I'm glad you found the discussion helpful. I've been known in the past to blabber extensively about these things; it sometimes surprises me that I apparently don't compel my fellow WPns to run screaming for the hills every time I open my big mouth.;-) I noticed your WP Philosophy on the front page—it's admirably honest and to the point. I agree with you that WP's biggest issues right now are verifiability, accuracy, and—very simply—good writing. At 1 million articles, no other compendium comes close to us in terms of quantity (the Britannica still has only 120,000 odd articles in some 55 million words, compared with our 1 million articles in some 350 million words). Nevertheless, the quality of the vast majority of our 1 million articles is, if we're honest about it, appaling. There are pages and pages of unverified tales, juvenile brain farts, adolescent rumblings, unadulterated nonsense; of the half-way decent articles, most lack the most elementary sourcing. An infinitesimal number of our articles have been granted "featured status"—they're supposed to be the stuff we're proud of and represent the "good" articles on WP. We have 900 of them—out of 1 million. Can you imagine the folks at Britannica saying "Our encyclopedia is the best in the world. Fully <b>0.09%</b> of our articles have met our editorial policies; we're prepared to stand by their verifiability, factual accuracy, and neutrality. The other <b>99.91%</b> are kind of touch-and-go, but hey—those are just numbers, right?"&#160;;-0 Somehow, the concept that the presence of bad stuff in an encyclopedia <i>actively hurts it</i>, certainly as much and usually more than the absence of good stuff, seems alien to a lot of us. Indeed, editors termed "deletionist" (and even "mergist", which is what I think most closely describes my own position) are often actually derided for trying to enhance the quality of the encyclopedia (while being told in no uncertain term that "<i>we're here to write an encyclopedia, people!</i>"&#160;:)) I don't quite understand the thought process, and for the most part all of us agree on most things and get along very well, but there you go. Anyway, I just dropped by to say thanks, but seem to have inflicted a rant on you! Apologies.;-) <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><span style="font-family:Times;color:navy;cursor:crosshair;">ENCEPHALON</span></a> <i>05:48, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<dd>In that case, the article Midian or the article Edom should be tagged; but not the category. While "Midian" proper may be considered part of Torah people, the entire category should not. -- Avi 02:07, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree. Midian is a "Torah people", thus the category should be included. It's not necessary for 100% of the individual items within the category to be expressly mentioned in the Torah.

<p>I would be interested to know how 1948 A.M. is arrived at for Abraham's birth. Because the book I have that adds up all the ages found in the different versions says 1946, and it's using the same figures from the MT to get that number. I'm just wondering what might be causing that 2-year discrepancy. I can reproduce the whole calculation adding up to 1946 if you like. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 21:03, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>OK, that still leaves me curious as to how the 2 year discrepancy came about, so let's see if we can figure this out. Here is the calculation in my book (<i>The Interpreter's Bible</i>, old Edition, Vol. I, p.143):</p>
<p>(Numbers refer to the "age at giving birth" given in the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masoretic_Text_3b56.html" title="Masoretic Text">Masoretic Text</a>, of course the older versions have different figures, as I mentioned):</p>
<dl>
<dd>Adam - 130</dd>
<dd>Seth - 105</dd>
<dd>Enosh - 90</dd>
<dd>Kenan - 70</dd>
<dd>Mahalalel - 65</dd>
<dd>Jared - 162</dd>
<dd>Enoch - 65</dd>
<dd>Methuselah - 187</dd>
<dd>Lamech - 182</dd>
<dd>Noah - 500</dd>
<dd>Shem - 100
<dl>
<dd>(Flood is AM 1656 according to this calculation)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Arpachshad - 35</dd>
<dd>Shelah - 30</dd>
<dd>Eber - 34</dd>
<dd>Peleg - 30</dd>
<dd>Reu - 32</dd>
<dd>Serug - 30</dd>
<dd>Nahor - 29</dd>
<dd>Terah - 70</dd>
</dl>
<p>All these figures added together=1,946 AM when Terah gave birth to Abraham. Where are your figures different?

<p>Here is the discrepancy, Genesis 11:10, Arpachshad was born two years AFTER the flood. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 00:33, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Gosh, that's <i>absolutely untrue</i>, Avi! You <i>do</i> know that, right? I really did intend to go up no sooner than about mid April, but it was Seeker's confounded Trekkie ships that forced my hand... He threatened to set them loose on my page, and there I was—undone. Lol. Seriously though, I guess I buckled under the combined onslaught that occured on my page.&#160;:-) But thank you for your support, Avi.
