<p>Hi Avril,</p>
<p>Many thanks for your work on the West Kilbride page, and especially your recent addition of the Hunterston Brooch info.</p>
<p>Probably the biggest weakness of the page (according to Wikipedia standards) as it now stands is its lack of citations of sources.</p>
<p>Would you be able to add citation(s) of the source(s) you used for the Hunterston Brooch info? That would be a great help.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
--<a href="../../../n/s/h/User%7ENSH001_6af3.html" title="User:NSH001">NSH001</a> 17:59, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Good evening!</p>
<p>I wonder if you are the Neil who was at Primary School with me? All those years ago! I'll bet you are. There's no better start in life than a Scottish primary school education! What a pity WK's fine Victorian School (the one we knew) was burned to the ground by vandals. Come to think of it, an entry about the current WK Primary School would be good for the article too.</p>
<p>Another amenity needing an entry is the West Kibride Museum.</p>
<p>I'm learning the editorial tools for Wikipedia, very gradually. Still don't know how to do citations of sources. The material about the Hunterston Brooch I gleaned from National Museum of Scotland publications. Have you been to the Museum in Chambers Street, Edinburgh, where the brooch is housed? You'll find that it is one of the great "icons" of early Scotland. So we should fly the flag and say "West Kilbride made this!"</p>
<p>Regarding citations, I need to find out more about the time Helen Keller stayed in West Kilbride.</p>
<p>We also need to be careful with the hyperlink for Robert Barr, though, because there have been several prominent people with that name.</p>
<p>The architect of West Kilbride Railway Station was James Miller who designed a lot of Scottish Stations, including Wemyss Bay. The RIAS (Royal Incorporation of Architects of Scotland) is building a database of Scottish architects and has screeds about the buildings of James Miller. As you might imagine, there is more than one James Miller, architect. However, the one we are referring to here is THE James Miller who designed, as well as stations, several illustrious buildings in the centre of Glasgow and who is very much a name to conjure with.</p>
<p>What I should like to see is a "history" of West Kilbride, starting with its geology and landscape, and describing the development of the village from early times onwards. For example, the house named "The Fort" in Seamill was named after the archaeological remains of a Roman fortification which were unearthed when the foundations of The Fort were being dug. Similarly, across the road, at a house called "Tarbet", Roman funerary urns were found.</p>
<p>Seamill, as we know it, was preceded by a village called Sandylands. The house in Ardrossan Road named "Sandylands" commemorates this.</p>
<p>Sadly, quite a bit of local history is in danger of being forgotten, simply because people are not recording it properly and passing it on to others. Even in my own time, I have seen local history being lost through ignorance and lack of protection. Some years ago, contractors uplifted lines of rocks from the beach at Seamill and used them to shore up the land against erosion by the sea. Sensible? No! We later found out that these lines of rocks were many hundreds of years old and they were, in fact, ancient fish-traps. An ancient monument that should have been "listed".</p>
<p>So, I hope the work on Wikipedia will help to raise awareness of West Kilbride, Seamill and Portencross, and alert people to their interesting history.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work! Kind regards from Avril.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<dd>Hi Avril, thanks for the kind words. Yes, I think I probably am that Neil. Sorry to say I have been struggling to remember you or recall anything about you. Sorry! But it was 45+ yrs ago, and in a class size of nearly 40 it's not possible to remember everybody. I can remember Jean Jardine, Inez Andrews, Keith Beard, Raymond Black, Duncan McLardy (sp?)), Ailsa Mackinnon, Andrea Currie, Kathleen Small, David Simmons, Alasdair Morrison. Also someone called Alan or Allen, whose 2nd name I can't remember. That's off the top of my head, could probably think of some more with a bit more time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm a bit out of touch with West Kilbride/Seamill now, not having been back since we sold my father's house after his death in 1995. I have mixed feelings about WK, as I was always made to feel an "outsider" (and was bullied at the primary school, so it was a great relief to get to Ardrossan Academy). Partly why I left Scotland after getting 7 Highers in 5th year. But it's still a beautiful place, and there were also some lovely people there. I really would like to bring the article up to Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:WIAGA" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:WIAGA" rel="nofollow">good article</a> standard.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Re citations, there are lots of different ways of doing this on Wikipedia, and there is no "right" or "wrong" way. The best way of learning is just to look at examples in other articles. If you follow the help from the Wikipedia front page, you will find several articles on how to do citations, but they can be daunting at first.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For the WK article, I'd suggest following what I've been doing, which is to put the citation between a pair of &lt;ref&gt; ... &lt;/ref&gt; tags. This results in a little superscripted number appearing where you put the tags, and the citation itself magically appears after the &lt;references/&gt; tag, which is usually placed near the end of the article (it's in the "Notes" section in the case of the WK article). So if a reader of the article wants to follow up a citation, he/she can just click on the little superscript, and the browser will take him/her to the citation itself, which will be highlighted in blue. Similarly, if a reader is interested in the citation, he/she can click on the little caret on the left, and that will take him/her back to where the source is cited.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If the source is a URL, all you need do is just copy it from another window in your browser, and paste it between the &lt;ref&gt; ... &lt;/ref&gt; tags (this is what I did for the BBC "restoration" article). If you'd like a description of the source to appear instead of the raw URL, place the URL within a pair of square brackets, with the description following the URL, separated by a space, like this:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>&lt;ref&gt;[http://very.interesting.web.site my brilliant description]&lt;/ref&gt; (<b>warning:</b> it's easy to forget the closing &lt;/ref&gt; tag!!!)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>-- which you'll see is what I've done for all the refs except the BBC one.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If the source is a book or newspaper article (not online), then just type out the reference (between the &lt;ref&gt; ... &lt;/ref&gt; tags) as you would expect it to appear in the "footnotes" section of a book. Again take a look at how other articles do it. It's possible to use one of the citation templates to do this -- the advantage is that they will automatically give you correct formatting, and probably make life easier once you're used to them; the disadvantage is that they're cumbersome to use, and lots of editors on Wikipedia don't like them. For an example of the "Rolls Royce" standard of citation, take a look at the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actuary.html" title="Actuary">Actuary</a> article (which was the "featured article" on the Wikipedia front page a little while back) -- very professional looking, but complicated, a lot of work to maintain, and OTT for the WK article, I think.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>OK, that's enough on citations!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You've got some good ideas on the WK article above -- I suggest you post them on the WK talk page (or even better, update the article itself if you're sure of your facts and have a reliable source). Talk pages can be useful if you're not sure of something or want to enlist some help. As I'm out of touch with what's going on in WK nowadays, there's not a lot more I can add. I'd love to see the "Amenities" section being expanded, but I obviously can't do that myself. The "Local economy" section needs to be expanded, and I can probably do that from published sources, when I have time. The "History" section I'd rather leave to an expert (I was never any good at history at school!) -- although, again, I could probably cobble something together if necessary.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, a couple of tips on editing talk pages:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>when replying, indent your paragraphs by beginning them with a colon or colons (one more colon than the previous contributor)</li>
<li>sign your contribution using the four tildes (as mentioned by "Doldrums" above). I find the easiest way of doing this is to use the nice squiggly signature button above the edit box. I prefer to put it on a new line, aligned with the rest of my contribution, as I think that makes it easier to see who has written what.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>Kind regards (and good luck!),</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Good evening, Neil</dd>
<dd>Thank you for your helpful reply. I'm glad you are the Neil I thought you were. I saw your name also on Friends Reunited, so I put two and two together.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>May I firstly say that I'm extremely sorry that you don't have happy memories of WK Primary School. Childhood isn't always the idyll that some people imagine it to be. However, I think WK was a pretty good primary school - especially compared to nowadays when some schoolchildren, in inner-city schools, are actually toting handguns! (At the same time, you are only alliowed to play conkers if you are wearing goggles! Isn't life paradoxical?)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm glad all worked out so well for you. I read in your profile that you are a practising Quaker. A very interesting way of life! Quakers are great pacifists, and I deduce that you will be very much agasinst the Iraq War. (Me too!)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>West Kilbride should be very grateful that you are puttimg so much work into its Wikipedia article! I wonder how many people will read it? Presumably those who are thinking of moving to the area, for a start. Was it you who added the recent photographs? Thank you, if was. They do make a big difference!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One thing I would say about the photographs is that the topmost photo (of Seamill Beach) is not really typical of West Kilbride - especially since Seamill and Portencross are to get their own, complimentary articles. We need a better picture of West Kilbride itself - e.g. of the Main Street, or an overview from Law Hill.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I've just put a bit more effort into the article. I've added a bit about accommodation and I've put in more website links. It all starts to add up. I should also like to add a paragraph about the cup-and-ring stone which is historically important, I'm told, and deserves a mention.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also deserving a mention is WK's good results in the "Scotland in Bloom" competition each year. Another annual venture is the Scarecrow Festival which gets the local schoolchildren enthusiastically involved.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It may take some time for the Wikipedia article to achieve the level of professionalism that, I deduce, you are looking for. However, if we keep plugging away, and aiming high, we shall get there!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I still haven't got my head around all the editing tools, though!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<p>Hi Avril - I'm continuing the discussion in a new section, as the old one has become too cumbersome to edit.</p>
<p>Oh, I <b>do</b> have happy memories of the primary school too, and I think it probably was a good basic education. The bullying wasn't bad enough to make me afraid of going to school. I did get on better with the other "English" pupils, as we had a shared feeling of being outsiders. I remember my best friend was Peter Cook, but his parents packed him off to a boarding prep school at a horribly early age. I was much happier at Ardrossan Academy, partly because the so-called "11-plus" eliminated 90% of the bullying, and partly because I found all the new subjects (science, maths, Latin, foreign languages) really thrilling and exciting.</p>
<p>I'm not going to say much more about the WK page here, as that discussion should really be on the WK talk page, where other editors can also contribute. But you'll no doubt have noticed that (about 2 weeks ago) I copied <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">User:Dave souza</a>'s photo to the <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seamill.html" title="Seamill">Seamill</a> page, with a view to replacing it with something else on the WK page. I'd like to see a wide panoramic view at the top, probably taken from Law Hill. It would be perfect for display like this one:</p>
<div class="thumb" style="margin: 5px; clear: both;">
<div style="overflow: auto; overflow-x: scroll; width: 98%;"><a href="../../../p/a/u/Image%7EPauliyas_Hongkong.jpg_053c.html" class="image" title="A panorama of Hong Kong"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/4/46/Pauliyas_Hongkong.jpg/1500px-Pauliyas_Hongkong.jpg" alt="A panorama of Hong Kong" width="1500" height="206" longdesc="../../../p/a/u/Image%7EPauliyas_Hongkong.jpg_053c.html" /></a></div>
</div>
<div class="thumbcaption" style="margin: 5px; font-size:90%">A panorama of <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a></div>
<p>I quite fancy one of those Panoscan cameras, but they cost about US$38,000! But it might be possible to do something similar with a high-resolution digital SLR camera, a wide-angle lens, and cropping off most of the top and bottom of the pic -- or more likely, having to "stitch" a few images together with suitable software.</p>
<p>Yes, it was me who added the pics. You can easily see that by clicking the "history" tab at the top of the WK page. I think the Wiki software is really good - from the "history" page you can see who has edited the page, and when, what changes they made, look at <b>any</b> previous version of the page, compare <b>any</b> two versions of the page, look at any contributor's user or talk page, or examine all the edits they've made. So if you really don't like someone, you can go through the list and revert all his edits! (in fact, this is sometimes necessary to deal with vandalism)</p>
<p>OK, time for some more of Neil's editing tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>It looks to me like you're editing the whole page each time, by clicking on the edit tab at the top of the page. It's much, much easier to edit just one section at a time (just click on the "[edit]" to the right of each section heading). Also safer, as it reduces the risk of an edit conflict if someone else is editing the page at the same time (actually the Wiki software is very good at resolving edit conflicts when they do happen, but they can still be a nuisance).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It's good practice to provide an edit summary (in the little long box below the main edit box) so that people can see what you've been doing. If you're editing a section, the Wiki software will fill in the name of the section for you, but you should still add an edit summary of your own (and the software will complain if you don't, whether you're editing the whole page or just a section).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You forgot to "sign" your contribution again! Tsk, tsk, naughty girl!</li>
</ul>
<p>Kind regards, and good luck with your editing,<br />

<dl>
<dd>Dear Neil</dd>
<dd>Thank you, again.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm glad you have survived WK Primary School so very well. I think you must have been in the other "intake" from me, although they were merged at some point. Was it in Miss MacGregor's year, perhaps? The "11-Plus" was called "the Quali" in Scotland, short for "the Qualifying Examination". An example of "the Belt" is displayed in WK Museum. Many of us recall being at the receiving end of "the Belt". Were you, like me, in Miss Barclay's class? A very amusing book could be written about that!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry you found there was anti-English bias in WK. In fact, there were a lot of English families living in West Kilbride. Many of them came to WK to work at the large ICI plant (Nobel Division) at Ardeer, Stevenston. Perhaps that's what brought your family here.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On with the editing. I've been at the article again with my scalpel, as you may see. Hope that's all right. I know you don't think the article is all that good yet. But I think it compares well with those for other comparable towns.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And that brings me to an important point. I think WK is wrongly categorised as a North Ayrshire village. It is, surely, a North Ayrshire <b>town</b>. The new strap-line for WK is "Craft Town Scotland". It's confusing, I know, because, around here, West Kilbride is known as "the Village". For example, if one says someone lives in "the Village", one means that they live in West Kilbride, rather than Seamill or Portencross. However, the population is increasing rapidly and there are now some 6,000 people living in the WK area (including Seamill and Portencross). So, I would categorise WK as a town and Seamill and Portencross as villages.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately, the local politicians are trying to stamp out Seamill, in the mistaken assumption that, if you abolish Seamill, West Kilbride will gain a higher profile. There's an inverted snobbery here, also, because property values in Seamill are a bit higher than those in West Kilbride. Signage, as you drive into Seamill, now reads "West Kilbride incorporating Seamill". It's all very silly. Seamill has a somewhat different <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sense_of_place.html" title="Sense of place">sense of place</a> from West Kilbride, and always has done. (Note how the phrase <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sense_of_place.html" title="Sense of place">sense of place</a> shows here in blue!) Seamill is different from West Kilbride, just as Leith is different from Edinburgh. This is a <b>good</b> thing, I believe!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On the subject of editing, I have taken the liberty of deleting the bit about the vandals at WK station. I don't think this is a point worth making. Readers can deduce from the mention of CCTV and the mobile police station that there's a problem with security at the station.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also don't think the point about six hairdressers is worth making. A lot of shops have come and gone in West Kilbride, over the years. High-quality butchers, family grocers, lovely wee sweetie-shops, dress-shops, shoe-shops, retailers of every kind, the Grand Central Cafe, the Roxy Picture House - all gone. <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic_transit_gloria_mundi.html" title="Sic transit gloria mundi">Sic transit gloria mundi</a>! But every town has the same problem. The advent of supermarkets has put countless small shops out of business, all over the UK. In West Kilbride, however, the local preople decided to do something to re-generate the village (town?) and, as a result, West Kilbride Craft Town was born.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Grand Central Cafe was an important piece of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_deco.html" title="Art deco">art deco</a> which was underestimated, overlooked, fell to bits and, eventually, was razed to the ground. (Nardini's in Largs is currently in the balance. Very, very sad!)</dd>

<dd>Back to editing. Thank you for all your editing lessons. I'm afraid I find the Wikipedia editing tools very fiddly. However, if I persevere, I may get there. I still can't see how to add a signature. (Sorry!) I wish I had chosen a more anonymous screen-name. Can I change that?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for the photos. A great step forward. Yes, a panoramic shot would be lovely! I have some photos of WK, Seamill and Portencross that you may want to use. How can I send these to you? What's this Wikimedia Commons I see mentioned?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is a nice program, freely available on the Internet, called www.slide.com. You can make nice slide presentations of your pics and incorporate them in your web-site. Goodbye to boring, static presentations! YouTube, as you know, is a good way of showing videos. (But you know all this, of course, because you are technically very adept. Much more so than me!)</dd>

<dd>I can't remember the names of any of my teachers there, tho' the name MacGregor does ring a bell. I do remember Mr Rutherford, the head teacher, though. I remember we had a new, young teacher in P6 or P7 who my mother thought was very good -- she taught us how to play chess, among other things, was that Miss Barclay? She bought a brand-new Mini as soon as it came out -- I wonder how many young teachers nowadays could afford a brand-new car (unless married to a rich spouse)?</dd>

<dd>Yes, my Dad was a research scientist at Ardeer. He took early retirement from ICI (but only a couple of years off his normal retirement) to look after my mother, who had cancer.</dd>

<dd>Yes, fine to delete the bit about vandals, in fact anything that isn't either common knowledge or can be cited to reliable sources can be deleted as far as I'm concerned. I too thought that the population of WK was around 6,000, but I replaced it in the article by the actual 2001 census figure. I doubt the population has increased to 6,000 in only 5/6 years, especially since the 2001 census showed a <b>fall</b> from the 1991 census. A good example of why I keep banging on about the need to cite reliable sources!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Another point to watch in this sort of article is "peacock phrases" (see <a href="../../../p/e/a/WP%7EPEACOCK_4025.html" title="WP:PEACOCK">WP:PEACOCK</a>). For example, "fine bowling club". Much better to <i>show</i> why it's a fine bowling club. I think we need to be careful that the article doesn't read like a tourist brochure. It's now much better than most other small-town articles, but we've still got some work to do to bring it up to <a href="../../../g/o/o/WP%7EGOOD_ad34.html" title="WP:GOOD">WP:GOOD</a> status.</dd>

<dd>Sad to hear about the Grand Central Café, had fond memories of that place (even tho' I don't much like Art Deco architecture, I still think it should be preserved). I seem to remember it was pretty much dead by the 1990s anyway.</dd>

<dd>I think the go-ahead young teacher you have referred to was called Mrs Taplow (or Tapley?). I was taught by her on only one occasion when our teacher, Miss Hogg, was off sick. I remember that Mrs Taplow used to throw the wooden board-duster at pupils if she thought their concentration was drifting. (How things change!) She may have found that an effective way to make pupils sit up. The Headmaster in succession to Mr Rutherford was Mr Parker. His wife taught domestic skills such as cooking, sewing and knitting to girls. (Were the boys taught woodwork or something like that? I can't remember.)</dd>

<dd>Sadly, the old WK Primary School was burned down by vandals (them again!) about 25 to 30 years ago. It was replaced by a new primary school which looks very smart and business-like. Not as venerable and traditional as our Victorian school, though. Apparently, its classes are open-plan now, with the emphasis on play rather than discipline. Pupils wear lovely, red sweaters with "West Kilbride Primary School" and a heraldic shield emblazoned on the front in black outline.</dd>

<dd>There was play, as well as discipline, at WK Primary School when we were there. I remember playing <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peever.html" title="Peever">peevers</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marbles.html" title="Marbles">marbles</a>, <a href="../../../y/o/-/Yo-yo.html" title="Yo-yo">yo-yos</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conkers.html" title="Conkers">conkers</a> in the playground, eating <a href="../../../s/o/o/Soor_ploom.html" title="Soor ploom">soor plooms</a> surreptitiously in class, trying to chat in class without getting caught, and so on. The belt was always lurking in the teachers desk, ready to warm the fingers of chatty people who got caught.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Although, the belt may seem barbaric to our <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politically_correct.html" title="Politically correct">politically correct</a> age, we were all in the same boat, and out-going pupils found it gave opportunities to show off their derring-do and devil-may-care approach to life. Nowadays, youngsters seem to think <a href="../../../a/s/b/ASBO_855d.html" title="ASBO">ASBOs</a> are a badge of honour. So, maybe the world doesn't really change that much, after all.</dd>

<dd>I note what you say about peacock terms. From the point of view of literary style, I agree with you. Mindless value judgments do seem - er, mindless. However, if you are writing about something you don't actually know much about, it's not so easy. Thus, just describing the WK Bowling Club as a bowling club doesn't tell the reader very much. I could say that the WK Bowling Club looks prosperous, well landscaped, well manicured and that it has a sizeable membership. But that doesn't seem like the objective, academic approach either. That's why I described it as a fine bowling club. That tells the reader something at least - i.e. it's not a bottom-of-the-range bowling club. At one point, I described the WK Golf Club as an "18-hole golf club". Someone (presumably you) changed that to "championship golf club". That was better, because a championship golf club would have 18 holes, by definition.</dd>

<dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I can see there's a conflict of goals here. For one thing, Wikipedia wants to encourage people (like me) to get going and not to feel utterly inhibited. On the other hand, they want Wikipedia to be a well-respected work. Rather like "The Times" used to be revered as a "journal of public record". (Is it now? Maybe not, since Mr Murdoch got his hands on it.) Can an amateur, collaborative work also be regarded as a professional work? I'd say it can fulfil a valuable role - but, also, that one needs to keep a pinch of salt at the ready.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Accordingly, I'll write a line or two about the Roman remains in Seamill, and anyone with more information can brush that up some time. I think it's better to get this written down, rather than to risk the local knowledge being lost or forgotten. The archaeological records must exist somewhere. But where?</dd>

<dd>You and I shouldn't be too hard on ourselves, perhaps. University professors tell me that students nowadays consider their own views to be as weighty as those of the leading authorities in their subject. Magritte's urinal, Tracy Emin's unmade bed, the BT telephone directory - all these are ground-breaking works of art. Clearly, a cat may look at a king. So, we can too.</dd>

<dd>A piece of bright news about West Klbride. Some more of the empty shops have been purchased by the Moffat Trust for restoration and conversion into more craft studios. So, the upgrading of the Main Street (now a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservation_area.html" title="Conservation area">conservation area</a>, I believe) is growing apace. Craft Town Scotland really is looking up!</dd>

<dd>I know that Wikipedia isn't meant to be an advertisement for West Kilbride. But I do think we should be presenting the town in a positive light, where appropriate. There are plenty of good things to say about WK. There is a kernel of worthy citizens who work tirelessly to make WK a good place in which to live. Watering flower-baskets in summer. Running clubs and societies in winter. Public-spirited people like that should be encouraged!</dd>

<p><s>Hi</s> Evenin' Avril!</p>
<p>New section again, to keep things manageable. So many points to deal with, so I'll try to deal with them in the order you mention.</p>
<p>I don't know of any way to change your Wiki name, but it's easy enough just to set up a new account. Speaking personally, I'd rather you didn't, as changing identities makes it harder to keep track of who said/did what, but it's your choice, of course. Some less scrupulous people,known as <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppetry_eb4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppetry">sock puppets</a>, set up lots of different accounts pretending to be different people in order to impose their views on certain articles, but I'm sure you wouldn't do that!</p>
<p>Yes, in principle you could e-mail me any pics you think worthwhile, but I'd rather you held off that for a few days, as I need to do some rather tedious housekeeping on my e-mail account first. However, you could always have a go at uploading pics yourself -- just click the "upload file" link on the left and feel your way. BUT if you do upload pics, I <b>do</b> recommend that you upload them to "Commons", rather than just the English Wiki.</p>
<p>What is "Commons"? Well, on most articles (but sadly not WK!) you'll see a box on the left headed "other languages" -- if you click on say, French, then you get the French version of the same article, which forms part of the French wikipedia. In general, the foreign-language wikis are completely separate from each other, including from the English wiki. In particular, that means the bit at the top with your account name, "my preferences", etc will disappear when you look at the French wiki, unless you've previously set up an account on the French wiki. (I also have an account on the Spanish wiki, but haven't used it much, yet.) But photos don't care much about language, so there's yet another wiki called "Commons" whose sole purpose is to hold photos, videos, and other language-independent stuff. Pics on there are automatically available to <b>all</b> the different language wikis. It's also easier to manage your pics there, as you get a "gallery" tab on your user page, from which you can see all the pics you've uploaded. There are also facilities to put pics in different categories, to make it easier to find what you're looking for. It's just much nicer for handling your photos, and you get the benefit of making it available to all the different language wikis. BUT in order to use Commons, you MUST first set up your own account on the Commons wiki (the picture tutorial doesn't make this requirement clear).</p>
<p>Re pics, it's very important to be aware of copyright. Basically you can only put stuff on Commons that is freely available for anyone to re-use (though it's OK to specify a limited number of conditions, such as that the copyright must be credited to the original holder, and that the same conditions apply to any re-use). There's loads of detail in the help sections on copyright. All the pics I've used so far have been taken from the geograph web site, which satisfies the copyright conditions. If you've taken the photos yourself, there shouldn't be a problem as long as you're willing to make them available under a free copyright licence.</p>
<p>So I'd encourage you to have a go at uploading pics to Commons while I'm sorting out my e-mail. Once it's on Commons, it's not too difficult to get it into an article -- see <a href="../../../p/i/c/Wikipedia%7EPicture_tutorial_cbf3.html" title="Wikipedia:Picture tutorial">Wikipedia:Picture tutorial</a>. I recommend making plenty of use of the "Show preview" button so you can experiment with the sizing and positioning of your pic(s), and so that you can get a "feel" for how it works. (and you should also <b>always</b> specify "thumb" among the image parameters, by the way). Or you could always ask me to put it in for you.</p>
<hr />
<p>I can't be sure about the name Taplow or Tapley. I think Tapley is more likely, but I just can't remember. Do you remember that incident when I was run over by a car on the A78 at the top of Merlewood Road, and spent 10 hugely enjoyable days in Kilmarnock Royal Infirmary? I was knocked unconscious and couldn't remember anything about that accident either! No, we definitely weren't taught any woodwork (which makes me wonder what we <b>were</b> doing when the girls were doing sewing, etc!). But we boys did do metalwork and woodwork at Ardrossan Academy when the girls did "domestic science". Can you remember the names of any of the other teachers there? Maybe that might jog my memory.</p>
<p>Not sure what "peevers" was/were, but I do remember all the other games you mention. Click your link, and you get Peever, South Dakota -- not as good an article as our wee town! (But a good example of how NOT to use numeric data.) Boys used to play football, of course, and I was always terrible at team games (always used to get picked near the end of the line-ups at the start of games, but I wasn't the absolute worst). I hated team games, but quite enjoyed other sports. My Dad and I used to go skiing in Glencoe at weekends (staggeringly beautiful scenery). Used to play badminton in the Overton church hall -- I'll never forget that evening when Raymond Black came in and announced that president Kennedy had been shot.</p>
<p>I think the best attitude to Wikipedia is not to feel inhibited. If you don't get it quite right, someone else will be along sooner or later to improve it. It's a bit like a free market -- prices can temporarliy be wrong, but will eventually find the right level. On the Stock Market, if you can identify a company that's hugely over- or under-valued, you will make a fortune. We just have to content ourselves with a bit of kudos for improving articles. Eventually it will be better than any commercial encyclopedia. I left the bit about "fine bowling club" in as an aide-memoire for something that can be improved. Maybe they won all their matches last year, or we can find a quote (in a reliable source, of course!) from the chairman of the Scottish Bowling Federation that it's the friendliest club he's ever seen. Something like that anyway.</p>
<p>I think the discipline of citing everything to reliable source is extremely valuable in keeping dodgy facts out of articles, and making what does go in more interesting and useful. It makes for a little extra work, of course, but the result is worth it. I think the present "transport" section is a huge improvement on the old version that said "probably the easiest way of getting to WK is ..." It's amazing what you can do with nothing but published sources. You might have noticed that I set up a stub article for James Miller the architect, to avoid the disambiguation page from the WK article. Click on the link to have a look -- yet I knew absolutely nothing about him!</p>
<p>Interestingly, you don't need to be too worried about negative aspects, I think. For instance, Belfast used to be terribly ashamed of its part in building the <i>Titanic</i>. Nowadays it has a whole tourist industry based around its most famous ship! What about that horrible, gruesome murder on WK railway station (c.1990 IIRC)? Just a thought. In the end, it's always best to be honest, and accurate.</p>
<p>Kind regards from<br />

<dd>Good evening, Neil!</dd>
<dd>Thank you for your lengthy reply. I do appreciate all the trouble you take. Like you, I would like this article to be really good. We must persevere!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>No, I don't remember your getting knocked down on the A78. Thank goodness you pulled through all right! The A78 is now a rather busy road. It has turned Seamill into a mere <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commuter_belt.html" title="Commuter belt">commuter belt</a>, without much sense of community. That is why Seamill will always be a mere <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satellite.html" title="Satellite">satellite</a> of WK. (Not a <a href="../../../u/f/o/UFO_9768.html" title="UFO">UFO</a>. That's a different story!) If you look at old photos of Seamill, you will see groups of people strolling up the Kinning Brae - i.e. up the middle of the A78. In those days, the only real traffic hazard would have been a very occasional bolting horse.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Even in my own time, I remember pedestrians strolling through West Kilbride, treating Ritchie Street and Main Street as if they were one large pedestrian precinct. You wouldn't do that nowadays!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Peevers" is a <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playground_game.html" title="Playground game">playground game</a> very similar to <a href="../../../h/o/p/Hopscotch.html" title="Hopscotch">hopscotch</a>, but not identical to it. I should have clicked on the blue link to make sure Wikipedia had got the right "peever". But I omitted to do so. Sorry! (Never assume, as they say.) Games were seasonal. Conkers came round in autumn, for example. Exchanging scraps was another girls' game. One traded up to get a good collection - say, of <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angels.html" title="Angels">angels</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cherubs.html" title="Cherubs">cherubs</a> (<a href="../../../c/h/e/Cherubim.html" title="Cherubim">cherubim</a>!)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Fancy you remembering Ray Black telling you that <a href="../../../j/f/k/JFK_e817.html" title="JFK">JFK</a> had been shot! The <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_media.html" title="Mass media">mass media</a> mean that, in our time, such events resonate round the world in a flash. We are all present as history is in the making!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Back to our article. If you look at the equivalent for, say, <a href="../../../l/a/r/Largs.html" title="Largs">Largs</a>, you will see there's a box in the top-right corner, giving a little thumbnail sketch. We need that too. But I don't know how to do it, yet. Over to you, perhaps.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have at last seen the bit in Toolbox called "Upload file". Why didn't I see that before? Yes, I have some photos that may be helpful. I'll start uploading them soon. The better illustrated the article is, the more impressive it will be.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>At the weekend, I asked my sister is she knows anything about Helen Keller's stay in WK. She says a now deceased family friend, Mr Furlong, knew about it. Mr Furlong was a very responsible person - the sort to be very sure of his facts. But, how this story can be verified now, I don't know. That's a pity. Because, if it can be proved, it's a West Kilbride story well worth the telling.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>During WW2, the <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emperor.html" title="Emperor">Emperor</a> Haile Salassie (spelling?) stayed in Wemyss Bay (or was it Skelmorlie?), just up the coast. That's an established fact - easily checked on <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a>. John Lennon's Uncle Stanley lives in Largs. Kevin Stacey has relatives in Saltcoats. All true! (Oh, dear. I'm digressing!)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When we were children, a boy from Glasgow named Christopher Whyte came for a holiday in Seamill. He pretended to be a European princeling escaping from his father's enemies, in a storyline worthy of Enid Blyton's "Famous Five". How disappointed I was when I found it was mere fantasy! (Well, if Haile Salassie could stay in Skelmorlie, why couldn't a European princeling come to Seamill?) Now Chris Whyte has found fame as an award-winning author and writer of gay poetry in Gaelic. The child is, indeed, father to the man! (No-one has written him up on Wikipedia, though, it would seem!)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for giving James Miller (architect) the recognition he deserves. Sadly, WK Station is not in the shape James Miller would have envisaged. The quaint bothy where the unfortunate girl was murdered some years ago has been demolished (shame!) and replaced by a memorial garden.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Did you compile the article about James Miller (architect) on Wikipedia? Amazing! I don't think it was there before. Or did I just overlook it!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Kirktonhall House, in the centre of WK, needs to be written about. And there are weavers' cottages lining Ritchie Street which are worthy of note.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We could also have a section on "vanished buildings", recalling the Grand Central Cafe, the Roxy Picture House, the old mills which stood close to the centre of town, Crosbie Towers. All these were important landmarks in their time. Part of WK's history.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Then there are other extant buildings, such as Carlung House, which are significant.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As I said before, WK's good results in Scotland in Bloom and the annual Scarecrow Festival should be included, I'd say. I'll try to find something to write about them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I strongly feel WK needs to be categorised as a <b>town</b>, rather than as a village. If you look at the other places in Ayrshire that are "villages", you will see that they are, typically, small and comparatively unimportant. They may have other redeeming virtues, such as <a href="../../../p/i/c/Picturesque.html" title="Picturesque">picturesqueness</a>, of course. So, I suggest that we move WK to the "Ayrshire towns" category, leaving Seamill and Portencross in the "Ayrshire villages" category.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I found a bit on Google about WK's submission for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservation_area.html" title="Conservation area">conservation area</a> status. However, I can't confirm that the bid was successful. I shall have to find out!</dd>
</dl>

<p>Just to let you know I've started using the WK talk page. Writing style there will be quite formal, as it's addressed to anyone who might be looking at the WK page, and the subject matter there will be strictly confined to the WK page.</p>
<p>I may copy some of your remarks above (obviously, none of the personal stuff) there as a starting point for discussion, if that's OK with you (feel free to do so yourself, of course).</p>
<p>Will reply later to your message above. Time for bed now!<br />

<p>A tag has been placed on Christopher Whyte, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under the <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#Articles" title="WP:CSD">criteria for speedy deletion</a>, because it is a very short article providing little or no context to the reader. Please see <a href="../../../s/t/u/Wikipedia%7EStub_72af.html#Essential_information_about_stubs" title="Wikipedia:Stub">Wikipedia:Stub</a> for our minimum information standards for short articles. Also please note that articles must be on <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notable</a> subjects and should provide references to <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a> that <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verify</a> their content.</p>
<p>Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself. If you plan to expand the article, you can request that <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">administrators</a> wait a while for you to add contextual material. To do this, affix the template <b><code>{{<a href="../../../h/a/n/Template%7EHangon_38a0.html" title="Template:Hangon">hangon</a>}}</code></b> to the page and state your intention on the article's <a href="../../../t/a/l/Help%7ETalk_page_601e.html" title="Help:Talk page">talk page</a>. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this. <span style="background-color: #EECCFF;"><a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatyrTN_0a7c.html" title="User:SatyrTN">SatyrTN</a> <span style="font-size: smaller;">(<a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatyrTN_2573.html" title="User talk:SatyrTN">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SatyrTN_f368.html" title="Special:Contributions/SatyrTN">contribs</a>)</span></span> 15:40, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, Avril! To request that an article be written, visit <a href="../../../r/a/_/WP%7ERA_a7f5.html" title="WP:RA">Requested Articles</a>. You can add Christopher to the list, and if anyone has the time and inclination, they'll be able to write up an article. As a general rule, Wikipedia will delete any pages that are basically empty - it's to keep clutter down. Thanks for writing! -- <span style="background-color: #EECCFF;"><a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatyrTN_0a7c.html" title="User:SatyrTN">SatyrTN</a> <span style="font-size: smaller;">(<a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatyrTN_2573.html" title="User talk:SatyrTN">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SatyrTN_f368.html" title="Special:Contributions/SatyrTN">contribs</a>)</span></span> 16:25, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
