<p>Avi; do what u think is right. i dont know what wikipedia prefers. it would seem to me that the power of wikipedia is wikilinks. it provides a 3rd dimension to the written word. people dont know everything; it is helpful to click on a link for greater insight. as a case in point, i didnt know what a "columbāria' was. so i had to go to the dictionary. furthermore, a lot of words get passed over because they are common words, like "mutual assurance", but the key issue is what does wikipedia want? you are a lot more experienced than i am. so do what is right. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosephbrophy_bede.html" title="User:Josephbrophy">joe</a> 16:57, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The best rule of thumb is to follow wiki's own rules, which we all learn as we go along, and all are subject to change based on consensus&#160;:). The one in question is <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECONTEXT_5f0d.html" title="WP:CONTEXT">WP:CONTEXT</a>. The first entry of most terms that add context to the article like "insurance" or "reinsurance" should be wikilinked. "Money", "family", or "band", in my opinion, shouldn't be linked, as they do not add to the context of the article (and would likely not be footnoted in a paper version). I'm very thankful that you are adding your prodigious work to the article; remember no one <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">owns</a> an article, although certain editors may "adopt" an article and maintain it.

<p>...but, and I'm sure this is far from the first and last instance[oh, the bigotry that tags along with free speech sometimes], the article on Ari Fleischer has been a recent target of somewhat blatant anti-semitic remarks; as I saw your page and it said you were a member of the judaism wikiproject as well as an rc patroller, I thought perhaps you would be receptive to either watching it or taking some action to protect this page, as I'm not an accounted wikipedian and am somewhat unaware of what to do in these situations. Here's the diff: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ari_Fleischer&amp;diff=61079846&amp;oldid=61079650" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ari_Fleischer&amp;diff=61079846&amp;oldid=61079650" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ari_Fleischer&amp;diff=61079846&amp;oldid=61079650</a>.</p>
<p>The way I figure it, regardless of whatever one's political beliefs or views of the man, the fact that he's jewish should not, in any way, be held against him; moreover, the wikipedia article shows up as the fourth item on google for Ari Fleischer, and with all the nonsense in the media about wikipedia we don't need anti-semitism added to the list, I believe. 24.13.8.214 02:36, 29 June 2006 (UTC) russ.</p>

<p>Hi Avraham,</p>
<p>I also consider myself a stickler for grammer and I am wondering if you can help me out with a silly question. In a list, does a comma come before and? For example xxx, xxx, xxx, xxx, and xxx or does it go xxx, xxx, xxx and?</p>

<dd>Hello, Guy. Actually, both are valid constructions. It is called a "serial comma". I have the CMOS at work, not home, so I cannot give you the specific chapter, but the Chicago Manual of style DOES recommed putting the serial comma in. See here: <a href="http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/cmosfaq.Commas.html" class="external free" title="http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/cmosfaq.Commas.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/cmosfaq.Commas.html</a> (especially the one about Mother Theresa and the pope)&#160;:-) Hope that helps. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 04:12, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

(i hope and pray) 2. i have a few other sources and i am trying to track the original articles. 3. the structure of the current article doesnt look like anything else in the universe, as best i can tell 4. but facts are facts.. 5. i have a lot more material on Flood since i have read his books - and my observations as an irish musician will be original. when i get time i will begin entering it the article. 6. i also have original pictures that i have taken. my picture of the memorial in enniscorthy is not good enough for my standards. 7. i will probably have to fly over to wexford and take better pictures. also i need to find where his correspndence is being archived. because i want to comment on some of it. 8. i also have one of his old old books, with his picture on it. I have to find out if i can use that picture. bt of course i can get others without copyright infringements. 9. the long and short of all this is that grattan was a world class genius and his contributions were enormous. but, according to his son, he was a shy person, not seeking glory. 10.i have tried to make the article neutral, although other folks praise him effusively <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosephbrophy_bede.html" title="User:Josephbrophy">joe</a> 03:53, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have no doubt they have international operations and I see no major similarly in agenda to AIPAC or the others. Although the ADL probably has some overlap with regards to fighting anti-Semitism. My insertion of the term American was always immediately adjacent to the term non-profit and I did not try to emphasize that they only operated in the US. I notice that the ADL handles this by saying that the ADL was founded in the United States and has many offices in the US and in three other countries. This was a minor point though and it was only because it was blindly reverted along with my inclusion of informaton on the founder and removal of OR linkage to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Anti-Semitism_4332.html" title="New Anti-Semitism">New Anti-Semitism</a> that is has been brought up here.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">AeroPress article</span></h2>
<p>You deleted the [{AeroPress]] article for being nonsense, which it appeared to be. I sometimes scan the [:Category:Candidiates for speedy deletion]] listings to see if there is anything that I can salvage. It turns out that the original author's claim "This is an awesome machine for making coffee" may be true. AeroPress (in this context) is a new type of coffee maker from Aerobie, Inc. of Palo Alto, California. See <a href="http://aerobie.com/Products/aeropress_story.htm" class="external free" title="http://aerobie.com/Products/aeropress_story.htm" rel="nofollow">http://aerobie.com/Products/aeropress_story.htm</a></p>
<p>Is this technology notable enough to warrant an article in Wikipedia? I'm not sure, but you might want to undelete the AeroPress article and turn it into a stub (or a full article) about the coffee maker if you think it would be worthwhile. Another AeroPress, <a href="http://www.aeropress.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.aeropress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aeropress.com/</a> , is a web design and hosting company that is probably not notable by Wikipedia standards.

<dd>The author, or yourself, is more than welcome to recreate the article, add something more somewhat more substantial than "cool coffee machine," and run with that. I won't delete it reflexively again, but as it stood, it was not even stubworthy. The links I checked that came out of the <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerobie.html" title="Aerobie">Aerobie</a> article about Alan Adler made no referene to the AeroPress, which also added to my decision. I don't think an undeletion is called for, but recreation with valid content is certainly an option.

<p>Hello, my name is Jared Eimicke and I have recently created an account on your website using the name Knickf2j. I created an article called "Jizzfest" on July 8th. A "random updater" on the same day went on the talk section of my page and cited it as "patent nonsense" and suggested it should be deleted. Shortly afterwards, it was, by you.</p>
<p>Jizzfests are parties that I actually do host, and have become famous amongst many in my tiny hometown of Metuchen, NJ. Many people are constantly asking me about them, and I figured it would be fun and informative to create an article on Wikipedia, so everyone could look at it. The random updater also seemed to think my article was some kind of self-promotion. I suppose I could see how one could interpret it that way, however that was definitely not my intention, and if the page was put back on, then I wouldn't hesitate to edit the article in order to limit self-promotion if necessary. I spent a lot of my time creating the article, and it would mean a lot to me if you could find it in your hearts to allow the article on your site. Many people in my town would be grateful. So in summary, please let me, user Knickf2j, continue to update and oversee the creation of the recently deleted on July 8th article "Jizzfest." Thanks a lot for your time. If you need to you can contact me at jeimicke@syr.edu</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">apartheid wall</span></h2>
<p>1) What does the RFA have to do with including apartheid wall in the disambig page?</p>
<p>2) I can AGF but that doesn't change the fact that no credible reason has been given for removing the link. Homey 15:49, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Isn't the entire subject of apartheid as it relates to non-SOuth-African countries under a RfAR? Also, doesn't the fact that <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_Israeli_apartheid_c912.html" title="Allegations of Israeli apartheid">Allegations of Israeli apartheid</a> is listed on the page, and Apartheid Wall is mentioned prominently in that article, make adding it to the disamb redundant?

Is the idea to list every example of every allegation of every type of action referred to as apartheid on that page? What about civil unions and same-sex marriage laws?

She is far more familiar with how disambig pages work with either of us. Homey 19:33, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>And there actually is no section in <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_Israeli_apartheid_c912.html" title="Allegations of Israeli apartheid">Allegations of Israeli apartheid</a> on the separation barrier as apartheid wall.

<p>As for AGF, I am trying, but it is frustrating that as soon as one of your claims (ie RFA) for why the article shouldn't be listed is dealt with you come up with another, and another, and another. Homey 19:37, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Homey, I respectfully request you read my initial paragraph completely. Both statements are there. I brought up two points,of which you only reponded to one. I will <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and presume that you were so positive about the RfAr, that you stopped reading and responded immediately.

<p>Your right, you did mention it, I just didn't see it.</p>
<p>In any case the mention of the wall is thirteen paragraphs into the article and is not accorded its own section. This doesn't strike me as especially prominent and the mention does not go into as much detail as the section on "apartheid wall" that the disambig page points to.Homey 19:45, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>My point remains in that are we to list every example of everything that is apartheid? There is nothing more special about the wall being an example of allegations of Israeli apartheid than the recent court decisions upholding the marriage laws in NY to be allegations of sexual apartheid. Apartheid as it relates to Israeli activity is listed in the disamb page. Anyone specifically interested in the wall will easily find it, wikilinked as well, in the Israeli article. I still feel that there is no need to specify ACTIONS on the disambiguation page. The purpose of the page is to make sure that someone entering "apartheid" gets to the article that they had in mind. Having <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegations_of_Israeli_apartheid_c912.html" title="Allegations of Israeli apartheid">Allegations of Israeli apartheid</a> more than serves that purpose, I believe -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 19:51, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It's obviously a phrase that is in wide use rather than a random reference. Homey 19:47, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Instead of reverting within five minutes can you just wait for Natalya to respond? And I actually did respond to your point on your talk page. "Apartheid wall" is in wide use, 452,000 hits on google. How many hits does apartheid in regards to same-sex marriage get?Homey 19:49, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry about the minor issues, my profile defaults to having minor edit checked. As for the former, the issues are there, but it makes no sense for a section whose primary purpose is apartheid to be in a non-apartheid article.

<p>I removed the section from my talk page as it was already on two other talk pages. The other problem with your rewrite was that it left only the criticisms of the term "apartheid wall" with none of the reasons for the description ie it was a very POV rewrite. Homey 21:00, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's no problem. I'm a former honorary secretary of the AUSA. As mentioned I have access to their diary which is a compilation of historical events from the AUSA's annual reports.

<p>Hi. I agreed with its deletion but I'm just wondering why you merged it into <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_transports_of_Heads_of_State_ddeb.html" title="Air transports of Heads of State">Air transports of Heads of State</a>? It seems to me there is a clear majority for renaming the article <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_transport_of_the_Royal_Family_and_executive_of_the_United_Kingdom_08db.html" title="Air transport of the Royal Family and executive of the United Kingdom">Air transport of the Royal Family and executive of the United Kingdom</a> (or some variation). Did you choose to ignore it or had you some other reason? I intend to create the article and create a {{main}} link at Air transports of Heads of State. Any objections?

<dl>
<dd>This was very redundant to the heads of state article, in that around 80% of the information in BFO was already in Heads of State, unlike the squadron article. The suggested name, IMO, seems very long and artificial, when we already have an article about Air transportation of various heads of state. What I would suggest is placing a {{<a href="../../../s/p/l/Template%7ESplitsection_1a39.html" title="Template:Splitsection">splitsection</a>}} tag in that section, and discussing it on the talk page, and polling for a consensus. At least, that is what I would do. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 21:00, 11 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But there is a consensus on the AFD listing. I know the title is a trainwreck, but it's important to note that the aircraft (past, present or future) are not for the sole use of the Royal Family or the executive, but both. So maintaining the standard of Air transport of.... Air transport of the Royal Family and executive of the United Kingdom is the shortest, most correct title available IMO. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark83_60bf.html" title="User:Mark83">Mark83</a> 21:07, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Aren't both the Prime Minister and the Queen considered heads of state?

Some say to heads of state, some to the squadron, some to the new article, and some do not make any mention of a title, which is why I merged it to the one that it most logically resembled, in my opinion. As I do not think there was a consensus on the name, I would suggest using the {{<a href="../../../s/p/l/Template%7ESplitsection_1a39.html" title="Template:Splitsection">splitsection</a>}} tag, and if no one makes a fuss on the talk page in a few days or so, go ahead and split it out. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 21:12, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're right, there isn't really a naming consensus. I've followed your split section discussion suggestion. And no, Queen is head of state, PM head of government. In theory the executive is entirely subservient to monarch, but of course in practice a monarch would never challenge a democratically elected government. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark83_60bf.html" title="User:Mark83">Mark83</a> 22:26, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Jews and Judaism- A single entity</span></h2>
<p>Hi there Avi. I noticed your comment concerning pursuing the idea that historically Jews and Judaism were not separate concepts, implying that Judaism encompasses more than the word religion would imply. Perhaps R'Hirsch would be of assistance in your rewrite:</p>
<ul>
<li>What the Torah wants to regulate is not only the thoughts and sentiments of man, but the whole of human existence- man's sensual impulses, his needs and desires, his individual life as well as that of his family, society and state. The Torah is the unique message of G-d addressed to Man in his totality.</li>
<li>"The name "religion" became fatal to the true understanding of the Torah because this name was given to it in complete defiance of the fact that the essence of the Torah is in complete contrast to what is usually known as religion and it's manifestations."(Volume I pages 184-187)</li>
</ul>
<p>And last but not least:</p>
<ul>
<li>"All analogies used to describe Judaism are defective. Judaism is not a religion, the synagogue is not a church and the rabbi is not a priest. Judaism is not a mere adjunct to life... Judaism comprises all of life. To be a Jew is the sum total of life's purpose.to be a Jew in the house of worship and in the kitchen, in the field and in the store, at the office..." etc. etc.(Volume VI page 122).</li>
</ul>
<p>I thought this implied that Judaism is more than "religion" because everything is generated from within Judaism, there really is no facet of Jewishness that falls outside its purview. This is opposed to the presentation of the Boyarin quote, which implied that Judaism is less than religion because outside influences are part of it. Anyway, just thought I would drop a line.

See our copyright page at <a href="http://www.lib.uiowa.edu/spec-coll/Users/copyright.html" class="external free" title="http://www.lib.uiowa.edu/spec-coll/Users/copyright.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lib.uiowa.edu/spec-coll/Users/copyright.html</a>, including the links to Gasaway and Hirtle.</p>
<p>By the way, ISBN numbers were not invented until the 1960-1970s, so the number you cite is probably an artifical addition by one of the current book sites. It was certainly not assigned in 1911!

<p>Wow! Thanks for that info - for a minute there I thought you wrote it all yourself! So, based on what you've kindly shown me, it seems that an "en dash" <i>is</i> appropriate as an interlocutor between birth and death dates, as it "connects things that are related to each other by distance". Does this mean I'm correct and Crz is...? With many thanks, <a href="../../../n/e/s/User%7ENesher_2ed4.html" title="User:Nesher">Nesher</a> 15:44, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you for your comments. I am still new and trying to find my feet! I have sourced the comment about fuel shortages. Thank you also for heeding my comments about the WP:OR. (Downs 16:24, 19 July 2006 (UTC))</p>

<p>Hi Avi. I see you've been rounding up more articles on these dubious little IQ clubs...I found two more here and here. I've put them up for AfD as well, but was thinking should we not somehow link all of the AfDs together, because the arguments for and against will be much the same?

<p>It was very ignorant to give a "strong delete" to the Chonga article. It is a true, widely-used term in south Florida. That should be enough. <a href="../../../t/a/m/User%7ETamajared_28b4.html" title="User:Tamajared">Tamajared</a> 01:38, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>when i logged on to wiki a few hours ago, about 5pm, maybe, i had a yelow or organge message indicating new mail. i clicked on it and was sent to a site that had some colored warning boxes. dont know the user name. the boxes indicated that i committed serious acts of vandalism, and that i was being blocked from using wiki.</p>
<p>the next thing i recall was being on a page where my user name and the search box was not there. after of few minutes i signed off. then i signed on and there was not new mail message, and i was able to edit.</p>
<p>have not a clue what happend to me. was it a fluke or an error or a trick. dont know. everything seems to be working fine right now. sorry to trouble you on nonsense. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosephbrophy_bede.html" title="User:Josephbrophy">joe</a> 03:52, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
