<h2><span class="mw-headline">Bookmakers</span></h2>
<p>I can see the logic of placing bookmakers as practicioners of outcomes of games of chance, as being appropriate in the context of actuaries' development as a profession. You seem to delete such references. Why? Many professions have evolved from different backgrounds, and the reference to mathematicians' involvement in chance outcomes seems to be proof that gambling practicioners preceeded the actuarial professionals. <a href="../../../t/a/y/User%7ETayana_a32c.html" title="User:Tayana">Tayana</a> 03:00, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Your response does not refute comment in context, but introduces "statistics" . Please explain clearly why I should not revert? <a href="../../../t/a/y/User%7ETayana_a32c.html" title="User:Tayana">Tayana</a> 00:42, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>--- The use of statistics is universal in most disciplines and is irrevelant to the current discussion. Here we are talking about chance outcomes; of life expectancy or winning an event. Bookmakers(directly) along with acturies(or their employers) have a finincial interest in the outcome of chance events. Accordingly the comparison is relevant. <a href="../../../t/a/y/User%7ETayana_a32c.html" title="User:Tayana">Tayana</a> 00:58, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Khalidi</span></h2>
<p>I'm being disingenuous? Correct me if I'm wrong: It seems you're trying to insert a prominent accusation that Khalidi denies Israel's right to exist, based solely on a statement saying that one has to understand from the Palestinians' perspective that they've been under occupation since 1948. Then you're wanting to say he's an anti-Zionist, apparently based on no more information. Can you explain these accusations? I'm not being disingenuous; I don't think it's appropriate. The bias here, incidentally, is in the implication that Khalidi is entirely opposed to Israel's existance. Of course, that would turn Khalidi into an extremist. I'm no expert on Khalidi, but I don't think he is such an extremist, or that there is any justification for trying to label him as such, or even that his critics really suggest or have evidence that that's what he is. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 17:15, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Avi, re your comment on my page, I looked over each of the sources, and I don't see anything to support calling him an anti-zionist. Rather, he seems to pretty much avoid discussing what Israel should be altogether. Of course, he does seem to argue that the Palestinians deserve a homeland, but that is, of course a very different thing. To call him an anti-zionist, we'd simply have to equate the two, but that's not for us to do, and I don't see anyone who has argued that this is appropriate in his case.</dd>

<dd>Also, you say Wikipedia can't have original synthesis, but that overstates anything I've seen in Wikipedia guidelines. No original research, yes, but you can't write a paragraph, encyclopedia or not, without synthesis. We can mask our own synthesis, and to a degree that's probably helfpul, but a factor is always going to be whether something makes basic sense, or else we'd have an encyclopedia of well-cited giberish. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 20:23, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I can't say we are happy with each other, but my 3RR report ended up with no blocks but warnings all around from Dmcdevit, and there is talk on the talkpage and no reverting (except once by Mackan who blundered in not having followed the 3RR page and was immediately and rather harshly blocked for 3 days, but he'll be back.) Anyway, you could leave it protected for a while (it is, I believe, the right version to protect) while we talk, or you could go ahead and unprotect now. Either way. I don't think anyone is going to be fast to revert.</p>
<p>I am lazy now to provide diffs, but really the talk page, starting with SlimVirgin's "Reverting" subhead shows the shift to discussion. <a href="../../../j/d/2/User%7EJd2718_bc8a.html" title="User:Jd2718">Jd2718</a> 03:37, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Avraham, I see why you protected the page, but the situation had just been dealt with by Dmcdevit. I'd guess people will actually probably be quicker to return to discussion if the page isn't protected. Also, there is other work I'd like to do on the page not relating to current disputes.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Is a radical circumcision a Jewish religious requirement?</span></h2>
<p>Avi ... I finally talked to a Mohel, and sounded like he does frenectomies about as often as might be expected in a US Hospital circ. He does them for the same problem, that is the newly (post circ) tightened shaft skin now pulls on the glans via the frenulum. Quick flick of the nail. "It looks better." "The penis may not heal properly otherwise" ... that was his main concern.</p>
<p>Sorry, lots of inflammatory language, but what do you think about this [<a href="http://www.covenantcircumcision.info/milah_vs_Periah.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.covenantcircumcision.info/milah_vs_Periah.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>]? Is Periah a "religous requirement"? Would Milah be sufficient? Isn't there a religous concern about doing harm?</p>
<p>We should cover this issue in the Topic.</p>
<p>We should also discuss the high rate of UTI infection that has been found post traditional ceremonies.</p>
<p>I assume you don't have a frenulum, because that's the only case where I could personally discount accounts of sexual harm from circ related frenectomies.</p>
<p>You know I think on average circs may not effect male sensation (in a net negative way). Cases of phimosis and frenulum breve and poor hygiene ... maybe 30% of uncirced guys have relatively poor sexual response. That might equal the guys that lost or suffered significant damage to their frenulums.</p>
<p>I think it's always bad for women.<a href="../../../t/i/p/User%7ETipPt_1698.html" title="User:TipPt">TipPt</a> 04:48, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think that it is good that you get notice.

<li>I beleive strongly in notice and the opportunity to be heard. I would of course provide notice without regard to position. Too bad the wiki-bot-wanks haven't worked out a way that this magically happens upon deletion.</li>

<li>I wish to further pursue this. From what I've seen Users in my position often go find an Admin that is willing to help them. That troubles me, as it's a somewhat lawless process. Is there a better way to get someone to review your refusal to help? Keep in mind that the DR is maybe a five day process.

<li>Hello again Avarham. I just wanted to get back to you on your advice concerning WP:ANI. I have carefully considered this and have decided not to pursue WP:ANI concerning notice to editors at this late stage. I am still convinced in the importance of notice and an opportunity to be heard for editors who work is threatened in deletion matters. But the current matter has gone through 2 AfD's and is in the second DR. I have been participating in DR discussion and without access to the actual article I don't see how ordinary editors could meaningfully participate. The discussion tends to shift to wankish policy backwaters that most editors, even if they care about an article, would not care to wade into. I guess I'll raise this issue earlier in the process when it again seems appropriate. In the mean time I'll slough through the DR as best as I can. Warm regards. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdivorce_959f.html" title="User:Edivorce">Edivorce</a> 04:55, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I noticed you gave me a warning about vandalism to <a href="../../../h/u/n/Huntley%2C_Illinois_c825.html" title="Huntley, Illinois">Huntley, Illinois</a>. Please tell me what vandalism you are refering to. If it's about the Pacific Islander status, the information is true, may be off by a little bit, but I just was tired of the area being marked Template:Islander when there are actually Pacific Islanders living in town. I will try to get an exact figure. The other thing was just a spelling error I fixed.</p>
<p>Additionally, I am a regular user with a real login, however I often forget to login. Please don't assume that I'm committed to vandalizing Wikipedia simply because I have a IP registered to <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Illinois_University_1574.html" title="Northern Illinois University">NIU</a>. I know about those people who were told by their professor to vandalize Wikipedia, but please don't assume that I am one of them. I love Wikipedia and I hate vandals and I even revert vandalism myself under this IP address. I also make great contributions to Wikipedia and I'd appreciate it if you would remove the warning status for something that is completely NOT vandalism.

I'VE ASKED YOU NOW FOUR TMES, each politely, if you'd be willing to unblock the page. An entire week has gone by, with you continuing to edit daily.

<p>Avi,</p>
<p>As you've doubtless seen, I've withdrawn. I've received many great comments, including some really good advice. I've thought about some of the comments left my those who opposed, and I found myself in agreement with some. Some more experience in other parts of Wikipedia would not be a bad idea. So I'm going to take some time and digest it all. I think I'll try again in future.</p>
