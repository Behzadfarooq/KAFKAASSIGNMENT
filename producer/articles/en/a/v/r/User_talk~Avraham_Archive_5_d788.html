<dd>According to David Albright of the <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulletin_of_the_Atomic_Scientists_059c.html" title="Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists">Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</a>, "Faced with sanctions, South Africa began to organize clandestine procurement networks in Europe and the United States, and it began a long, secret collaboration with Israel." although he goes on to say "A common question is whether Israel provided South Africa with weapons design assistance, although available evidence argues against significant cooperation." <sup id="_ref-name_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-name" title="">[1]</a></sup></dd>

</dl>
<p>Surely the larger quote is more accurate and representative of what he actually says in the paper, rather than a misrepresentative sentence fragment? The sentence fragment is not evidence against a joint programme but only applies to "weapons design assistance".</p>
<p>Secondly, why did you remove the fact that Chris McGreal wrote in the Guardian? That's a relevant fact regarding the credibility of the story; he did not self-publish his article.</p>
<p>Thirdly, why did you restore the sentence "Israeli ambassadors spoke publicly against racism in apartheid South Africa." despite the fact there are no citations that ambassadors did do such a thing?</p>
<p>Fourthly, why did you replace "Israel developed a relationship with <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> during the 1970s and 1980s." with "There are controversial claims that Israel developed a relationship with South Africa during the 1970s and 1980s."? Are you denying that Israel and South Africa did have a relationship during the 70s and 80s, against the many sources in the article? Do you have sources that claim this?</p>

<p>Dear Avi,</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help with the "Targeting ..." article. Its nice to find another wikipedian that is not anti-Israel.</p>
<p>In response to your comment about my referencing the blog, I agree with you that it is a WP: RS issue, but before I put the link to the blog, somebody deleted THE ENTIRE PARAGRAPH citing that he personally disliked the Herald Sun and that because the Herald Sun site did not include the pictures, he assumed that the pictures were phoney. That's the kind of reasoning that Holocaust deniers use. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a better link on the internet with the pictures than that blog. If you have any suggestions as to what to do, I'd appreciate the help. --<a href="../../../g/h/c/User%7EGHcool_11e1.html" title="User:GHcool">GHcool</a> 15:22, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>How are you going finding sources that show Israeli Ambassadors denounced apartheid during the regime?</p>
<p>And you never answered my question about using the full quote of David Albright. Again, why did you replace this</p>
<p>According to David Albright of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, "Faced with sanctions, South Africa began to organize clandestine procurement networks in Europe and the United States, and it began a long, secret collaboration with Israel." although he goes on to say "A common question is whether Israel provided South Africa with weapons design assistance, although available evidence argues against significant cooperation."</p>
<p>According to David Albright of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, "... available evidence argues against significant cooperation."</p>
<p>Surely the former is more accurate and complete, and the latter is rather misleading? <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeuterium_a36a.html" title="User:Deuterium">Deuterium</a> 02:23, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay, thanks for the update regarding the ambassador's vote at the UN. But even if you do confirm it, it does not support the general statement that many or some Israeli ambassadors denounced apartheid, just one. A single case does not make a trend.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, the section should be organized chronoligically. Given that the claims are that Israel developed a close relationship with SA during the 70s and 80s, a 1961 UN vote does not do much to refute that claim and should probably be placed before the discussion of nuclear and arms trading. <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeuterium_a36a.html" title="User:Deuterium">Deuterium</a> 01:19, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tip and Jake have differing POV's. Our job is to ensure that reliable and verifiably sourced material gets the proper fair representation based on the significance of the source.

Personal attacks are a much worse issue in my opinion, as editors who respect each other, even if they disagree, can often come to some acceptable comprimise, whereas editors who resort to <i>ad hominem</i> attacks and belittling their opponent and the opponent's viewpoint are often much more difficult to reason with.

Yes, Shmuel Katz is a former politician and belongs to the right wing part of the map. Many others, like Yehosuah Porat who is cited in the article, are also politicans - Porath was a member of an exteme left political party. Furthermore, the quotations are based on secondary sources, fully verified and reliable and objective. Furthermore, there are also citations that have nothing to do with Katz, for example Pipes, but Zero has vandalised them as well.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Jewishness</span></h2>
<p>Dear Avi,</p>
<p>I am not a crusader. I have not destroyed the lives of many innocent men and women while fighting for a cross.</p>
<p>I see that there are many good articles on Judaism and Jewish languages on wikipedia. I have read a fair few, and liked them. It would be a very fine thing if more articles of the sort were to be written; can you do your bit? (Or have you already?)</p>
<p>The comment on Lise Meitner was disturbing because I find this sort of tagging especially disturbing in her case. She had no wish to be Jewish. In all probability, she was not a coward; she simply could not sincerely describe herself as Jewish. What the Nazis did was an act of violence against her: they forced an identity onto her that she felt did not belong to her.</p>
<p>Of course, you may or may not wear outer signs that identify you as Jewish. That does not mean that you, or anybody minimally humane, would force somebody else to wear outer signs that identify them as Jewish, would you? How is this different? Wikipedia articles are often the first thing that comes up when somebody searches for a person's name.</p>
<p>As for "irreligious Jew": that means either (a) somebody of Jewish status who does not practice, (b) somebody (presumably of Jewish status?) who is strongly committed to Israel, say, or (c) somebody who goes around saying that he is Jewish, but may or may not be saying the truth according to criterion X or Y. "Irreligious Jew" is not something defined independently of religion. It is something that refers to a religion, and to a nation (if you wish!) defined in terms of a religion.</p>
<p>I, personally, find the situation especially disturbing in the case of living people. However, most of the issues are general; they apply neither to living people alone, nor to categories alone.</p>
<p>Judaism does not disturb me. Commitment to Judaism and to Israel does not disturb me; anybody who does something constructive seems admirable to me. Rather, it is the imposing of categories on people that disturbs me, and will, at some point, disturb you.</p>
<p>You may be right in stating that deleting category tags from individual people will not do the job. After all, non-inclusion from a list may imply exclusion. It is not my intention to tag, say, Lise Meitner (who was a Lutheran) or Max Newman (whose mother was not Jewish) as non-Jews. Rather, the point is that they should not be tagged as all. The only way we can avoid tagging people in one way or the other, explicitly or implicitly, is by doing away with the tag altogether. <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBellbird_c267.html" title="User:Bellbird">Bellbird</a> 15:30, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Should we have cross-indexes for Jewish Bankers, say, or for Black Criminals, or for White people of Great Intelligence?</p>
<p>There are ways of classifying information that are simply not encyclopaedic (or civilized). The fact that tags can lend themselves to that is an argument against keeping such tags, not an argument in favour of keeping them.</p>

<dd>In theory, I do not have a problem with Jewish bankers. The latter category you bring is racially charged, and has its own issues that needs to be dealt with. And I know that Jews own the media, the banks, the seats of government, the press, and every third 7-11, but I do not think Jewish bankers would suffer from that the way "Bell Curve" related material would. But you would need to create Category:Bankers by religion first and then make a subcat.&#160;;) -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 16:01, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>the demonstrable truth, with citeable evidence, is not a personal attack.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Categorising</span></h2>
<p>Avi: you do realise that we are effectively talking about a racial category, even if it refers to a race that we agree (I hope!) does not exist? We are classifying people by bloodlines - and little else - regardless of their beliefs or actual backgrounds. It is not just that private backgrounds are being made public - it is also that actual backgrounds are being thoroughly obliterated by a binary label.</p>
<p>This is the case even if we just define somebody as Jewish or not (as in the case of the Perelman page). Lists and categories are more sinister. It is not just that they essentially force information to be included, regardless of whether it is relevant. It is also that lists and categories create mental categories in the mind of every reader. Shall we have lists of members of the NKVD who happened to be Jewish? Shall we have lists of Jewish slave traders? Lists of Jewish bankers in Vienna in 1930, with percentages? Do you realise that this means that individuals are being assigned an essence consisting in their supposed membership in a group that they did not choose? Lists are insidious because no statement needs to be made: there is simply a grouping, and "facts" that cannot be denied - unless the act of grouping is invalidated as such.</p>
<p>It is all nice and well that you categorise yourself. However - what is it like to be categorised by another? Can't you imagine it? What if you wake up a Christian? Or a Gentile? Or somebody who is supposed to be horrible or wonderful for no reason related to his actions, to his background, to his sense of self? <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBellbird_c267.html" title="User:Bellbird">Bellbird</a> 16:18, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Larger than Life (books): Question about past deletions</span></h2>
<p>Hi Avraham: I was looking for an article that I had edited and have only now noticed that it was nominated for deletion by you at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Log_2006_June_12_14b4.html#Liozna_and_Larger_than_Life_.28books.29" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2006 June 12">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2006 June 12#Liozna and Larger than Life (books)</a>. The article is about two very important books that were written: Larger than Life (books) that caused quite a storm when they were published as an honest biography of the last Lubavitcher Rebbe and the history of Chabad. It is a pity that you went ahead with that action without consulting a variety of other editors familiar with Judaism (and are not working with a pro-Chabad POV only at all times - because Wikipedia is not here to censor material that goes against current Lubavitch political correctness, or <i>any</i> political correctness for that matter!) Did you contact the creator of the article as required? Or you could have brought it to the attention of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Judaism_1a41.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Judaism">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Judaism</a> after you had nominated this article.

In the circumcision discussion, I positively stated that user:jakew MAKES ME SICK. Which is true.

My respond:</p>
<p>It seems actually impossible to ignore Jakew's inclination on the subject matter. I really believe that he is heavily abusing NPOV arguments. And what's worse, he stays so very friendly and Wikipedia-compatible at all times, because that's a viable strategy. He just knows the rules he has to comply to, but within those set boundaries he IS a POV pusher. I think that people like him are a disgrace to the community.

<dd>Oh seriously, how many edits have I made to the article itself? One, maybe two? I go to the talk page first, a place where discussion can get heated, but when have I EVER advocated the <i>censorship</i> of information that could be seen to promote circumcision? When? that's right - never. I've merely been militantly advocating NON-BIAS in the article, an article that is currently pro-biased.

The article brings both points of view, and brings sources and evidence for both points of view. What it does not do is take a stand one way or the other pro- or anti-. It brings the latest discussions of world-renknown medical organizations which for he most part themselves do not take a stand, but remain neutral. Even for those that do take a stand, there are different stances for medical, ritual/religious, and truly elective circumcisions. This is what the article should be, and this is what remains. For the article to start leaning one way or the other because editors such as yourself have made a near religious objective of demonizing circumcision, is against everything wikipedia stands for. Look at all of your edits: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Lordkazan" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Lordkazan" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Lordkazan</a> You do not want an unbiased circumcision page, you want an anti-circumcision page, and that is not permitted in wikipedia.

<dd>I still do not see how this attests to being a white nationalist. It may attest to a certain sense of humour which you apparently and for apparent reasons (which have nothing or virtually nothing to do with your being Jewish) do not share, but humour is a colorful thing and it is the least thing any white nationalist is capable of (otherwise he or she wouldn't be one, right?). Therefore your accusation adds to a personal attack, Avi. Please be more careful in your choice of words in the future and adhere to the corresponding WP guidelines. Thank you. <a href="../../../8/7/2E/User%7E87.78.178.102.html" title="User:87.78.178.102">87.78.178.102</a> 15:01, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Certain things are poor choices for humor; the Jews running the world is one of them. Posting such trash is a gross violation of wiki policies, as you well know, and your attempting to defend it is in rather poor taste.

<dd>Even though there are exactly two uses of the phrase "White Americans," those do not assert any ideas of white supremecy. Add on top of that the fact that kitler did not even identify with that philosophy. I'm in full agreement that it was in bad taste (and against policy), and as you can see I agreed above that it is trash, but calling kitler a white nationalist was wrong. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkovich292_9f23.html" title="User:Markovich292">Markovich292</a> 16:52, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So you think "Jew hater" is more accurate based on the number of references to Jews contolling the media? When one posts white supremicist trash on ones user page—and gets blocked for it I might add (he was only unblocked with the promise not to engage in such activity in wikipedia any longer, what he does in his own time is his business)—and makes no effort to disavow oneself from it (also, calling <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolph_Hitler_82be.html" title="Adolph Hitler">Adolph Hitler</a> “the Fuhrer” in a vacuum, as opposed to historically referencing the title) is often indicative of such leanings. May I suggest you read up a bit on White nationalism and white supremacy, or even better, please take the time to read the trash on that old page, here is the link: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Kitler005&amp;oldid=73285648" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Kitler005&amp;oldid=73285648" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Kitler005&amp;oldid=73285648</a> I'll even point out some telling sentences for you to make it easier <a href="../../../s/m/i/Image%7ESmile.gif_8d37.html" class="image" title="image:smile.gif"><img src="../../../upload/shared/f/fb/Smile.gif" alt="image:smile.gif" width="20" height="20" longdesc="../../../s/m/i/Image%7ESmile.gif_8d37.html" /></a>:</p>

<p>But to permit the Jews, with their 3,000-year history of nation-wrecking, from ancient Egypt to Russia, to hold such power over us is tantamount to race suicide.

<p>So, our senses of humor are somewhat incompatible. As an aside, my father's family was from Germany also; although, of my grandfathers 11 or so brothers and sisters, most are ash now. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 17:05, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm very sorry for that. But I can counter even that: A friend of mine is Jewish, and his father once told a joke I won't ever forget, because he really was a great man with a fine sense of humour in the tradition of people like Ephraim Kishon. He asked me what the high-point of Anti-fashism would be like. Right when he saw I was actually beginning to think about an answer, he said: "That's when Jews are made out of soap!" --- I would never tell that joke if I hadn't heard from a man who had lost almost his entire family to the Holocaust, but I have. And THAT is intelligent humour. <a href="../../../8/7/2E/User%7E87.78.178.102.html" title="User:87.78.178.102">87.78.178.102</a> 17:33, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I guess I have already caused enough trouble on here, and I'm sorry about it. It was just a joke that my brother put on there. And I'm sorry that your grandfathers are ash. Two of mine are ash too&#160;:( but, I mean if they are making fun of you it is because you are also falling into the steroetype. Someone; I call the President of Iran a cool guy because I like the way he dresses, and you look through the history of my user talk page and then post that I was a White National or whatever. And then when people argue about it you bring up the fact that some of your family are now ash, alluding that they were burnt in the Holocaust. Well there are a hell of a lot of mass murders all around the world all throughout history. I'm sure if anyone traces their linage back far enough they'll find someone being killed systematicly. Hell, why don't we talk about the Armenian Genocide? Why don't we talk about Stallin starving the Ukrane? Why don't we talk about the German POWs that died in American POW camps after the war. They froze to death. They had to dig and scratch with their nails into the very earth to try to escape the freezing weather. But enough about this. I'm sorry that you misunderstood me and I'm sorry for causing this mess on your talk page, but I think some good ideas came out and we cleared up some misunderstandings<a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKitler005_3d4f.html" title="User:Kitler005">Kitler005</a> 04:15, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am guessing that he only says "funny" because of the absurdity of it...and if not then I really don't know what to think. One thing I find interesting about your post though, is you pointing out how he references Hitler as "the Fuhrer." I have to say, I thought the same thing as you about his "leanings." I will have to decline your suggestion to "read up" on those topics you mentioned though, because I watch the History channel&#160;:) I am not <i>just</i> limited to that though, so no need to worry about my knowledge base.</p>
<p>I can assure you, unless you are some kind of ubergenius as some like to say, my comprehension is probably on par with yours. I can also assure you that I have no POV sympathetic to that stuff that was posted. I was only saying that the wording in it does not assert any kind of supremacy of white people over others, so although objectionable, it is not really white supremicist (yes, I take accuracy on wikipedia very seriously). So as Forrest Gump says, "and thats all I really have to say about that." <a href="../../../s/m/i/Image%7ESmile.png_3237.html" class="image" title="image:smile.png"><img src="../../../upload/shared/2/26/Smile.png" alt="image:smile.png" width="20" height="20" longdesc="../../../s/m/i/Image%7ESmile.png_3237.html" /></a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkovich292_9f23.html" title="User:Markovich292">Markovich292</a> 05:19, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I wonder what Atomaton's issue is. You are quite correct: the consensus was that the previous photo was preferable. I have made so many changes to the article just now (I trust only non-contentious ones) that I am loathe now to enter into that fray, but could you now reiterate that that was indeed the consensus?<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasalai_b16e.html" title="User:Masalai">Masalai</a> 11:01, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>JBKramer has made a false claim about me. I simply wished you to know. He seems most incivil. If you wish to file an RFC on him I would be happy to sign it. <a href="../../../u/z/u/User%7EUzumaki_c95b.html" title="User:Uzumaki">Uzumaki</a> 18:32, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
