<h2><span class="mw-headline">Joachim</span></h2>
<p>Could you please revert your move of <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joachim.html" title="Joachim">Joachim</a> to Joachim {Saint). There was no discussion to make this move. In fact, it looks like the consensus at the AfD was to restore Joachim to the version before TenaciousT started adding Star Trek info. The disambig page IS helpful, I will admit, but it should be a link at the top of Joachim. The article Joachim has for a long time been about the Christian figure, and he is the most notable individual to go by that name, so there is nothing wrong with giving him the <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joachim.html" title="Joachim">Joachim</a> article, as long as the disambig link sits at the top. I do not have admin access, so I cannot revert your changes myself. I hope you understand. If you feel that the disambig article should be the top level article, maybe we can discuss that, but please do not go against what editors suggested be restored at the AfD. Thanks for your consideration.-<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 22:12, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Instead of re-moving the page, I switched the main entry to redirect to Joachim (Saint) instead of the disamb. This way, there is more flexibility in the future. If you wish, start a discussion at <a href="../../../j/o/a/Talk%7EJoachim_e0c7.html" title="Talk:Joachim">Talk: Joachim</a> about actually moving the page back.

<dd>I don't see why your move can ignore discussion, but you suggest that my move needs discussion. Did you not read the AfD where multiple editors suggested the article be reverted back to the pre-TenaciousT state? If that isn't discussion, I don't know what it. On top of that, your name choice is problematic for two reasons. It goes against our capitalization convention (saint should be lowercase), and the word "saint" is POV, because not all Christians traditions believe in Sainthood (and the original texts that refer to Joachim do not use this title either). So again, I ask you to please restore the article to their previous state, and let any new move proposals go to discussion.-<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 23:06, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

And if you got rid of any xth holiest site statement about masjid al aqsa and/or medina , why not remove all the others too. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThestick_44db.html" title="User:Thestick">thestick</a> 16:45, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</s></p>

<p>Alright, since this problem has been excavated again by <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChesdovi_1392.html" title="User:Chesdovi">User:Chesdovi</a>. The historical evidence, common sense and general knowledge support the Mecca-Medina-Jerusalem "holiness" structure. It's ridiculous and frustrating to see that all the 'sources' are ignored and Muslims are treated like idiots that don't know a thing about the religion by some people behaving like cranks and behave as if they have false consensus syndrome. The point of the article was not to get rid of the ranking, but to put incorporate all the listed "third holiest sites" into a general article.</p>
<p>Al-Aqsa Mosque being the third holiest in Islam is a an established fact, the others are just opinions, misconceptions or just - mistakes. Why should a site be 'third holiest' just because some Capt. E said so? Just to satisfy somebody's agenda? Shorely some mistake and you must know better. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThestick_44db.html" title="User:Thestick">thestick</a> 17:27, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Now that I look back on the old discussions for template: Messianic Judaism, I see that here at: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:ChristTrekker/MJtemplate#TfD_nomination_of_Template:Messianic_Judaism|HERE" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:ChristTrekker/MJtemplate#TfD_nomination_of_Template:Messianic_Judaism|HERE" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Inigmatus had made a case-by-case explanation for why each and every one of the links in the template was relevant and factually tenable. No one was really able to provide a decent rebuttal to his assertions about the link list. With that in mind, why do we need to go over this for a second or third time, when such an argument has already been decided by a landslide? We COULD repeat such a discussion again, just to be safe, but the genuine honesty of this whole situation seems to be on its last legs.

<dd>Oh, well in that case I am very appreciative of the sheer amount of work you have put into making the Messianic Judaism article good. But I really think that it would be much easier to use my version and simply paste your citations back into the article; if you read the article carefully you will see that it is more NPOV than it has ever been, and even more so with your citations.

<dd>You've basically taken your version of the article and added some bits and pieces of what I had. This is not at all what I was hoping for, which would have been my article with your improved citation system. I don't consider this a proper merge, so I'll take the current version and my original article and do some more reconciliations (line by line). One of my criticisms of your style of editing is the length; it's too long sometimes, whereas I like to summarize, convey the same ideas with less words, let the obvious be written between the lines, and leave the rest to the external links. As someone very personally involved with the subject matter of the article, I ask for some leeway. <a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoogster_f017.html" title="User:Noogster">Noogster</a> 21:11, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alright, I've done a bit more. I think we can both be rather satisfied with it now. Now about all that needs to be done is adding a few more citations to everything as you are so skilled at doing. I assume there was some motivation for having removed two of the pictures? I generally prefer articles that have three or more pictures and I know many people that tell me they can hardly sit through reading something on the internet unless it is well-illustrated. <a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoogster_f017.html" title="User:Noogster">Noogster</a> 22:16, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Note that I'm also wary about the following statistic in the introduction: By 1993 there were 160,000 Messianic Jews in the U.S. and 350,000 worldwide. By 2003, there were at least 150 Messianic synagogues in the U.S. and over 400 worldwide. The previous statistic had only about 50,000 people in the Messianic movement period (Jews or Gentiles) with only about 180 congregations worldwide. The following must be considered:</dd>

<dd>1.)Was the cited author by referring to "Messianic Jews" referring to any Jew that believes that Jesus is the Messiah? There's definitely a difference: Messianic Jews must A.)Be Torah-observant B.)Ethnically Jewish, either by birth according to Jewish law, conversion, or Messianic Jewish conversion (still rare, mind you) C.)Identify as Messianic</dd>

<dd>2.)Assuming that the movement is about 1/2 Jew, 1/2 Gentile (with a clearly Jewish majority as far as leadership), then the 50,000 statistic would have only been 25,000 Messianic Jews. How do we account for such a wide variance between the two statistics?</dd>

<dd>4.)A Jew that practices some conventional form of Christianity without regard to the Torah is almost universally frowned upon by Messianic Judaism and not considered a part of it. Such Jews are classified as Hebrew Christians and are not a formal/synagogal movement as is MJ, but classify an ethnic Jew that is a Christian. There are a lot of them worldwide when you total everything up. But they are not Messianic Jews or part of the movement.</dd>

<p>I guess the Rabbi Yeshua website is really strange; they refer to him as Rabbi (which obviously makes him simultaneously Pharasaic), the website looks and acts Pharasaic, and there is a Talmud quote on the margins of every other page, yet another article turns around and says the opposite.</p>
<p>And the attempted re-create of the template, I must say, is total garbage. Add only things that have to do with Messianic Judaism?

<p>How feasible do you think it is to make a Wikipedia biographical article of this guy? He made official aliyah to Israel (letter from chief Ashkenazi Rabbi and all) and apparently very accepted in the Orthodox Jewish community, and perhaps a thousand people may claim affiliation with his group, but it seems very difficult to find reliable sources.</p>

<dd>Is there a Wikipedia article of a Jew by Orthodox conversion that exists? Preferably one that has made aliyah? I could use it to see what kind of citations and sources to include for an article on YbD (formerly Clint Van West). Even if the article does become up to snuff, it may be too controversial to not get deleted; in very simplest terms, this guy believes in Jesus (albeit in a way that is arguably entirely consistent with Orthodox Judaism, i.e. a human Mashiakh ben Yosef named "Ribbi Yehoshua").

<p>The general issue is this: I am a mainstream Jew; I am not a messianic Jew; I have no sympathy for messianic Jews religiously.

Just thought I'd let you know as you, very justly, tagged the "as is" version for AfD. Have a nice day! <a href="../../../1/5/6/User%7E156.34.142.110.html" title="User:156.34.142.110">156.34.142.110</a> 18:40, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
