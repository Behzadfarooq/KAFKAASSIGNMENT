<p>Hi. I reverted your page move of {{<a href="../../../n/e/w/Template%7ENews_reference_03ba.html" title="Template:News reference">news reference</a>}}. We need to have both the old and the new {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_news_5e9e.html" title="Template:Cite news">cite news</a>}} if we want to change the parameter names. See what we have done on {{<a href="../../../b/o/o/Template%7EBook_reference_08ee.html" title="Template:Book reference">book reference</a>}} â†’ {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_book_c666.html" title="Template:Cite book">cite book</a>}}. We need to do the same on {{<a href="../../../n/e/w/Template%7ENews_reference_03ba.html" title="Template:News reference">news reference</a>}} â†’ {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_news_5e9e.html" title="Template:Cite news">cite news</a>}}. Sorry. This was my fault. I shouldn't have used the term "move". It is rather a migrate. Once we agree on how the new template looks, we can deprecate the old {{<a href="../../../n/e/w/Template%7ENews_reference_03ba.html" title="Template:News reference">news reference</a>}} and remove the "in development" notice on {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_news_5e9e.html" title="Template:Cite news">cite news</a>}}. I will then convert the calls on the articles by using <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html" title="WP:AWB">WP:AWB</a>. Please wait with removing the development notice on cite news. Once this is done, the template is released into the wilderness of the articles and incompatible param changes are no longer possible. We should give some more time to others. Maybe there are more ideas what to change on the params. Once we start converting, there is no way back. --Adrian Buehlmann 19:33, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What's the point of listing which users are newer if other than to discount them? I think that's disingenuous. If the case was to show how "old" a given user was, why not do it for <i>all</i> users, or rank them by age? That's kind of silly. <b>...&#160;</b><span style="background-color: #11cbc4; width: 52px; height: 16px; font-size: 12px; p { text-align: center; font-face: Times New Roman}"><a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvriette_f119.html" title="User:Avriette">aa</a>:<a href="../../../a/v/r/User_talk%7EAvriette_2538.html" title="User talk:Avriette">talk</a></span> 04:38, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Newer users may have stumbled across the poll from, say, the Signpost, and taken part in it without knowing the wider repercussions.

<p>Count me in. Does Esperanza vote as a bloc, take policy positions, etc? StrangerInParadise 08:46, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You miss my point. What I'm getting at here is that voting blocs happen as a factor of voting in general. I think that can be proven without doubt. I haven't looked into it, but I would imagine there are <b>lots</b> of sources of information about voting community dynamics. Finding them shouldn't be too hard. What I was getting at with that link was that it happens here in other places in innocuous fashions. It happens on IRC, and it happens on <a href="../../../a/n/b/WP%7EANB_8bef.html" title="WP:ANB">WP:ANB</a>. Some places are "okay" for recruiting votes, and others are not. If we come up with a list of recent instances where that happened, we can point out the fallacy that "vote stuffing" is a problem. I think the primary problem is not vote stuffing, but the fact that there are <i>so many</i> places for discussion that nobody can be aware of all of them (RSS would help!). Take a recent example (which I am admittedly a part of). See <a href="../../../l/e/e/Talk%7ELeet_%28language%29_8572.html" title="Talk:Leet (language)">Talk:Leet (language)</a>. There is a vote being held there. Did you know about it? If I weren't watching the page, would I know about it? Am I interested in it? You betcha. I wasn't watching that page a week ago. Now, if somebody comes to me and says hey, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Netoholic&amp;diff=42896878&amp;oldid=42878027" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Netoholic&amp;diff=42896878&amp;oldid=42878027" rel="nofollow">come vote</a>, that's not vote-stacking. But the mechanism is the same.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think people use the term "vote stacking" when they're unhappy that more people have been brought into a discussion than they'd like. I think that's inherently A Very Bad Thing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think also that informing people of a vote (even asking them to vote one way or another) is not harmful. To say that it is harmful is to say that people who are informed are incapable of making a decision that they would have made, had you not informed them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also think you're spot-on with jury pools. I doubt it will ever be implemented (it's a pain in the ass, software wise). However, I think the discussion will draw parallels between our voting system and voting systems in general. (for example, voting blocs happen. they're not evil. <i>not telling people about</i> votes is evil)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>thoughts? <b>...&#160;</b><span style="background-color: #11cbc4; width: 52px; height: 16px; font-size: 12px; p { text-align: center; font-face: Times New Roman}"><a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvriette_f119.html" title="User:Avriette">aa</a>:<a href="../../../a/v/r/User_talk%7EAvriette_2538.html" title="User talk:Avriette">talk</a></span> 08:57, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Didn't miss the point, just wondered if there was another. I think Esperanza might be an example of how neutral news of a vote can diseminate through a community and affect an outcome by thus selecting participants. I have said this about template:cent, #wikipedia, etc. When you look at the non-individual announcements of UPP, you see inherent biases.</p>
<ul>
<li>(on WP:Userboxes) A proposed policy on userboxes has been created to help decide what should be considered acceptable for userboxes. Your input is appreciated. It has also been proposed to migrate some userbox templates to the user namespace. Some have already begun this process and you may wish to do the same for your userboxes. [no mention of poll!]
<ul>
<li>(on WP:Proposed policy on userboxes)There is an ongoing poll about an almost identical policy in Wikipedia:Userbox policy poll</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(on WP:Current Surveys) An attempt to end the userbox wars.</li>
<li>(on Template:Cent) Userbox policy (voting)</li>
<li>(on WP:PUMP (policy)) <b>Userbox policy</b> This is a policy proposal onn userboxes, developed by Pathoschild from an original by Doc glasgow. It picked up quite a lot of favorable comments in Pathoschild's userspace and so after discussion I've moved it to WP:UBP (which believe it or not hasn't actually had any concrete proposals on the main page for weeks)</li>
<li>(on WP:PUMP (policy)) <b>An End to the Userbox WArs?</b> In case anyone missed it, a poll opened at Wikipedia:Userbox policy poll which, I think, stands a chance at ending the bloodshed. Current tally is 26 yay and 4 nay (not that it is a vote or anything).</li>
<li>(on #wikipedia header) [generic announcement, text now gone]</li>
<li>(on four cannabis-related talk pages and WP:Deliriants, with an announcement of a new userbox User pro-cannabis) <b>New Pro-cannabis userbox</b>...also, consider weighing in on <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUserbox_policy_poll_0ca3.html" title="Wikipedia:Userbox policy poll">Userbox policy poll</a>. Stand up and be counted while you still can.</li>
</ul>
<p>All but the last two bear the implicit message, "this is a good and right thing to support", all say nothing of adverse consequences. Especially on WP:Userboxes, this is misleading: the subtext is, <i>nothing to be done, jimbo's weighed in, accept the inevitable by userifying</i>. Further, these were the primary means of bringing people to the poll, apart from word-of-mouth. It would be interesting to add to this list of known announcements.</p>

<dd>I know no one is actually asking for my opinion here, but Iâ€™d like to add that this "<i>nothing to be done</i>" message was very concrete.

<dd>My first impression was when reading your request for more civility was that you were telling Tony to be more civil. Especially since it was in its own section. I think if you had titled it something else I may not have been given the impression that Tony was the one you were asking to be more civil. And reading through that, I didn't see where Tony was being uncivil. What I saw was that Tony was being polite but firm in warning FourthAve about the consequences of vandalizing articles. FourthAve has ignored all prior warnings and continues to make regular personal attacks and continues to vandalize articles, so at this stage in the game a firm hand is needed in dealing with him.<br /></dd>

<dd>I am surprised this has produced such tumult. I watch Tony's talk page. I saw the user being a dick, and warned him about it.

<p>I've got clashing opinions on the point shooting page, and while I'm trying to mediate as best I can, the two editors in question have a long history of clashing over this particular issue. They're also both good sources of information, so I'm trying to avoid annoying either one any more than necessary, but this might escalate into something requiring administrative action. Since you seem to be more familiar with the adminstration of Wikipedia than I am, I thought you might be able to take a look and provide some input. <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluzwup_2550.html" title="User:Fluzwup">scot</a> 16:28, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you like, we can discuss via email. Sometimes public discussions can get pretty ugly.

Both are very informal. One level up from that would be <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a>, which is "non binding" but definitely more public, and more likely to hurt feelings and bruise egos. What you really want to avoid is <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html" title="WP:RFAR">WP:RFAR</a>, as that usually winds up being punitive.</dd>

<p>Not sure what you're talking about regarding my "recent use of vandalism" or "community justice" considering I've been out of town since Thursday. Furthermore, out of my last 100 edits, only one has used the word or abbreviation for vandalism, my last one before I left town. While it wasn't vandalism by itself and yes, was probably just a test, that particular test has been entered multiple times by multiple users and in very poor form, and it's been established as nothing but cruft. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">â‡’</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iceland.svg_bd47.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/ce/Flag_of_Iceland.svg/18px-Flag_of_Iceland.svg.png" alt="" width="18" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iceland.svg_bd47.html" /></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swatjester_088b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swatjester"><small><sup>Ready</sup></small></a> <a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_5dcc.html" title="RSTA"><small>Aim</small></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_United_States_Armed_Forces_74b7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject United States Armed Forces"><small><sub>Fire!</sub></small></a> 01:28, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Think about it this way. I can give the navy permission to use an image I created, but that does not make it public domain. I still retain copyright. In this case, Lockheed furnished the image. It was their artist, their rendition, and their copyright. The Navy is publishing it with permission. We are publishing it as promotional material of Lockheeds, and thus fair use.

<dd>The fact that there are multiple images (Lockheed and GD) indicates to me that the images came out of the proposal phase. The navy doesn't draw a ship, hand it to a vendor, and say "build this." They sketch out requirements and a contract framework, go to the vendor, and say "show us what you'd build." Then diagrams like this get produced. Also, if you have time, look at <a href="http://www.army.mil/fcs/" class="external free" title="http://www.army.mil/fcs/" rel="nofollow">http://www.army.mil/fcs/</a>. There's a lot of nice video and pictures there, in addition to whitepapers, etc. While the Army does have a big marketing department, they don't have the necessary people to make huge 12-minute long starwars animations. Boeing does. They did it <i>for</i> the army, but it was still Boeing personnel.</dd>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I was surprised to see you comment, "Self-deprecation is unbecoming" in this RfA. Your opinion is yours to cherish, of course, but given that we have agreed quite firmly in the past (over out-of-process admin actions), I thought you should take a look at my userpage. I <i>embrace</i> self-deprecation with gusto, and consider it an asset in my quest to practice constant humility. I suppose my point to you is that you should realize how wildly divergent people's views on this topic can be, so that you don't quickly discount an otherwise fine editor for reasons of personal style.

<dl>
<dd>Dig, friend. I wasn't, however, suggesting we should <i>agree</i>, only that you might wish to evaluate why (for what reasons) we <i>disagree</i>, evaluate your investment in these, and keep that mind for future reference. If you can be "almost offended" by a polite request to consider each others differences, we do have diametrically-opposed world-views. Partly my mistake, but rest assured that the "almost offended" bit is completely mutual, and I will avoid contact with you assiduously in future. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 22:33, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. IÂ´m against the move you made. Wikipedia guidelines (not policies&#160;:-) states that article names should strive to be closest to the thing a reader would type in the search box. I canÂ´t see someone typing Teahupoo, Tahiti too many times... Location names are appended with country or city names only when there is another location with the same name, for example see <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/o/Rio_de_Janeiro_d5c5.html" title="Rio de Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a> and many others. I think Teahupoo, Tahiti will increase the burden on wikipedia because it will increase <b>redirects</b> either because wikipedians are more likely to link to <a href="../../../t/e/a/Teahupoo.html" title="Teahupoo">Teahupoo</a> instead of <a href="../../../t/e/a/Teahupoo%2C_Tahiti_cf1a.html" title="Teahupoo, Tahiti">Teahupoo, Tahiti</a> and because users will certainly type Teahupoo on the search box, only to be redirect to Teahupoo, Tahiti. It may seem a small burden, but we should avoid redirects whenever possible because taken collectivelly they are really a big waste of time and resources. If you have any arguments to sustain the move, please let me know them, because IÂ´m considering moving the page back to Teahupoo.

<dd>IÂ´ve compiled a very (very) small list to exemplify my disagreement with the move. People will get REDIRECT correctly to the page they sought, but REDIRECTS should be avoided whenever possible. I never said people would not be able to find the article by typing Teahupoo alone in the search box, it is the fact that this will generate a redirect that annoys me. It is an unecessary burden on the mediawiki engine that can be avoided easlily in this case.

<li>Anyway, I thought your concerns would ask for an answer, so here it is. The introduction of this criteria, although not perfect, is to focus less on duration and editcountist on Wikipedia. No minimum count or duration required. <i>None</i>. And I do give exceptions (see the 1FA page) to long-standing Wikipedians who have contributed in other aspects. Yes, getting an article to be featured is not easy, which is why just <i>one</i> featured article is all this is needed to fulfill my criteria. - <i>Best regards</i>, <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMailer_diablo_6ffa.html" title="User:Mailer diablo">Mailer Diablo</a> 14:18, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Awesome! What kind of book are you writing? I wasn't aware of more mediation between you and Neto. From what I see, he didn't win much.

<p>What point are you trying to make by saying he served "compulsorily"? That he was reluctantly drafted? This clearly was not the case, since he served in an elite unit, as his obituary makes clear.

<dd>His obituary specifically states he served in an "elite unit", so it must be important. You have no evidence that he was compulsorily induced into the army, and his obituary doesn't state he was either. Serving in the army was (and often still is) considered a privilege in Israel; the analogy with Viet Nam is way off, and stating that it is seems like POV pushing. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 23:01, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>When did Shahak join the army, and when did that law come into effect? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 23:19, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Exactly. Saying he served "compulsorily" is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> at best. On the other hand, saying he served in an "elite unit" is a simple and properly sourced fact. And it must be an important one, since his <i>Guardian</i> obituary specifically states it: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4216853,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4216853,00.html" rel="nofollow">After Israeli army service in an elite regiment etc.</a> If it wasn't significant, why would they have put it in? Obituaries are brief, they only put in the most important facts. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 23:28, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There's a guy who just recently came onto the <a href="../../../c/4/i/Talk%7EC4ISTAR_d174.html" title="Talk:C4ISTAR">Talk:C4ISTAR</a> page and wants to merge it with <a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_5dcc.html" title="RSTA">RSTA</a>, <a href="../../../i/s/t/ISTAR_5deb.html" title="ISTAR">ISTAR</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surveillance_and_Target_Acquisition_a3f2.html" title="Surveillance and Target Acquisition">Surveillance and Target Acquisition</a> all into one article. This is one of the things you and I had discussed and rejected earlier in the year: as ISTAR and C4ISTAR are doctrinal and RSTA and STA refer to both tactics and organizational units. A merge would be ridiculous and just be a combination of two disparate topics into one article. The collective talk for this is on <a href="../../../c/4/i/Talk%7EC4ISTAR_d174.html" title="Talk:C4ISTAR">Talk:C4ISTAR</a> and I'd like you to weigh in. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">â‡’</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swatjester_088b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swatjester"><small><sup>Ready</sup></small></a> <a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_5dcc.html" title="RSTA"><small>Aim</small></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_United_States_Armed_Forces_74b7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject United States Armed Forces"><small><sub>Fire!</sub></small></a> 02:04, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
