<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reliability</span></h2>
<p>As I wrote in the "Messianic Jews" Discussion page:</p>
<p>I've looked into this Berkley book, and it seems to me that it should be treated as entirely unreliable on the issue at hand. To begin with, the discussion of Messianic Jews is entirely tangential to the main topics of the book, and is based on no particular expertise. More important, the book itself is not a scholarly source, but an off-the-wall polemic. Here's how Publisher's Weekly described it: "Berkley, who is Jewish, a member of B'nai B'rith and author of Vienna and Its Jews, has written a freewheeling, brashly opinionated, anecdote-filled, sometimes entertaining cultural history of the Jews that is certain to irk and provoke. In his opinion, Jews tend to be assertive and prickly; they have an often desperate need for recognition and respect; a fractious people, driven by disunity, they give generously, but rarely anonymously, and have a "near-obsession with food." The typical Jewish family, he says, features a dominant mother, a relatively weak father and a high degree of solicitude for its children. These and other uneasy generalizations border on stereotypes." Similarly, the Library Journal writes: "His book suffers from several problems. On some issues, such as civil rights and homosexuality, Berkley constructs straw men that he easily demolishes. He often fails to do justice to the complex issues and gives little attention to how modern arguments relate to Jewish history and tradition." In other words, unless we would be willing to take this author as a "reliable source" for all the other bizarre things he says, we should not take him as a "reliable source" for an off-hand comment about Messianic Judaism. Again, I need to emphasize that I am not saying this as a "defender" of Messianic Judaism. Quite the contrary. But the first duty of Wikipedia should be accuracy....</p>
<p>I have a broader question. What makes a source "reliable"? The mere fact that it's published? The mere fact that it appears on Google Books? I'm a professor at a major American university. If I wrote a scholarly article in which my only standard for whether a source was "reliable" was whether that source was published somewhere, I'd be laughed out of the profession.

<p>Yes, there was no COI. But I am left wondering; is Jayjg now authorized to dish out 'educational' blocks against perceived irredeemable violators that he has edit conflicts with?

<dd>I understand about that Moshe but I mean, should I now expect Jayjg to dish out a 24-hour block based upon that pretext? Is he now authorized?

.

<p>Hi Avi,</p>
<p>I was just about to ask about CIRP links, when I noticed that WP:ATT does not seem to include that section.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What I meant by "vandalism", and miscellaneous</span></h2>
<p>Actually when I removed the vandalism it was Kirbytime's I was referring to Kirbytime's offensive comment in my talk page. See my response in his talk page.</p>
<p>I was under the impression that you could remove warning tags in your page once you've served your time. I know better now.</p>
<p>I posted that (slightly POV) message in Inigmatus' comment for 2 reasons: the first was so it would be clear to him, my closest associate on WP, what I thought about the matter, and the second was to remind him that he is to respect how wide the gamut of "Messianic Judaism" is and be as pluralistic as possible.</p>
<p>Lastly, I've posted a response to your questioning of the 5 citations in the talk page. <a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoogster_f017.html" title="User:Noogster">Noogster</a> 22:28, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Moishe Rosen is not a Messianic Jew according to almost anyone you ask that is a member of a Messianic congregation. This is no different from WP not classifying Messianic Judaism as a form of Judaism due to the fact that the established denominations reject it as such. <a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoogster_f017.html" title="User:Noogster">Noogster</a> 22:42, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">3RR</span></h2>
<p>Most instances of 3RR (and other misconduct) I don't bother to report, and your response to Grandia01 report is a terrific example of why. I can only guess that admins are overworked and can't be bothered to read what is written. <i>Half a year</i> this guy has done this, warned again and again, reverted by dozens of editors. This is a joke. Do you have any idea how long it takes to get one of these reports together with background? A lot longer than it takes to revert four (or even twenty) times. Reporting sockpuppets is even more futile, but there, we can at least say that admins are maybe not always especially perceptive. With 3RR there is really no excuse particularly where edit warring has gone on since <i>October 2006</i> with <i>zero</i> discussion. Meanwhile serious, active, good faith editors are subjected to all manner of prosecutorial measures. Since that time I've been RfCU'd twice, reported falsely for 3RR once, RfC'd (without certification) once - but with Grandia01, let our motto be, <i>assume good faith!</i><a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 07:25, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for pointing out the censor/censure difference; I'm not a native English speaker, and sometimes my brain reverts to latin mode. Yet, despite my obvious mistake, it still made sense now that I researched the etymology and many meanings of the term.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censure" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censure" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> One could make the case that Wikipedia editors are "public officials" and that you censured the anonymous coward by calling him a troll. But that's beyond the point at hand... I carefully reviewed the talk guidelines before reverting your deletion. The behavior is unacceptable, ok. But you don't have the right to delete it. Clearly, many people around the Ahmadinejad article expressed similar views in the past. Times and again, I was called an apologetic. That is as serious a personal attack could get, but deleting someone else's comments is just as unacceptable for me as making the attack in the first place.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Writings of Messianic Jews</span></h2>
<p>Avraham,</p>
<p>As you've no doubt noticed, many Messianic Judaism related pages end up deleted, often for lack of good sources. I hope to help solve this problem. I have been a Wikipedia and Wikisource contributor for some time, and have contributed (somewhat irregularly) to articles that relate to Messianic Judaism. I have recently started a project on Wikisource, the <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Wikisource:Wikiproject_Salvation_of_Israel_Project" class="external text" title="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Wikisource:Wikiproject_Salvation_of_Israel_Project" rel="nofollow">Salvation of Israel Project</a> with the aim of making available the writings of Messianic-Jews and Hebrew-Christians of ages past. This should go a long way to improve proper referencing of sources, and help prove notability. Feel free to check it out. Right now, the only text available on the project is <i><a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/History_of_the_Ten_Lost_Tribes_-_Anglo-Israelism_Examined" class="external text" title="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/History_of_the_Ten_Lost_Tribes_-_Anglo-Israelism_Examined" rel="nofollow">History of the Ten Lost Tribes - Anglo-Israelism Examined</a></i> by David Baron. God willing, other texts will follow.</p>
<p>I have an electronic copy of one of a work by Rabbi Jehiel Lichtenstein, (sometimes confused with <a href="../../../i/g/n/Ignatz_Lichtenstein_5d3b.html" title="Ignatz Lichtenstein">Ignatz Lichtenstein</a>) in Hebrew. It is his commentary on the New Testament. The Biblical text of the NT, in Hebrew, appears to come from Franz Delitzsch' translation of the NT. Though I understand more than merely that which begins with "Baruch Attah", I do not posses sufficient Hebrew skills to translate the work into English. As you are reasonably fluent in Hebrew (He-2), and a regular contributor to the WikiProject Messianic Judaism, I hope to enlist your aid, if you are kind enough to agree.</p>
<p>Also, have electronic copies of some of Ignatz Lichtenstein's untranslated German writings. As I speak no German, if you know someone who might be agreeable to volunteer to translate the remainder of his work into English for the project, that would be wonderful as well.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Contradiction?</span></h2>
<p>You have nominated the article for deletion, yet you are neutral about it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Amal_Saad-Ghorayeb" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Amal_Saad-Ghorayeb" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. Why nominate an article for deletion, when you don't want it to be deleted? I'll vote to keep it, but I can't make a counterargument, since there is noone making the argument to delete this in the first place.<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 23:56, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Krinsky</span></h2>
<p>The article is in a dire state but so almost all the articles on Chabad-Lubavithch topics. This man is very very notable. And hopefully I will get round to sorting out the article tomorrow. This nomination is absurd as <a href="http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=yehuda-krinsky&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;um=1" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=yehuda-krinsky&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;um=1" rel="nofollow">this google news achive shows</a>. His role as the right hand man and spokesman of Schneerson for 40 years and his stewardship of the organisation for the past 13 years makes him notable, not only the <b>165 newspaper articles, dozens of scholarly articles and books he is cited in.</b> Please reconsider your nomination ans assist me in putting together the article. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Spart_dfd6.html" title="User:David Spart"><tt class="userlinks">David Spart</tt></a> (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_Spart_ce52.html" title="User talk:David Spart">talk</a>&#160;<b>·</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_David_Spart_0a3b.html" title="Special:Contributions/David Spart">contribs</a>&#160;<b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">logs</font></a>&#160;<b>·</b> <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_David_Spart_6bd7.html" title="Special:Blockip/David Spart">block user</a>&#160;<b>·</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_01d8.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#002BB8">block log</font></a></span>) 02:31, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
