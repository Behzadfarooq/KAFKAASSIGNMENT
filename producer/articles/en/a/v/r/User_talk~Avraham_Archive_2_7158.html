<p>Hello. Regarding the Actuarial Outpost issue, <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> has made false accusations. There is no vendetta against the former site and its administrators. The only vendetta that exists is their not wanting a factual reference to a spin off site that promotes more freedom than their site allows. The actuarial outpost was formerly known as the Rebel Outpost. It was, in fact, a spin off from the CAS web site for precisely the same reason that the RebelActuary site had to spin off from the Rebel Outpost - which changed it's name to the Actuarial Outpost as it became a more commercial venture and less interested in the free expression of ideas.</p>
<p>I only thought wikipedia would be better served to have a true historical perspective rather than be tainted by Avraham's revisionist history which denies that a spin off did in fact take place for exactly the same reasons that created it in the first place.</p>

<p>Hi Avi, I'm sorry if I've upset you in any way. Your hard work on Rabbi Schachter is definately much appreciated. The reason I reverted your edits and took away the "proper wiki citation for a website" is because I didn't see the need to tell the world the <i>date on which the URL was accessed</i>. Why is that necessary? And again, as with the biography infobox that you eventually took off - why don't other articles have this feature? Please explain.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">BOYARIN</span></h2>
<p>I appreciate the spirit of your comment. But, part of Boyarin's argument -- which I explained on the talk page -- is that the distinction between Jew and Judaism is itself anachronistic, a modern distinction that does not fit well with the totality of jewish history. This is a valid view and should be included in the article. At Wikipedia we do not delete views we disagree with. If we know <i>other</i> views are missing, we <i>add</i> them. Find a scholar who argues that the distinction between religion and ethnic group (or race or nation) is a distinction that has long been meaningful in judaism, and that is useful to help underestand Judaism, and <i>add</i> that to the article as an alternative to Boyarin's view. But do not delete valid content. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 01:15, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do not even argue with that point, but it is the term <b>Jew</b> that has changed, not <b>Judaism</b>. The definition of Jewery by religion is difficult according to Boyarin, but not the definition of the religion by Jewery. Which is why, this is an excellent, nay, <i>required</i> addition to the page <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jew</a>, but not <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>, in my opinion. It is not that the view is "present" or "absent", it is that this is drectly referring to <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jewery</a>, not Judaism, and so I feel it is misplaced in the <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> article. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 01:20, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am afraid you are misreading Boyarin. I read the entire work from which the quote is taken. He is making an argument about <i>distinctions</i> like religion, ethnicity, culture, race, and nation <i>as well as</i> the entities that go along with these distinctions e.g. Judaism, Jews, Jewishness. His claim has to do with the impossibility of identifying "Judaism," which the article is about, as a religion. As I have said, not all people share these views, but that is no reason to remove it from the article. If you want to claim that Judaism is a religion, find valid sources that say so and add them. But do not delete a valid source that challenges the view that judaism is a religion. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 01:26, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have recently made some edits to the article itself, specifically the paragraph in question. My only intention was to express more accurately Boyarin's views. These edits may not respond to your concerns, but I would welcome knowing what you think, or if you want to discuss this further, <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 13:52, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You do know that is is usual to bring things to the cabal first, and if that doesn;t work, you ask for informal intervention, and if that doesn't work you go to the mediatiion committe, and if all else fails, you go for arbitration. Thus, in our case, I suggest we start with the cabal, and not jump to the committee.</dd>

<p>i noticed your editing out references to other actuarial organizatons. ok with me. However, the SoA is a driving force in North America as well as internationally in getting all the the actuarial organizations working together and working with higher standards. i need to get the scope of this effort properly reflected in the article. a large number of new entrants into the society were born outside the usa. it is important for them to understand the scope of these efforts because it creates future job opportunities for them and other future inquiries into wikipedia. one way to accomplish this is to link to websites, but i would prefer not to do that. joebrophy <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosephbrophy_bede.html" title="User:Josephbrophy">Josephbrophy</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosephbrophy_b903.html" title="User talk:Josephbrophy">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__Josephbrophy_911e.html" title="Special:Contributions/ Josephbrophy">contribs</a>) 23:04, June 20, 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>avi: here is a dilemma. the Society of Actuaries will give be permission to copy any material from any publication or website that they have created. however if the material is edited by me or any one else, then all bets are off. is there any way around this dilemma? they told me i can write about anything from them, if i put everythign in my own words. of course, this is not a problem for me. but it does raise a question. If i use a quote from some celebrity and someone else in wiki modifies the quote - than what happens? what are the protocols with repsect to "permission to use pictures or exact wording.?" <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosephbrophy_bede.html" title="User:Josephbrophy">joe</a> 00:16, 22 June 2006 (UTC) joebrophy</p>

<p>Avi: i don't bruise easily so do what you need to do to make everything fit better. i have a lot of info that i need to put someplace. so rather than driving you crazy with questions, i will insert info where i think they make sense. knowing of course that you will find the right home for them'</p>
<p>i noticed that the wiki listing on mathematics, mathematical finance, and probabily theory did not make any reference to actuary. so i added the word actuary to the text of probability theory to see what happens. i will also add some content to mathemtics and mathematical finance. i noticed that there was not listing for "branches of mathematics". the listing for mathematics trys to cover the subject but their writeup is boring and just one lost paragrahp. although there are some neat sections to the listing. i would like to insert some examples of actuarial notation in the listing on mathematics. i never know whose turf i am stepping on.</p>

<dd>It's fairly good, but from long experience on FAC, I can tell you it won't pass without some substantial changes. I'd recommend replacing it on PR and soliciting some wider opinion. Specifically it has POV problems in claiming actuaries are the most important, qualified, etc. It also doesn't even mention <a href="../../../r/i/s/Risk_management.html" title="Risk management">risk management</a> which actuaries could be said to be an important part of, with risk management as the broad umbrella area of knowledge. Also there's the perception that actuaries are typically the number crunchers only, and others actually make the decisions, whereas this article paints it as actuaries running the show. Finally actuarial science is something that has a wealth of books and other reliable sources published on it, but the article currently doesn't cite many/enough. I could look for more if you'd like more suggestions of things to polish up, but I wanted to let you know there were issues to fix before FAC was a good idea. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 21:16, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for you input. I'll comb through the article again for those waesel word issues; I guess I missed a bunch. Also, it does mention risk management, bith in the lead and in "non-traditional" My fear is that going into to much detail threatens to overwhelm the article. Also, most books are about <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actuarial_science.html" title="Actuarial science">Actuarial science</a>, not the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actuary.html" title="Actuary">Actuary</a> themselves. There are plenty of books on lifecon/cas prob/freq sev issues etc. Gosh knows I had to read a bunch getting my letters, but that deals with the WORK, which is properly contained in <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actuarial_science.html" title="Actuarial science">Actuarial science</a>, IMO, and not Actuary. However, I do defer to your expertise, and will try to get some more sources in.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">REINSURANCE AND SOCIAL INSURANCE</span></h2>
<p>Avi:</p>
<p>i cant find your recent reply to me re the above captioned subjects.</p>
<p>the underlying risks are similar but the actuarial skill sets are quite different. for example, all the "old" guys like jack moorhead and bob meyers get involved in social insurance. the size of the risks are enormous, and the quantification is vague because of politics. look at the 9/11 WTC</p>
<p>years ago there was very little difference between an insurance company and a reinsurance company. but that has changed. look at the 911 WTC loss. forgot about what the contract says; judges and politicians can reinterpret them any way that is convenient for them. in my judgement, the actuarial skill set for senior actuaries in reinsurance is much more challenging than regular insurance.</p>
<p>since we are focusing on 'actuary' i believe it is important to show or hint at the tremendous breadth of business and societal risks that our profession has to cope with.</p>
<p>this seems to me also to require a new page about types of risk, and also about the tools we use that go far beyond life and other contgencies. not to mention chaos and complexity theory.</p>
<p>i will get back to this later in the afternoon. i am trying to fix one of my disfunctional computers.</p>
