<p>I remember making the comment you referred to, although I don't remember when. I didn't really think there were <i>no</i> other DC-area Wikipedians, and in fact I knew there were a couple and I've since run across others. But at the time, I believe I was the only one who was involved in highly visible pages like Requests for Adminship, policy discussions, VfD (now AfD), etc. Since then I've faded into the woodwork, but it's nice to know there are some other locals contributing. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 17:46, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Yes, that's disturbing a bit. The attitude that "I am right and everyone else is wrong" has become too prevalent on the Wiki. Some people just need a whack or two with a cluebat. In Neto's case, well, he's usually competent and knows what he's doing, it's just that he doesn't work well with others who disagree with him. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 18:16, 17 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm really sorry to hear that. I was about to say you're new and you run into people like that, but now I see your account predates mine by half a year (where have you been?&#160;:) ) and starts with some edits on the absolutely awesome Hyperion books. Cool!</li>
<li>Anyway. Yes, I've dealed with it (and him) before, and I yet live. First, let me assure you that Neto is not an admin (you can probably figure out why). Second, well, he's a trouble case, and is about as bad a user we have that is still allowed to edit. That would be because on the one hand he's a solid enthousiastic contributor with a good grasp of template logic, and on the other hand his social skills are off the scale in the negative zone.</li>
<li>I think it's laudable that you're still trying to make a compromise that he finds acceptable. That's, of course, what Wikispirit and <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">WP:FAITH</a> are all about. Unfortunately, there's a select few users in the place that you just can't argue with, and you've just met one. He is extremely vindictive (as near as I can tell, he has hated me with a passion ever since a disagreement on the wording of <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Example_user_be59.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Example user">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Example user</a> <b>last May</b>). If such people get angry, it's generally best to stay calm and respond with simple oneliners such as "please be <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>" or "please don't make <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a>", or (against people citing policy in defense) "<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> a bureaucracy".</li>
<li>So about the dispute. Well, it's sometimes easy to overlook, but most Wikipedians are in fact nice and rational people. So what you can do is get a third opinion, usually on the talk page of wherever the dispute was, or else on <a href="../../../3/o/_/WP%7E3O_1830.html" title="WP:3O">WP:3O</a>. Of course I'm not saying that two people against one are by definition <i>right</i>, but someone who can't find another to back up his opinion is almost certainly wrong, even if he thinks that official policy is on their side.</li>
<li>That's the simple solution. If it doesn't work or turns into an angry revert war, there are some recourses, e.g. <a href="../../../r/p/p/WP%7ERPP_5127.html" title="WP:RPP">request that the page be protected</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">request an admin to take a closer look</a>, or <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">report somebody for outrageous reverting</a> (but don't do the latter if you were also reverting, two wrongs don't make a right). That should help for most kinds of dispute, and none of that is escalating (if you must, that would be <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a>). If one party is unreasonable and incivil, and the other is rational and dismayed, it's usually pretty obvious where the cause of the problem lies. While I'm not saying there's <i>never</i> any fallout, improper sanctions are quite rare on the Wiki. One of the truisms is that people who hold extreme views are not sanctioned because of the views they hold, but because of the social norms they break while defending those views.</li>
<li>Or, of course, find some other user who likes Dan Simmons, and ask for advise&#160;:) Hope that helps!

<dd>As to where I've been, if you look around, I've been in a lot of places. I am just no good at interpersonal conflict and fear I'd wind up like MSK. Additionally, I don't find it productive to be spending time on policy here. I prefer to contribute. In fact, I'm pretty self conscious about the amount of time I've been spending in the User Talk/Talk/WP namespace. There <i>are</i> a lot of people here who seem to forget that there is an encyclopedia which doesn't contain the sum of human knowledge yet. Lastly, the contributions I am generally most happy with are the ones that find an image for an article which desperately needs it. This is such a nice thing to accomplish for an editor, and yet it rarely ever winds up causing a fracas that other people would be involved in. So you might not see me if you were looking for a lot of consistent edits (I move around a lot), or were looking at policy discussions (not for me). Thanks for your comments. I'd really like it if I could lean on you for guidance in situations like this. Every once in a while it happens (I think this is the third such time I've butted heads with somebody else).</dd>
<dd>Oh. I suppose to give a truly factual account of the situation, I've been pretty abrasive in "discussions" with other users. So far I'm batting 1.000 in resolving those conflicts. So I have deliberately stayed out of people's way and tried not to draw attention to myself. I suppose the cat is out of the bag. I suspect now somebody will dig up some old edit of mine and use it as proof that I'm an asshole. Raul's got a page on the cyclic nature of wikipedia, and it mentions that the longer you're here, and the more edits you make, the more likely it is that somebody will find something that you've done wrong and shriek about it. The same is not true for things you've done right. <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvriette_f119.html" title="User:Avriette">Avriette</a> 02:43, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm sorry if you disagree with my tone. I readily admit to be a bit tired of hearing it's all RfA's fault, yet not a single person has been able to present evidence that RfA is to blame. I am well aware of the riots that broke out around the beginning of the year. Though I did not comment on the userbox fiasco, I closely watched it. You might like to see my edits <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Talrias_9039.html#Another_outside_view_by_Durin" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Talrias">here</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_adminship_Archive_44_ff4c.html#Wikipedia_riots" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship/Archive 44">here</a> for some output from me regarding this situation. I believe it is quite serious. As for having "enough" admins; one of the primary tasks for admins is reverting vandalism. One metric for determining whether we need more admins or have enough is the number of edits per day per admin; i.e. the number of edits that need to be reviewed per admin, on average, to ensure that vandalism does not creep into the encyclopedia. You might be surprised to know that this number has shown an 80% increase over the last 10 months. Indeed, it appears RfA isn't promoting admins fast enough, even though the rate of admin promotions has been increasing as well. At this juncture, there is no evidence to suggest that RfA is the problem. It's conjecture. Are there bad admins getting through? Yes. RfA's fault? Hard to establish that, and even if there were that we could come up with a process to fix the problem. The source of the problem isn't, in my opinion, RfA. It's ArbCom and Jimbo. For example, for refusing to take a stance on wheel warring, and in fact in Jimbo's case engaging in it to a degree himself. See <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFAR_b522.html#Wheel_warring" title="WP:RFAR">WP:RFAR#Wheel_warring</a>. So far, it's 3-0 rejected. ArbCom has effectively vacated policy; it no longer applies. What matters is "common sense" and experience of past traditions. This is a terrible situation. You might like to have a look at <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_WikiProject_Policy_Matters_%28proposal%29_0f32.html" title="User:Rd232/WikiProject Policy Matters (proposal)">User:Rd232/WikiProject Policy Matters (proposal)</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProcess_is_Important_0fa4.html" title="Wikipedia:Process is Important">Wikipedia:Process is Important</a>. These are a step in the right direction I think. We are too large and too diverse of a community now to rely on "common sense". What is common sense to you might not be so to me, and vice versa. Process and policy must develop in consensus developed ways, and be enforced as such. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 20:58, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I think we have different vantage points with some similarity in views. I wouldn't say we disagree really. I've despaired that there is any one person who can solve all of the problems or find a core problem that undermines the impact of the other problems. I think we can induce change that corrects some of the problems. One of these is the current ArbCom election which is unseating a number of current ArbCom members. Re: vandalism. Yes, it's hard work fighting vandalism and the software needs to evolve to handle it far better than it does now. I've some thoughts about this <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_Flaws_4362.html#Vandalism" title="User:Durin/Flaws">here</a>. For my own part with regards to the riots, I haven't gotten involved. I am very self-strict about sticking to policy. With an exception, this has kept me out of trouble. I have seen the impact of the riots, and I am quite upset about it. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 21:27, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hodgdon has load data online, and Accurate has a free booklet they'll snail mail you (I requested one to supplement my out of date Speer manual). And Hodgdon does have a few loads for the .50 BMG listed, from 655 to 800 grain bullets:</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure the 750 @ 2800 is a near-match to the military loading. They also have Cowboy loads using Pyrodex black powder substitute, which should do for BP equivalent load data if you think that would be useful for the pre-1900s cartridges. <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluzwup_2550.html" title="User:Fluzwup">scot</a> 22:10, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, would you like to organize an effort to add velocity/energy info? I was pondering this myself, and I think a template might be in order. However, I would think that such a template would be best worked like the "userbox" template, where there is a "Ballistics" box, with nested smaller boxes of "55 gr / 2200 lb-f / 3680 fps". I'd just like to make sure it gets standardized. I'd be happy to go through adding the information to pages as I have time. <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvriette_f119.html" title="User:Avriette">Avriette</a> 22:16, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Point me in the right direction to start, and I'll try. I've never made a template before, so I'll need some help there, and you mentioned "WP:Weaponry" at some point--if that's a user group, I've never been to one before, and don't know how to get there. It'd be nice if the generation of templates could be automated--maybe start with a spreadsheet with weight/velocity pairs for differing loads from a source, then use a program to parse that that spit out filled out templates for each cartridge, with caliber, summary, source, and disclaimer. Those could then be cut and pasted into the appropriate pages. I can certainly do the spreadsheet and parser program, though it will take me a while--having too much spare time isn't exactly a concern of mine right now. I can grab a few minutes here and there, though, and a few days of that should be enough to get something going. And if we're going to automate this, we should DEFINATELY automate the metric conversions. I sure as heck have no grasp of ballistics in SI, I've worked in grains and ft-lbs. for too long--but even many Americans have even less of a grasp of a grain or a ft-lb than they do a gram or a newton-meter. <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluzwup_2550.html" title="User:Fluzwup">scot</a> 04:49, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>First off, see <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWeapon_ecc9.html" title="WP:Weapon">WP:Weapon</a>. However it seems inactive. We could probably recruit people. It seems to me that we're in the same boat. Either of us could write a quick tool to generate templates and do the conversion. However, we have two obstacles -- getting the data in a normalized format, and the design of the template. Once we have the data, we can fiddle with the template all we want. As well, there is a perl module to do conversions of units, so we might be able to do that (don't know what you were planning to use). Alternatively, we could probably do the conversion with Google's SOAP interface, but I hear that's unreliable of late. Do you know how to get past the "data entry" phase without lots of typing? Also, I notice that there's no <a href="../../../2E/2/2/.22-250_Remington_004b.html" title=".22-250 Remington">.22-250 Remington</a>. It seems to me that by actually getting the raw data, we could also create the stubs for the ammunition, and flesh it out somewhat. I think a category is probably also in order. Thoughts? <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvriette_f119.html" title="User:Avriette">Avriette</a> 07:38, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that it would be perfect for stubs--the basic ballistics, plus a breif note on appliations and history would probably be enough for most cartridges. It's only the ones with a long and checkered history, like .223 Remington, that really require much more than that. As far as format and entry goes, I think a spreadsheet with a given format would be fine, and then it can be hand entered. We don't care about powder, all we care about is ballistics, so we want bullet weights and velocities. Since all the reference stuff, at least in the US, is in grains and fps, then that would be the units for input. The data can be stored in comma separated value files (CSV), which are portable to just about anything, and can be parsed by any programming language. If we can get a group, then once we agree on a format, each person can volunteer to do a set of cartridges, say, .40-45 caliber handgun cartridges from Hogdon's website.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The CSV files can be concatenated together to make the "database", and then that can be processed by a program to generate the templates. I'm a C/C++ person primarily, so I'd probably pick that or a generic BASIC like QBASIC or SmallBASIC (slow (which won't matter) but OK for text processing, and readily available). Unit conversions can be done in the code, and should be pretty straightforward--7000/545 grains per gram, 12/39.37 meters per foot, and energy will take a bit more math, but we can find a simple conversion from ft-lbs to joules or whatever.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It would also be pretty easy, once the data was in hand, to generate a big list of cartridges, sorted by any given attribute and use that as a "list of" article. For example:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"List of cartridges sorted by bullet diameter"</li>
<li>"List of cartridges sorted by bullet mass"</li>
<li>"List of cartridges sorted by velocity"</li>
<li>"List of cartridges sorted by Taylor Knock-Out factor"</li>
<li>"List of cartridges sorted by IPSC power factor"</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>For those charts, you would probably sort by maximum, and also include the value for the minimum load as well. The lists would let you quickly compare calibers, and the template on the caliber pages would let you look at all those values for a given caliber all at once.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>To get all that, we'd need, for each load:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Name, bullet diameter (to .001 inches), bullet mass (grains), velocity (fps), +P (boolean)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>For loads with min/max data, supply both. The template could also have a slot for SAAMI max pressure for normal and +P, which could be supplied by hand (as it's going to be PSI or CUP, and may not be available for wildcats). <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluzwup_2550.html" title="User:Fluzwup">scot</a> 16:25, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the page for <a href="../../../j/o/u/Joule.html" title="Joule">Joule</a> or <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watt.html" title="Watt">watt</a> has the information to convert ft-lbs, kN etc. Or maybe it was <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horsepower.html" title="Horsepower">horsepower</a>. I forget. As far as templates, your best bet is to just read a couple. I'd suggest <a href="../../../m/a/i/Template%7EMain_f8c0.html" title="Template:Main">Template:Main</a> and any of the userboxes. I don't think we need any special flags for referring page, or anything like that. As far as how to get the data into a regular format, how do we do that? I could probably write something to scrape Hornady's site, but that would only get us the stuff they're selling. Furthermore, Hornady has many variations on the theme. A moly coated bullet is supposedly higher energy (because of slightly higer velocity...) than not. The Wiki style guide has a quick tutorial on creating tables, which we'd need to do, but it is <i>woefully</i> inadequate. <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvriette_f119.html" title="User:Avriette">Avriette</a> 18:44, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You know, after looking at the hodgdon page, I am confident I could scrape that into a CSV for us. We could then figure out what was missing, and scrape those where necessary. I've got some links elsewhere I could poll again. I think Black Hills also has data for some of their rounds. I can probably find data for newish rounds like the .338 LM and .410 chey-tac, as well.</dd>

<dd>I think something like the Infobox for catridges might work for individual cartridge data; have a row for each loading, and columns for weight, velocity, and calculated stats like energy, IPSC power factor and TKO. For the comparison charts, the table would work. Sorting by bullet mas and velocity we'd need 3 columns (name, mass, velocity). Sorting by calculated value, like energy, power factor or TKO we'd need 4--name, mass, velocity, and the calculated value in question. <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluzwup_2550.html" title="User:Fluzwup">scot</a> 20:42, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</pre>
<p>It breaks. Also I am not sure where the extra |} is coming from. With regards to formatting, I'd like to have some extra spacing between the columns, so that they don't run into eachother as they are now. What do you think? If this works, all that remains is to do the scraping, auto-generate it with perl, and stuff it into pages. One thing (and scot, you can probably answer this): the Hodgdon statistics list "bullet", "velocity", and "cup". I would imagine we can derive energy from those numbers. I don't know how to do that, however. Additionally, is CUP relevant if we want to give a realstic comparison for muzzle energy per each load? Also, if we wanted to put links in this to explain things (such as "energy", "Cartridge", CUP), where would you do it? Where would you indicate that this is <i>muzzle</i> energy, and is obviously different at 30, 100, etc yards. Note that there is a SAAMI article, but no CUP article. <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cartridge_%28weaponry%29.html" title="Cartridge (weaponry)">Cartridge (weaponry)</a> should work. Anyways, I'm going to ping Wwoods about this, I suspect he can help with the little bits.</p>

<dd>Wow, those look superb. (the above was Wwoods) My only concern is that they don't have parameters. While they look cleaner the way you had them, I'd like to be able to provide "arguments" such as mass= and so on. This way editors aren't going to mess up the display inadvertently. I know the ship articles all have tables like the one above, do you have a problem with people accidentally breaking them? Scot, what's your take on this? Would you rather pick one "standard" load per cartridge, or have statistics for several of them? There's a huge difference between a 230 gr .45 ACP +P and a 185 gr .45 ACP. Seems like it might be good to include both ends of the range...? Afterwhich, I can begin the scraping and autopopulate the tables, and we can divvy up the insertions.</dd>

<dd>Excited we can add this much content. That's going to be really nice if we can actually provide data for all the catridges we have.

<dd>The templates look good, from the outside at least (haven't puzzeled out the workings yet, gotta get cat out and dogs and and head to bed in a few minutes). I think we should definately have room for up to 3 loads; a lightweight, a heavyweight, and a "standard" load (which will be a source for argument, but such is life). Some loads may only have two, and some might only have one. As far as parameterization goes, if we plan on doing the bulk of the work in one big chunk with automated tools, I don't see that it makes a big difference at this point. <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluzwup_2550.html" title="User:Fluzwup">scot</a> 04:03, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So, what about the layout? If you want several different loads, then I guess the two-column format won't suit. Do you really want a link to a Category at the top, looking like it leads to an general article on cartridges? Maybe a link to the Category, or to a list of cartridges would go better at the bottom? Is this field wedded to premetric units, or do we need to make room for conversions? "CUP" needs a link to an explanation, and maybe a unit. It's a pretty wide table—do you want this toward the top of an article, with text flowing around it, or down at the bottom and centered? What about including a picture?</dd>

<dd>CUP and LUP, copper uints of pressure and lead units of pressure, probably should have their own articles. They are specific to firearms, and don't translate well into PSI or other pressure units, as the are more representative of the area under the pressure curve than they are of peak pressure. Velocity, mass, and energy will probably need conversions, and pressure in PSI can be converted. Might be best to leave space for 2 units for each (maybe 3 for pressure if SAAMI has both CUP/LUP and PSI for some cartridges) and let the automated table generator handle the conversions. Things like IPSC power factor and TKO don't really have equivalent metric units, so they won't need room for conversions. As far as pictures go, I think it might be better to have those be separate from the table, since not all cartridges will have them. <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluzwup_2550.html" title="User:Fluzwup">scot</a> 20:24, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've never operated the M14, the Wikipedia description wasn't perfectly clear. I thought the M14 was gas operated. Is it the same as Ruger's Mini-14?</p>
<p>I referred to a Benelli SBE as "recoil operated" in a duck camp once, and the owner thought I was nuts. He felt that term should be reserved for the older Browning shotguns and big military guns, where the barrel moved rearward. With respect to that discussion, a clarification between blowback, gas operated, recoil operated, and inertia operated should be useful.</p>
<p>I have heard the the modern inertia design comes from a Swedish design of 1908. <a href="../../../r/p/e/User%7ERPellessier_94d6.html" title="User:RPellessier">RPellessier</a> | <a href="../../../r/p/e/User_talk%7ERPellessier_43a0.html" title="User talk:RPellessier">Talk</a> 19:55, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Garand series (M-1, M-14, Mini-14) are all gas operated, and actually show the evolution of the design quite well--long stroke, short stroke/captive piston, and short stroke with a self cleaning piston. If you do have any ation questions, I can probably answer them. Chances are I've shot one, taken one apart, or laughed derisively at the patent (say, for example, the "blow forward" action--discovered when I went to a patent library with the express purpose of looking up the most silly possible firearm operating mechanism I could come up with, only to find it had in fact been patented about a decade or two earlier). <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluzwup_2550.html" title="User:Fluzwup">scot</a> 20:11, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear Avriette, I think that there was no big typo confusing finite and infinite. The equivalence may be proved exactly and rigorously for an infinite number of colors. For a finite number, it is more confusing but assuming that one gets the bound state of the top and antitop with the desired interactions, it is not really possible to distinguish an elementary Higgs from a composite one. The difference between elementary particles and composite ones only becomes sharp in the limit of weak coupling but it is violated in this model, and it is infinitely strongly violated for many colors... --<a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumidek_c9b2.html" title="User:Lumidek">Lumidek</a> 05:06, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Good morning. Thank you for your comments on my Talk page. That text was originally added to the article as a result of a dispute about a year ago (though I may have the timing wrong) when a reader questioned the very existence of the "blank cartridge". Not knowing the reasons behind the practice, the reader considered it incredible. It was easy to prove that the technique was used in at least some cases and to show why. The psychological factors in such situations have actually been studied in great detail. The studies I know of were conducted primarily by the US Army. Selective or malleable memory is a known coping mechanism for stress disorders triggered by combat guilt. The guilt associated with executions is closely related. By briefly explaining the practice, we have been able to preempt other claims that "it never happened". Given that we are documenting practices that are largely historic, we have recurring problems with readers who are unaware of the context and who doubt anything they can't find in Google. I encourage the scepticism but this particular research is too old to be online (at least, as far as I know).</p>
<p>So I would politely dispute your characterisation of the description as "apologetic". I consider it a fact no more value-laden than the observation that most condemned are blindfolded. I do strongly agree with you that we should be consise but not to the point of sacrificing facts or knowledge. If we can agree on the appropriateness of the content, I would encourage your continued copyedits to the article. I don't pretend to be a master of golden prose.</p>
<p>Thanks also for your update on HANEs. I originally intended to draft that article based on an earlier Scientific American article on the topic. I thought they used "event" in that article but my memory could be off. I've also fallen more than a bit behind in my reading.

<p>I explained my position on the talk page. The addition of the infobox/dialects box is inappropriate. The comments on the WP:FACR page said the same thing. Do not artificially elevate that form of slang based on your whims. You must cite reliable sources that classify it as anything more than slang. IF you want to make that article featured again, you'll need to be extra watchful for these sorts of unsourced additions... it is why it is no longer feature - a victim of the culture it tries to describe. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 06:45, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I did cite sources which describe it as an emergent language. Did you actually <i>read</i> those sources? Second, the reason it is no longer a FA is because you initiated the process to remove it. Nobody but you was complaining. Lastly, you expressed displeasure over the use of the language infobox. I changed it to a dialect infobox, which I felt was more appropriate. I still do. And I agree that the language infobox doesn't really belong there. However, that's not what we're discussing. As I said, I'd like some third party involvement in this. Additionally, I'd like you to <i>read</i> the sources before stating that I need to find more. I worked pretty hard to find the ones I added, and I did in fact read them. <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvriette_f119.html" title="User:Avriette">Avriette</a> 06:59, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You recently voted to oppose my Request for Adminship, based on the fact that I had stated I wanted to be able to edit protected pages. It seems I had not made myself clear, which I have tried to rectify.</p>
<p>I desire to be an admin, and part of that is the ability to edit protected pages. I specifically mentioned it, because it is perhaps the most visible part of being an admin. See for example <a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProtected_7bf5.html" title="Template:Protected">Template:Protected</a>, where I was forced to impose on another editor's time to make a simple formatting change. I do not desire to edit protected pages haphazardly, and firmly believe that all such edits must be discussed and easily reversible.</p>
<p>You may have other issues with my request, and I can accept honest criticism. But since you may have voted negatively because of a misunderstanding, I would ask you to please reconsider your vote (or at least your reasoning). Thank you. -- <a href="../../../e/c/5/User_talk%7EEc5618_ab71.html" title="User talk:Ec5618">Ec5618</a> 14:42, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b><a href="../../../i/e/d/Image%7EIed_munitions.jpg_809f.html" title="Image:Ied munitions.jpg">Image:Ied munitions.jpg</a></b>. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is therefore unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then you need to argue that we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then you can use {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL_bb04.html" title="Template:GFDL">GFDL</a>}} to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, please read <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>. See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a> for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other media, please check that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Avriette_Archive3_5008.html" title="Special:Contributions/Avriette/Archive3">my contributions</a>" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting "Image" from the dropdown box.
