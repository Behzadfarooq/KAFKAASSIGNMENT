<p>From meriam webster:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Main Entry: 1gen·der<br />
Pronunciation: 'jen-d&amp;r<br />
Function: noun<br />
Etymology: Middle English gendre, from Middle French genre, gendre, from Latin gener-, genus birth, race, kind, gender -- more at KIN<br />
<br />
1 a&#160;: a subclass within a grammatical class (as noun, pronoun, adjective, or verb) of a language that is partly arbitrary but also partly based on distinguishable characteristics (as shape, social rank, manner of existence, or sex) and that determines agreement with and selection of other words or grammatical forms b&#160;: membership of a word or a grammatical form in such a subclass c&#160;: an inflectional form showing membership in such a subclass<br />
<br />
2 a&#160;: SEX &lt;the feminine gender&gt; b&#160;: the behavioral, cultural, or psychological traits typically associated with one sex</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Sex" is more specific. Historically, it was not synonomous with "gender." As a bit of a prescriptive grammarian, it rankles me to see the two confused.</p>
<p>I do not care to create an account to discuss it further. Wikipedia takes all types of input, including mine.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You're being an ass about this. It isn't a matter of being a <i>prescriptive grammarian</i>, and I am not <b>confused</b> about same. <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex.html" title="Sex">Sex</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gender.html" title="Gender">Gender</a> are two very, <i>very</i> different things. Note I link off my home node to <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berdache.html" title="Berdache">berdache</a> (which I now realize is pejorative, but I digress). I think in the text affected, <i>It is interesting to note that the sex of this character changed between movies and television series.</i>, that since we did not see a <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penis.html" title="Penis">penis</a> or a <a href="../../../v/a/g/Vagina.html" title="Vagina">vagina</a> and the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Care_Bears_d522.html" title="Care Bears">Care Bears</a> are anatomically barren, the <b><a href="../../../g/e/n/Gender.html" title="Gender">gender</a></b> of the creature changed. In fact, I can be a human male, or a potted flower, or a giant <a href="../../../m/o/b/Moby_Dick_3f81.html" title="Moby Dick">white whale</a>, and have a <i>gender</i> that is unique to me. Be it male, female, <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berdache.html" title="Berdache">berdache</a>, or something else. The <i>gender</i> of the bear changed, not the <i>sex</i>. The latter would have been impossible. I would imagine (and I looked) that images from the actual movie are copyrighted and as such do not appear on the intarweb very much, but <a href="http://www.timelesstrinkets.com/CareBears/Images/PlushCubRabbit.jpg" class="external text" title="http://www.timelesstrinkets.com/CareBears/Images/PlushCubRabbit.jpg" rel="nofollow">here</a> is a reasonably good approximation of said rabbit. Sex change not possible, gender change entirely possible.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Lastly, perhaps to summarize it more clearly, as I've beaten around the, ahem, bush, somewhat here, is that <b>gender is a role</b>, and <b>sex is a physical apparatus</b>. You look at a <a href="../../../c/a/r/Care_Bear_356d.html" title="Care Bear">Care Bear</a> and you tell me which is possible to change, outside of <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fanfiction.html" title="Fanfiction">fanfiction</a>. <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvriette_f119.html" title="User:Avriette">Avriette</a> 16:23, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>LOL! I absolutely <i>love</i> your edit summary. &#160;:-) Okay, I don't exactly see the adjectives "uncooperative" and "childish" as applicable, but I agree it would have been nice if I had left a message for you. I do apologize for not taking the time to give you that courtesy. To be honest, though, I hadn't realized I had changed more than one. I recall your name from the Arbiter article, where I eventually changed it from Speedy to VfD, but I didn't realize I had changed any other tags you submitted. I had to go through my contributions to find the other one. I'm sorry. If I had realized I was changing multiple submissions by the same person, I probably would have left you a note. I didn't realize it. BTW, I agree with you about the amount of trivia (I still use the word "fancruft") in Wikipedia. I don't envy you the job of cleaning up the Care Bear situation.

<p>Oh my! I love your advogato diary, and I love your edit summaries! Just a piece of advice: correcting Wikipedia braindeath by means of hand editing and VfDs is a hopeless activity.

<p>Unfortunately, I don't have irc access. I (gasp) don't have online access at home, but I've been seriously considering RR. That way I could do something more productive at home than play Morrowind. &#160;:-) Anything you would like to ask, feel free to.

<p>Hey, just read some of your recent stuff in your diary with respect to fancruft, and if you haven't already, you should definitely check out <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EFancruft_9652.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Fancruft">Wikipedia talk: Fancruft</a>. This subject understandably comes up a lot. My personal attitude is that, if there exists a group of related stub articles, they should be combined into a single, possibly worthwhile article; take a look at <a href="../../../o/c/a/The_Legend_of_Zelda%7E_Ocarina_of_Time_characters_1770.html" title="The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters</a> for a good example. Originally each section of this article was its own article, which was quite annoying.</p>
<p>I understand that you might reject such content as being encyclopedia-worthy at all because of its limited scope and influence, but I tend to lean towards inclusionism and am embarassed to admit I wrote the original article on <a href="../../../v/e/s/Vespene_gas.html" title="Vespene gas">Vespene gas</a>, so I suppose I can't really talk. <a href="../../../d/c/o/User%7EDcoetzee_a2a7.html" title="User:Dcoetzee">Deco</a> 05:37, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

I wish you hadn't shown me <a href="../../../v/e/s/Vespene_gas.html" title="Vespene gas">Vespene gas</a>, which also frightens me. However, I am suitably satiated from my carebears jihad that I will leave the wikipedia alone for a few days. Then I may have some content to add. I have some new pictures for <a href="../../../u/s/m/USMC_2798.html" title="USMC">USMC</a> weapons systems that we don't have and are not copyrighted (gubbermint and all).</dd>

<dd>Don't get me wrong, I do appreciate your cleanup and if you think <i>Vespene gas</i> should go I would understand. I've conducted a number of efforts that mysteriously met violent opposition, such as changing the archaic British spelling "connexion" to "connection", but you have to edit for what you believe in.

<p>Hi Avriette and thanks for the note. Pointers for aircraft (including helos) are at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Aircraft_8cfc.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Aircraft">Wikipedia:WikiProject Aircraft</a>, where you'll also find links to the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Aircraft_Categories_e77e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Aircraft/Categories">category system</a> and current <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Aircraft_page_content_894f.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Aircraft/page content">standard layout</a> for these articles. I standardised your <a href="../../../c/h/-/CH-21_Shawnee_396c.html" title="CH-21 Shawnee">CH-21 Shawnee</a> article as an example.</p>
<p>While there are now some quite evolved standards for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Ships_8d3c.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Ships">warships</a> and aircraft, standards for weapon systems more generally are all over the shop. There seems to have been an effort at creating a navigational template for missiles ( {{Missile types}} ), but it hasn't been widely rolled out, and perhaps was really only intended for general articles on categories of missile rather than specific systems anyway. Similarly, while a standard spec table for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Weaponry_75f4.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Weaponry">small arms</a> was developed, it hasn't been implemented widely (and WikiProject Weaponry is now listed as inactive anyway).</p>
<p>There have been at least two attempts to develop a broad-based and consistent way to categorise weapons, but neither went very far.</p>
<p>Given the mess, at the moment I really only try to make sure that weapons articles are reasonably well-classified, and that aircraft weapon systems carry the {{airlistbox}} template. I also list new aircraft articles <a href="../../../n/e/w/Wikipedia%7ENew_articles_%28Aircraft%29_b66b.html" title="Wikipedia:New articles (Aircraft)">here</a> and standardise them when I get the time (currently bogged down in mid-February).</p>
<p>If you want to have a stab at it, some kind of consistency is desperately needed for weapons on Wikipedia. At the moment, it's pretty much a model of the <i>worst</i> aspects of collaborative editing, so it'll be a long-term project!

<dd>I have to say that I disagree very much with your re-edit of the Shawnee's page. It isn't particularly important, as the <i>flying banana</i> hasn't flown since 1964 outside of air shows. However, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F/A-18_Hornet" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F/A-18_Hornet" rel="nofollow">the fa/18</a> (sorry, c/p) and you've got this fancy table on the right. I created the table for the shawnee from a "template" i had been using which I now realize that had been used from the weapons systems page -- the <a href="../../../m/2/0/M203.html" title="M203">M203</a> (although of course, I used wikinotation instead of html) example. I like it a lot, and used it on, for example. the <a href="../../../g/a/u/GAU-17_9afb.html" title="GAU-17">GAU-17</a>, <a href="../../../m/1/4/M14_%28rifle%29.html" title="M14 (rifle)">M14 (rifle)</a> among others. It is a very standardized, almost "trading card" like format, from which it is easy to discern all aspects of the weapon, plane, whatever. I think the format of:</dd>

If it is just yields we are talking about, then MOAB shouldn't be on the chart at all with the Tsar Bomba. I don't get the logic. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 04:30, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I figured somebody would take issue with it. See <a href="../../../i/v/y/Ivy_King_3fa9.html" title="Ivy King">Ivy King</a> for what a "super bomb" is compared to <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Boy_994b.html" title="Little Boy">Little Boy</a>. They weren't superbombs even for their time. At the time they were being detonated, much bigger and higher yield bombs were being developed. The reason BLU-82 belongs there and MOAB as well alongside Tsar Bomba is we are talking two entirely separate types of bombs. The Tsar Bomba was the biggest, meanest nuclear weapon ever built.

<p>Regardless of "Taiwan" being the prevalent common name for the country, "Taiwan" is only the main part of the territories that ROC administers.

<p>Hi Alex: How are you? Thank you for your note on my user page. I did the page on Jake from Daria because that night I wasnt inspired to write about much else, and if you look at <a href="../../../d/a/r/Daria.html" title="Daria">Daria</a>, other people have written about other characters so I felt I had the green light to go ahead. I do hope that future generations appreciate my writings, and yours and everyone else's because that is precisely why this wikipedia is so lovable and enjoyable; we break away from Brittanica and other, normal encyclopedias in that we cover topics they certainly would never cover.</p>
<p>Apart from that, you were right about pointing out the "clear" situation. English isnt my first language, so I couldnt find a better word for the suit's color. But today I realized Ocean Blue is more like it and so I corrected it. BTW, Ive never seen a suit of that color either, that must be a cartoon writer's imagination invention!</p>
<p>Anyways, happy trails around wikipedia and I hope youre enjoying your experience here as much as I am!</p>

<p>Is it really necessary to add that it is a video game and hence fiction?

<dd>It is silly to put entries about Star Wars characters into the wikipedia. That, however, is really another discussion. See <a href="../../../f/i/c/Template%7EFiction_983c.html" title="Template:Fiction">Template:Fiction</a>. This is a recurring problem in the wikipedia: fiction is presented as being somehow factual. With the vast networks of fictional characters and places, such as with <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_earth.html" title="Middle earth">middle earth</a>, it is possible for people to become confused or at least misled. One such example of this is <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Donald_O%27Brien_d9d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Donald O'Brien">Donald O'Brien</a>.

<dd>Sheesh, don't be so uptight! No, I don't really have a problem with it- I'm not going to revert it or anything; it just seemed a waste of time to me, and I was letting you know so. And the 'fictional' data that was presented as 'factual' was in fact 'factual'- 'Atris is a X in X' is completely factual. And really, does anyone think that a person from something called 'Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2' is going to be anything but fictional? C'mon, have some respect for the reader's intelligence!

<p>Hi! If you don't make a picture a thumbnail, you can set it to 300px and fill the box. (Note that the caption then has to be added as well as the picture's alternate text.) With PD images, you can potentially save editors on other wikis a few steps by loading them to the Wikimedia Commons, instead of just to en:wikipedia. <a href="../../../w/w/o/User%7EWwoods_7169.html" title="User:Wwoods">—wwoods</a> 21:43, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have ranted many times that the wikipedia needs to push more towards machine-parsable data. In the case of making a picture a thumbnail, rather than including a new sequence:</dd>
</dl>
<pre>
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt; [[image... ]] &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt; image description &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
</pre>
<dl>
<dd>the following is much easier to parse:</dd>
</dl>
<pre>
  [[Image:imagename|thumb|&lt;size&gt;|&lt;position&gt;|&lt;caption&gt;]]
</pre>
<dl>
<dd>I use thumbnails judiciously in my contributions to tables. I don't see why it needs to "fill the width of the table", and I don't think it looks any worse for it. As far as wikimedia commons goes, I haven't figured that part out yet, but I am not opposed to doing it. I could write a bot to upload all my images to the wikicommons. Note that on my <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvriette_f119.html" title="User:Avriette">user page</a> I discuss my desire to have an entirely machine parsable wikipedia. That is until somebody comes up with an API for mining it. Right now it's fine to use, but is near impossible to use for automated requests. Eg., I want to write an app that is able to extract all specifications for any <a href="../../../u/s/m/USMC_2798.html" title="USMC">USMC</a> weapon. Right now, that's close to possible because I've been so hard at work standardizing those pages. But the further you stray from that, say WikiProject Ships, or WikiProject Planes, you need a new parser. Standardize data, and it becomes a much more valuable resource. Make it machine parsable, and an API can be written. This is A Good Thing. <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvriette_f119.html" title="User:Avriette">Avriette</a> 01:21, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I've also been making an effort to standardise things with respect to the WikiProject Ships' data. I've written a template based table that basically covers all or at least all the most important bases when it comes to putting ship data in. The advantage of it is also that being in standard format, data can be parsed from it a good deal easily than with the standard table format that is followed at the moment. At the moment there are sufficient variations to make it almost impossible to write a parser to extract data.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This comes into thumbnails vs full-width images as well. I think that full-width images look better when compared to thumbnails. Also, with my template table it does matter. The variable for the image contains the standard information about the image like its filename, location, alt attribute etc. Then there is a separate variable which deals with the caption for the image, thus making it machine-parsable. I hope you will look at what I've done and see what you think. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Newton_8a3b.html" title="User:David Newton">David Newton</a> 14:58, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That would be fine if people followed the convention. However, there are cases like <a href="../../../a/-/4/A-4_Skyhawk_6839.html" title="A-4 Skyhawk">A-4_Skyhawk</a> where people have NOT followed the convention. If we use thumbnails and standard templates, we can begin to have the workings of machine parsable data. I really think that is a goal we should work towards. I would <i>love</i> to write an API that could pull down information from the wikipedia. Imagine:</dd>

<pre>
  #!/usr/bin/perl
  use Wikipedia::Article;

<dl>
<dd>There's no reason *not* to strive for conformability. There are some among us who take a more anarchistic view on things, like the wikipedia is a free-form encyclopedia, and every article should have its own "style" and so on. In fact, look at the history of the <a href="../../../c/h/-/CH-21_Shawnee_396c.html" title="CH-21 Shawnee">CH-21 Shawnee</a> and you tell me which revision (mine or <a href="../../../r/l/a/User%7ERlandmann_a23c.html" title="User:Rlandmann">Rlandmann</a>'s) was more machine-parsable. It's probably an uphill battle, but I'm willing to fight tooth and nail for it. Many of these things can be bot'ed. The WWW::Wikipedia module on cpan is more or less limited to this:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<pre>
  use WWW::Wikipedia;
  my $wiki = WWW::Wikipedia-&gt;new();

  ## search for 'perl'

<dd>(Well, since you're back...) "Machine-parsable" is good, but <i>if</i> we have to choose, "human-parsable" is more important. Scaling an image down from 300 pixels to 270 means giving up 10% of the width, and ~20% of the area; it's a small, but non-trivial, loss.

Since you do not mind my "merciless edits" I'll be happy to help you out. As to photos, my philosophy is this (and I provide a lot of photos to Wikipedia): "When a better photo comes along, use it (instead)". By (instead) in parenths I mean: leave the old one in there for awhile, the length of time dependent upon how obviously better the new one(s) is/are. Put your photos up in the article. If they are an improvement, I (or someone else) will quietly remove the less valuable and obviously redundant one(s). The idea is to constantly improve (as well as expand) the Wikipedia, and there is only limited room for photos in most articles. BTB, nice to meet you. How are you getting out here so much?

<dd>Well, we first came out in November of 2004 for what was supposed to be our wedding and honeymoon (a conflict with my <a href="../../../a/o/l/AOL_c152.html" title="AOL">then-employer</a> prevented wedding from happening). We completely fell in love with Oahu, after staying at both Ko'Olina and Waikiki (the Ihilani and the Hyatt, respectively). Then I interviewed for a position on the <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subaru_%28telescope%29.html" title="Subaru (telescope)">Subaru telescope</a> for <a href="../../../f/u/j/Fujitsu.html" title="Fujitsu">Fujitsu</a>, which was on the big island, <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hilo%2C_Hawaii_e9d9.html" title="Hilo, Hawaii">Hilo-side</a>. They paid for that trip. After the trip to Hilo, I changed <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">employers</a> and decided I wasn't going to get caught up in the job again and let the wedding wait 6 months or a year. It was time to head back to Oahu, this time to really <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/avriette/sets/221590/" class="external text" title="http://flickr.com/photos/avriette/sets/221590/" rel="nofollow">get married</a>, at the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Mililani.html" title="Mililani">Mililani</a> <a href="../../../j/o/d/Jodo_Shinshu_ca90.html" title="Jodo Shinshu">Hongwanji</a> temple. I start with the new employer on Monday, 4/25. However, we have bought a timeshare between the three trips (three trips to HI in 6 mos!), and will probably wind up going back to TBI to stay on the Kona side, at the Hilton Kohala Resort. I still haven't gotten up to <a href="../../../m/a/u/Mauna_Loa_a957.html" title="Mauna Loa">Mauna Loa</a> and I never saw <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilauea.html" title="Kilauea">Kilauea</a>, so I'm anxious to go back. However, we do need to get back to the temple in Mililani, so we will most likely be doing a week or two in Kona and a week in Oahu. I would expect that to come in six months or so. We've also discussed a hunting trip to Lanai (although there is ample hunting on TBI, so I dunno whether that will happen).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As far as "merciless edits" go, I was initially kind of upset about the <a href="../../../m/a/k/Makapuu.html" title="Makapuu">Makapuu</a> thing, but when I saw how you had actually done the merge, I was happy with it. My concern was having the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Hawaii_state_parks_9a3a.html" title="List of Hawaii state parks">List of Hawaii state parks</a> updated and appropriately linked to wikipedia articles. Which, incidentally, I think is kind of a wreck. There are a lot of "parks" on Oahu in specific, many of which are state-maintained, but do not bear names. One such park is the beach at Maili on the leeward coast (appx 30 mins north of Ko'Olina). I've got pictures of it, but I'm not sure what to call it. The locals called it "the park across the street". Additionally, there are some state parks, like Makapuu, which don't really require an entire page for themselves, or for which an entire page would be overkill. I am not sure, however, what to do about it.</dd>

<dd>We seem to have very convergent thoughts on the wikipedia (although mine may be a little more vocal and radical), which is to improve the overall quality of it, a page at a time.

<dd>Well <i>aloha</i> and <i>e komo mai</i>. On small "unnamed" parks: Hawaii has always been short on signs (and they do get ripped off all the time) so names of parks, etc. probably exist but are not obvious in many cases. Send me the picture, or post it on your user page and I might be able to name the place for you. I'm an environmental consultant and have been all over the place in my nearly 40 years living/working in Hawaii. The best way (IMHO) to handle the little parks and other interesting places is to tuck them into articles about the area, just as I did for <a href="../../../m/a/k/Makapuu.html" title="Makapuu">Makapuu</a>. I recently created <a href="../../../k/o/k/Koko_Head_1fb0.html" title="Koko Head">Koko Head</a> to cover the many scenic spots between <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawaii_Kai%2C_Hawaii_7078.html" title="Hawaii Kai, Hawaii">Hawaii Kai, Hawaii</a> and Makapuu.

<p>Hey. You tried to add a comment or article to VfD not long ago, but it got mixed up and I couldn't figure out where it was meant to go. I've removed it from the page as it ended up as a comment under a VfD which was added after your comment. As you know where/what its meant to be, you should be able to reinstate it. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 01:46, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>Thanks for the message about <a href="../../../2/0/7/User%7E207.239.12.200.html" title="User:207.239.12.200">User:207.239.12.200</a> yesterday. Unfortunately you caught me after I had finished editing for the day. Even more unfortunately, blocking that IP last night probably wouldn't have helped much. Blocking is a relatively blunt tool - it only lasts 24hrs, so it only works against an active vandal. It is not intended as a punishment, but rather to prevent continued vandalism whilst we patch up any existing damage.</p>
<p>That IP edited the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a> article several days ago and there haven't been any edits since. Assuming it is a shared IP at a school, it is unlikely that anyone would have been there to notice the block on a Sunday.</p>
<p>The best we can do it keep an eye on them and apply a block the next time they are actively vandalising articles. Otherwise it will be a different person who is likely to see the warning messages and the block would probably have little effect.</p>
<p>In the longer term, the most effective weapon against vandals, is to show that their edits won't stick since they are easy for us to revert, they won't wind anyone up too much and their efforts are generally futile. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 21:11, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Which edits in particular do you have a problem with?</p>
<ul>
<li>added the word "supposed" in "Some say the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_invasion_of_Iraq_768c.html" title="2003 invasion of Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a> is part of the "war on terror," most notably but not exclusively because of Hussein's supposed <a href="../../../w/m/d/WMD_f3b3.html" title="WMD">WMD</a> activities,". Even the US administration admits there were no WMDs so some kind of qualification seemed necessary.
<ul>
<li>"supposed" casts disbelief on the subject.
<ul>
<li>Good heavens. Surely you're not saying that you still believe in the WMD? Even poor old Colin Powell has given up on that one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>updated the civilian casualty figures and removed some garbled text
<ul>
<li>updated by a factor of ten or more, not quoting a source, and using a source which is widely discredited.
<ul>
<li>The source was there before my edit (the WP article which leads to the primary sources) I gave the range of figures which are in the article and are commonly cited. The high end figure of 100,000 has been disputed by some and supported by others but it can't be discredited, simply because nobody has done a better study.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>added the Amnesty International criticism. Seemed to fit pretty well with the section heading (Criticisms of the War on terror)
<ul>
<li>which is entirely incorrect, has been derided in popular press, and should be considered <i>entirely</i> pov.
<ul>
<li>It's a widely reported criticism of the war on terror by the world's foremost human rights organization (a group often quoted by the Bush administration whenever AI is talking about other countries). It's certainly Amnesty International's POV, but reporting that they hold that POV is entirely appropriate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Updated the US casualty figures which were about a year out of date
<ul>
<li>fine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tightened up the budget bullet without changing the content.
<ul>
<li>fine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reworded the "failure to provide WMD evidence" bullet without substantially changing the content.
<ul>
<li>you changed the inflection. that's called POV.
<ul>
<li>Every edit changes the inflection to some degree. If you see a problem with the edit, please fix it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Removed the CIA bullet because it seemed wildly tangential.
<ul>
<li>agree with this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sorry about the misleading edit summary, it was a bit more than a cleanup. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 02:36, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
