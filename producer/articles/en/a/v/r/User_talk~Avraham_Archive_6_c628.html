<p>a recent comment of his.

<dd>Thanks, I'm sure he did not mean to purposely mischaracterize the proceedings; more likely it is the result of frustration that all involved are feeling about the article.

<dd>Yes, work on this article has indeed been frustrating, you're right about that. For one thing, I have Amoruso following me to other people's talk pages and turning them into a battleground, and now his actions make me think even stronger that he is looking at every single entry on my edit history pages. Don't you see anything wring with him calling one of my statements a lie and choosing to to another one of my statements a personal attack <i>when he has no good reason to say either</i>?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I presume you have seen all the stuff he has done, and as an administrator you should have addressed this long ago, or at the very least referred another admin here if you felt too involved in the debate. Instead you seemingly let it slide by, only to jump on me about <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> after a single comment by him that falsely accuses me of lies and personal attacks. It is bad enough to have had Amoruso make <i>actual</i> personal attacks against me, but to have an administrator who ignores <i>that</i> and talks to me about AGF when I have not even come close to violating it is annoying to say the least.</dd>

<dd>Anyway, I have responded to your comment on my talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Markovich292&amp;diff=80757222&amp;oldid=80572079" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Markovich292&amp;diff=80757222&amp;oldid=80572079" rel="nofollow">here</a> which hopefully debunks the claim of personal attacks and lies. I have also asked you to clarify why you are using the term "mischaracterize" as well. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkovich292_9f23.html" title="User:Markovich292"><font color="green"><b>Markovich292</b></font></a> 04:47, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Avi, it seems the compromise is even larger now with official acceptance of it by the user Mantanmoreland on the MA talk page, one of the chief discussioners.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad&amp;curid=2071383&amp;diff=80763516&amp;oldid=80761341" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad&amp;curid=2071383&amp;diff=80763516&amp;oldid=80761341" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Note than nobody disagreed to this proposal as a temporary solution, never, also not at the first time, except for some anon named TopRank <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad/Archive_6#Anti_Semitism_Category" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad/Archive_6#Anti_Semitism_Category" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. So basically there was never an explicit disagreement to the compromise and there's a wide agreement to the compromise now.

<p>Thanks for a reminder. I didn't realise I had crossed the lines of civility and made a personal attack&#160;:). I didn't mean anything bad by my comment that he constantly added Zionists comments. I just wanted a good justification for why I was rechaning it. I'll be more careful in the future. BTW, should I appologize to him on his talk page (since I can't take back the edit summury) or otherwise let him know that I did not mean to be negative to him.&#160;??<a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKitler005_3d4f.html" title="User:Kitler005">Sup dudes?[[User:Kitler005</a>]] 20:58, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Vote to delete Medzhibozh (Hasidic dynasty)</span></h2>
<p>I have written the following to the nominator:</p>
<p>Meshulam: You should avoid this kind of move (the hasty nomination to delete <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Medzhibozh_%28Hasidic_dynasty%29_1fb7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Medzhibozh (Hasidic dynasty)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Medzhibozh (Hasidic dynasty)</a>) because <i>it's a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/slippery_slope" class="extiw" title="wikt:slippery_slope">slippery slope</a></i> and could lead to the nomination for and deletion of similar articles about smaller Hasidic dynasties - by people who are not experts and don't care - with unintended consequences. Votes to delete are open to the world and you are inviting people who have no idea what this topic is about at all to cast a vote, which is very unfair and lacking insight. It seems that you may have been better off trying to add a {{<a href="../../../m/e/r/Template%7EMerge_to_78ed.html" title="Template:Merge to">merge to</a>}} template or considered MERGING the material at some point perhaps and WAITED (at least a month!) to do so. You should also have first started a discussion at a number of places where people who know something about this topic could have given their intelligent input, such as at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Judaism_1a41.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Judaism">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Judaism</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EOrthodox_Rabbinical_Biography_Collaboration_of_the_Week_61ff.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Orthodox Rabbinical Biography Collaboration of the Week">Wikipedia talk:Orthodox Rabbinical Biography Collaboration of the Week</a>. Or you could have contacted other editors who deal with topics like this to solicit their views. This action of your is extreme and I do not condone it. I urge you to withdraw this nomination. Thank you.

<dd>Hey Avi - there is a jewish group that specifically opposes religious cirucmcision. I would feel more comfortable with you adding it to the article's section on jewish circumcision.

<p>Do you think it is controversial to claim that Jews call their Tanakh "the Bible?" I don't. Do you think it is controversial to claim that "the Bible" refers only to the combined "Old Testament" and "New Testament," i.e. is a term that refers to the sacred scriptures of Christians (but not Jews)? I do, but this is precisely the claim Home Computer is making on the Bible talk page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bible#Current_layout" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bible#Current_layout" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bible#Current_layout</a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">etiquette discussion at circ talk page</span></h2>
<p>Avi,</p>
<p>You know that longish section at the circ talk page that focuses more on the etiquettes of inter-editor dialogue than on the subject of the article? Would you consider moving that whole section to the complaining editor's talk page? Based on your post there it appears that you might agree with me about this. It is an unfortunate request because both the primary editor involved and the target of his discontent are both generally excellent contributors to that page and I hadn't been aware of any specific conflict between them. However having such a personalized dialogue on a "public" talk page is not fair to the targeted editor. I've discussed this with the affected editor by e-mail and while he would be content to just let the thing get archived away eventually, he also wouldn't mind if the thing were removed to an appropriate place. This request comes from me, not him; I discussed it with him by e-mail just to see how he would react if I contacted an admin about the situation. The only thing that comes to my mind while writing this now is that if the discussion is removed to a user talk page it may linger in plain sight much longer than it would if archived at the circ page. Anyhow, I still don't think it belongs at circ -- but I have nothing more to contribute on the point. Do what you think is best for all concerned.

<p>My point for removing those lines were obvious. This is journalism, and here, in wikipedia, is not allowed.</p>
<p>It seems that you think anyone that do not accept your opinion is a vandal: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AHossein.ir&amp;diff=82770635&amp;oldid=82251986" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AHossein.ir&amp;diff=82770635&amp;oldid=82251986" rel="nofollow">diff</a>]</p>
<p>Anyway, read <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biographies_of_living_persons.html" title="Biographies of living persons">Biographies_of_living_persons</a>, writing style section for more information. You can read parts of it here:</p>
<p>The writing style should be neutral, factual, and understated, avoiding both a sympathetic point of view and an advocacy journalism point of view.</p>
<p>The nice thing about you is that you do your personal attacks with what I call "misunderstanding voice of common with your opinion". When you want to call someone a vandal, you say that "All the wikipedians think that you're vandal". This is not different with saying "I think you're a vandal".</p>
<p>So, don't call me vandal again. Thanks. --<a href="../../../h/o/s/User%7EHossein.ir_5f79.html" title="User:Hossein.ir">Hossein.ir</a> 16:44, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Avraham,</p>
<p>I see looking at the <a href="../../../u/w/_/WP%7EUW_de83.html" title="WP:UW">WikiProject user warnings</a> page, that you are a participant in this project. I have recently started an undertaking to harmonise <b>all</b> user page warnings and templates. For this I would like your assistance. I have listed a number of ideas on the project template page <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_user_warnings_templates_3ca1.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject user warnings/templates">here</a> as a first draft. I fully appreciate that as with most editors and admins, that you are fairly busy. Therefore I am not looking for anyone to carry out the actual work, I am willing to do that myself, with help from a number of other RC Patrollers who have come forward. But what I am looking for is your invaluable input, on the draft ideas and also to suggest other ways you believe we may improve the templates. I do however require the services of a couple of administrators to put into effect some of the new templates, as they are currently protected. Please take 5 mins to look through the new templates page, and both the project and templates talk pages and leave any ideas or suggestions that you may have. Best regards <a href="../../../k/h/u/User%7EKhukri_e3b4.html" title="User:Khukri"><b>Khukri</b></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../k/h/u/User_talk%7EKhukri_0ba4.html" title="User talk:Khukri"><b><font face="verdana">talk</font></b></a> . <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khukri_f113.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khukri"><b><font face="verdana">contribs</font></b></a>)</sup> 09:43, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's a 1996 revisit, not a 2004 guideline AVI. The 1996 revisit (of research/policy) defers to the 1982 policy, which defers to the 1975 policy. Those references make the date irrelevant. Why do you have a problem (can't properly quote the sequence and fact) with the CPS doing that???<a href="../../../t/i/p/User%7ETipPt_1698.html" title="User:TipPt">TipPt</a> 15:59, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
