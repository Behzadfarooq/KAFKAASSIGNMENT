<li>Avriette, why don't you take a step back and look at what happened before calling me a nubcake (for someone who works at Microsoft, this may take WAY too much intelligence for you).</li>
</ul>
<p>I added a comment to the talk section regarding 111!!!11one. My comment says "Gonif is still around. He plays DR". You reverted back and deleted that, on a talk page no less. That is bad form for 2 reasons: reason 1, you don't delete other people's talk comments. reason 2, you don't revert talk pages except for blatant vandalism. Furthermore, now you come onto my talk page and insult me (personal attacks are against wikipedia policy) and then start blabbering about some random edits that have nothing to do with my one small little section.</p>

<dd>don't be a twit. <i>you</i> can find this information on your own. sources aren't really required to name where cannabis is legal to cultivate, it's common knowledge among anyone who has actually looked into the matter, or grown it themselves. It is perfectly legal to cultivate and possess cannabis in the netherlands, as well as in the state of california. nevada and arizona also have decriminalized cannabis cultivation. british columbia, as i recall has also decriminalized, although i don't know the specific law off the top of my head. many smaller countries simply do not have laws on the books on the subject. furthermore, many groups (such as indigenous tribes) do not recognize the law of the municipalities they reside in. would you tell an aborigine it was against the law to cultivate ibogaine? what about marijuana? get a grip. <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvriette_f119.html" title="User:Avriette">Avriette</a> 15:43, July 11, 2005 (UTC)

<p>You need to stop slagging people off. You are rude. I suggest you reassess your attitude if you wish to keep editing here as personal attacks are barely tolerated and you seem to be a master. Marijuana is not legal to cultivate in Holland leading me to doubt your assertion that it is legal in some parts of the US. Indigenous people are not exempt from the laws against cannabis cultivation. That would be rascism, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 16:10, July 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have removed the line breaks which are not standard to wikipedia and make the article a nightmare to edit. Removed some POV (esp that strong cannabis is produced because of the illegality), some irrelevances such as kif and 2 suspect pics that I have put up for speedy deletion (and have now been speedily deleted, redownload them <b>after</b> you get permission and not before). They were embedded in the text but they should never have been downloaded to wikipedia until permission had been actually granted, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 16:34, July 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Finally I would point out that it is not my responsibility to source your (Avriette's) dubious claims. It is for you to source them, and without engaging in personal attacks, claiming I am a twit and an effing numbskull for questioning your dubious claims and not rushing out to try and source them for you. Your sources don't give any obvious info proving your point, while the Iraq war article and the vague wikipedia articles not connected to the issue make me strongly question your good faith as an editor here and make me think you are POV pushing and leting off steam. Please control yourself. What exactly am I supposed to be getting a grip of? The dubious claims have now been removed, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 16:40, July 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am genuinely confused as to why people who have cultivated cannabis somehow know that it is legal to cultivate in some places? I can't see how one logically leads to the other, so perhaps you can enlighten me. Do cannabis cultivators where it is illegal research the places where you allege it is legal to cultivate it? Or what exactly? I have looked through your 7 links and none of them mention legalised cannabis cultivation; indeed some of them don't mention cannabis at all. Are you just trolling? If so, please can you go and do it somewhere else, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 19:43, July 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would argue about the finer points of this with you, but I have no interest in a dick swinging contest. Nothing I say here will convince you one way or the other, and you haven't shown any interest in research at all; simply a furtherance of your beliefs. Let me remind you that the style guide to wikipedia is a guide, not policy. In fact, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Wereon" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Wereon" rel="nofollow">this has been discussed before</a>. I change my stance on the Netherlands drug policy. It is technically illegal, but said law <a href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Dutch_mayors_support_legalisation_of_cannabis" class="external text" title="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Dutch_mayors_support_legalisation_of_cannabis" rel="nofollow">is not enforced</a>. <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/law/november96/marijuana_11-7.html" class="external text" title="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/law/november96/marijuana_11-7.html" rel="nofollow">Arizona</a>, <a href="http://www.casacolumbia.org/supportcasa/item.asp?cID=12&amp;PID=104" class="external text" title="http://www.casacolumbia.org/supportcasa/item.asp?cID=12&amp;PID=104" rel="nofollow">California</a>, <a href="http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/249/nevada.shtml" class="external text" title="http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/249/nevada.shtml" rel="nofollow">Nevada</a> and other states are on the record (so they're not links to the actual legislation, you can find that your self) as having decriminalized cannabis cultivation. <a href="http://www.stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/152/twocultures.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/152/twocultures.shtml" rel="nofollow">British Columbia</a> is close to similar reactions (or may have, I didn't look far enough). I find this base arguing over character to be characteristic of the worst kind of user of the wikipedia -- somebody who requests adminship and views it as a badge to harass users, make threats, delete comments, revert changes, and so on. To quote Jimbo, "it should be no big deal." So why do I find myself defending myself against threats from somebody who is copping a permissions escalation threat? I never claimed to be superior, I claimed to be <i>right</i>. In fact, I am. If you wish to further debate the veracity of this article, you may <i>recuse yourself from consideration</i> in a <i>peer review process</i>, which is available to all articles. Consider also, that this article and other cannabis related articles are highly polarizing in nature. It will be difficult to attain any consensus whatsoever. When I arrive home, I will remove any damage you have perpetrated on this article, and perhaps loosen up some of the text. Please also note that the preceding article was near worthless. Lastly, not all people who consume marijuana are shiftless idiots. I would say that, yes, a majority of people who cultivate cannabis <i>do</i> research the legality of it (much in the way concealed weapons permit holders do), as it is imperative that they understand the law. I myself will not comment on my own participation, except to say that I have never <i>illegally cultivated</i> cannabis. Do not revert style in articles unless you are prepared to cite policy which states articles MUST BE WRITTEN A CERTAIN WAY. Do not threaten me further. Keep your opinions off your sleeve and out of articles. Keep personal attacks on personal pages, not on article pages. And maybe, next time, do your own damn research for yourself, if you disagree with an article. I'd like to state that last night in fact, I cleaned up and helped <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georeactor.html" title="Georeactor">georeactor</a> escape a probable vfd, noting that the article was garbage and required peer review. I'm hardly what you could call a crusading idealogue. Please direct any further spite or vitriole to either my personal email address (which you are smart enough to find), or to my user page. xoxo, <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvriette_f119.html" title="User:Avriette">Avriette</a> 21:10, July 11, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well now you have permission those pics will be a useful addition to the article. Deleting non copyright free material is for the sake of wikipedia, and I can assure you it had nothing to do with you. I certainly don't think marijuana growers are shiftless idiots. In the UK one would know that cultivation is an imprisonable offence and have no need to investigate further. Same in Honduras and most of the rest of the world. I don't agree at all that you are right about Holland. The supply side has not been legalised. But, I repeat, it is for you to research to source any claims you make in articles at wikipedia, it is not up to me to do that research because I dispute your claim and am asking you to source it. I only need to research my own claims in articles, eg if I were stating in the article that cannabis is illegal everywhere then you might ask me to source that claim and I would have to do so or see said claim removed. That is the way it works on all tricky POV articles (as you rightly comment cannabis is inevitably a tricky POV type subject). BTW who is the administrator you were talking about? <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 21:53, July 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know what you're referring to in the last line of your comment. I think there may be a misunderstanding as to the state of the text in the article. I find that very large editing tasks <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cannabis_cultivation&amp;diff=18499302&amp;oldid=18076738" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cannabis_cultivation&amp;diff=18499302&amp;oldid=18076738" rel="nofollow">such as the original edit</a> are near impossible to complete in the browser. Thus, I took the text, pumped it into <a href="../../../v/i/m/Vim_%28text_editor%29.html" title="Vim (text editor)">vim</a>, and edited it there. This was a process that took, even in vim, several hours. Upon completion, I copied it from an apache share into my text editor again, and subsequently reinserted it into the page. You don't seem to be a unix user, so I'll explain that this involved my own personal editor settings turning on text wrap and a column width of 78 characters when I edit a file ending in .txt, such as "ccult.txt", in this case. With all due respect (and I do not mean that facetiously), I think this is a little egocentric on your end. Your assumption that I was using a "nightmare" of formatting takes into account no other possible editing format but your own.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As to sources, I will list a few. Everything I put in the article was from memory, and only occasionally checked against other articles on the wikipedia (such as linked). I have a lot of experience in the subject, and was taught by others with much experience in the subject. Additionally, you may have gathered from the (if I do say so myself) vast spectrum of subjects I enthusiastically edit, that I read a great deal, with a high degree of retention. Nevertheless, said books are still on my shelves, and I can go dig them up for ISBN's, or hit amazon. As to the legality, I got out of the operation back in the mid 1990's, when I left California. Since then, the legal situation has changed somewhat, with a particularly dubious states-rights vs federal law problem coming up, especially in California. We've even had (at last count) two supreme court cases on the subject.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am of a mind to break out the legality of it entirely into its own article. Ordinarily, I would have a brief summary and use the {{seemain}} template, but even that's been cocked up. I think that, while legality is an important part of the discussion (and has only been granted a cursory (and inconsistent) treatment in the present state of the article, it also detracts from what I view to be a primarily botany-related article, not a socially-related article. I would also like to note that my inferrence was misunderstood when you believed I had meant that illegality has resulted in stronger potency marijuana products. In fact, what I had meant was illegality had resulted in indoor growing, increased light (due to production needs), co2 enrichment, and the like -- which in turn resulted in higher quality plants.</dd>

<dd>At any rate, I will rework the article some, and attempt to leave the linebreaks out. I will during that process move the legal issues around, add the previously removed images, and clean up the wording. I'm sure you'll let me know what you think.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would also like to state that I find it incredibly disappointing that you have reacted so violently to this article. It is my belief, based upon seeing your edit history, and your participation in things such as a group of "drug free" wikipedians, that you see yourself as both a police agent of some administrative wikipedia cabal, and somebody who must "save" drug users. It is important for you to understand that, whether this is true or not, it is the way your actions were perceived by me. While my reaction was (in my opinion, understandably) quite bristly, your initial comment seems to be quite demanding, without extending an olive branch of research. I, myself, would have said something akin to "ahem, I found sources x y and z, which seem to contradict the article. could you please elaborate on this?" Additionally, I would have put it on the user's page directly, rather than having this here. In fact, I would appreciate it if you would either move this to my talk page, or to your talk page, as I think it has little substantive relation to the material in the article. This has largely been an argumentative exchange over character and politics, and we are only now (seemingly) reaching some sort of tentative agreement or cease fire. Let me also say that I would not have reverted the article (as you did) without first attempting to come to some agreement.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would encourage you to participate in some of the more mundane tasks of wikipedia usership. You seem to have occupied a lot of your recent time here with things like vfd/tfd, talking to users about things they shouldn't be doing, and updating your user page. It seems to me that what should keep users coming back here is not that they are in a position of power. In fact, I don't think administrators really <i>are</i> in a position of power. When such a position is perceived by an administrator, I think they should quickly be convinced otherwise. This is, incidentally, why I stated at least a couple times that threats <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:CJ2005B&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=18329363" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:CJ2005B&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=18329363" rel="nofollow">have no place in the wikipedia</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To summarize, I don't have any particular beef with you, except as mentioned above, my feeling that you are abusing your position (be it toothless or not) as an administrator to force others to change their articles, as well as reverting without consensus. I also feel that you should meet me half way if you are going to request sources. It is impolite to put the onus of defending my work on me without offering to do some of the work yourself. Had you just done that from the beginning, none of this would have happened at all.</dd>

<p>If cultivatuion is legal in some US states it could be put in that cultivatuion is legal in some US states. IO am happy to take your word on that one. There is an article on legal issues of cannabis and maybe that is the place to put it. Saying the line breaks was a nightmare wasn't an attack on you. Are you happy with the text as it is.

First I am not an admin. Second I have a militantly pro cannabis stand, limited by the confines of NPOV (I was trying to rescue Wikipedia from Cognition's POV pushing in creating the association). Thirdly I have contributed a lot to articles (esp Spanish language bios) but also to a range as wide as your own including lots of vandalism patrols and welcoming new users.

<dd>Ehhhh. Ok. Well, whatever. I don't wish to fight at all. Note I have updated the page. I think, as I said above, that the article should really focus on the botany, since it is such a rich subject. The article now includes sources -- none legal in nature -- as well as a few additional links, additional pictures, and no linebreaks, per your request. Please remember it is very hard to edit files which do not have linebreaks in VIM as it is largely a line-oriented editor. If you have changes you'd like to make to the article, go on ahead and do so, but again I think the legality should be left elsewhere. <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvriette_f119.html" title="User:Avriette">Avriette</a> 02:18, July 12, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi - You left me a note that says:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>You recently nominated <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETregoweth_2a9b.html" title="User:Tregoweth">user:tregoweth</a> for adminship. I had a recent encounter with them whereby an image I added to <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mons_pubis.html" title="Mons pubis">mons pubis</a> was removed as either copyvio or "nsfw". It wasn't clear at all from the edit comment why this was done. Upon asking the user why this was done, they apologized and said that it was accidental. Having edited the user's talk page, it is on my watch list. I am continually amazed to see how many of these minor altercations the user gets in to. Would you mind saying something as an objective third party who seems to have support for the user?

<p>I assume you're talking about this note I left on tregoweth's page. I left a note like that on the talk page of everyone on <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_WP600_not_admins_50e3.html" title="User:Rick Block/WP600 not admins">this list</a> who objectively met the criteria (top 600 editors by edit count in article space who are not already admins). The point of the list is to highlight a fair number of "high volume" users who for whatever reason are not admins. '*' on the list is added by the users themselves. Tregoweth did not put a '*' by his/her name, so I presume is not interested in becoming an admin. I have had little direct interaction with most of the folks on the list, including tregoweth. My bias (based on knowing he/she has made many thousands of edits over many months, but not on any direct interaction) is that this is a person who has put a lot of time and energy into wikipedia and is almost certainly well-intentioned. It's certainly possible that some small percentage of his/her edits are done in error, but at a rate of 500/week even a 0.1% "error rate" adds up to 2 "bad" edits a month. If you have concerns, I'd strongly suggest you discuss them with tregoweth directly. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 17:13, August 14, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Robert. I could contribute substantial information to that section myself. And I agree with your assertion that it is drivel. However, I have been considering adding a "close quarters battle" article, which is a common term in pistol tactics discussion ("CQB"). I think an article on pistol tactics really belongs there, and the mechanicals and description of a pistol belongs in the <i>pistol</i> article. What do you think? I'm happy to provide sources, etc, on pistol combat tactics. But again, I think it belongs in a different article. Whatever the case, the section as it stands is awful and needs to go. xoxo, <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvriette_f119.html" title="User:Avriette">Avriette</a> 06:28, August 21, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, I know I bothered you about this earlier but I'm wondering if I could trouble you again to contribute to a (slightly different) discussion on Hawaii's royals. (I apologize nothing concrete happened from the previous discussion; that was largely my fault for not keeping the discussion going.) Anyway, I hope we can eventually agree on a written standard for the naming of Hawai‘i's monarchs.

<p>I think you should definitely put a link in the article to the video, if you have it hosted elsewhere on the web.

<p>those who write shitty articles are not vandals. a vandal writes "dfjkgdf" or "bush is a fag" - and if we don't fix those edits, then wikipedia is a mess and quite useless. that's what i meant by police. thanks for explaining. ta ta. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingturtle_613d.html" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a> 07:00, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's precisely my point. If you can't accept that other people are allowed to leave their rat-turd droppings all over the encylopedia, and that it makes it "a mess", then you've got no authority arbitrating. Let me paint an example. I hate star trek articles. So let me say that I'd purge all star trek articles. Okay, but I'd alienate users like <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a>. Like it or not, they contribute a lot of articles and janitor a lot of stuff for the rest of us.

<p>are you saying i should allow the person at 213.138.128.13 to make edits like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pok%C3%A9mon&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34590405" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pok%C3%A9mon&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34590405" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hilary_Duff&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34590908" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hilary_Duff&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=34590908" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> and i should just let those edits sit there? those rat turds are ok? they don't make wikipedia a mess? i've never said anything about purging articles i don't like. i'm talking about stopping vandalism like these two links i've just shown you. you can't possibly think those two edits are helping wikipedia and that person is contributing. you've obviously got an axe to grind, but i'm not a person who purges articles and i oppose most deletions. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingturtle_613d.html" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a> 07:15, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You misunderstand. Being in this community means you understand that you're a janitor. When I eat a bunch of newspaper and take some giant fibrous shit in the toilet and it stops the plumbing up for days, does the janitor come into my office and say, "gee, avriette, what a jerk you are for stopping up my toilet"? No. he silently fixes it, and he <i>walks away</i>. We're not here to police things.

<p>I noticed that you voted against me because I referred to "punishments". I realize that my wording was poor on that, and in fact against my beliefs about what the ArbCom should do.

<p>As an administrator I find it is only appropriate for me to remove personal attacks.
