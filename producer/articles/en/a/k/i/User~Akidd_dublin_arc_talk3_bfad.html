<dd>I fond it ridiciulous this would have been explained at some BBS. As if they would have a legal right to declare a certificate of "not being fond of a language". I found them spelling various things, but not the irish word for rat, which is RADAN, and not luch francach (french mouse). These BBS do not have any legal significance. <a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAkidd_dublin_1e95.html" title="User:Akidd dublin">Akidd dublin</a>•<a href="../../../a/k/i/User_talk%7EAkidd_dublin_efbb.html" title="User talk:Akidd dublin">tl</a>•ctr-l 14:57, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hello. I have followed the recent thread about "weak language" on the Villiage pump, and want to give you some feedback. I am quite sure that you have good intentions, but unfortunately I (and others) am finding that your edits are causing great difficulty, quite likely because English is not your native language. There are many good editors here whose native language isn't english, and generally there's no problem, sometimes the phrasing might seem a little unusual, but the meaning is quite clear. However, I'm finding that with your edits, many of them do not make any sense at all, which is a serious problem.</p>
<p>I don't know what your native language is, or whether there is a wikipedia in that language, but if there is, could I suggest that you might find it more productive to edit where there is no language barrier. Without trying to be cruel, I do honestly think because of the language difficulty, your edits, no matter how well intentioned, are creating more problems than they are solving.</p>
<p>As I said, I'm not trying to be cruel, and I hope you take this the way it was intended. Regards, <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinRe_7317.html" title="User:MartinRe">MartinRe</a> 02:21, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>this only occured when i caused the edit of <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_hair.html" title="Red hair">Red_hair</a>. native or not, it was low quality. i am not going to argue further. no one complained about the wrong information within this article. <a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAkidd_dublin_1e95.html" title="User:Akidd dublin">Akidd dublin</a>•<a href="../../../a/k/i/User_talk%7EAkidd_dublin_efbb.html" title="User talk:Akidd dublin">tl</a>•ctr-l 12:43, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hello again. In case you were not aware of it, there are wikipedia in several languages, a list is at <a href="../../../index.html#Wikipedia_languages" title="Main Page">Main_Page#Wikipedia_languages</a>. If there is one in your native language, I think it would be a lot more rewarding for yourself as well.</dd>
<dd>My comment wasn't in regard to the Red Hair article in particular, I did take a quick skim though some other articles you have contributed to, and there are many other editors who are finding that your changes are proving impossible to understand. Your changes to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Static_random_access_memory.html" title="Static random access memory">Static random access memory</a>, for example, have been reversed by two different editors, because they simply couldn't understand them.</dd>
<dd>Please understand that this is nothing personal, but I hope you realise on the english wikipedia editors do need a reasonable standard of english to be able to contribute. Unfortunately, it does appear that you have clear difficulties with english , which is why I would suggest applying your efforts to a wikipedia in a language that better suits you.

<li>For my new articles, I do not get any of what you mean. They are capitalized, no spelling mistakes, sentences like printed in books. I tried to make it fully Hi-Fi. However i found it convenient not to maintain links to posts on a few BBS. They are important, but it is not the world to me. I prefer not to have an opinion about them. Like elsewhere, some things speak for themselves. But everyone can improve.

<p>Hi there. It seems some people are having difficulty communicating with you to explain their issues, so I would like to ask you what is your native language to see if we can all understand each other.

I have abandoned this account. I found it ridicioulus: there was annoying information (article:red hair). It was removed. I was accused then of spelling wrong sentences. It does not have to be in usage by anyone (i.e. "Please understand it forehand"). It sounds better than: "You have been warned".

<dd>YES. This is not a Vendetta. EVERYONE. I only stated to use correct english in articles. "My new articles are not full of mistakes, neither they spell completely wrong grammar." It should be: "The articles i created recently are NEITHER full of mistakes NOR they do spell a completely wrong grammar." - If this is required? I have seen a lot of "wrong" english (this means to leave out words): in printed manuals, on the net, i do not have list of it. Now i try to figure out: What is STANDARD ENGLISH? If i omit the NOR, that's wrong english? If it is that, then there are other articles in need, and it does not make sense to attack me. I already abandoned this account, because its past "political correctness", "special population groups". A manager of a boyband said that in an interview. I do not know how it can be helped right now but to do something different. <a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAkidd_dublin_1e95.html" title="User:Akidd dublin">Akidd dublin (abandoned 5/2006)</a> 17:51, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Spell" is the wrong word. One does not "spell" grammar; one uses it. The sentence could have read "My new articles are not full of mistakes, nor do they use poor [wrong|bad|incorrect] grammar"; "My new articles are not full of mistakes, nor is their grammar bad" would be even better. However, though this would make it an English sentence, it would still be wrong, because your articles DO use poor grammar, and syntax. As for "special population groups", people use phrases and constructs all the time; that does not make them official stand-ins for meaning, as you appear to believe. I would be happy to help you with your English sentence structure, but Wikipedia is not the place for English lessons. <a href="../../../f/n/a/User%7EFnarf999_8dfc.html" title="User:Fnarf999">Fnarf999</a> 18:07, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>spelling language (by sentences) by applying grammar rules. do people really need this? i appreciate your offer to help out my ""poor grammar". It is not wrong, just weak, sounds like slang, a touch of foreign. Aren't i am entitled to do so? Just for articles i need to use correct sentences. I have put so much effort into it, to emulate a slang which indeed is misunderstood for coming from a foregin country. You ask to spell out all the fill words explicitely? then it gets this: "The language useage as it is right now, is not wrong. it is just a weak way of writing, this way it sounds like slang language, one believes the sentences spelled by a foreign person." VS "It is not wrong, just weak, sounds like slang, a touch of foreign." - SEE ADVERTISING. I really do not know what is required. I have read programming manuals. I guess they are difficult for a few. I assume some people may have difficulties to understand these manuals fully. It is not i would not know. It is that i do not see within other articles. I do not know why you (a couple of wikipedia people, not EVERYONE) do police me that way. there are worse cases, which go un-noticed. someone can <i>police</i>, but i doubt someone can <i>microsoft</i> something. this goes on further here on wikipedia. to spell microsoftifying- good grief. i put it to a bin, if i receive that letter. not on the bin. <a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAkidd_dublin_1e95.html" title="User:Akidd dublin">Akidd dublin (abandoned 5/2006)</a> 18:22, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you are missing the point, Akidd dublin. No one is policing your edits for fun or folly; people are watching your edits because you have become a known menace. In general, when you edit an article, the section becomes nonsense. You are making points that you are using "slang" because it is too much trouble to write everything out; that is not acceptible for Wikipedia. You have also admitted (if I understand correctly) that your slang is poor, because it is foreign-sounding. That makes it even more inappropriate. You also seem to be implying that you "abandoned" your user account because of "political correctness" which I assume means that you had a problem with people reverting your "ghey" edits. That doesn't solve this problem either. Wikipedia should not read like a software manual, or like slang, or like foreign slang. That is the issue. <font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 22:54, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>So far, so good. My new articles are not full of mistakes. I have not become personally offensive. I am not here to help out the avatar set of a few BBS. (see the wikipedia article about BBS, to understand more about BBS). I indeed abandoned this account, because people try to grave out talk which is two years old. This information belongs to a BBS, not to wikipedia. Some articles here would never make it through an editor for a commercial print. It is not non-sense. but do not say the articles were perfect, then i came and vandalized them with non-sense. This is just not true, and i assume you know it. I read TOC (of a country), and they spell: "slanderous against individuals". It is up to you to understand the meaning. It works without me. This would suit wikipedia policies. You do not have any proof that it is really me on these BBS. I am not a fan of BBS. BBS are not the world. They are required, but aren't a proof for anything. Often, they bend copyright law to a high extend. Indeed i do not do any BBS posting right now. I do not know what you are writing about. <a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAkidd_dublin_1e95.html" title="User:Akidd dublin">Akidd dublin (abandoned 5/2006)</a> 13:09, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I do not want to discuss marriage here on wikipedia. I do not want to discuss it at all. Man and Woman shall marry. I will not change my opinion. It does not make sense to start a discussion with me about that topic. (If it continiues) I probably change to another account because this is embarassing (and abandon this account).

<dd>This is not a discussion about marriage. I was telling you that you <b>will not</b> change the words that other people have used when leaving comments. For example, Fnarf999 used the word "gay". You <i>changed</i> this to "ghey". This is not allowed. I don't care what your opinion on homosexual marriage is.

<dd>When i start another account, only editing articles <b>which are completely unrelated to this</b>, then, i believe, i can demand a removal of unrelated talk. It does not make sense to discuss it here on wikipedia. Doing so, is not valid usage of my user page. I believe the talk should be removed, as the spelling in the red hair article has been removed. It is not right to make it that long, repeating these words twenty times. <a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAkidd_dublin_1e95.html" title="User:Akidd dublin">Akidd dublin</a>•<a href="../../../a/k/i/User_talk%7EAkidd_dublin_efbb.html" title="User talk:Akidd dublin">tl</a>•ctr-l 15:34, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You are wrong. User talk pages cannot be modified in that way. And changing the comments left by others is a clear violation of Wikipedia's rules. You may of course start another Username if you want, but if you do so simply to lose the trail of critical comments about your English, and carry on damaging Wikipedia in the way you have using your new ID, you will answer to that.

<dd>Actually, you <b>do</b> have to keep fnarf999's comments. You cannot simply remove his comments. What you may do is archive this entire page (I can help you do this if you wish).

<dd>Ok. I am doing what people ask me to do. "I do not want him to put his personal opinion to my userpage" - I do not see a grammar mistake within this sentence. I preceive this as harassment.

<dd>The grammatical error is that you should have used "on" instead of "to". Thus: "I do not want him to put his personal opinion on my userpage." However, Fnarf999 is not harassing you. He is pointing out the huge number of problems you have with the English language. You <b>know</b> this is true. You've been told this over and over again by multiple people here on Wikipedia. You have been told this on other forums dating back to at least 2004. Your English language skills are very bad. I know you are trying. I know you try hard to spell things correctly and to use proper grammar. But the fact remains, your English skills are very bad. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 14:22, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wait. I try to emphasize where he puts it. Because he should not. I express he could put it somewhere else, if i use "to". If i write "on", it sounds i do not want him to put anything on my user talk page. The other forums generally spelled harassment, but we leave it at this point. My weak spelling does not whitewash their otherwise questionable content.<br /></dd>
<dd>"on" - He is putting stuff to somewhere.</dd>
<dd>"to" - emphasizing the action of putting itself. He could talk to someone else, somewhere else. He should not have talked (or have put talk to ...) that way.</dd>

<p>You said: "Because i found it uncanny to have a geographic location connected to an user name, i am going to abandon it now. I find the user talk embarassing, and not-well-educated teenie-like.

<dd>I'm sorry, I don't understand what you are saying. What do you mean when you say "not-well-educated teenie-like"? And do you mean "before" when you say "forehand"? I think you are saying that you are going to abandon this user and start a new user. That's fine, that is your right. However, you may be happier editing Wikipedia in your native language as I fear that the same problems are going to show up in the new user account. Another alternative if you wish is that we could take this matter to arbitration. This would allow you to state your case and allow a group of neutral people to give their opinions.

<dd>Are you saying that you are using software like <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/" class="external text" title="http://babelfish.altavista.com/" rel="nofollow">Babelfish</a> to translate from your native language to English? This would certainly explain the serious grammatical mistakes and difficulty in understanding what you write. If so, please stop. Babelfish is not particularly good at translating. If you need to rely on this <i>or similar</i> software, please refrain from editing the English version of Wikipedia. If instead you are writing everything yourself (<i>without</i> the use of translation software), I still claim that your skills in English aren't good enough.
