<p>Mr./Ms. Akidd_dublin: Before you mark other people's contribution for deletion, you might want to do some research. The International Relations Institute of Cameroon exists. If you have never heard of it, good grief! They are plenty of other things in the world that you have never heard of. Maybe my contribution wasn't up to par with other as far as style is concerned, but it contains truthful and publicly available information. You are doing a disservice to the wikipedia organization by acting this way. Your categorization is uncalled for. G p 03:54, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

Mr. Kidd, I am sorry if I was a bit harsh in my reply. I was a little offended because I know the institution. I do not work for IRIC. I simply graduated from there and I know the quality of the instruction that it offers, having studied in the U.S. afterward.</p>
<p>It is all good, and it is ignorance that let me to post phone numbers in the article. Thanks for all your insight! G p 07:38, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The transformer article definitely needs work, and the 'analogy' section has been discussed on the article's <a href="../../../t/r/a/Talk%7ETransformer_577d.html" title="Talk:Transformer">talk page</a>. As with any Wikipedia article, if you think you can improve it by editing, you should feel free to do so. I think you are suggesting that the article also needs more pictures of low-power transformers. If you are able to find pictures that are available under a copyright-free licence, you should upload them to the article.

<dd>(OUTSIDE VIEW) Coming from the Village pump posting, and after reviewing the edits, I agree that the above edit wasn't vandalism. Uncited, and IMO, probably incorrect, but at worst a mistake, and <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html#What_vandalism_is_not" title="WP:VAND">mistakes aren't vandalism</a>.

<p>Akidd, as requested I have removed my vandalism warning from your page. If you wish, I would not object to your removing your responses from this page as well, though you are certainly not required to do so. While I still believe firmly that cockney rhyming slang would not invent a term to refer to a specific building in another country (isn't it really more likely they would use the term to refer to homosexuals?), your actions since indicate that you truly believe "ginger" refers to this building. Furthermore, I was rude to you far beyond what was called for. Additionally, I think you for your edits since that time. We have both made edits to the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_hair.html" title="Red hair">Red hair</a> article and I appreciate your ability to continue to work with someone (me) who you felt had it in for you. I look forward to many more productive edits from you in the future and I hope you can forgive my rudeness. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 15:59, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

The citation probably does not meet <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>, however, and in any case, you and I both agree (I think, I'm not trying to put words in your mouth) that it has nothing to do with <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_hair.html" title="Red hair">Red hair</a>. --<a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamla_5f07.html" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> 16:02, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Being productive, creative, even artistic: this includes making mistakes, or make art out insufficient expression possibility. However, i do not repeat mistakes intentionally. For established articles <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transformer.html" title="Transformer">Transformer</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_hair.html" title="Red hair">Red_hair</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watermelon.html" title="Watermelon">Watermelon</a> to name a few, i am now trying to discuss edit plans on their talk page. I do not mind about agressive spellings, if it does not continiue, or gets personal. It could be worse, but i made tiny mistakes, of course. Discussion data/parts of it, can be removed sometimes. <a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAkidd_dublin_1e95.html" title="User:Akidd dublin">Akidd dublin</a>•<a href="../../../a/k/i/User_talk%7EAkidd_dublin_efbb.html" title="User talk:Akidd dublin">tl</a>•ctr-l 10:03, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><i>probably</i> this citation suits to include it into <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cockney.html" title="Cockney">Cockney</a>. I do not know if it is right/makes sense to include a link from <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_hair.html" title="Red hair">Red_hair</a> to <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cockney.html" title="Cockney">Cockney</a>, porbably/probably not. <a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAkidd_dublin_1e95.html" title="User:Akidd dublin">Akidd dublin</a>•<a href="../../../a/k/i/User_talk%7EAkidd_dublin_efbb.html" title="User talk:Akidd dublin">tl</a>•ctr-l 10:06, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Akidd, I saw your comments on the Village Pump page (as well as the edit history of Matrix (IT)) and have to agree that being called a vandal when you're acting in good faith is disturbing. I fully agree that referring to you as a vandal is impolite, though you may want to note that many editors consider removing of article maintainance templates (especially an article in review, such as this one) vandalism. It's my hope you don't take their comments personally.</p>
<p>Myself, I'm going to go the route of avoiding removing maintainance templates of AfD'd articles when possible so I can avoid such problems. Maybe this is the chicken's way, but I'm not as <b>bold</b> as other editors here at times.&#160;:D</p>

<dd>When writing networking software, there's an axiom I learned, "Be frugal in what you send, be generous in what you receive." This works equally as well in social issues, and I <i>try</i> (often failing, but the trying is no less important) to apply this to myself.
<ul>
<li>When I respond to others, I attempt to be as civil and (painfully) cheerful as possible. With luck, this defuses situations before they occur. Feel free to tell me how well this works! In either case, it's mediated slightly by the need for sincere opinion. If I think your article stinks, I'll certainly tell you so, just trying to phrase it so as to not insult you.&#160;:)</li>
<li>When someone responds to me, I try to recall that they could be having a bad day, that they're just gruff, or that they're emotionally involved, and that I shouldn't take it personally nor let the emotions involved affect my response. Granted, if someone replies with factual information ("You forgot to do this here...(blah blah), you boogerhead!") then I'll take the helpful part of the information and work with it. I guess the best kylu-to-English translation is "Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater."</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I'm working on an essay describing this and other potentially useful ways of having a nondisruptive presence that others can voluntarily adopt if they'd like. Maybe it'll go over well. Maybe it'll be ignored. It'll stay there for others if they'd like, however.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, I hope this whole experience didn't turn you off from contributing. The more the merrier, you know!</dd>

<p>On my talk page, you say "If you continiue attacking my edits, i am going to write about you, there. This has no threat meaning, but it looks you really browsed a list of contributions, which i created myself.." To which I respond:</p>
<dl>
<dd>What on earth does "no threat meaning" mean? That's not English. And frankly it does sound like some kind of threat, of what I can't imagine. I did browse your contributions, because I stumbled across a couple of them that indicated a stylistic problem which I have described elsewhere. You insist on arguing small inconsequential points that make no sense. For example, in Talk:Red hair, the business about the Gaiety Theatre and Cockney slang -- the information you added is both wrong and completely irrelevant -- as irrelevant as a recipe for ginger cookies would have been. Wikipedia is not nonsense.<br /></dd>
</dl>
<p>Look: I'm not trying to attack you. I'm not interested in you, I'm interested in Wikipedia. I believe that the low quality of your edits indicates some problems with your editing style. For one, you are obviously not a native or fluent writer of English. This is a problem in an English encyclopedia. It is not a criticism of you personally. I can tell you have intelligence, because the errors you habitually make are quite typical of someone whose understanding outstrips their ability to express it in a second language.<br />
However there are other problems with your edits. A large number of them are irrelevancies and trivia, unsuitable for an encyclopedia at best and flat-out wrong at worst. For instance, the business with the Gaiety Theatre and Cockney slang. Any suggestion that the word "gay" referring to homosexuals refers to this theater is ludicrously false, and any suggestion that there is any connection between "red hair" and "gay" is plain wrong. I don't think you understand the slang; "ginger" for "queer" means "ginger beer" which has nothing to do with red hair. Nothing at all. The article on red hair is not a dumping ground for miscellaneous facts about the word "ginger" unrelated to its red-hair meaning. This to me indicates a much more serious problem with your edits than simple English. <a href="../../../f/n/a/User%7EFnarf999_8dfc.html" title="User:Fnarf999">Fnarf999</a> 15:57, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good. I do not want to discuss this topic further, however i am happy it is gone from the article. I you were interested in me, you can try my 360 blog, to add comment, post to groups etc. Otherwise it's not a dating site. I read native writes (of english), and there are, let us say, different. I dont get what you want to attack. If there is any new topic/article edit, i would write to your talk again (if appreciate). I think this is better than to keep quite.<br />
<dl>
<dd>"Quiet" is the word you're looking for there, but I still don't know what you mean. I don't understand the "dating site" comment at all. The sentence "I read native writes (of english, and there are, let us say, different." is not English. Do you mean "writings"? Do you mean to say "I have read native English writings"? OK, that's nice, but what on earth does "there are different" mean? Different what? I am not ATTACKING, I am seeking understanding of what the words you type mean. This stuff can't even be corrected; it doesn't mean anything. <a href="../../../f/n/a/User%7EFnarf999_8dfc.html" title="User:Fnarf999">Fnarf999</a> 21:39, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Neither i do not get what's possible in that short sentences to spell them wrong</i>. At least i read two programming reference manuals, one recently.

<p>You want examples? Are you kidding? In the paragraph you just wrote, nearly every single sentence has major grammatical problems that destroys its meaning. Your English is terrible. It's much more than spelling; it's beyond repair. <a href="../../../f/n/a/User%7EFnarf999_8dfc.html" title="User:Fnarf999">Fnarf999</a> 18:15, 10 May 2006 (UTC) On <a href="../../../y/a/m/User_talk%7EYamla_8e0c.html" title="User talk:Yamla">User talk:Yamla</a> you write: <i>It is called "word clearing".

Wikipedia is not a nursery rhyme. Adding this sort of thing to a Wikipedia article <i>is</i> vandalism.</p>
<p>You also write <i>Gai means sexually flavoured activity for entertainment purpose.</i> This is not an English sentence, but if I gather its meaning correctly it is not only POV it is wrong. You also write: <i>people can misunderstand this as harassment (using dictionary=laughable)</i>. This is once more a fundamental misunderstanding of what I said, which was NOT "using a dictionary is laughable", but "being told to use a dictionary by someone who habitually uses one out of every three words incorrectly is laughable.

<dd>Look. I am not interested in gai. <i>I simply do not edit articles, where it is required technically.</i> I do not need to spell this word. If it does not belong to an article (like red hair), then it does not need correct spelling (if it is possible to understand the meaning from the context). I am a friendly nike consumer, and i love coca-cola, skeletor etc. I do not care about gender.

<dd>Yes, it does; it trashes meaning. Your point, if you have one, is so unfocused and scattershot that no one can tell what you're saying. Are you referring to "gay"? Why -- WHY are you referring to "gay"? And what do Nike, Coca-cola, Skeletor, and gender (huh?) have to do with anything? Are you under the impression that "gay" is a "gender"? It isn't. No capable speaker of English would need to be told that. <a href="../../../f/n/a/User%7EFnarf999_8dfc.html" title="User:Fnarf999">Fnarf999</a> 21:35, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
