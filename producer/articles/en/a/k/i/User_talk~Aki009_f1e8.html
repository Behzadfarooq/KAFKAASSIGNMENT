<p>We have a lot of free content so it appears we can get it. The setup on the image upload page is based on the principle that if we give people the chance to tell us the truth they are less likely to lie to us.14:47, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I understand. I appreciate the fact that you are very clear about your opinion. However, it does seem to be inconsistent with the instructions provided to contributors, which specifically imply that there is no deletion in certain cases if clear identification of source and license grant are given. I had asked that you review the matter, but you make no mention of that in your response. I don't believe you have to respond to it, but since it deals with an apparent inconsistency I wish you would speak to it.Aki Korhonen 16:37, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks. The policy is poorly written, as it seems to take a long-winded way of saying the obvious: i.e. only public domain images allowed. This is also inconsistent with the instructions given when an image is uploaded. I don't fault you for following this policy, however I wish that you would consider pushing back -- in your position as admin -- to broaden the scope of acceptable licenses. Instead of furthering the concepts behind "free" images, this policy limits wiki to just "free" images. A two-tiered system would greatly enhance the visual appeal of the pages, and provide helpful information. A picture is worth a thousands words, as they say. From a procedural standpoint, such two-tiered system would be extremely easy to implement, and it might spur more content that's freely contributed in response. Aki Korhonen 20:19, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>GFDL is in no way shape or form PD. We allow quite a range of lisences. GFDL, various CC, Free art, CeCILL (although I've never managed to figure out how that one applies to images) and GPL (and probably LGPL) under certian condtions.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 20:23, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Agreed. It is not PD. However, the current policy excludes images that a copyright holder would like to contribute to wiki, or other non-commercial purposes, yet retain the rights thereto for other contexts. A two-tiered policy would not be difficult to implement, and it seems to me that it is in the common benefit to including more informative content, rather than insist on restrictions based on only a certain type of license.Aki Korhonen 20:33, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So far there are no non-commercial lisences that are not legaly awful. The problem comes with defineing commercial with the result that they are far far too strict to be useful. Secondaly we know that the existance of non free content on wikipedia tends to demotivate people from produceing free content. QF 6 pounders are fired from time to time and at least some of these are public events. Should not be too hard to obtain a free enough photo.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 20:42, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I understand this argument. However, I am sure that we could define a non-commercial or wiki-only license language that would be acceptable to many if not most of those who want to post on wiki. You are probably correct that there is other content on pretty much any topic, including the image I posted earlier. However, this case is also a great example of why this policy will greatly restrict wiki, as I have no such image to post, and I can't say where one would be readily available. Thus, this policy is causing the page to go without this image, and I doubt one will ever be added by anyone. So in the end, the policy is not promoting the concept of "free" photos, but restricting illustrations on wiki. Aki Korhonen 06:31, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>On the basis that we are talking about a weapon system that was used by the US it is pretty much a given that a PD photo exists of it fireing somewhere in some goverement archives. Throw in the issue that these things are still fired at public demonstraitions and obtaining a free photo should not be hard.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 12:14, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that a replacement image likely exists. But as I said before, I can't locate one right away. My point is, that since I don't have an alternative that I will be able to use, it's doubtful anyone else will do so either. And hence wiki is an illustration short, only due to an ideologically driven policy that limits the content on wiki. What's worse, this is not an isolated incident. For example, based on your record, you alone have removed quite an impressive number of illustrations, and I'm sure other admins have done the same. Assuming that a good portion of these deletions have the same set of circumstances, then wiki is truly shortchanged by this ideologically driven policy. --- Would it not make sense to have a two-tiered policy, so that while there is a search for a likely existing, but not readily available "free" image, at least some image can be used? Aki Korhonen 17:02, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>experence suggests that the existance of non free content prevents the appearence of free content. See also <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="meta:Eventualism">meta:Eventualism</a>.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 17:22, 9 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>However creating and enforcing a monopoly is never welcomed with open arms, and rarely furthers the free development of ideas and content. Unfortunately a quick scan of wiki shows that there aren't that many illustrations out there, and a recurring topic is the deletion of images solely because the owner desired to only license the work for wiki or non-commercial purposes. So do you really want to place an ideology in front of a great useful project? It's obvious that already a large number of contributors are turned off by such ideologically driven policies and ultimately wiki will never be what it could have been. With the current trends being what they are, it's only a matter of time before someone (can you spell G-o-o-g-l-e) begins a competing project without such limitations, and then your hopes of supporting "free" content by refusing any alternatives have merely furthered the demise of wiki, and not the availability of "free".

<dd>there are 960,552 media files on commons and rather a lot on wikipedia. Competition exists in various forms both in the forms of wikis and images hosts (flickr comes to mind). Some have image lisence policies that are more liberal than wikipedia. We seem to get by ok and have produced significant amounts of free content that would otherwise not exist. Google would be unable to use non comercial use only images so in this case they are not a concern.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 19:24, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The raw numbers are always deceiving. It's the ratios that probably show where the action is. I'd love to know how many images per topic there are these days, compared to before wiki began its "free"-image-only experiment?</dd>
<dd>Also, a commercial competitor could certainly use non-commercial-use images, as the prerequisite for posting any image is the right for the site itself to carry the image; this is similar to those who want to post "wiki-only" images. It seems that my point is not being noted, which is that there is a lack of images on wiki, that the policy of only accepting "free" images is greatly restricting contributions (based simply on the number of complaints and deletions that I see taking place in just the few days that I have been paying attention to this) and that this policy will over time lead to disappointed contributors who will likely stop contributing. This will make wiki a place with much text and few pictures in the near term. In the long, the fact is that an enforced limitation such as this is a typical spurring element for a replacement to come forth. Presumably such replacement would set aside ideology for the common good, which is a jointly-created encyclopedia, not a only-free-content-may-apply encyclopedia.</dd>
<dd>I will not assert the topic at this time, but there is a special quality to images that sets them apart from the other forms of expression, which in turn raises even more questions about the "free"-image-only policy on wiki, as the policy is not being even-handed to its contributors.</dd>

<dd>Normally I would say that I don't know enough of the related history. However, in this case Geni is extremely clear about his view, he did not do as I had asked him to (review the inconsistency in his editing and the apparent conflict to instructions provided to conributors), and while I can't tell that it is incorrect, it does seem to be inconsistent. So, yes, I will second it, but with the note that I'm doing so due to the inconsistency. Aki Korhonen 16:33, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
