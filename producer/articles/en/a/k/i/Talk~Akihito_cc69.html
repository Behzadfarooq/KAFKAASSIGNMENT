<p>There's a handy book that I came across some time back, "What Every American Should Know About the Rest of the World." At one point it states that Akihito suprised a good deal of people by admitting to have Korean ancestors (Koreans often being regarded as "inferior" in Japanese society). Can someone confirm this and add if possible? It would make an interesting piece.</p>

<p>The term 明仁天皇 violates one of Japanese taboos surrounding the Emperor.

<p>If it serves the cause... but I disagree with Nanshu's assertion that somehow Japanese "taboo" be considered, or that there be a "proper" way to refer to an Emperor.

<dd>I am not sure what do you mean by reign name since to my knowledge none of Emperor of Japan has reign name, and instead, they are named by a given name, posthumous name or era name.

<p>Those in favor of renaming the article are on the right track, but it should be renamed Emperor Akihito of Japan. Reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Emperor Akihito is how he is widely referred to in the Western press. Go to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com" class="external text" title="http://www.nytimes.com" rel="nofollow">NY Times</a> or <a href="http://www.japantimes.com" class="external text" title="http://www.japantimes.com" rel="nofollow">Japan Times</a> or <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com" class="external text" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com" rel="nofollow">Washinton Post</a> and do a search for Akihito. You'll see he is referred to as Emperor Akihito. This is what people are familiar with.</li>
<li>As both a native speaker of English and a fluent speaker of Japanese who has studied Japanese for over 17 years (and lived in Japan for 10), referring to him as simply Akihito is disrespectful. He is an emperor with a title and should be referred to as such.</li>
<li>All 121 Japanese emperors in Wikipedia that precede Emperor Meiji are referred to as "Emperor X of Japan". There is no reason why the current emperor should be an exception. The only thing that is different about him is that, because he is still alive, he obviously hasn't been renamed his posthumous name yet, which will be "Emperor Heisei."</li>

<dd>I think the reason for that tradition for encylopedias was so that you don't end up with a long list of articles that start "Emperor X" or "Queen X", etc. in the index, similar to putting ", The" at the end of a title that begins with "The." That logic doesn't apply to a purely online Encylopedia. The articles on Japanese emperors were written and named by people who are familiar with Japan, the Japanese language, Japanese naming customs and how people typically refer to Japanese emperors in English. And the same convention is used for the Chinese emperors listed in Wikipedia. The only difference is there isn't one currently on the throne.</dd>

<p>No, you misunderstand; I didn't say that the convention for print encyclopædias was not to use titles, but that the <i>Wikipedia</i> convention is not to do so. There are various reasons for this, one being that it avoids possible conflict over the validity of claims, and charges of PoV in using such titles. Another is that we don't use titles for anyone else (whether "Professor", "Dr", "Mrs", "Sir", "Dame", "President", etc.), so why should royalty be any different? <a href="../../../c/2E/_/C._E._M._Joad_4cbb.html" title="C. E. M. Joad">C. E. M. Joad</a> was always known as "Professor Joad", but that's not the title of the Wikipedia article. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 16:22, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I didn't misunderstand, I'm saying the convention was probably borrowed from paper encyclopedias. It's just no longer relevant. And conflict over claims? Is there any conflict that the current emperor of Japan is the current emperor of Japan? I'm not aware of any. There was a brief period in Japanese history when there were rival courts, each with its own emperor, but even though there are arguments on both sides as to which was legitimate, all of the emperors are still named posthumously with the Tennō suffix. I have to admit that the argument about nobody else using titles is a compelling one. However, I think it only applies to the current emperor at most. The rest are posthumous names, not merely titles. Meiji never ever appears by itself in the Japanese language. Whether dictionaries, encyplopedias, ordinary text, etc. it always appears with Tennō appended to it. So I would say the consistency argument with respect to Japanese and Chinese emperors alike, as well as the fact that he is widely referred to as Emperor Akihito are good enough reasons to change it. -<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefu_84bf.html" title="User:Jefu">Jefu</a> 16:43, August 3, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The emperor of Japan is really a king, but he is called an emperor. Historically, there was only one emperor in Asia, that of China. All other Asian rulers were kings or princes (except for maybe in India, the Middle East, etc) that paid tribute to the Chinese emperor, or resisted (and failed becoming a part of his empire). The Japanese, however, decided to one day call their king an "emperor", even though he did not have an empire. (You could argue though that the Japanese indeed have an empire since they conquered the Ainu and the Okinawans. They also briefly ruled the Koreans and Taiwanese.) This was considered an insult and provocation to the Chinese emperor. Japan is really the only country in history, as far as I know, with an "emperor" without an empire.--<a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESir_Edgar_35f5.html" title="User:Sir Edgar">Sir Edgar</a> 06:54, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's a polite fiction to call Akihito, the Emperor of Japan, it's a bit like Leonard Casley calling himself 'His Royal Highness Prince Leonard of Hutt' and his wife <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Leonard_488e.html" title="Prince Leonard">"Her Serene Highness Princess Shirley"</a>. An emperor is a king of kings, or by the O.E.D. "a sovereign of higher rank than a king", Queen Elizabeth could be called an Emperess as she reigns over Scotland and Wales (although the fact her son is the prince of Wales is a bit of a cheat), nevertheless the head of the Commonwealth is not referred to as Empress. Now if there was some evidence for the existence of lesser sovereigns in Japan then the title would certainly be correct. Strictly speaking he is King of Japan, but since the title of the ruler is up to the people of Japan to decide (i.e. "Her Serene Highness Princess Shirley"),and not us editors of wiki, then yes Akihito is the Emperor of Japan. lars 14:40, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The title of the emperor of Japan is set out in the Japanese constitution. In any event, Japan claims sovereignty over Okinawa, which was a kingdom, so the Japanese emperor, if the claim be admitted, is a king of at least one king.</p>
<p>But each territory had it's own lords, and he presided over them. 24.14.120.92 09:06, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Exactly. This is the correct answer. Japan used to be divided into many smaller semi-autonomous (the degree of autonomy being dependent on the time period) territories that were ruled by their own local rulers. The first accounts of Japan in Chinese historical texts refer to the land of Wa being divided into a hundred different countries. Japan wasn't unified until Hideyoshi/Tokugawa, and even then the local territories (the han) technically remained in the hands of local rulers until the land was formally passed to the emperor and the han system was abolished in favor of the prefectural system as part of the Meiji restoration. In any event, the word tennou has always been translated (by foreigners) into emperor in English. It has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with Japanese aggrandizement of the role of the emperor, as I'm sure some suspect.-<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefu_84bf.html" title="User:Jefu">Jefu</a> 11:49, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, "The term ('tenno') was first used at the beginning of the Nara period (710–784) as a translation of the Chinese t'ien-huang, or 'heavenly emperor', and replaced the older title of mikado, or 'imperial gate'." <a href="http://secure.britannica.com/eb/article-9071703" class="external free" title="http://secure.britannica.com/eb/article-9071703" rel="nofollow">http://secure.britannica.com/eb/article-9071703</a> The Japanese were fully aware of Chinese customs and institutions by the 7th century. Instead of taking the title of "wang" (king), they adopted "tien huang" (heavenly emperor).</dd>

<dd>And here is the entry from <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emperors_of_Japan_eee7.html" title="Emperors of Japan">Emperors of Japan</a>: <i>The first documented use of the title "tenno" is in a diplomatic letter from Empress Suiko to Emperor Yang of Sui China in 607 CE, bearing the sentence "tennō of the east hails kōtei of the west" - the same sentence was translated into Chinese as "tianzi of the land of sunrise hails tianzi of the land of sunset". Tianzi, son of heaven, was a title used by Chinese emperors. The introduction of this term comes amidst the movement of Japanese sinicization, and is considered an attempt of the Japanese rulers to assert themselves on equal footing with the Chinese emperors.</i></dd>

<dd>This insulted the Chinese emperor and his indignation is believed to be contained in the response. However, the Japanese envoy Imono Imoko (deliberately) lost the response, and avoided offending Empress Suiko upon his return to Japan. The empress's nephew, Prince Shotoku, really only wanted to express that Japan is an independent country and not a tributary country of China. But he ended up offending the Chinese. Nevertheless, Sui China desired friendly relations with Wa Japan prior to invading Goguryeo Korea. And so it was.--<a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESir_Edgar_35f5.html" title="User:Sir Edgar">Sir Edgar</a> 08:10, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not exactly sure what you are going on about. What does the introduction of the word tennō into the Japanese language have to do with how it is translated into English. Are you confusing the arguments here?</dd>

<dd>But since you mention it, let me point out some of the inaccuracies in what you wrote above. First, the Encyclopedia Britannica article was probably written 50 years ago and never updated, and in any event is highly simplistic. The implication that there was a single prior term "Mikado" that was thrown out in favor of "Tennō" is simply incorrect. There were several terms that were used when refering to the line of rulers who eventually became the imperial line. In particular, Ōkimi was used, as well as Sumeramikoto, both of which appear in the Nihonshoki and the Kojiki. Second, the article regarding the letter to the Chinese emperor is flat out wrong (and thank you for pointing out the innacuracy so that I may fix it). The term used in the letter (which is recorded in Chinese texts) was Tenshi (天子, so you got the Chinese correct) not Tennō (天皇). The oldest documented use of the word Tennō is from an inscription on a wooden slat (Mokkan) that was unearthed in Asuka (near Nara) in 1998. The slat has been dated back to the reigns of <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emperor_Tenji_0f30.html" title="Emperor Tenji">Emperor Tenji</a> and <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empress_Jito_270a.html" title="Empress Jito">Empress Jitō</a> which were somewhat later than Ono no Imoko and his trip to China in 607. There are those who believe that the term was first introduced during the reign of <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empress_Suiko_d050.html" title="Empress Suiko">Empress Suiko</a>, but the favored view currently is that it wasn't introduced until the reign of Tenji/Jitō. (Kumagai Kimio, <i>Ōkimi kara Tennō e</i>, Kōdansha 2001).-<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJefu_84bf.html" title="User:Jefu">Jefu</a> 16:15, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The word "tenno" means "heavenly emperor" or "heavenly ruler". It is a title above king. The Japanese were fully aware that the use of such a title would be equivalent to declaring Japan an independent country from China. The justification of the use of such a term is weak at best though. Wa was not hundreds of countries, but tribes, and they were not even unified when the use of the term tenno began. Furthermore, Japan did not annex the Ryukyu Kingdom until 1879 and the Ainu in Hokkaido were not conquered until the late 19th century. So, where was the empire?</p>
<p>You may say that "emperor" was a term given by Westerners, but the Japanese accepted it. If it was wrong, they themselves would use another term in English.--<a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESir_Edgar_35f5.html" title="User:Sir Edgar">Sir Edgar</a> 08:03, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is also the possibility that they accepted it as translation to keep up with Europe's own title inflation. As we reach the Meiji era, Europe had five empires (Ottoman, German, Austrian, French and Russian), Asia had at least three (India (to Britain), China, Persia), Africa had at least one (Ethiopia) and even America had one (Brazil). Japan is not, after all, much bigger than say, the British Isles, and population was rather equivalent. Whether or not an emperor rules over sovereign rulers, kings or anything else of the sort is probably irrelevant (the Byzantine Empire avoided feudalism as much as it could). As for heavenly ruler part, European kings were considered to be inviolable rulers with a divine mandate to reign. But keeping the translation as Emperor is certainly better as it is what is accepted; otherwise, this would be like insisting (for example in the case of a Hohenzollern restauration in Germany, a Bonapartist restauration in France or restauration in Ethiopia) that they should not be addressed as emperor but as kings because "they don't rule an empire". Or we might as well insist the the Grand Duke of Luxemburg is actually Count.</dd>

<p>The Tenno still presided over the various sovereign rulers whether they were completely united or not. 24.14.120.92 15:24, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
