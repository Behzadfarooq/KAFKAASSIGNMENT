In the anime as it only goes up to volume 8 Akito is indeed portrayed as a male becuase it had not been confirmed in the manga yet. We dont yet know why she is adressed as a male, but we assume that she has ordered them to call her male and since they can not disobey her they must oblige. We assume that her reasoning will soon be adressed.</p>

<p>In the description on the main fruits basket page, it describes Akito engaging in sexual actions with Kureno. Perhaps an missed chapter on my part, but where and how did the manga expalin that fact..? -<a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegamanZero_5c06.html" title="User:MegamanZero">Zero</a><sup><a href="../../../m/e/g/User_talk%7EMegamanZero_9677.html" title="User talk:MegamanZero">Talk</a></sup> 08:04, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In chapter 96, there's a scene with them kissing at the beginning. A little later in the same chapter, they are sleeping in the same bed. Also, towards the end of chapter 97, it shows them kissing, this time with Akito's yukata coming off, and Kureno isn't wearing a shirt (From the image, you can't tell if he's wearing anything else or not). Those are the refrences I found. -Kamirose 01:26, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This information is a thought of a prediction. Since all the bubbles in the manga panels of tese chapters are in japenese. Akito was also shown kissing Shigure somewhere in chapter 98 or further chapters. Then afterwards Shigure and Akito end up having sex. But as myself [shimichan] is not proven.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I know it's not proven. Zero asked for the refrences. It was hinted at, though perhaps never proven outright. Also, I'm not saying that Shigure and Akito never slept together. They did, and I'm actually a fan of the Shigure/Akito pairing. However, that doesn't mean that Akito never actually engaged in sexual acts with Kureno. Kamirose 23:20, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Oh, and I forgot to mention... in volume 17 (I forget which chapter) while Shigure is visiting Akito, he mentions that the reason he slept with Ren (Akito's mother) was because Akito slept with Kureno. So, actually, it was proven. ^^; Kamirose 02:37, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, and besides, we all knew it all along. ^_^ Sorry I took so long, but as a poor girl living in the States, I had to wait until either it was dubbed or I could see someone's elses proof.

<p>For this section my translation of the story has been used without my permission nor has Otaku Corner been linked or credited anywhere that I can see on the Fruits Basket pages. The translation can be found here <a href="http://otakucorner.blogspot.com/2006/08/fruits-basket-chapter-131.html" class="external free" title="http://otakucorner.blogspot.com/2006/08/fruits-basket-chapter-131.html" rel="nofollow">http://otakucorner.blogspot.com/2006/08/fruits-basket-chapter-131.html</a> As you can see about half way through a small amount of the text is edited to be shorter but the speech is completely, and the text is mostly, still copied word for word. I'd like it if the poster of the section could link or credit Otaku Corner for the translation and in the future ask permission before using it. I work hard on the translations and would like to be at least credited for the translation. Thanks. ^_^</p>

<p>The constant changing of the pronouns addressing Akito in this article is seriously starting to grate on my nerves. This article states right at the top that there are spoilers throughout so what's up guys? I seriously don't get it.</p>
<p>While I'm here I might as well throw out that it makes very little sense to have a whole section devoted to Kyou and Akito (which, frankly, deals very little with their actual relationship anyway) and a translation of the Zodiac story (which also doesn't belong here, in my opinion) while her relationship with Shigure and Kureno isn't even addressed. This article needs a serious overhaul.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I suggest that the Akito article be protected. Too many edits on pronouns! <a href="../../../k/y/o/User%7EKyo_cat_9d81.html" title="User:Kyo cat">Kyo cat</a> 22:46, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I agree, this page really needs some accurate editing. The zodiac story is definitely out of place. It has no more relation to Akito as it does to any of the other. Kami was a separate character to Akito just like the cat and the other animals. The Kyo and Akito part really needs some cleaning up, parts go off to the curse again and others are just inaccurate.

<p>Can someone please add a "relationship with Yuki" section? I don't know why there's a whole section devoted to her relationship with Kyo, but there's not one with Yuki. She had more interaction with Yuki...so wouldn't it make sense to include this section?</p>
<p>I would do it myself, but I haven't ready all of the manga yet, and I don't want to post misinformation because of it. --71.74.81.105 21:43, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All right, I've started the section, but I need to more time to expand it further (I'm doing homework right now, and I need to get my manga out too).

</dl>
<p>I expanded it to the best of my abilities, given my knowledge about what happened in the manga. Will someone write about the cage that Yuki was kept in now? Details like why Akito decided to keep him in there would be good. You can write it when you get time. --71.74.81.105 14:09, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
