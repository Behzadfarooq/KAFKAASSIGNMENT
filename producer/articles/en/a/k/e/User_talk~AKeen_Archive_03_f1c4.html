<p>Hiya, I was working with Admin <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> to merge <a href="../../../c/i/t/Category%7ECities_in_Italy_a6e0.html" title="Category:Cities in Italy">Category:Cities in Italy</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/w/Category%7ETowns_in_Italy_ef05.html" title="Category:Towns in Italy">Category:Towns in Italy</a>, as you proposed on June 9 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_June_9#Category:Cities_and_towns_in_Italy" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_June_9#Category:Cities_and_towns_in_Italy" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<dd>As I was looking through the Italian Wikipedia, I see that more often there they do what you've been doing with the Sicilian towns, which is to call things Municipalities. Perhaps it's worth doing another "Category merge" proposal, to get rid of "Cities of" and "Towns of" categories altogether, and replace everything with "Municipalities of"? --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 08:04, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Your contributions page looks nice.

<p>noticed your latin music credential, hope it extends to disco... I bulked up the Salsoul entry but my Wiki skills (especially at that point) suck. I would be so greatful if you could proof and "in line" the article. My hope is that my contributions outweigh my slop at any given time. Also, if you know anything about Morales and Munzibai a.k.a. M and M please bulk that one. I have a great source for the latter, an online interview that I read with religioius intensity and now cannot locate.

<p>Would my favorite editor be able to head over to Remix and, well, <i>remix</i> the article? It's getting messy, I did my best to make it factual and add this and that, but it's structure is suffering horribly. I also made note of three points (see the talk page for that article) that need to be in there, I couldn't bear to add them 'cause I'm on dial-up (not to mention tired of my own sloppiness!).

<p>I don't believe there was sufficient info about the film version to warrant a separate entry. The existing article included all the facts about the play and the movie. Your comment about half the info about the film being removed is puzzling, as its plot was discussed in the play section - repeating it was redundant. And why all the sub-headings in the play article? They unnecessarily break it up into small sections, giving it a very cluttered look. Furthermore, the photo is no longer relevant, since it doesn't pertain to the play. I'm curious as to why you felt you needed to make all the changes you did. <a href="../../../s/f/t/User%7ESFTVLGUY2_becf.html" title="User:SFTVLGUY2">SFTVLGUY2</a> 20:33, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the problem is the paucity of text as opposed to the number of awards. I moved the awards to a separate section so they don't overtake the business background. I may post the CHICOTW template on each Chicago neighborhood talk page. Thanks for your feedback on the CHICOTW. I will probably change the CHICO when the day changes according to (UTC). You may want to nominate your suggestions after I do this for the Jan 3 week. Multiple editors will help the page look active and attract the interest of others possibly. Even though no one is making the type of improvements to the page I want, it has gotten many more edits (feedback) this week than usual. I think this may make it this time. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyTheTiger_9324.html" title="User:TonyTheTiger">TonyTheTiger</a> 17:47, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
