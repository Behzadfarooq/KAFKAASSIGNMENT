<p>Hello! I was reviewing the talk page discussion and the contribution history for the <a href="../../../m/e/l/Mel_Gibson_DUI_incident_cb80.html" title="Mel Gibson DUI incident">Mel Gibson DUI incident</a> article and I notice that you made a proposal back in August to have the off shoot article merged back into <a href="../../../m/e/l/Mel_Gibson_7385.html" title="Mel Gibson">Mel Gibson</a>'s biography. I wonder if that is not a proposal worth revisting at this juncture now that this incident is no longer a current event? Some editors argued its status as a current event as their rationale, and indicated a willingness to revisit the article's status at a later date.</p>
<p>Currently, there is a heated AFD debate regarding the newly created Michael Richards Laugh Factory incident article. The creator of this article is justifying the spin off, based upon the existence of the <a href="../../../m/e/l/Mel_Gibson_DUI_incident_cb80.html" title="Mel Gibson DUI incident">Mel Gibson DUI incident</a> as a precedent. I'm inclined to think that spin off articles of this type are inappropriate content Wikipedia because they become platforms for excessive defamatory material about living people. If <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winona_Ryder_c49d.html" title="Winona Ryder">Winona Ryder</a>'s shoplifting arrest and trial doesn't warrant its own article, none of them do. I am interested in hearing your thoughts and I am wondering if you think it may be an appropriate time for the <a href="../../../m/e/l/Mel_Gibson_7385.html" title="Mel Gibson">Mel Gibson</a> merger to be reconsidered.

<p>Thanks for you message. You have a very good point about navigation issues. Have you ever tried to read the O.J. Simpson/Nicole Brown Murder coverage? There are so many articles that a chart is required! LOL</p>
<p>Yes, I would like to work towards getting the DUI incident merged back into the main article. I've only been on Wikipedia a few months, however, and I don't know how to nominate a merger, from a technical perspective. Can you help me out with that? <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleo123_d48f.html" title="User:Cleo123">Cleo123</a> 06:29, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was not recruited by anyone onto Wikipedia. This is outright discrimination against us. we are two people with the same opinion and we deserve to be teated this way. I have not been bribed or forced into helping Henchman. It's just that there was never a need to remove the minigame lists. We are two people, not one.

<p>Regarding the current news section of the article: I have posted a comment on the talk page. I would appreciate if you would air your concerns there, rather than simply delete an important section of the article. I placed the news section at the top so that it would be visible, and so anyone interested could quickly get updated information about what's going on.</p>

I have also opened an <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Economy_and_trade_7481.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Economy and trade">RfC</a>. Now that the article is under RfC, deleting the section again would be against WP policy.

<dd>AKMask: In my opinion, a new sockpuppet case (concerning meatpuppetry) about them needs to be made. Look at the their recent edits: alot of the edits are them trying to get the AFD discussions in their favor.

<p>I agree, it doesn't look good... but I'm not going to make a huge deal out of it. Is it annoying that they repeatedly do it after they were cautioned not to? Yup. But I have yet to see one instance where this sort of "get out the&#160;!vote" effort has actually impacted anything. If it starts actually impacting outcomes, then I'd be a lot more concerned.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 13:29, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there! It's best not to strike out comments without fully knowing what you're doing. As is plainly clear on the RFCU, the user was unblocked prior to the RFCU beginning and after participating on his primary username, he utilised a sock by referring to himself in the third person and advocating for his name to be kept. <a href="../../../g/a/i/User_talk%7EGaillimh_5024.html" title="User talk:Gaillimh"><font color="#008000"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>gaillimh</b></span></font></a><a href="../../../g/a/i/User_talk%7EGaillimh_5024.html" title="User talk:Gaillimh"><sup>Conas tá tú?</sup></a> 21:23, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I know exactly what I was doing. The fact that he used the exact same signature (which is a unique one) shows fairly plainly that he wasn't trying to fool anyone. -<b><a href="../../../a/k/m/User%7EAKMask_da48.html" title="User:AKMask"><font color="#990011">M</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../a/k/m/User_talk%7EAKMask_4b56.html" title="User talk:AKMask"><font color="#990011">ask</font></a></sup> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Alaska.svg_3df9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/e/e6/Flag_of_Alaska.svg/20px-Flag_of_Alaska.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="14" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Alaska.svg_3df9.html" /></a> 21:25, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think you do. Skewing consensus by means of sockpuppetry is a very serious matter, and obvious or not, the user still engaged in that practise. That it was obvious shows a further disregard to the community <a href="../../../g/a/i/User_talk%7EGaillimh_5024.html" title="User talk:Gaillimh"><font color="#008000"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>gaillimh</b></span></font></a><a href="../../../g/a/i/User_talk%7EGaillimh_5024.html" title="User talk:Gaillimh"><sup>Conas tá tú?</sup></a> 21:30, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I just finished putting together a fairly decent investigation of a couple sockpuppets not an hour ago. Look for yourself, its at <a href="../../../a/k/m/User%7EAKMask_puppets_6e4b.html" title="User:AKMask/puppets">User:AKMask/puppets</a> The fact that there was no real sockpuppetry here seems to through out any possibility of there needing a disclaimer. First of all, before viewing the source, the 2 accounts <b>appear to be the same</b>. Same name shown. Second of all, at worst its as bad as those idiots who put Delete or Keep in front of every comment they make. Look at the situation as the closing admin would see it. Say user Bob votes for something, and then for reasons unknown and seemingly complicated, shows up as bob2 but still signs as Bob. No ones fooled, theres no puppetry cause hes not trying to passhimself off as someone else, hes identifying with the first account. I trust whoever closes not to be retard when reading the discussion. -<b><a href="../../../a/k/m/User%7EAKMask_da48.html" title="User:AKMask"><font color="#990011">M</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../a/k/m/User_talk%7EAKMask_4b56.html" title="User talk:AKMask"><font color="#990011">ask</font></a></sup> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Alaska.svg_3df9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/e/e6/Flag_of_Alaska.svg/20px-Flag_of_Alaska.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="14" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Alaska.svg_3df9.html" /></a> 21:35, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hehe, I still don't think you understand what I'm getting at. A sockpuppet does not need to be covert; in fact, lots of sockpuppets are quite obvious. This is a clear-cut situation of sockpuppetry, and I'm not sure what you don't understand about this. I'm happy to work with you further, but please take a look at <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>. I've highlighted a passage that might be of relevance, so you don't have to spend your valuable time going through the whole thing:</dd>

<p><i>Wikipedia uses a "one person, one vote" principle for all votes and similar discussions where individual preferences are counted in any fashion (vote fraud). Accordingly, sock puppets may not be used to give the impression of more support for a viewpoint. This includes voting multiple times in any election, or using more than one account in discussions such as Wikipedia:Deletion debates, Wikipedia:Requests for adminship, or on talk pages.</i></p>

<dd>I've read the policy many-a-time. What you seem to fail to get is he never got more then one vote. He reiterated his posistion, generally frowned upon when you bold the opinion again, but he still only got one vote. If you need further clarification, feel free to ask&#160;:) -<b><a href="../../../a/k/m/User%7EAKMask_da48.html" title="User:AKMask"><font color="#990011">M</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../a/k/m/User_talk%7EAKMask_4b56.html" title="User talk:AKMask"><font color="#990011">ask</font></a></sup> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Alaska.svg_3df9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/e/e6/Flag_of_Alaska.svg/20px-Flag_of_Alaska.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="14" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Alaska.svg_3df9.html" /></a> 21:44, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hehe, I appreciate your offer to clarify, but again, you've missed the point. Please take another look at the RFCU and I'm sure you'll see what I mean <a href="../../../g/a/i/User_talk%7EGaillimh_5024.html" title="User talk:Gaillimh"><font color="#008000"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>gaillimh</b></span></font></a><a href="../../../g/a/i/User_talk%7EGaillimh_5024.html" title="User talk:Gaillimh"><sup>Conas tá tú?</sup></a> 21:46, 3 April 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Also, RFCU isn't a vote, but a discussion, which is another reason why it's important not to misrepresent oneself <a href="../../../g/a/i/User_talk%7EGaillimh_5024.html" title="User talk:Gaillimh"><font color="#008000"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>gaillimh</b></span></font></a><a href="../../../g/a/i/User_talk%7EGaillimh_5024.html" title="User talk:Gaillimh"><sup>Conas tá tú?</sup></a> 21:47, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I dont know if I can further clarify my posistion. I wont strike out your comment, but we may just have to agree to disagree on this, I just dont see it as an attempt to skew consensus. Perhaps he thought the old name would be hosed and this was going to be his new one, maybe he honestly thought he was blocked. I dont know, but I do know that if it was an attempt to skew consensus, it was roughly on par with the skill that the 3 Stooges would have attempting the same thing&#160;:) -<b><a href="../../../a/k/m/User%7EAKMask_da48.html" title="User:AKMask"><font color="#990011">M</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../a/k/m/User_talk%7EAKMask_4b56.html" title="User talk:AKMask"><font color="#990011">ask</font></a></sup> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Alaska.svg_3df9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/e/e6/Flag_of_Alaska.svg/20px-Flag_of_Alaska.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="14" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Alaska.svg_3df9.html" /></a> 21:50, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>&lt;---- I'm not sure if we're in disagreement; it seems as though we simply aren't communicating as well as we'd like to ( the perils of trying to carry on a conversation on a talk page, I suppose&#160;:) ). The user in question, <a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenian_Swine_d77b.html" title="User:Fenian Swine">User:Fenian Swine</a>, begun his participation on the RFCU as so:</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Strong Allow</b>. It would be nonsense to block the name of someone who contributes well towards this site. Whether you perceive me to be anything is just your own personal opinion, it means nothing. Should you chose to block the name, you will be losing a worthwhile member over something as silly as political correctness.--Play Brian Moore 20:28, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>He then utilised his sockpuppet, Swenian Fine, to skew consensus by adovocating that he be allowed to keep his original user name as so:</p>
<p><b>Strong Allow</b>. It's a bit late for this debate ladies and gentlemen. Swine is not offensive at all. The user is a Fenian, henceforth if there is any sense left in this place, it will be allowed.--Play Brian Moore 20:47, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later, he logged on to this sockpuppet account to attempt to skew consensus. It's clear that he was not just mistaken, as he refers to himself in the third person, therefore assuming the position that he is an independent user. I agree completely that his naming and signature choice for this sock was incredibly daft, but nonetheless it is a sock and he did attempt to skew the consensus. I mentioned that the sock was disallowed from participating and he has commented several times since without acknowledging so. As such, it's necessary to note, quite clearly, that the user utilised a sock during this discussion <a href="../../../g/a/i/User_talk%7EGaillimh_5024.html" title="User talk:Gaillimh"><font color="#008000"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>gaillimh</b></span></font></a><a href="../../../g/a/i/User_talk%7EGaillimh_5024.html" title="User talk:Gaillimh"><sup>Conas tá tú?</sup></a> 22:01, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Then note that, I'll note as well that there doesn't appear to be enough evidence to support the accusation, <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and such, and the closing admin can make up his mind. -<b><a href="../../../a/k/m/User%7EAKMask_da48.html" title="User:AKMask"><font color="#990011">M</font></a></b><sup><a href="../../../a/k/m/User_talk%7EAKMask_4b56.html" title="User talk:AKMask"><font color="#990011">ask</font></a></sup> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Alaska.svg_3df9.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/e/e6/Flag_of_Alaska.svg/20px-Flag_of_Alaska.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="14" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Alaska.svg_3df9.html" /></a> 22:05, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hehe, I have noted it, and with regards to good faith, I'm not sure how you could think that they are two different users, as he's actually stated that they are one in the same. You need to start looking more closely at things before commenting on them mate&#160;;) <a href="../../../g/a/i/User_talk%7EGaillimh_5024.html" title="User talk:Gaillimh"><font color="#008000"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>gaillimh</b></span></font></a><a href="../../../g/a/i/User_talk%7EGaillimh_5024.html" title="User talk:Gaillimh"><sup>Conas tá tú?</sup></a> 22:06, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I dont think they're different users, I think they're the same, what I do is assume the good faith that it wasn't an attempt to skew consensus. From <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>: "sock puppets should not be used for the purpose of deception, distraction, or to <b>create the illusion of broader support for a position than actually exists.</b>" He did not do this because it seems somewhat obvious that there was no intent at deception.
