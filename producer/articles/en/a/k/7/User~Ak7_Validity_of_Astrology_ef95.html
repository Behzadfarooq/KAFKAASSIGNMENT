<p>To those who practice astrology professionally, it is a science that seeks to investigate the influence of celestial bodies on to the Earth. They claim to be able to predict events on earth, even within the personal lives of individuals, by observation of the Sun, Moon, planets and stars. There is not wide consensus amont astrologers as to whether the arrangements of the planets <i>cause</i> the events or merely <i>predict</i> them.</p>
<p>Some astrologers, rather than make take a clear stand saying astrology has objective validity or it does not, consider <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">astrology</a> to be a useful <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intuition_%28knowledge%29.html" title="Intuition (knowledge)">intuitive</a> tool by which people may come to better understand themselves, others, and the relationships between them. Some argue that the question of astrology's objective validity is a non-issue, and that astrology's primary value lies in the introspection and self-examination it provokes. In this respect astrology shares more with <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarot.html" title="Tarot">Tarot</a>, <a href="../../../i/_/c/I_Ching_a792.html" title="I Ching">I Ching</a> and modern <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychotherapy.html" title="Psychotherapy">psychotherapy</a> than <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astronomy.html" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a>. Perhaps for this reason, astrology remains popular even in cultures where scientific critical thinking is major part of secondary and higher level education.</p>
<p>Astrology's continued appeal may rest on its ability to link an individual's life to the wider <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmos.html" title="Cosmos">cosmos</a>, and so give a feeling of uniqueness, meaning, and connection to the totality of things. Astrology also contains <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archetype.html" title="Archetype">archetypal</a> <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symbolism.html" title="Symbolism">symbolism</a>, which, according to some schools of thought (such as <a href="../../../j/u/n/Jungian_psychology.html" title="Jungian psychology">Jungian psychology</a>), can be found universally throughout humanity.</p>
<p>Althoug the consensus among modern scientists is that astrology has no scientific validity, historically many of the world's most famous astronomers, mathematicians, physicians and philosophers were also astrologers, or consulted alstrologers. Like <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alchemy.html" title="Alchemy">alchemy</a>'s relation to <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemistry.html" title="Chemistry">chemistry</a>, astrology's relation to astronomy can be seen as that of a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-science.html" title="Proto-science">proto-science</a> by historians.</p>
<p>Because of the popularization of astrology in the early 20th Century - mostly due to the efforts and controversy surrounding the New York City-based astrologer <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangeline_Adams_6c64.html" title="Evangeline Adams">Evangeline Adams</a> - and the need for publishers to sell more newspapers; "sun-sign" astrology columns spread rapidly throughout the United States. Designed as a publishing gimmick to raise newspaper sales, these columns continue to be printed in nearly every newspaper in the country and subsequently, throughout the world. Thus, the applied science of astrology never rose above this very simplistic form of astrology. Many astrologers scorn sun-sign horoscope predictions as nothing more than a way to entertain readers. ‘Popular’ astrology in which people are labeled on the basis of their sun sign alone is seen by these astrologers as frivolous. The Sun sign is regarded as one of many factors that must be taken into account when interpreting the transits of planets and stars relative to the Earth in forecasting events.</p>
<p>Regarding the mathematical complexity of astrology, however, there is no one standard range of approach. Some astrologers may be members of a society, such as the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Federation_of_Astrologers_26ec.html" title="American Federation of Astrologers">American Federation of Astrologers</a>, which tries to maintain standards of learning and conduct; others appear to be lone hobbyists.</p>
<p>In the 20th century, many apologists in favor of astrology have come to use modern science as the reasoning behind their explanations. Some astrologers maintain that <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravitational.html" title="Gravitational">gravitational</a> or <a href="../../../t/i/d/Tidal_forces.html" title="Tidal forces">tidal forces</a> are the mechanism behind astrology, but the idea that <a href="../../../t/i/d/Tidal_forces.html" title="Tidal forces">tidal forces</a> from the gravitational influence of the <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moon.html" title="Moon">Moon</a> affect <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biological.html" title="Biological">biological</a> organisms has only recently found some support among scientists in limited cases, and most of the conventional scientific community still believe its effects to be minimal; by implication, the effect from other celetial bodies would be so small as to be imperceptible. Some modern astrologers state that the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_wind.html" title="Solar wind">solar wind</a> emanating from the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun.html" title="Sun">Sun</a> regulates weather on Earth, despite a lack of supporting empirical evidence in <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metereology.html" title="Metereology">metereology</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/k/7/User%7EAk7_Validity_of_Astrology_ef95.html" title="Edit section: How skeptics view astrology">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">How skeptics view astrology</span></h2>
<p>Skeptics believe that astrology is a form of <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a>, which attempts to lay claim to the prestige of <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">science</a> without submitting itself to the discipline of <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_method.html" title="Scientific method">scientific method</a>. Skeptics may consider astrology to lack <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falsifiability.html" title="Falsifiability">falsifiability</a>; that is, they may consider it impossible to construct a test for astrology that it could demonstrably fail. Other skeptics hold that not only is astrology falsifiable, it has been disproven</p>
<p>Given that most astrologers claim to make predictions about future events, it should be possible to construct an <a href="../../../e/x/p/Experiment.html" title="Experiment">experiment</a> that at least measures its accuracy. No such experiment has ever demonstrated the <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivity_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Objectivity (philosophy)">objective</a> validity of astrology. In addition, scientific <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_blind.html" title="Double blind">double blind</a> tests <a href="http://psychicinvestigator.com/demo/AstroSkc.htm" class="external text" title="http://psychicinvestigator.com/demo/AstroSkc.htm" rel="nofollow">(example)</a> have shown that even the best astrologers fare no better than random <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chance.html" title="Chance">chance</a> when matching <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horoscope.html" title="Horoscope">astrological charts</a> to <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personality.html" title="Personality">personalities</a>.</p>
<p>Astrology critics point out that its proponents respond to such lack of evidence, either by changing their claims, or by refusing to accept the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_method.html" title="Scientific method">scientific method</a> as a valid test of their claims and relying instead on subjective and anecdotal evidence. If <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_method.html" title="Scientific method">scientific method</a> is to be rejected entirely, then astrology has to abandon all claim to being a science and of offering anything consistently of use. By declining to attempt any experiments that might show astrology to be false, skeptics hold that astrologers show themselves not to be scientists but rather holders of a <a href="../../../f/a/i/Faith.html" title="Faith">faith</a> or <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctrine.html" title="Doctrine">doctrine</a>.</p>
<p>The unquestioning use of horoscope columns in newspapers and mass-market magazines without an "amusement only" warning leads to "Astrological Forecasts", being considered on the same footing in the minds of some with weather forecasts. Astrology has failed carefully designed empirical tests of its predictive claims <a href="http://www.skepsis.nl/astrot.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.skepsis.nl/astrot.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, unlike <a href="../../../m/e/t/Meteorology.html" title="Meteorology">meteorology</a>, which, although not always correct, has been proved to be significantly more accurate than random guessing.</p>
<p>The established scientific consensus is that astrology is either mere <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superstition.html" title="Superstition">superstition</a> or imposture, and that its popularity is due either to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Age_1b86.html" title="New Age">New Age</a> <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magical_thinking.html" title="Magical thinking">magical thinking</a>, wilful deception or to unscientific gullibility on the part of the uneducated.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/k/7/User%7EAk7_Validity_of_Astrology_ef95.html" title="Edit section: Frank Brown's Experiment">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Frank Brown's Experiment</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a>, a <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biologist.html" title="Biologist">biologist</a> named Frank Brown transported a shipment of <a href="../../../o/y/s/Oysters.html" title="Oysters">oysters</a> from <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Haven%2C_Connecticut_109e.html" title="New Haven, Connecticut">New Haven, Connecticut</a> several hundred miles away to <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evanston%2C_Illinois_903a.html" title="Evanston, Illinois">Evanston, Illinois</a>. Oysters open and close their shells in <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synchronization.html" title="Synchronization">synchronization</a> with the <a href="../../../t/i/d/Tide.html" title="Tide">tide</a>, and up until this time the accepted explanation for this phenomenon was simple: the physical force of the <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water.html" title="Water">water</a> gave the oysters some cue as to when to open and close their shells.</p>
<p>Dr. Brown placed his oysters in a controlled environment, and at first they responded as expected, opening and closing their shells in accord with the tide in New Haven. However, within a week, they began to get out of sync. Within two weeks, they had once again settled on a single <a href="../../../r/h/y/Rhythm.html" title="Rhythm">rhythm</a>, opening and closing in correlation with the <a href="../../../t/i/d/Tidal_forces.html" title="Tidal forces">tidal forces</a> of Evanston, despite the fact that there was no physical motion of water to prompt their action. Clearly, some mechanism in the oyster was detecting the tidal force.</p>
<p>One explanation advanced by biologists is that the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a>'s <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnetic_field.html" title="Magnetic field">magnetic fields</a> are affected by tidal forces, and nearly all biological organisms (including <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humans.html" title="Humans">humans</a>) are affected by the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth%27s_magnetic_field.html" title="Earth's magnetic field">Earth's magnetic field</a>. While this has little bearing on the practice of astrology, it is evidence that tidal forces do indeed have an effect (albeit indirect) on living <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organism.html" title="Organism">organisms</a>.</p>
<p>However, <a href="../../../p/h/e/Pheromones.html" title="Pheromones">pheromones</a> have almost the exact same effect, even in humans. Knowledge of pheromones was largely discovered <i>after</i> 1954, and biologists today, when given the information, would likely conclude that pheromones from the living things in the environment triggered the synchronization.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mars_effect.html" title="Mars effect">Mars effect</a> is based on some of the statistical analyses of French psychologist and statistician <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michel_Gauquelin_141d.html" title="Michel Gauquelin">Michel Gauquelin</a> published in the late <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>. It claims that Mars occupies certain positions in the sky slightly more often (21%) at the birth of sports champions than at the birth of ordinary people (18%). Specifically, the claim is that sports champions are more likely to be born when Mars is rising in the eastern horizon or culminating in the upper meridian, known to astrologers as the <a href="../../../a/s/c/Ascendant.html" title="Ascendant">ascendant</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midheaven.html" title="Midheaven">midheaven</a>. Among hundreds of possible correlations Gauquelin tested, this was one of the most striking results that he found to be statistically significant, but it was not the only one.</p>
<p>However, there is a problem with ambiguity (who qualifies as a "sports champion"?) known as the eminence factor, where the Mars effect only shows up in the most prominent athletes in their fields of prowess. Also, significant correlation does not prove that two variables are related or connected. This is a common <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_fallacy.html" title="Logical fallacy">logical fallacy</a> known as <a href="../../../c/o/r/Correlation_implies_causation_%28logical_fallacy%29.html" title="Correlation implies causation (logical fallacy)">correlation implying causation</a>.</p>
<p>In a more recent study by several French scientists <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D0879759887/roberttoddcarrolA/002-5154596-6648018" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D0879759887/roberttoddcarrolA/002-5154596-6648018" rel="nofollow">[2]</a><a href="http://www.discord.org/~lippard/kammann.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.discord.org/~lippard/kammann.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, a sample of over 1,000 French athletes was compared with thousands of others for birth times, dates and location of Mars at birth. The comparison did not show any Mars effect.</p>

<p>It is sometimes said(with dubious authenticity) that statistically, people born in a certain time of year will become outgoing or docile, supposedly due to Astrological forces. Howvever, many Western societies use a child's age in <a href="../../../s/e/p/September.html" title="September">September</a> to determine the year in which he or she will begin formal education. Because of this, the average student born in September will spend his or her childhood and adolescence with peers who are mostly younger, while a student born in <a href="../../../a/u/g/August.html" title="August">August</a> will spend this time with peers who are mostly older. Therefore, even assuming that traditional justifications for astrology are entirely false, horoscope signs may still correlate with assertiveness but this is an artifact of the educational system.</p>

<p>For astrology to be true at all, celestial bodies must somehow affect earth. This is not controversial; both the Sun and the Moon have huge effects on the earth. Howver, the efects of any other celestrial bodies- many of which are central to astrology- on the Earth is minimal.</p>

<p>There are various claims by astrologers that distant planets affect us through either <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravitation.html" title="Gravitation">gravitation</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electromagnetism.html" title="Electromagnetism">electromagnetism</a>, or some other as yet undetected <a href="../../../f/o/r/Force.html" title="Force">force</a>. However, scientifically we know of no force whatsoever that is caused by distant stars and planets that is capable or affecting our lives and personalities here on earth. Consider the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Astrologers sometimes claim to have scientific explanations for their practices. For example, it is pointed out that the moon causes tides on earth, and it is reasoned that the gravitational pull of other heavenly bodies affect us. This is flawed for the following reasons:
<ol>
<li>The gravitational pull from e.g. <a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturn_%28planet%29.html" title="Saturn (planet)">Saturn</a>, when calculated for its effect over an area the size of the human body, is equal to the gravitational pull from a car 1.7 meters away. Yet astrologers do not seem to be interested in the positions of cars at the time of birth, or indeed whether one was born in a car park. As a matter of fact, the gravitational pull of Earth itself varies more from place to place than the pull of even the largest planets.</li>
<li>If direction and strength of the gravitational field is important, then surely nearby massive objects (cars, mountains, houses) and the birthing position would play a far greater role than distant planets.</li>
<li>Astrology also does not offer any explanation of how this minuscule gravitational pull from other planets comes to affect personality, why we are especially susceptible to gravitation during birth nor how the gravitational influences at one point in the past affects our outlook for the future.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If, on the other hand, it is the electromagnetic force rather than gravity that plays a role in our daily lives, then certainly the relatively weak (at least indoors) solar radiation and weak magnetic field of the earth would be drowned out by artificial lighting, TV screens, medical equipment or even refrigerator magnets. There is no evidence of even the strongest man-made magnet affects either the weather or biology of the human body; MRIs induce thousdands of times the natural magnetic field on the patient with no detectable physiologic effect.</p>
<p>All of the 4 known forces decay with distance (exponentially, no less), while astrology does not appear to compensate for this.</p>
<p>Assuming a theoretical (and as yet completely undetected) 5th force emanated by any celestial body, it is unclear how such a force could influence so differently two people located on Earth only hundreds of miles apart. Only the angle of incidence is left as a parameter. If this force exists, it shows a very singular behavior, unique in the physical laws, yet to be observed.</p>

<p>Astrological charts do not consider all stellar objects, including planets, moons, and distant stars, although some fixed stars are included in some astrological systems.</p>

The <a href="../../../t/r/o/Tropical_zodiac.html" title="Tropical zodiac">tropical zodiac</a> and the <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sidereal_zodiac.html" title="Sidereal zodiac">sidereal zodiac</a> both divide the <a href="../../../e/c/l/Ecliptic.html" title="Ecliptic">ecliptic</a> into 12 equal portions of 30 degrees, but the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constellations.html" title="Constellations">constellations</a> of the zodiac all vary in size, from 44 degrees across for <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgo_%28constellation%29.html" title="Virgo (constellation)">Virgo</a> to 20 degrees across for <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer_%28constellation%29.html" title="Cancer (constellation)">Cancer</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../t/r/o/Tropical_zodiac.html" title="Tropical zodiac">tropical zodiac</a> used by most western astrologers begins at the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vernal_point.html" title="Vernal point">vernal point</a>, which gradually changes its position due to the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Precession.html#Precession_of_the_equinoxes" title="Precession">precession</a> of <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a>'s <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axis_of_rotation.html" title="Axis of rotation">axis</a>, known as the precession of the equinoxes. Over the course of 2000 years, the tropical zodiac has shifted about 24 degrees, so any celestial object said to be in one <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrological_sign.html" title="Astrological sign">astrological sign</a> will, upon observation of the present night sky, usually be found occupying the next zodiacal <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constellation.html" title="Constellation">constellation</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sidereal_zodiac.html" title="Sidereal zodiac">sidereal zodiac</a>, used by many eastern astrologers, deducts about 24 degrees to account for the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Precession_of_the_equinoxes.html" title="Precession of the equinoxes">precession of the equinoxes</a>, but it still does not align perfectly with the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constellations.html" title="Constellations">constellations</a> because the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constellations.html" title="Constellations">constellations</a> are of unequal sizes, rather than each being 30 degrees across, as the sidereal zodiac requires.</li>
<li>Many who are skeptical using this claim continue to ignore that the only difference between tropical and sidereal zodiacs is due to the precession of the equinoxes. Each system - tropical and sidereal - is used as an astrological "technique" - and so the argument maintained by skeptics concerning the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constellations.html" title="Constellations">constellations</a> and the <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seasons.html" title="Seasons">seasons</a> continues to be used to debunk astrology without admitting understanding of the tropical and sidereal systems and the techniques versus an actual philosophy concerning the "seasons" and the "constellations" themselves as seen from a earth-based vantage point.</li>
</ul>
<p>Critics of astrology say that astrologers who use the tropical zodiac, as almost all in the west do, take an arbitrary point 2000 years ago in the past as the basis for their interpretation of the heavens. The zodiac of 2000 years ago holds no special place in astronomy. If we go back 4000 years we find Taurus was the constellation of the Vernal equinox, if we go back 6000, we find Gemini. Critics of astrology say that astronomers understand that the view of the heavens continually changes over long periods of time, while most astrologers use a fixed and inaccurate version of reality. Critics also point out that most modern astrologers are unwilling to adapt to a modern astronomical model of the heavens.</p>
<p>Adherents of Astrology have claimed that its techniques have been accurate for many centuries. However, three planets (<a href="../../../u/r/a/Uranus.html" title="Uranus">Uranus</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/p/Neptune_%28planet%29.html" title="Neptune (planet)">Neptune</a> and <a href="../../../p/l/u/Pluto_%28planet%29.html" title="Pluto (planet)">Pluto</a>), were only discovered within the last 250 years. Many astrologers have now integrated these planets into their systems. If these planets (or any, for that matter) affected life on earth in an astrological sense, there should have been measurable discrepancies between reality and prediction before these planets were discovered.</p>

<p>In <i>The Stars Down To Earth</i>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodor_Adorno_ccac.html" title="Theodor Adorno">Theodor Adorno</a> of the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankfurt_School_a302.html" title="Frankfurt School">Frankfurt School</a>, continued his consideration of the role of the <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_industry.html" title="Culture industry">culture industry</a> by examining the astrological columns of the daily papers in 1951. He accused them of false consciousness, demonstrating how the columns encouraged the low-level clerical or office workers to identify with the social rungs above them. But "false" consciousness is by definition multiple consciousness and ambivalence, and narrative and psychological theory allow consciousness to follow its own dialectical laws in which the astrological reader engages in a quite respectable suspension of disbelief (cf. the psychology of the lottery ticket buyer, who probably knows how slim the chances are) and never decouples from the judgment that a world is possible in which people, albeit half ironically, peruse the "stars" for clues.</p>
<p>One scientific explanation for the widespread belief in astrology is the so-called <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forer_effect.html" title="Forer effect">Forer effect</a> (also called personal validation fallacy or the Barnum effect after <a href="../../../p/2E/t/P.T._Barnum_c023.html" title="P.T. Barnum">P.T. Barnum</a>). In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a>, Forer observed that individuals will give high accuracy ratings to descriptions of their personality that supposedly are tailored specifically for them, which are in fact vague and general enough to apply to a wide range of people. In this way, the supposed traits given to people born under various signs may seem to the individual to be amazingly accurate, but are in reality extremely general.</p>

<p>The distinction between astrology and <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astronomy.html" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a> was not made until relatively recently (see <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_astrology.html" title="History of astrology">History of astrology</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_astronomy.html" title="History of astronomy">History of astronomy</a>). Today, astrology is viewed as astronomy's predecessor in the same way that <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alchemy.html" title="Alchemy">alchemy</a> is viewed as the predecessor of <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemistry.html" title="Chemistry">chemistry</a>. While most scientists dismiss modern astrology as a <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a>, they will admit to its historical status as a proto-science. See <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology_and_astronomy.html" title="Astrology and astronomy">astrology and astronomy</a> for more detail about the relationship between these two subjects.</p>
<p>There are <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biology.html" title="Biology">biological</a> phenomena that coordinate with celestial movements (e.g. <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circadian_rhythm.html" title="Circadian rhythm">circadian rhythms</a>, see <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chronobiology.html" title="Chronobiology">Chronobiology</a>). It has been demonstrated that some <a href="../../../a/m/p/Amphibians.html" title="Amphibians">amphibians</a> are able to use <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celestial_bodies.html" title="Celestial bodies">celestial bodies</a> for orientation (source: <i><a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_ecd4.html" title="Encyclopædia Britannica">Encyclopædia Britannica</a></i>). Some astrologers may attempt to draw conclusions from this, even though these correlations are not completely understood.</p>
