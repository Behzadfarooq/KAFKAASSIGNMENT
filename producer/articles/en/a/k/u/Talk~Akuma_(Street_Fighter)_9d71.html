<p>"He has been known to occasionally help people in need."<br />
How so? I'm a casual fan, so I don't know as much about SF as many other people, but I can't remember a single event in which he actually helped another person. It's mostly been him beating the everliving hell out of people, or causing misery for others (i.e. wrecking an innocent freighter). <a href="../../../t/e/r/User_talk%7ETerminusEst13_d146.html" title="User talk:TerminusEst13">TerminusEst13</a> 4:23 PM, August 25th, 2006</p>

<p>Would it be possible to have it so that when you click on the image of Akuma, you can flick through different images, sort of like a slideshow? You've got the SNK style artwork of him but I really like the Capcom artwork too. Doom jester 13:48, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay. BTW, to whoever's been adding in all the Capcom art though, well done, because it looks awesome. Actually I think the best artwork of Akuma is the picture that was in the Street Fighter EX manual, by his profile. It'd be cool to see that one on this page somewhere.

<p>First off, it's a name, not a real Japanese word like <i>Akuma</i> is, so I'm not sure it needs to be translated. Secondly, I must object to the current translation of "Strong Demon." 鬼 can refer to numerous different supernatural entities, even ghosts and spirits. Similarly, 豪 is much closer to "great" or "powerful" than "strong." I am going to edit this. If you revert, please explain here first. --<a href="../../../f/e/i/User%7EFeitclub_dad9.html" title="User:Feitclub"><i>feitclub</i></a> 21:13, May 5, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Whereas I do agree that 豪 is more like great/powerful than "strong", in my experience, I have only seen 鬼 taken as the kanji for "Oni". <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_S_f5c0.html" title="User:The S">The S</a> 04:40, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Along those lines, I must ask how "ten" 天 in Japanese (sky) looks anything like "jigoku" 地獄 (hell). I must also ask how the "top stroke" of "ten" can ever be made upside down, when it is in fact a straight line. It should also be noted that "ten" is merely "sky" whereas tengoku (sky-country) is actually "heaven". - Nekochan</p>

<li>Uhm "Akuma turns his back and a kanji meaning "heaven" (or arguably "rest in peace") appears on his back" is still in there, and I argue that the kanji is not "heaven" at all. - Nekochan
<ul>
<li>There's many instances where the "ten" kanji is translated to "heaven" as a shorthand for "tengoku". I don't believe it's inaccurate. Read the Akuma section of Tiamat's FAQ. <a href="http://db.gamefaqs.com/coinop/arcade/file/street_fighter_plot.txt" class="external autonumber" title="http://db.gamefaqs.com/coinop/arcade/file/street_fighter_plot.txt" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 21:09, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I am a native Japanese speaker and I do speak some Mandarin as well. I strong disagree with the tanlation of "powerful spirit" from the position of a native. That is correct to translat 豪(gou) as great/powerful. But translation of 鬼(ki) can never be sprits or ghosts. That is only in Mandarin language means 鬼(guei) as aforesaid meanings. There is another character for spirts in Japanese 霊 or 魂. Take a look at <a href="../../../o/n/i/Oni_%28mythology%29.html" title="Oni (mythology)">Oni (mythology)</a>(鬼=ki) that should give you a clue. It needs to be translated as demons or ogres, always physical evil mighty monstors but never something fuzzy like ghosts in Japanese language. Since Capcom is NOT a Chinese Video game developer but Japanese, his name 豪鬼 should be translated as "great/powerful (whichever you like) deamon" Btw his name in English "Akuma"(悪魔) originally means Deamon in Japanese.　豪鬼(gouki) is also Homonym of the word 豪気(gouki) which means daring, valor or bold. Let me make statements about the character 天(ten) on his back as well. The single character 天 often mean "sky" or "heaven". In this case it can mean a lot. We can take it as 昇天 wich means R.I.P. There is an idiom 天下無敵 meaning "matchless under the sun" more of the game players in Japan take the character of 天 as this way. There's a back ground story Akuma's elder brother <a href="../../../g/o/u/Gouken.html" title="Gouken">Gouken</a> had the Japanese character 無(mu) which means "null" or "none". Togheter they go <b>天</b>下<b>無</b>敵. I think if you ask Capcom, they will just say that's up to the video game players how they take it. So they left the Japanese character with only one that can be taken as several meanings.--<a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakora_D_d655.html" title="User:Takora D">Takora D</a></li>
<li>Correct me if I'm wrong, but from where I come from, "ten" is pronounce as "tien".</li>

<p>I don't who proposed this but I strongly disagree. Akuma/Gouki is an actual, popular <i>Street Fighter</i> character.

<p>I agree with you. However merging the "Origins of Akuma" section in <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheng_Long_c53e.html" title="Sheng Long">Sheng Long</a> would really make sense, since the content in that page duplicates the one in this section.

<dl>
<dd>I think that "Origins of Akuma" section should remain in Akuma/Gouki, that's were Akuma came from so why delete it? Instead the Sheng Long article should redirect to Akuma, cause everything is explained there and Sheng isn't a character at all and is not necessary as an aricle. <a href="../../../a/e/n/User%7EAeneiden-Rex_0a9e.html" title="User:Aeneiden-Rex">Aeneiden-Rex</a> 13:09, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Even if Sheng Long isn't a real character, I still think it deserves its own article; there is content (the EGM fake reporter, the new joke about street fighter 3, some background about the hoax, etc.) that doesn't really fit in Akuma's article and is large enough to spawn a standalone article. Let's keep the section "Origins of Akuma", but stripped of the duplicate content, and have it link to Sheng Long to know the whole story. What about that? --Lorenzo80 15:45, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article now says: Sometime later Akuma observed a tournament that was taking place, and when the final round approached he jumped in and fought one of the finalists while the other was in the changing room. Winning the fight and taking his opponent's life, Akuma fled the tournament. (Posted by Daily grind on 09-12-2005)</p>

<li>It's the tournament Adon took part in, I dont recall the title. But while he was preparing in the changing room Akuma lept into the ring and defeated/killed Adon's challenger then left. As for evidence, it happens in Adon's Street Fighter Alpha 2 ending and has been confirmed by Capcom to be official. I suppose I should have elaborated more on the tournament, but I thought since this is Akuma's article not Adon's it would be slightly pointless to give it more of an expansive mention.

<p>The Shin Akuma entry in the article seems to imply that Gouki must reach some higher state or plateau to achieve the power that is definitive of "Shin Gouki". I personally believe that this is incorrect, and there's another theory roaming about (noted in Tiamat's comprehensive SF Plot giude) stating that Gouki is in fact Shin Gouki with a merciful attitude. That usually means that Shin Gouki (who is probably one of the strongest fighters in the entire SF universe) holds back punches and voluntarily limits the use of his power (much like Oro with his bounded arm - coincidentally, Oro is also one of the strongest fighters in the SF universe), as depicted in his normal Gouki form.</p>
<p>On a side note, Shin Gouki from CvS2 is not the same Shin Gouki of SF canon, as I understand that the Shin kanji in CvS2 refers to "Divine" (a.k.a. God Gouki), rather than "true/real". Besides, he gains the power in CvS2 from absorbing the Orochi "curse" residing in Rugal...which further creates a complicated crossover plotline.</p>

<p>Has anyone seen the ending in Capcom versus SNK 2 where, if you defeat Ult. Rugal with Shin Akuma, it's like the two of them get combined into one super-powerful dude? I can't remember exactly what happens, because I've only done it a couple of times (it's pretty hard to get to see it), but this is for real, I'm certain. I can get a screen grab if you want, although it might take a while. Anyway, I'm wondering if any of you guys know who this Ult. Ruglal combined with Shin Akuma guy is because it's a cool ending. Basically from what I remember he looks a bit like a more powerful version of Shin Akuma but with a bare chest. BTW no, I'm not talking about the ending where Rugal gives his power to Akuma. And as far as I can tell, there's no way of playing as the guy either. Thanks. Doom jester 13:20, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've beaten (the Arcade and Playstation 2 versions of) the game forty or more times, and I've never seen this character you reference. Furthermore, I've tinkered with the entire scope of character-altering hexadecimals, so unless he's very well hidden in the game, I don't believe such a thing exists. I'd love for someone to prove me wrong, though. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_S_f5c0.html" title="User:The S">The S</a> 03:21, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Uhh... I've beaten both Shin Akuma and Ult. Rugal and nothing like this happens. They just get angry and then get swept up into a void and "disappear." Then you get that character as a playable one. They sort of "combine" already when Rugal absobs Akuma's "energy" or Akuma absorbs Rugal's orochi. -- 66.194.121.226 12:16, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>For the record, who you fight at the end of the game gives you different endings. To fight Ult. Rugal, Rugal will absorb Akumas power and then you have to fight him. The ending shows Ult. Rugal start to lose his mind because he cannot control Akumas power. After a short struggle, Akuma manages to take over Ult. Rugals body. The end result is a supposed, "God of Fighting" He's got the face of Akuma, white hair, and wears Rugals clothing. But, it's just an artwork, it's not in a sprite form, so, I highly doubt he'd be playable at all</p>

<p>Hello dear sirs and ladies, I am answering your questions regarding the character shown after defeating ultra rugal in capcom vs snk. Firstly I would like to mention is that no, you cannot play with this character, in other words this chatacter is unplyable. he is more of a 'what if' character had rugal beaten akuma and taken his powers. But rugal didnt beat akuma as you alrady know. Secondly I want to answer your question as to the identity of this new character. This character is not rugal, as if rugal by chance had been able to beat and absorb akumas power he still wouldnt be able to control it hence it would destroy him as it shows in the end. What you get is akuma restored with the addition of rugals power in him. in simple words that character is akuma overcoming ultra rugal and reaching new level of power. So both endings are in favour of akuma, because he cannot get peace. The only way he can achieve peace and rest is by ryu and that fight will take some time to take place as it would be the be be all and end all of all fiction fights done ever. Last but not least Gouken, Sheng long and Goutetsu need their own pages in wikipedia and shouldnt be merged with akuma because they are all chatacters in their own right. But more of that next time. Take care</p>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Does anyone know what Akuma is saying when he wins in the games that he's in? I'm not sure about all the other games, but in Capcom versus SNK 2 and Street Fighter EX, he has a few different things he says when he wins. One of these, in CVSNK2 sounds something like "Shorsh!". It would be really interesting if there was a section of the article covering his lines from the different Street Fighter games, and what they mean in English.</p>

<p>We're talking about a discipline that came from Japan, and knowing that Akuma DID in fact based his mode of combat purely on the Satsui No Hadou. Don't you guys think it's better to say "Satsui No Hadou Ryuu Ansatsuken"? Because if you say "Satsui No Hadou Styled Ansatsuken", then it would have no pure Japanese meaning, but if you guys say "Satsui No Hadou Ryuu Ansatsuken", then it would mean Assasination Techniques from the Intention to Murder. Remember that in this case, "Ken" should mean "Technique" rather than "Fist". So Ansatsuken should mean "Assassination Techniques" or Assassination Routines in this case. Or better yet, Assassination Moveset. So I would have to say "Satsui No Hadou Ryuu Ansatsuken" or "Murderous Intentional school of Assassination Techniques". — <i><b>Vesther</b></i> (<a href="../../../v/e/s/User%7EVesther_244c.html" title="User:Vesther">U</a> * <a href="../../../v/e/s/User_talk%7EVesther_ca6d.html" title="User talk:Vesther">T/R</a> * <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vesther_28bc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vesther">CTD</a>) 03:24, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I seem to remember a scene in Street Fighter V (The Japanese Animation series of Street Fighter 2) in one of the early episodes (I think it was Trap, Prison, Scream of Truth, but I'm not positive), Akuma has a brief cameo standing in the airport. I remember it because I thought it was so out of place. Given that his other cameo from the series is in it, I think this should be added in the trivia section, although I'm not positive enough in the episode placement to confirm this.--Hawk405359 02:29, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the recent 2005 movie "Street Fighter Alpha Generations" Gouki's backstory hints that he had an affair with Goutetsu's daughter, and that she was pregnant, it is later revealed that she died during childbirth and that the child was handed over to the monk by Gouken. Ryu mentions having run away from a temple when he was little, only to somehow be found by Gouken and trained along with Ken. And the Monk in the movie mentions someone he promised to take care of for Gouken, running away, he also mentions keeping the promise that the boy he took care of not follow in his father's footsteps, related to the Satsui no Hadou. Additionally, it is mentioned that the "bad Karma" known as Satsui no Hadou, has manifested itself in Ryu's and Gouki's bloodline, even Gouki hints at his blood relation to Ryu.</p>
<p>The question then, is this, is this movie considered Canon by Capcom?

<li>I don't really see the importance of these articles. They describe aspects of the SF storyline that are barely delved into in the games, and only expounded upon in non-canon stories such as the Udon comics. Gouken and Goutetsu were certainly never playable in any capacity and the articles are largely fancruft. Relevant data should be merged to the Akuma article (since their turns in the story mostly revolve around him) and the articles redirected. <a href="../../../j/u/j/User%7EJuJube_a9d8.html" title="User:JuJube">JuJube</a> 01:19, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>
<ul>
<li>Well, I kinda have to disagree a bit there. Gouken was a <i>Street Fighter</i> character LONG BEFORE Gouki/Akuma was made. He was introduced in the <i>Street Fighter II</i> manga by Masahiko Nakahira long before <i>Super Turbo</i> was made and then canonize into the series' backstory in Akuma's backstory. Jonny2x4 15:04, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Gouken was never a playable character. It's pretty ridiculous that Gouken has an article but not Q. <a href="../../../j/u/j/User%7EJuJube_a9d8.html" title="User:JuJube">JuJube</a> 00:40, 24 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't really mind either way, but I think Gouken at the very least has more depth as a character than Q and everyone in SF1 combined to sustain a stand-alone article. All it needs is to be rewritten into a real word perspective.Jonny2x4 05:33, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Oh yeah, I think a stand-alone article on Q could work out, as long as it focuses on a real world perspective, instead of being a fictional biography. The Japanese article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j:Q_%28%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%82%A4%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC%29" class="extiw" title="w:j:Q_(ストリートファイター)">w:j:Q (ストリートファイター)</a> is a perfect example of an OOU article on Q.

It really wasn't that hard, considering they're short articles and I could see them being merged with <a href="../../../a/k/u/Akuma_%28Street_Fighter%29_0531.html" title="Akuma (Street Fighter)">Akuma</a>. However, Akuma still needs a serious rewrite before that can happen. Jonny2x4 00:49, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I'd say keep as a separate article. While it may not be a main playable character we're talking about, said character is very important to the series canon and should be separated for clarity's sake at least. -- <a href="../../../h/i/d/User%7EHidoshi_954c.html" title="User:Hidoshi">Hidoshi</a> 09:47, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If they were only related to Akuma in the series I'd say merge them, but Gouken has just as much to do with Ryu and Ken as he does with him. He's an important figure to the stories of three main characters. That should warrant his own article. After all, it's silly for links about Ryu's mentor to redirect to the Akuma page. If you're going to go that route, why should Akuma have him over anybody else? I can see maybe merging Goutetsu's page into Gouken's just for the sake of space, but that'd be it. -- Charagon 3-29-07</li>

<p>Change his Japanese name to another Japanese name?</p>

</ul>
<p>I have a much better theory about that. If you had ever played <i>Super SF2 Turbo</i> (which was Akuma's first appearances), you'll notice he's the only character whose name never appears on-screen. I'm guessing Capcom of Japan didn't tell Capcom USA his real name and back story, so they gave the character their own name and told people he was called Akuma because he was possessed by the devil (which was Capcom USA's original explanation for Akuma's powers) and the name kinda got stuck from <i>Street Fighter Alpha</i> and onward. It makes sense when you consider that he and Nash are the only characters besides the Grand Masters to get their names changed (and new names at that).Jonny2x4 20:07, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
