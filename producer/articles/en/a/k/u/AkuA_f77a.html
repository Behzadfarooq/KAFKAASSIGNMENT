<p>It was 1998 and <b>AkuA</b> was still in high school when he first saw local professional wrestling on TV. He found it lacking and figured he could at least do the same if not better. A friend of a family member had a son who was a wrestler by the name of "<b>The Golden Warrior</b>". When they spoke, <b>The Golden Warrior</b> advised him to try <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greco-Roman_wrestling_1720.html" title="Greco-Roman wrestling">Greco-Roman wrestling</a> to learn the basics. So <b>AkuA</b> joined his high-school wrestling team. At the beginning of 1999, he joined up with a local wrestling company called <b>Pro-Wrestling Hawaii</b> which was headed by a man called "<b>The Bonecrusher</b>". He was known as "<b>Jazz</b>". (He took the name a few months before <a href="../../../e/c/w/ECW_1cca.html" title="ECW">ECW</a>'s <b>Jazz</b>/<a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlene_Begnaud_db12.html" title="Carlene Begnaud">Carlene Begnaud</a> debuted) There <b>Jazz</b> met another trainee named "<b>Kaimana</b>". Together, they were ritually beaten by their so-called trainer on a weekly basis. In the meantime, they weren't being taught so they began training themselves. (giving each other pointers during training sessions) <b>Jazz</b> would call him and they would meet and train in their free time. Wrestling each other over and over, <b>Kaimana</b> soon tired of the routine and didn't pursue the business further. However <b>Jazz</b> heard of another company and after contacting them, got them booked at a show. The show was <b>World League Wrestling'</b>s (WLW) Annual Extravaganza at Waipahu High School. <b>Kaimana</b> was pretty stoked that they would be wrestling again. It gave him a chance to debut his new character "7" while <b>Jazz</b> found a name which would become his trademark. <b>AkuA</b>.</p>

<p>The two wrestled that night and were invited to be part of a new promotion hitting the islands. <b>WLW</b> would be working with <b>NWA Hawaii</b> and they would soon form the <b>Island-Xtreme Wrestling Federation</b> (<b>IXWF</b>). <b>Kaimana</b> went back to his old name and together they took the NWA Tag Team Belts as "<b>Hawaiian Gold</b>". (Basically, they looked like the Hawaiian version of the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardy_Boyz_4e19.html" title="Hardy Boyz">Hardy Boyz</a>. <b>AkuA</b> was even known for dying his hair different colours) <b>Hawaiian Gold</b> succesfully defended their titles against "<b>Rated X-tasy</b>" and took the WLW Tag Team Belts. (which were combined that night) Since <b>Kaimana</b> worked full-time and <b>AkuA</b> only worked part-time (while in college full-time) <b>AkuA</b> did almost all of their promos solo. He always referred to the both of them even though there were individuals who tried to taint their friendship saying "<b>AkuA</b> and that <i>other guy</i>". <b>AkuA</b> was also thrust into the role of middle man. Everytime there was a show or event the details were given to <b>AkuA</b> and he then relayed them to his partner. Meanwhile <b>AkuA</b> created all the tandem moves, named them, coordinated their gear, came up with their catch-phrases and handled all the emails. <b>AkuA</b> even got his partner into the gym and they started working out together. Lastly, he came up with <b>The Kama'Aina Special</b>. (Hawaiian Gold's tandem finisher)</p>

<p><b>Hawaiian Gold</b> was finally defeated in a match that left <b>AkuA</b> seriously hurt. (He was able to finish the match despite recieving the injury early) Soon after <b>AkuA</b> recieved an email stating that his father wouldnt be able to tape his match during future events. (<b>AkuA</b> always used the tapes to review his matches) He found this stipulation ridiculous as no one was under contract, getting paid or even getting food in the back, let alone water. He expressed his dismay with an honest email and was "<i>let go</i>" for his troubles. He fired off one last email which detailed the lack of appreciation for all the wrestlers and walked away. Following the next show, he was pleased to get a call from <b>Kaimana</b> saying "They actually started feeding us in the back!" After that incident, <b>AkuA</b> didnt hear much from <b>Kaimana</b> as he continued to wrestle with <b>IXWF/NWA Hawaii</b>. His partner only called him once afterwards, to ask for footage from <b>AkuA'</b>s tape collection, which left <b>AkuA</b> feeling a little betrayed.</p>

Joining with Kenjiro he took on a new persona and used the name of the most illustrious <a href="../../../y/a/k/Yakuza.html" title="Yakuza">Yakuza</a> crime boss in Japanese history. <b>Kodama</b>. It was short-lived. The polynesian persona started to reappear as he attacked <b>Lopaka</b> only to replace him as <b>AkuA</b>, one of the <b>Nightmarchers</b>. Following the turn, the <b>Nightmarchers</b> got to wrestle against Kenjiro and Japanese/<a href="../../../w/c/w/WCW_bd9f.html" title="WCW">WCW</a> Wrestler <a href="../../../y/u/j/Yuji_Nagata_c24f.html" title="Yuji Nagata">Yuji Nagata</a> at a huge event at the <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawaiian_Waters_Adventure_Park_2e89.html" title="Hawaiian Waters Adventure Park">Hawaiian Waters Adventure Park</a>.

<p><b>AkuA</b> later resurfaced in another wrestling promotion sweeping the island called Action Zone Wrestling (<b>AZW</b>).

During this explosive match, <b>AkuA</b> took out <b>Bobby "Lightning" Bolt</b> with the <i>Transplant</i>.

Other wrestlers joined in the brawl eventually drawing a chant of "6-Man Match!" The crowd got their wish as <b>AkuA, DDB and Rocko Shinoda</b> took on <b>Sabaki, Mark Anarchy and Teddy Hart</b> in Tag Team Elimination. Sensing a stronger opponent, <b>Teddy Hart</b> kept <b>AkuA</b> grounded delivering a <i>Shooting Star Elbow</i>, <i>Moonsault Senton</i>, and a <i>15-foot Springboard Moonsault</i> to the concrete, finally getting the pin with a <i>Twisting Senton</i> otherwise known as "<i>Open Hart Surgury</i>".</p>
