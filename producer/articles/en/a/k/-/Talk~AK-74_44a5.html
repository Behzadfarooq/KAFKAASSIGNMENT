<p>The AK-74 is a different firearm all together. Though it is related to the AK-47 the changes made and the reasons for them set it apart. Why else would the Russian military have made such a huge and expensive change in their frontline combat weapon when they already had a tried and true one in place? Trust me, a comment noting their relationship is justified in each article, but they are truely different.</p>

<dd>LOL It's 90% the same gun chambered for a different cartridge. I'd bet you've fired neither one. <a href="../../../r/i/d/User%7ERiddley_ccb7.html" title="User:Riddley">Riddley</a> 02:34, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The M4 Carbine isn't included on the M16 page and shouldn't be. Same here. <b><a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraphic_9322.html" title="User:Graphic"><font color="red">Gяaρнic</font></a></b> 20:00, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ah, but you could make the case that the M-4 should be at least mentioned, since it is a direct derivative of the M-16. I agree with Riddley that the AK-74 and 47 are almost the same. I own both, and if you look closely at the two, you will find that the design, operation, feel, size (almost) etc. are exactly the same between the 47 and the 74, or actually, the AKM and the AK-74. The only differences are the cartridge, the muzzle brake on the 74, a grenade launching lug on the 74, and the ID cuts in the stock (and a couple of teeny-weeny changes, like a grooved buttplate). Everythng else is fundamentally the same. AK person 02:36, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've revised this article and tried to clear up some misunderstandings, fantasies, and conjecture, and bad ballistics understanding surrounding the 5.45 x 39 mm cartridge and bullet. It's arranged as more of a complement to the AK-47 page but differs in the necessary areas.</p>

<p>The only international law concerning rifle bullets used in war is rifle hollow points. They're not allowed. In one case where a US bullet has a tiny HP on top, there were some controversy, in which it was deem acceptable because the bullet, despite the tiny HP, did not perform like a regular rifle HP. However, I do not know of any law that concerns with bullet yaw, and said bullet yaw not only occurs when soft targets are struck, but covers such as wood. A comparison of the AK-47 and M16 by a show on Discovery Channel (I suspect it was in collaboration with BBC, it has mainly British experts and a British narrator) had a high-speed shot of the AK bullet tumbling end to end after passing through a wooden barrier.</p>

<p>There is no international law. You're talking conventions and treaties. At any rate, ALL bullets will yaw. The smaller the bullet and the higher the velocity, the greater the tendancy to yaw. International conventions and treaties specify the use of ammuniton that causes undue sufferring beyond their military asset. The use of soft-point and hollow-point ammunition arguably causes the same damage as a modern, well designed 5.56 bullet.--<a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsams10_5cf0.html" title="User:Asams10">Asams10</a> 17:31, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've pulled the 'children's section' of this article here to the discussion. In keeping in line with the encyclopedic nature of Wikipedia, we don't need a listing of each of the hundreds of times you've watched "Die Another Day" or other such movies and thought the AK's were cool. Also, we don't need a laundry list of video games in the main article. I think there might be a call for a "Firearms in Movies" article with a listing of guns and the movies they've appeared in. A similar article could be made for Video Games if somebody is so inclined. Just keep it out of this article, please. Deleted text here:</p>

<p>Seeing as how people generally get all worked up about the supposed deadly accuracy of Western small-caliber assault rifles (When was the last time any ordinary footsoldier hit anything with his weapon in real combat at 500 yards? By skill instead of luck? Never.), it would be interesting to see how the AK-74 using a broadly comparable design philosophy stacks up in the accuracy department. In any event the article would benefit by its inclusion.</p>
<p>I note that the 500m effective range listed would put the AK-74 on par with the vaunted accuracy of the M-16 and in the middle of the sighting marks of the G36. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKensai_Max_ebc4.html" title="User:Kensai Max">Kensai Max</a> 15:09, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, the AK design is inherintly less accurate than the M16 design. This is not argued by anybody in the know. You seem to acknowledge this by starting your statement with the suggestion that nobody can shoot at 500 yards anyhow. This is bunk. I shoot high-power rifle matches and, at 600 yards, even I can get decent scores with my modified AR-15. However, whatever ranges are listed, soldiers rarely ENGAGE targets beyond 300 yards. At that range, the M16 still has a distinct advantage over the AK. This isn't bravado, it's fact. --<a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsams10_5cf0.html" title="User:Asams10">Asams10</a> 18:01, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>OK, but be honest. You got decent scores w/ the AR-15, but nobody was shooting at you. I have been in combat in Iraq, at short and long range, and believe me, when a bunch of guys are shooting at you, you won't usually take the time to line up a perfect shot. I perfectly agree with the assertion that at practical combat ranges, the AK-74 is just as accurate and effective. Remember too that combat accuracy does not mean shooting a one inch group. Combat accuracy means hitting the center-of-mass, and both the M-16 and the AK-74 fit the bill here. However, from a purely objective POV, the M16/AR-15 is probably more accurate out of the box. --AK person If the effective range listed for both guns in their wiki articles is based on the same standards (I assume US Army ones), the AK-74 has accuracy on par with a standard-issue M-16. Now, the AR-15 design can probably be accurized to a much higher degree, but that's completely irrelevant with the ordinary infantryman's assault rifle and only comes into play when talking about marksman rifles - and I note that the Russians have had the Dragunov (at the ranges involved, a far more effective weapon than any 5.56mm rifle) at a squad level for far longer than we have been deploying marksmen.</p>
<p>Did you even read what I wrote? I quote, "When was the last time any ordinary footsoldier hit anything with his weapon in REAL COMBAT at 500 yards?" Target shooting and theoretical ranges are completely irrelevant here. You yourself admit that accuracy beyond 300m for an assault rifle means little beyond better shot placement at the range of real-world firefights - &lt;300m.</p>
<p>Now, that the AK-47 is less absolutely accurate than the M-16 is not open to debate. It's an entirely earlier generation of weapon firing a larger, slower bullet - still quite straight enough to put all its bullets inside a torso-sized target at 300 yards if you aim straight. The question at hand here is the accuracy of its small-caliber successor, the AK-74, whose effective range is listed as 500m in the article - merely 50m short of the M-16's. Assuming the standards are the same, the M-16 has no real advantage in accuracy over the AK-74, while its usual disadvantages remain in full force.</p>
<p>On a tangent, people continually spout off that a marginally more accurate weapon translates to a real advantage in a firefight. I have yet to see anyone actually back that statement up substantially. I have a hard time seeing how better accuracy will make up even one soldier's gun jamming due to its delicate, easily-fouled design in a serious battle. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKensai_Max_ebc4.html" title="User:Kensai Max">Kensai Max</a> 16:02, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay, I see where this is going. Not going to argue with you. You're wrong on most points, but I doubt you'd admit it, so there's no point in me wasting your time. I concede you are more stuburn.

<p>Wrong on most points how? By your declaration? Give me a break. You say yourself that you refuse to argue, so you effectively concede ALL points to me. I don't mind winning an argument on the first reply, but I can be surprisingly reasonable about differing viewpoints.</p>
<p>Stubborn? I refused to accept your unqualified dismissal of the "AK" system (not all of which are made equal), your hasty misinterpretation of my previous post, your irrelevant tangent on target-shooting and your often-repeated, never-proven mantra about the advantages of a somewhat more accurate weapon in a frantic firefight.

<p>Allow me to review your claims. As your claim is the extremely vague "wrong on most points", I'll assume that you object to my entire argument besides points you have explicitly agreed with.</p>
<p>1. Implication that the AK-74 is not as accurate as a stock M-16 by the use of weasel words. If the effective ranges are the same and they were tested to the same standards of accuracy, they are equally accurate. Full stop.</p>
<p>2. That the Russians have not been using designated marksmen for far longer than we have. I note that the Dragunov was in service in 1963 and we've only started talking about the concept recently.</p>
<p>3. That the AK-47 will not put most of its bullets inside a man's torso at 300m. I'm under the impression that US Army standard for effective range is &gt;50% of rounds inside a 20-in diameter circle. I assume they know what they're doing when they test - or do you have some kind of insider info you'd like to share?</p>
<p>4. This is the big one, that a marginally more accurate weapon actually means something in a real firefight. Can you supply one single source saying that this is true by something other than testimony and opinion? Tests with obvious bias aren't going to fly either. Joe Infantryman may have been in a few firefights, but I doubt he's used an AK-47 in half of them and an M-16 in the other half and can even hope to scientifically compare their effectiveness. And the only people in the military who could make that kind of comparison... aren't going to be spouting off on the internet.</p>
<p>Hell, even the United States Military agrees with me here - or are you going to be claiming that an M-4 carbine can shoot the same kind of groups as a full-sized M-16? I note that with a barrel-length only slightly shorter than a stock AK-47's, an M-4 has an equivalent effective range of 300m. As far as handiness goes, the AK-74, while longer than the AK-47, is still some six centimeters shorter overall than a full M-16 and has a ten-centimeter shorter barrel (same lenght as the '47's) with an insignificant drop in effective range.</p>
<p>My claims are either common knowledge, simple logic, or not accepting unfounded claims at face value. Care to refute them by argument instead of open denial? <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKensai_Max_ebc4.html" title="User:Kensai Max">Kensai Max</a> 18:14, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wow. I give up. I concede you have more time on your hands than I do. The AK-74 is, however, less accurate than the M16. Your arguing with flawed logic, therefore any argument I get into will be tedious. Again, this is silly. You keep trying to get the last word in so I'll just let you. I don't have enough time for this. You're still wrong.--<a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsams10_5cf0.html" title="User:Asams10">Asams10</a> 21:45, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Holy crap, both of you used some bad arguing. As a third party, I can honestly say that Asams sounds like he can't back up his position when he refuses to argue. And Kensai, you use some ad hominems that could really be left out. I would say that from a bench, the M-16 is probably more accurate. However, in combat both probably would have equal effectiveness.

<p>Sure, it's noiser than the 47, but I never thought the 74 was "extremely" loud. Any thoughts? (67.175.99.33 07:03, 23 November 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p>Well, if you stand to one side or the other and get the full effect of the muzzle blast, it can be very loud, even louder than the M-16, in my experience. AK person 03:44, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Good Question. The simple answer is "yes." The first Magazines were made of an orange/red bakelite. They changed sometime in...1982 or 83, if I remember right. They switched to polyamide (plastic) mags for 2 reasons: The bakelite mags had a tendancy to crack from the cold and harsh use in Afghanistan, and they reflected sunlight too much. The first Poly mags were a "plum" color (kind of a brown purple color; both of the "in action" pictures in the article have AK-74s with the plum colered furniture), then at about the time they switched from plum to black furniture (~1990), they also changed the mag color to black.

<p>I think that the pic of the Naval Infantryman with the AK-74 is mislabeled. The "M" designation would mean that the 74 has the plastic folding stock that all AK-74M's have. To have the triangular stock in the picture means that it has to be an AKS-74, not an AK-74M. whatever it is, the AK-74M already has a side folding stock, so there is no "S" in its nomenclature.
