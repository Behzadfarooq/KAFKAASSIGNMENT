<p>But the desgin is obviously inheirent in the AK-101 and its newer gas powered model. So still life in the old girl yet.If it works, stick with it. True that some are still being spat out as replicas by gunsmiths in pakistan and around the middle east (see michael palins "around the world in 80 days" documentry), but even if its being built with, more modern fabrication techniques, it still is the same old AK. Just newer. I suppose an original would be pretty beat by now. --<a href="../../../w/o/u/User%7EWouse101_39fb.html" title="User:Wouse101">Wouse101</a> 23:22, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Interesting. But what do you mean by "impact" on global conflicts? For the most part, infantry weapons do not determine the outcome of wars.<a href="../../../c/y/n/User%7ECynicalMe_3fa2.html" title="User:CynicalMe">CynicalMe</a> 20:33, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Usually not but for example during the Vietnam war the AK-47 gave the vietrnamese side the chance to engage american ground forces at almost equall terms (not counting air and artillery support). And I have heard that in Africa there are AK's used in civil wars on a daily basis that have not seen a <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gunsmith.html" title="Gunsmith">gunsmith</a> for 30 years (if not for the AK-47 wars in such places might have looked totaly different). <a href="../../../m/i/e/User%7EMieciu_K_31a4.html" title="User:Mieciu K">Mieciu K</a> 20:54, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You are right about the AK being used in Africa and its durability. However, I dispute that anything would be different had it not been there.The fact is that in most of the African civil wars, each side is armed with almost identical weapons (soviet bloc). If not the AK, then some other gun (they'd just have to buy them more often).<a href="../../../c/y/n/User%7ECynicalMe_3fa2.html" title="User:CynicalMe">CynicalMe</a> 21:27, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Why the AK was great? I think its main point in favor is ruggedness and reliability, which is covered in the article. The reasons why it is inferior to modern assault rifles basically boil down to being less accurate, which is also mentioned already. Inferiority is a very subjective matter. Granted, most new weapons are much more accurate, but they are also far less reliable. How many of them can be buried in a bog for a year and still function without a cleaning?<a href="../../../c/y/n/User%7ECynicalMe_3fa2.html" title="User:CynicalMe">CynicalMe</a> 22:18, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There's such a thing as overemphasizing an obvious point. Things should be made exactly as clear as they should be—clearer than that belongs at simple.wikipedia.org or in a baby book. Overemphasizing the obvious is talking down to the reader. Cluttering an article with bold word fragments distracts the eye and reduces readability—if anything, italics should be used for emphasis rather than bold, which is reserved for the title term in the lead line. That no one complained isn't much of an argument, and now that I've complained, it is no longer true. <i>—<a href="../../../m/z/a/User%7EMzajac_87ac.html" title="User:Mzajac">Michael</a>&#160;<a href="../../../m/z/a/User_talk%7EMzajac_a30f.html" title="User talk:Mzajac">Z.</a>&#160;<small>2006-07-20&#160;23:14&#160;Z</small></i></p>

<dd>First let me say that I'm not gonna keep arguing on this matter, much less with an administrator. I don't really mind leaving it unbolded, and of course it is not really <i>necessary</i>. But I don't think your arguments are good enough. The point is not whether the bolding is necessary or not. We all know what <i>AK-47</i> stands for, and that is stated in the very first line of the article. However, with all the Greek characters and ocidental equivalent, I don't see why it wouldn't be at least reasonable to have the respective characters bolded. Unlike a small acronym or whatever, there's a lot of text in there explaining the abbreviaton, and bolding the initials is not just a matter of clarification, it also simplifies the reading. It's not as obvious as you make it sound, and it's not as if there's a sentence explaining word-by-word, letter-by-letter where the name is taken from. That would be overemphasizing.</dd>
<dd>The excess of apostrophes ( ' ) may be confusing and/or distracting, but that's not true for the article itself, since it obviously only appears in the editing field. If distracting text is the problem, then we might as well take off all the templates and tables from the article to make the editing field cleaner and easier to use. I guess that's a matter of opinion; personally I never had problems editing this article because of the bolding in the first line—it's as distracting as any other code in the text. As for "talking down to the reader", I'm sorry, but that doesn't make much sense to me. If that's "talking down", then we have a hell of a lot of work to do. But again, if you and/or others really think it is so damn dead obvious, I sure as hell won't keep the discussion going. —<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqualla_56c6.html" title="User:Squalla">Squalla</a> 00:19, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not about the edit field, but about the type visible to the reader of the article. Boldface formatting is almost always visual overkill (pick up any book and try to find where the typographer used a bold font, aside from headings). Italics should practically always be used, except for the title term in the leading line, which is intended to stand out over everything else on the page. I wouldn't normally have much of a problem with italics, but here we'd be using it in an already italicized foreign phrase. Italicized italics are conventionally formatted in a roman font—in this case it loses the impact (sample below).</dd>

<p>Generally lighter than WWII auto-loading rifles? I guess I'll have to look that one up; I thought most 1940s semi-automatics were a little under 10 pounds (Kalashnikov, Garand, Walther G 43, the early Soviets). I think there is a misconception that submachineguns are lighter than assault rifles, which are lighter than battle rifles; if you compare weapons from the same era, you'll usually find little weight difference (Thompsons similar in weight to Garands; MAC-10s similar in weight to CAR-15s, etc.) <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoris_B_a324.html" title="User:Boris B">Boris B</a> 18:21, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay, according to <i>Jane's Guns Recognition Guide</i>, the Tokarev SVT-38 weighs 3.95 kg, the Garand M1 weighs 4.3 kg, the M1 Carbine weighs 2.36 kg, the Simonov SKS weighs 3.86 kg, the Ljungman AG42 weighs 4.71 kg, and I couldn't find the Walther or Mauser sniper rifles ('41 / '43).

<p>What's that about the SVT40. The SVT40 is, just like a Garand or G43, a semi-automatic rifle and nothing more. It shares none of the features that make an assualt rifle: It's not select-fire, it's not chambered for an intermediate cartridge and it does not have the typical in-line stock layout with a seperate pistol grip that all modern assault rifles share. It really doesn't belong there as it's just confusing the reader. If anything that should be the Fedorov design of 1910. <a href="../../../c/l/y/User%7EClydeFrog_7c3c.html" title="User:ClydeFrog">ClydeFrog</a> 4 August 2006</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that the SVT isn't a good example of a "proto-assault rifle". The features it shares with the AK (gas operation, bullet diameter, being designed in the USSR) might be worth mentioning but they are not peculiar to assault rifles. I, too, am curious about the Italian designs and the Fedorov. IIRC, the only military autoloader which used an intermediate cartridge before the MP 43 / Sturmgewehr was the M1 Carbine, (which this article doesn't mention, I suppose because it was rather on the weak side of "intermediate") or perhaps the American commercial rifles (Winchester or Remington? don't remember) which got pressed into air-to-air fights occasionally at the beginning WWI. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoris_B_a324.html" title="User:Boris B">Boris B</a> 00:48, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Regarding the weight issue, Bolotin's book "Soviet small arms" claimed that AK-47 weights 3.8kg empty, and commonly quoted figure 4.3kg is it's <i>loaded</i> weight. Can anyone confirm or deny these figures? Certainly given that most of the other AK variants are in the 3 to 3.8kg range, it would seem strange that AK-47 would weight that much. For example, Finnish rk62 has milled receiver and it only weights 3.6kg empty. --Mikoyan21 16:09, 24 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think the heavier figure may be referring to the milled receiver variant.<a href="../../../c/y/n/User%7ECynicalMe_3fa2.html" title="User:CynicalMe">CynicalMe</a> 17:09, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It depends on the receiver and the stock (more variants). Some lighter variants also use weaker cartrigdes (5.56x45, 5.45x39). <a href="../../../c/p/5C/User%7ECP_M_2ef9.html" title="User:CP\M">CP/M</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/p/5C/User_talk%7ECP_M_d8d6.html" title="User talk:CP\M">comm</a></sup> |<a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutrality_Project_de7f.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutrality Project">Wikipedia Neutrality Project</a>| 17:34, 24 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The point is, there are AK variants with identical milled receiver than AK-47 (Finnish RK62, for example) which are much lighter. Stock does explain part of this difference, but not friggin' 800 grams! --Mikoyan21 11:23, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Okay, it seems the dispute is solved. Finnish literature says that weight of Type 54 (AK-47 type2/3) is 3.6 to 4.0 kg empty, so average would be 3.8 kg - same as in Bolotin's book. Also, a collector who owns a type 3 AK-47 weighted his gun and it was 4.0kg empty, 4.4 with magazine. --Mikoyan21 12:36, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article seems to want to affirm the accuracy of the AK so much that it ends up being somewhat confusing. It argues that although the gun's moving parts are designed with loose tolerances, this does not incur an accuracy penalty. Strictly speaking, this is not possible; all things being equal, accurate guns are accurate because their parts are more precisely machined and constructed. If the AK's construction were made more precise it invariably would be more accurate. It is true however, that the AK was not designed for long-distance combat and so very high accuracy was not a goal of its design. It is AS ACCURATE AS IT NEEDS TO BE. But let's not say that its loose tolerances do not hamper accurracy; that is not true. Geminatea 00:52, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think I agree. "This reliability comes without a cost of accuracy, as the looser tolerances still allow the precision and consistency that are required of accurate firearms." This sounds "too good to be true". Maybe it should say, "This cost on accuracy posed by these loose tolerances has proven very acceptable in a combat weapon" or something like that, if the sentence is even necessary. I'm also a little curious about the next sentence - I didn't know Soviet infantry doctrine was different from anyone else's in this regard. Most countries moved to an assault rifle for short-range fire by most infantrymen, with specialist sniper/marksman weapons (which I suppose would have been Mosin-Nagants when the AK-47 was created, and SVDs later?) It just seems like run-of-the-mill post-war doctrine but I could be wrong. -<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoris_B_a324.html" title="User:Boris B">Boris B</a> 04:33, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I conditionally agree. First of all, you are confusing <b>tolerance</b> with <b>clearance</b> in this discussion. A tolerance is the allowable difference in acceptable parts within the gun. a clearance is the room between moving parts to allow for fouling and debris. That said, the AK-47 is generally made with very loose tolerances by Western standards in all respects be it metalurgy, dimensional, or finish. And yes it does lessen combat effectiveness despite what might be reported. Think of it with respect to shotgun patterns. The AK-47 is an open choke, and the M16 is full choke. This has the effect of encouraging full-auto spray and pray tactics by users of the AK-47. This is a truly effective tactical doctrine for large scale attack and defense. Get every rifleman shooting. The problem is, this weapon is being used by mental retards singly or in small groups. It becomes drastically less effective the smaller the group and the greater the range. Sure, close-in engagements (out to about 30 yards) are roughly equivelant, but give me an M16 (no matter how unreliable) any day of the week beyond that range.
<dl>
<dd>What weed are you smoking, guys? NO military in the world practice so-called "full-auto spray and pray" tactics. Even in Iraq or Somali. Soldiers are being trained to AIM in every military. Of course, most militias don't train even this, but those who survive for longer usually get it. And I did use AK-74. It can definitely hit human-size targets 100-200 m away, even for average shooter with minimal training.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.49.172.93 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.49.172.93_d06d.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.49.172.93">contribs</a>).</small>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, and a well trained shooter can work at about 300 yards. Something above that is generally more of marksman work. "Spraying" is used occasionally by some militant forces, but only to discourage enemy from advancing, not for real attack. Low tolerances in AK are made possible by simple construction. But the weapon is as accurate as intended, and sufficient for distances up to 300, not 30 yards (or did you mean 300?). At 30 yards the weapon of choice is pistol or SMG. AK's inaccuracy becomes noticeable only above 200 yards, where it can miss a few inches. Generally for a trained shooter it's about twice less accurate than AR-15. May be significantly worse without prior AK training, the aiming and general shooting techniques are somewhat different. --<a href="../../../c/p/5C/User%7ECP_M_2ef9.html" title="User:CP\M">CP/M</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/p/5C/User_talk%7ECP_M_d8d6.html" title="User talk:CP\M">comm</a></sup> |<a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutrality_Project_de7f.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutrality Project">Wikipedia Neutrality Project</a>| 04:10, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been following this discussion with interest. What concerns me is the "Effective range" field in the data table. It is incorrect to confuse accuracy with effective range, but what is and what should this figure be based on? Maximum theoretical distance bullet will travel if fired at optimum trajectory? (Several miles). Maximum theoretical distance bullet will travel at supersonic velocity? (possibly &gt;1000yds). Maximum distance average American gun enthusiast can hit human-sized target? (300yds). Maximum distance average sub-saharan African militiaman can hit human sized target? (~30yds). We need a non-subjective yardstick to base these figures on. --<a href="../../../a/d/m/User%7EAdmbws_d572.html" title="User:Admbws">Admbws</a> 15:20, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Umm.. just dropped in to look as this is the Featured Article today. The animated "AK-47 in Operation" gif is pretty neat, but a little choppy: I wonder if the uninitiated would understand what is happening there..</dd>
<dd>But anyway, regarding this discusion about accuracy I find it a bit confusing as currently worded. It says, "This reliability comes at the cost of accuracy, as the looser tolerances do not allow the precision and consistency that are required of more accurate firearms. However it is important to bear in mind that although accuracy was not the feature most desired of this design, it is still present."</dd>
<dd>If you boil that statement down it rather conflictingly indicates that, "This reliability comes at the cost of accuracy...However...accuracy...is still present." I think that you might want to cut this statement out altogether and replace it with something that combines the previous two statements in this discussion regarding the tradeoff between combat accuracy and combat reliability...Darentig 15:26, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The US military defines "effective range" as the shorter of these two: the distance at which the round will retain 60 ft/lb of impact energy OR the longest range that a round fired by an excellent rifleman has a &gt; 50% chance of landing in a 20 inch circle (size the military uses for an "average" torso target). For an M16 (mechanical/inherent accuracy of 1-2 minutes of angle) this is 500m--although match shooters can make decent hits at 1km with a specialized, sub-moa rifle. For an AK, with an inherent accuracy of 2-6moa depending on manufacture, 250-300m is the accepted figure. Of course, a trooper in most military organizations using the AK, to say nothing of a terrorist, is nowhere near as good a marksman as a US Marine or soldier, so in reality the effective range in their hands is probably much shorter.</p>

<p>is there any evidence that proves he worked on the design of the the AK? There is no citiation in the Hugo Schmeisser paragraphs.</p>
<dl>
<dd>By August 1945 the Red Army had created 50 Stg 44s from existing assembly parts, and had begun inspecting their design. 10785 sheets of technical designs were confiscated by the Soviets as part of their research. In October 1945 Hugo Schmeisser was forced to work for the Red Army and instructed to continue development of new weapons. Schmeisser's brilliance continued to impress the Red Army, and he, along with other weapons designers and their families, was relocated to the USSR. On October 24, 1946 The German specialists rode a train to <a href="../../../i/z/h/Izhevsk.html" title="Izhevsk">Izhevsk</a> in the southern <a href="../../../u/r/a/Ural_Mountains_314f.html" title="Ural Mountains">Ural Mountains</a>, where a center of Russian firearms development was located.

Little is known of his life during this period, until 1952 when he and other German specialists returned home to <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>what source is this information from? and if the work he did between 1946-1952 is "shrouded in darkness", how can he be thought to be a co-designer. It would just be speculation to think he was involved in AK-47 development.</p>

<p>Umm...it mentions in the article that to make more effective close range weaponry: "this was done by shortening the 8 mm Mauser cartridge to 33 mm and using a lighter bullet." ..last I checked, although I'm no gun expert, 8 mm was shorter than 33 mm. If this is indeed accurate, it's worded somewhat poorly. (new to wikipedia, just trying to help)67.142.130.27 03:12, 22 September 2006 (UTC)JSto</p>

<dd>Yeah, that got me too. Maybe they meant <i>from</i> 33 mm? --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 03:41, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The confusion lies in the fact that the figures given are measurements of two different things: 8mm is the diameter of the bullet (width), 33mm is the length of the entire cartridge. This means the original 8mm bullet cartridge was longer then 33mm before it was shortened, but not giving the original length makes it confusing if you are not familiar with firearms.<a href="../../../v/e/s/User%7EVespine_669a.html" title="User:Vespine">Vespine</a> 04:16, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, 33mm is the length of the 7.92mm Kurz' cartridge case. The full-size 7.92mm Mauser (8mm Mauser) has a cartridge case 57mm long. This is why we should use the full metric designations, in this case: 7.92x33mm Kurz vs. 7.92x57mm Mauser. <a href="../../../d/2E/e/User%7ED.E._Watters_a205.html" title="User:D.E. Watters">D.E.

<p>Several editors have been removing my addition of disambiguation link at the top of the AK-47 article. I appreciate your (unspecified) reason for doing so--namely, that you don't want a serious firearms article to be cluttered with silly references to material that has nothing to do with the topic at hand.</p>
<p>Let me explain why you are mistaken and why I do not require the consensus of the editors of this article to include my link:</p>
<p>There is an established precedence on Wikipedia to disambiguate nicknames of sports players and other notable people. I am listing some examples.</p>
<p>Let's start with basketball players:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enter <a href="../../../k/g/_/KG_56d7.html" title="KG">KG</a> into the Search field. You are directed to a disambiguation page with a list of entries, among which is <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Garnett_67c1.html" title="Kevin Garnett">Kevin Garnett</a>.</li>
<li>Enter <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mailman.html" title="Mailman">Mailman</a>. Once again you find yourself on a dab page that lists Karl Malone</li>
</ul>
<p>Try some other famous athletes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rocket.html" title="Rocket">Rocket</a> article. The first line is a disambiguation link, linking to a page that lists <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Clemens_2c5d.html" title="Roger Clemens">Roger Clemens</a>, among others nicknamed Rocket.</li>
<li>The first line of the <a href="../../../j/u/i/Juice.html" title="Juice">Juice</a> article contians a disambiguation link, wherein we can find a link to <a href="../../../o/2E/j/O.J._Simpson_76f9.html" title="O.J. Simpson">O.J. Simpson</a></li>
<li>The first line of the <a href="../../../d/i/e/Diesel.html" title="Diesel">Diesel</a> article disambiguates to several people nicknamed "Diesel"</li>
</ul>
<p>The inclusion of these disambiguations is not controversial. And neither should be my re-insertion of the disambiguation statement in the <a href="../../../a/k/-/AK-47_b9b4.html" title="AK-47">AK-47</a> article. You many not realize or believe this, but for many basketball fans, "AK-47" refers primarily to the forward Andrei Kirilenko. The name of the gun is secondary. This makes a disambiguation appropriate.</p>
<p>You may wish to reply that I require "consensus" in order to sully <a href="../../../o/w/n/Wikipedia%7EOwnership_of_articles_36eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Ownership of articles">your</a> featured article with a basketball player link. That may be true, but it's not the consensus of the 2 or 3 editors who frequent this article that I need--a broader consensus among Wikipedians has already been reached concerning the appropriate way to provide <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">disambiguation</a> for articles whose titles might possibly refer to one or more thing:</p>
<dl>
<dd>When a user searches for a particular term, he or she may have something else in mind than what actually appears. In this case, a friendly link to the alternative article is placed at the top.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This guideline could not be clearer, nor more reasonable.

<dd>It's not just me, but a host of users who are trying to prevent you from linking to a minor article from a monster article like this. My name can be <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nixon_9d26.html" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>, but that would not mean I deserve a disambig statement at the beginning of the Nixon article. If you agree that AK-47 should be disambig'd to the BB player, why shouldn't I use the same logic to say I want my own Disambig link at the beginning of the article? If you say that's absurd, then disambig is not a right and we argue merely about what level of relevance there is to the disambig. I feel that you must show a statisticaly significant percentage (2.5%) of people who type AK-47 are really searching for the basketball player and not for the gun. Show us that. None of us would argue that you may create your own disambig page and link the main article there, however it is my sincere belief that you are a fan of this player, his team, and/or basketball in general and feel that this trivial reference is fleeting and not encyclopedic. --<a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsams10_5cf0.html" title="User:Asams10">Asams10</a> 04:36, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Linking to a dedicated disambig page, when there's a lot of meanings, is one thing; however, when there is only one link, it might be necessary to decide whether it is appropriate. In this case the article about Andrei Kirilenko mentions his nickname only in section "Trivia", so I guess he's better known by his name; so disambig link will probably serve only very little purpose.</dd>
<dd>If there were several things to disambig, page would be appropriate, but here it's just not useful, IMHO. <a href="../../../c/p/5C/User%7ECP_M_2ef9.html" title="User:CP\M">CP/M</a> <sup><a href="../../../c/p/5C/User_talk%7ECP_M_d8d6.html" title="User talk:CP\M">comm</a></sup> |<a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutrality_Project_de7f.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutrality Project">Wikipedia Neutrality Project</a>| 05:15, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If I cared enough, I could demonstrate, using a variety of reliable sources, that Kirlenko is widely considered one of the best and most notable forwards currently playing basketball and that "AK-47" is his primary nickname, every bit as legitimate (and frequently used by journalists and fans, since his full name is such a mouthful) as the examples I listed above ("Rocket" for Clemens and "The Juice" for O.J., etc.). But this would require effort that would better be devoted to improving other articles (perhaps starting with <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrei_Kirilenko_%28basketball%29_9cb3.html" title="Andrei Kirilenko (basketball)">AK-47's apparently underwhelming article</a>, which I have not read in quite some time).

<p>I removed two links plugging a book by Larry Kahaner: "AK-47: The Weapon That Changed the Face of War." This is a work of opinion and the Washington Post article was an opinion piece and, as such, is not encyclopedic. It is more appropriate to reference books for an entry rather than place advertisements for them in links. In this case, the book itself is an opinion piece and references should be closely scrutinized.--<a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsams10_5cf0.html" title="User:Asams10">Asams10</a> 17:15, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>To say that Kahaner's book is a "work of opinion" is pointlessly reductive. The book is actually a well-researched history of the gun's impact on war and society. It's impossible for any journalist or historian not to be informed and thereby slanted by his or her own outlook or "opinion" (check out any other featured article, say, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Thatcher_2770.html" title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>, and tell me whether every one of the External Links is devoid of some kind of slant or POV).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I assume you have some quibble with what you perceive as the author's agenda, but that doesn't make the book any less notable or relevant to those wishing to learn more about the gun's legacy. To me, a book heavy on social/historical analysis is every bit as important as a link to a dry technical manual. I agree this should be added to the references, but I don't think it's entirely inappropriate to include information about a book like this in the External Links. If it's the commercial aspect of the website to which you object, we could probably add a link directly to the article's first chapter, which is available on several websites.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Fat_Man_Who_Never_Came_Back_7df6.html" title="User:The Fat Man Who Never Came Back">The Fat Man Who Never Came Back</a> 19:04, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>They are not quibbles and Larry makes it clear, from what I've read, that the work is one of reinforced opinion. The fact that he plugs the book by writing an opinion piece (yes, in the opinion section, not 'books' or 'world events'). He sums the article by mocking Kalashnikov's view that his weapon was merely a tool and not intrinsicly evil. That's the basic pretense of the rifle as a symbol of such rather than a tool wielded by the Soviet Union and others to spread Communism. He chose the Washington Post to print it and even THEY had to put it in the opinion section. Did I mention opinions yet? I have one, you have one, and obviously Larry has one. My point is that this work can be referenced as such, not placed as an advertisement under the links section. The first link directed you to the plug page for the book, clearly an advertisement. The second directed you to the opinion piece with the sole purpose of teasing and selling the book. Encyclopedic links are fine, but this goes over the board.--<a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsams10_5cf0.html" title="User:Asams10">Asams10</a> 21:28, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have seen a variant that i don't think you've mentioned</p>
<p>the PP-19 sports an odd magazine, it runs from the barrel along the foregrip to the chamber and spirals down the tubual magazine. Makes it very short and stock and has a larger magazine capacity. It has been chambered to accept 9mm rounds, I think its a variant of the AK-74, as its pretty short.</p>
<p>also I think there is the S12K, which I've heard has been completely rechambered to take 12G shotgun shells. Weather it can fire full auto, i don't know.</p>
<p>anyway, do these variants exsist?</p>

<p>There are very few internal design differences between the SKS and the AK-47 in the regards to the internal workings between these two rifles, save for the trigger that allows for fully automatic fire on the AK-47. On the SKS, there are two moving parts inside of the gas cylinder that works the bolt back after a round is fired. On the AK, this part has been replaced by one, if I recall correctly that is. Simonov's design must have had a large influence on Kalashnikov, but that is not mentioned here. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrenden_1679.html" title="User:Brenden">Brenden</a> 18:12, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're wrong. There are significant differences in all mechanisms, construction, etc. About the only thing they have in common is that both have a piston located on top of the barrel. There is no mention of the SKS because it's another gun. See that article if you want to know about that gun.--<a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsams10_5cf0.html" title="User:Asams10">Asams10</a> 01:20, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You can't tell me that Kalashnikov did not make a few design improvements to the SKS when developing the AK-47. Look at both the SKS and the AK when they have been field stripped. Beyond a few obvious differences (take down of the receiver, the trigger containing two sears, and the type of bolt operation to eject a spent cartridge out of the side as opposed to the top) they look strikingly similar. The AK features less parts than the SKS (an obvious improvement) and a few changes to address jamming issues. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrenden_1679.html" title="User:Brenden">Brenden</a> 05:25, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not sure what to say here. They're as different as a wankel engine and a standard piston engine. And, yes, I can tell you that they are different in virtually every way.

<p>Actually, SKS must be mentioned here as "predecessor" of AK just for its cartridge, which was used for AK weapon system (so called, "intermediate cartridge" - <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_language.html" title="Russian language">Russian</a>: <span lang="ru" xml:lang="ru">промежуточный патрон</span>)! This is why the AK was named "avtomat" (relatively new class of weapon in USSR), and not "assault rifle", and not "machinegun-psitol". --<a href="../../../j/n/o/User%7EJno_9776.html" title="User:Jno">jno</a> 06:47, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The SKS is definitely a predecessor of the AKM. Anybody that argues differently is just plain wrong. The SKS was the standard Soviet infantry rifle for a couple of years following World War 2. It was replaced by the AK-47. It preceded the AK-47, therefore it was the predecessor. Now that we have that out of the way, the argument that the AK-47 has similar design and operation to that of the M1 Garand is just plain dumb. I personally own an SKS (Original Russian Tula manufacture, an AKM (Maadi Egyptian manufactured model imported as the ARM by Intra Arms) and an M1 Garand (Springfield with an 749,xxx Serial number). The mechanisms of the M1 Garand and that of the AKM are very different. The bolt carrier operates in a completely different manner on the two rifles. The return spring on the garand is located inside the operating rod below the barrel, it operates the action by pushing the operating rod foward, which pulls the bolt closed (not like the SKS). On the AK it is located inside of the back of the bolt carrier assembly and operates the bolt by pushing it closed (exactly like the SKS.) The operating rod connects to the Garands bolt carrier by fitting into a cam in the side of it. This allows for a magazine below the action, since the gas system and operating rod are located below the barrel. Very different than the AK design. The gas system on the AK is on the top of the barrel, and the gas piston is attached directly to the bolt carrier assembly. This differs from the SKS in one way only. The Gas piston on the SKS is detached from the bolt carrier, and cycles the action by pushing against a gas tube extension rod that presses against the face of the bolt carrier assembly. Other than that they are the same system. I could go on and on about the similarities between the SKS and the AKM, and then go on to show the similarities of the SKS and the SVT, but this is the internet and some idiot that has never fired a rifle in his life will know better and correct me. So why waste the time? UtahWatchdog 08:13, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry this reply is late, but I just noticed somebody else had commented. Look at the bolt and bolt carrier of your AK-47 head on. Now, look at the same on the Garand, head on. Imagine that little round part on the side of your Garand bolt being moved 90 degrees clockwise. Now, imagine the extractor and ejector being moved about 20 degrees to eject from the side instead of at an angle. Now, look at the raceway on your Garand operating rod and your AK bolt carriers. Now, look at the side of the AK trigger group assembled (yeah, you'll need a little imagination for this) and then look at the side of your Garand trigger group. Other than moving the op rod to the top of the barrel, all of the geometry is IDENTICAL. Again, and as it says in the text, Kalashnikov's team SIMPLIFIED the Garand operating system and put it in a SIMPLIFIED StG44 receiver, fed it from a SIMPLIFIED StG44 magazine using a cartridge with virtually the same design concept as the StG44 cartridge. If you disagree, you're wrong. These are facts that can be ascertained by just looking at the weapons and are supported by volumes of circumstantial and real evidence even the words of Kalashnikov himself. That's it, end of story. To deny it flys in the face of logic.--<a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsams10_5cf0.html" title="User:Asams10">Asams10</a> 06:28, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is the B.S. of it [the AK-47] owing more to the M1 Garand than the SKS going to be replaced or not? <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrenden_1679.html" title="User:Brenden">Brenden</a> 05:25, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Even Kalashnikov himself has admitted that he borrowed features from the M1 Garand. See "Kalashnikov: The Arms and the Man" by Ed Ezell. The SKS uses a completely different locking mechanism than the AK. The only thing the SKS and AK have in common is the location of the gas cylinder above the barrel (also featured in previous Russian designs) and the 7.62x39mm cartridge. <a href="../../../d/2E/e/User%7ED.E._Watters_a205.html" title="User:D.E.

<p>He may have borrowed some features from the Garand, but the Garand wasn't the sole influence in the design of the AK-47. I own an AKM, Garand, and SKS (among many other rifles). Field strip the three rifles and place their parts next to each other. You will see which rifle the AKM more closely represents. Maybe Simonov ripped off the design of the Garand too?

<p>I realise this would be a big shift, but the association most people have when they think of the AK-47 is actually the AKM, as that was the source of the soviet bloc knockoffs. Just because it's the commonly assumed name, there's no reason to promote ignorance. Therefore, I propose shifting the "social impact" information to a new article under AKM, covering the name confusion in addition.
