<p>The <b>Akkari-Laban dossier</b> (<a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_language.html" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a>: ملف عكّاري لبن) is a 43 page document which was created by a group of <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denmark.html" title="Denmark">Danish</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleric.html" title="Cleric">clerics</a> from multiple organizations set out to present their case and ask for support in the <a href="../../../j/y/l/Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoons_controversy_7433.html" title="Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy">Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy</a>.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Among the leadership of the <a href="../../../u/m/b/Umbrella_group.html" title="Umbrella group">umbrella group</a> of Muslim organizations were <a href="../../../i/m/a/Imam.html" title="Imam">Imam</a> <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmad_Abu_Laban_0dbc.html" title="Ahmad Abu Laban">Ahmad Abu Laban</a> of the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamisk_Trossamfund_c269.html" title="Islamisk Trossamfund">Islamisk Trossamfund</a> and <a href="../../../a/k/h/Akhmed_Akkari_85d9.html" title="Akhmed Akkari">Akhmad Akkari</a>, spokesman of the Danish-based European Committee for Prophet Honouring. Danish Sheik Raeed Huleyhel was named head of the group and signed the petition letters.</p>
<p>The first delegation of five, headed by Abu Bashar of The Community of Islam, landed in <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_3.html" title="December 3">3 December</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> and returned <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_11.html" title="December 11">11 December</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>.

This meeting was arranged by Egypt's ambassador to Denmark, Mona Omar. (She was later criticized by the Danish foreign ministry for adding to the unrest by alleging that Islam was not an officially recognized religion in Denmark,<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> and on 17 February 2006 transferred from her post at Copenhagen.)</p>
<p>The second delegation, comprising four Danish Muslims headed by Sheik Raeed Huleyhel, traveled to <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebanon.html" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a> <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_17.html" title="December 17">17 December</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> and returned to Denmark <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_31.html" title="December 31">31 December</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>.

<p>At a <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_6.html" title="December 6">6 December</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> summit of the <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organisation_of_the_Islamic_Conference_a307.html" title="Organisation of the Islamic Conference">OIC</a>, with many heads of state in attention, the dossier was handed around by the Egyptian foreign minister Ahmed Abul-Gheit on the sidelines first <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/article344482.ece" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/article344482.ece" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, but eventually an official communiqué was issued.<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20060129/wl_mideast_afp/denmarkislamsyriabahrainunreligion_060129160121" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20060129/wl_mideast_afp/denmarkislamsyriabahrainunreligion_060129160121" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>The dossier consists of several letters from Muslim organizations explaining their case, multiple clippings from Jylland Posten, multiple clippings from Weekend Avisen<a href="http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Indland/2006/01/04/161736.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Indland/2006/01/04/161736.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, and some <a href="../../../j/y/l/Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoons_controversy_7433.html#Additional_images" title="Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy">additional images</a> that, according to the dossier's authors, had been sent to Muslims in Denmark.</p>
<p>The dossier appears to have been assembled and added to until some point after <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_8.html" title="December 8">8 December</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, with the first lobbying visits to Egypt having taken place before finalization. Several pages contain hand written notes, mostly translations from captions of cartoons. It is unknown if these were already present in the dossier or are later additions.</p>

<p>In the name of God the merciful</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Thanks to God, the ruler of the worlds, and may peace be with the last prophet, etc....</p>
<p>We, Muslims living in the kingdom of Denmark, we present our conditions in this country, which is situated in the northern part of Europe, and is one of the Scandinavian countries, to whom it may concern and to each and every Muslim.</p>
<p>This country has it own language. The rule is constitutional Monarchy. The country consists of a number of islands, the capital is Copenhagen, the number of citizens is 5 million and most of them are Protestants (Christian). Even though they belong to the Christian faith, secularization has overcome them, and if you say that they are all infidels, then you are not wrong.</p>
<p>Muslim immigrants (Turks) and refugees from countries crushed by wars (Bosnia, Somalia, Iraq, Lebanon) have migrated to this country, and thus is Denmark’s interaction with foreigners, and especially those who have other religions, something rather new, which has happened in the past 20-30 years, well knowing, the number of Muslims is possibly 170,000.</p>
<p>The faithful in their religion (Muslims) suffer under a number of circumstances, first and foremost the lack of official recognition of the Islamic faith. This has lead to a lot of problems, especially the lack of the right to build mosques, so they (Muslims) have had to convert old businesses and storage areas to places of worship.</p>
<p>Among these conditions you find an atmosphere, which nourishes a growing racism, the expression of which grew worse after the 9/11 incidents. And it (the racism) has many different expressions, but common to them all is that they speak badly about Islam. (Sometimes there is talk of the veil, circumcising, or about the sicknesses caused by the prayer etc.)</p>
<p>The crown of these acts are the pictures and so-called drawings which show the prophet (PBUH) in a disgusting and outrageous way. The circumstances of this case is, that after many artists, out of fear of Muslim reactions, declined to draw the prophet for the cover of a book about Islam, this made the responsible persons in Jyllands-Posten resist the artists' reluctance to this task, and in the wish to challenge the feelings of Muslims, they used freedom of speech as basis in the so-called democracy, and took over this task, and took it on their shoulders. The paper wrote to 40 cartoonists and challenged them to compete about the best drawing. Most of them did not respond, and only 12 did. Next they (the paper) published these drawings (the edition from <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_30.html" title="September 30">30 September</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>). The pictures were accompanied by the editor's commentary, which in short was that Muslims should accept this kind of satire, since this is one of the cornerstones in democracy, which ensures freedom of speech. They (Muslims) are consequently required not to be offended by this, like all others (also) subject to ridicule.</p>
<p>Because of the seriousness of the situation, most Muslim unions and centers called for a meeting on Sunday <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_2.html" title="October 2">2 October</a>, and agreed upon a number of measures to counter this hard attack, which had the intention of degrading the most glorious of persons in life (the Prophet, PBUH).</p>
<ul>
<li>The gathered agreed on forming a committee for support of the prophet Mohammad (PBUH) and appoint Sheikh Râ'id Hulaihil to chairman of the committee.</li>
<li>The criticism of what had been said in the paper, was represented by a statement of one of the wise (theologians), which was translated to Danish, but they only communicated a few scattered fragments of it.</li>
</ul>
<p>(continued from previous page) (This translation is based on a secondary translation through Danish. <b>A better translation is needed</b>)</p>
<ul>
<li>A call to Muslims to participate in addressing the newspaper, each in his own way, and by the means of communication at hand, to tell them that this cause represents a red line for all Muslims, and not only the wise.</li>
<li>A direct demand for an apology from the newspaper, and a promise that this never happens again, and in the future (the newspaper) will respect what is holy to the Muslims.</li>
<li>A collection of signatures among Muslims against the newspaper's actions on one side. And furthermore for support of the initiatives of the Muslim unions to counterattack this and similar attacks.</li>
<li>A dispatch of letters to political persons and the active political parties, to inform them of the seriousness of the situation, and win their support.</li>
<li>To contact the embassies of the Islamic world (in Denmark) in order to inform them about the true situation, so that they should take their responsibilities.</li>
<li>Contact local and global media, especially since they've ignored the issue so far.</li>
</ul>
<p>When we did not get any response from the responsible persons at the paper, and after the (Danish) Prime Minister deliberately ignored the wish of the Islamic ambassadors for a meeting with him, we called for a second meeting on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_9.html" title="October 9">9 October</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, from which a statement was issued to local and global media.</p>
<ul>
<li>After the al-Djazira channel had broadcasted this news, the newspaper stepped up the tone by assigning a special corner of its webpage, with the headline "The images of the prophet". The newspaper wrote, very unusually, an article in Arabic with the headline "The word is free", and presented what al-Djazira had broadcasted, but insisted on its (own) standpoint, and increased the number of pages covering this subject, and so those supporting the newspaper could take part, given that they presented the case freedom versus repression.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Among the noteworthy developments is the support of the European Union to the position of the Danish Prime Minister about not meeting the Muslim ambassadors, since he will not interfere in what their laws guarantee as freedom of expression, such as required them (i.e. the ambassadors).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Upon this, the Islamic organizations issued a second statement, which demanded the intervention of the Muslim world, now that the issue had become international, and because issues relating to the Prophet (PBUH) not only relate to Danish Muslims, but to Muslims around the world, because it can not be allowed if we accept an insult of our prophet, no matter the slogan or excuse.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The case was dealt with by the leadesrs of the Muslim world, and these clearly referred to the topic in the concluding statement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Several conditions increased our pain and torment:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. The ridicule of Islam and its followers has become an easily distributed commodity, when an almost extinct newspaper published images stronger and more offending on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_10.html" title="November 10">10 November</a>, probably to regain its popularity; this paper is "Weekendavisen".</li>
<li>2. Muslims received during this period of time - most notably those taking part in the actual protest against the images - letters whose tone differed between direct threats and mockery of Islam itself through attacks on the Qu'ran, when these people claimed that it was a fabrication, and they took part in the attack on the Prophet (PBUH) by sending animated images, that were stronger and fiercer, and which come from a deep hatred of Islam as a religion.</li>
<li>3. Denmark received the Dutch author of Somali origin, who is the author of the film that degrades Islam, and whose producer was killed recently in Holland. The reception for her was consequently a continuation of the confrontation, particularly since she gave an interview to Danish television in which she talked about Islam in a degrading way. And the strange thing is, that the Prime Minister, who had rejected meeting with the ambassadors, received her and presented her with an award, like he stated that he appreciated her brave position and her free opinions!! So see for yourselves...</li>
</ul>
<p>(continued from previous page) This is why the organizations again called an urgent meeting, in which it was decided to create delegations, who could visit the Islamic world with the intent of informing them about the danger of the situation and make them take part in the defense and support of our prophet (PBUH).</p>
<p>Our delegation visited the Republic of Egypt, and held a number of excellent and very positive meetings:</p>
<ul>
<li>A meeting with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, whose minister stated to the press, that this insult of Islam from the Danish press was a scandal, and promised to take up the matter at the Islamic Conference and with the Arab League.</li>
<li>A meeting with the general secretary for the Arabic League, which was characterized in a most positive way.</li>
<li>A meeting with the sheik of al-Azhar, who reacted to the issue, and demanded an urgent meeting at the al-Azhar research center, to stop this attack.</li>
<li>A meeting with Egypt's Grand Mufti, resulting in the issuing of a fatwa about boycotting Denmark, if the country did not retract this outrageous action.</li>
<li>A representative of the delegation attended the meeting at the research center on Thursday <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_8.html" title="December 8">8 December</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, which resulted in a declaration clearly condemning this act, which was described as an attack breaking all limits for acceptable communication and good tone in the dialogue. This declaration made it clear, that they would turn to the relevant committees of the United Nations and to human rights organizations, in the defense of the rights of the individual, and the protection of cultural diversity, by so doing, they reject the culture of hatred and the demise of other people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, we call for everyone eager and vigilant [the word can also mean careful, translator's note] to join the defense and support of the prophet. Seeking by all means available to establish legislation, which guarantees respect for everything holy and particularly for Muslim holy places at a time when it has become easy to hit these holy places in the guise of the fight against terror.</p>

<dl>
<dd><i>*Jyllands-Posten editorial from the day the cartoons were published, <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_30.html" title="September 30">30 September</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>.</i></dd>

<p>The Muslims that represent the broad image of Islam in public - hopefully there is a large, silent and more reasonable majority - but the Muslims that do represent Islam in public have one common characteristic: A monumental pompousness. Such pompousness leads to an almost morbid hypersensitivity towards any kind of opposition, which is presented as a provocation.</p>
<p>A provocation against one of these pompous imams or mad mullahs is immediately presented as a provocation towards the Holy Book, the Qu'ran, and then the trouble [really] begins.</p>
<p>This is when the Islamic spiritual leaders start crying out and, as a consequence, a host of spiritually less gifted persons immediately feel they have an obligation to follow what is presented as the teachings of the prophet, and ultimately murder the offenders.</p>
<p>As described in this day's edition of the Culture Section, the latest example of the intimidation from representatives of a dark and violence-marked Middle Age is a leading art gallery removing a work of art, fearing that it might offend Muslims. Translators of books critical to Islam choose to remain anonymous, fearing that they might offend Muslims. Danish illustrators reject illustrating a book about Islam, fearing that they might offend Muslims. A comedian states in public that he dare not make fun of the Qu'ran on television; he is afraid of offending Muslims. And so on ...</p>
<p>It would be nice to cast this fear aside as foolishness and paranoia, but a Dutch moviemaker has been murdered because he offended Muslims. A Copenhagen professor has been beaten up by no-good students, because he read aloud [to them] from the Qu'ran, and his students considered this to be a grave provocation. [The professor is non-Muslim. Translator's note.] That was why these lunatics believed that they had the right to beat him up and intimidate him.</p>
<p>Around the world, satire is made in movies, on the stage, and in books, but no-one dares make fun of Islam. That's because a bunch of imams and mullahs, who feel that they [hold the key to] interpreting the words of the Prophet, do not tolerate the insult it is to be mocked by intelligent satire.</p>
<p>Participants [a number of these imams] in the Prime Minister's recent meeting at [his residence] Marienborg, recently made a public demand that the PM should impose censorship of the press and outlaw everything which could be considered to offend Islam.</p>
<p>The Western societies, still dominated by a politically correct fear of confrontation with these voices from a Dark Age, is at increasing pains to find new excuses and explanations [for the situation].</p>
<p>The most disturbing part of this situation is that we are even being forced to discuss a world view that we in the West left during the Age of Enlightenment.</p>
<p>This country's Muslim spiritual guides use a lot of words trying to talk about something else when they are confronted with e.g. violent Islamic rhetoric.</p>
<p>When this happens, it [the rhetoric] suddenly has no meaning at all in a modern society. [Now] we [suddenly] have to see this in a historical context, which naturally has no relevancy at all in today's Denmark; and they point out that Islam is a religion of love and understanding.</p>
<p>If one asks a more direct question regarding those passages in the Qu'ran, which now [apparently] have more or less obscure meanings, they [the imams] become faint and unclear in their speech. And they keep repeating that the Qu'ran is the Prophet's Word and must be read literally in all respects.</p>
<p>The fact that the Prophet has only expressed himself verbally, and that the written sources were written by second, third, or even fourth hand sources generations later, is of no importance to a clergy, profiling itself by its monopoly of the interpretation [of the Qu'ran].</p>
<p>It would be a blessing if the great majority of Muslims, whose highest wish must be to live in peace and harmony with their neighbors, would eventually start opposing this stubborn clinging on to a dark past.</p>

<p>Comedian Frank Hvam recently declared that he "dare not make fun of the Qu'ran on television". A cartoonist, whose job is to depict the prophet Muhammad in a children's book, wishes to remain anonymous. So do West European translators of a collection of essays critical of Islam.</p>
<p>A leading museum of art removes a work of art fearing how Muslims may react. In this season, [Danish] theaters show three different plays with biting satire towards the US president, George W. Bush, but not a single one about Osama bin Laden and his allies, and during a meeting with Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen, an imam urged the government to take action against Danish media and force them to present a more positive image of Islam. The examples mentioned above are calls for concern, whether the perceived fear rests on a false basis or not. The fact is that it exists, and it leads to self-censorship. An intimidation of the public space takes place. Artists, writers, cartoonists, translators, and theatre people consequently avoid dealing with the most important meeting of cultures in our time, between Islam and the secular, Western societies rooted in Christianity.</p>
<p><b>The Ridicule</b></p>
<p>The modern secular society is rejected by some Muslims. They demand a special position, when they insist that special care is taken to protect their own religious feelings. This is incompatible with a secular democracy and freedom of expression, in which everybody must be ready to face scorn, ridicule, and humiliation. It is certainly not always sympathetic or nice to look at, and it does not mean that religious feelings should be ridiculed, no matter the cost. But this is a minor point in this case.</p>
<p>It is consequently not a coincidence that people in totalitarian societies are thrown in jail for telling jokes or depicting dictators in a critical way. This usually happens with the excuse that the work offends the feelings of the people. Denmark has still not gone this far, but the examples mentioned above show that we're heading towards a slippery slope, where no one can predict what the result will be of this self-censorship.</p>
<p><b>Twelve cartoonists</b></p>
<p>For this reason, Jyllands-Posten has urged members of the Association of Danish Cartoonists to draw Muhammad as they see him. Twelve out of around 40 replied and we're bringing their cartoons here on this page, under their own names. They are: Arne Sørensen, Poul Erik Poulsen (PEP), Rasmus Sand Høyer, Erik Abild Sørensen, Franz Füchsel, Peder Bundgaard, Bob Katzenelson, Annette Carlsen, Lars Refn, Jens Julius Hansen, Claus Seidel, and Kurt Westergaard.</p>
<p>Only 25 out of the 40 are actively working in their profession, and some of the others are subject to a clause in their contracts forbidding them to work for competitors. A few have argued for why they rejected this task, others have said that a large workload is the cause for not joining, while others have not replied at all.</p>

<p>(This translation is based on a second-hand translation through Danish. <b>A better translation is needed</b>)</p>
<p>We do not keep quiet out of fear of (democratic) oppression.</p>
<p>On the background of that the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten on Friday 30 September 2005 chose to publish, what is said to be satirical drawings of our prophet (pbuh), where the drawings clearly contain inadmissible scorn, which can under no circumstances be accepted. Since we, as Muslims, have accepted to settle in this country on the premise that our full freedom, not least regarding religion, will be secured and respected, we hereby wish to draw the Danish public opinion to attention to the following:</p>
<p>1) That our prophet Mohammad (pbuh) in our hearts has a unique and incompareable status. Since Mohammad and his other brothers, such as the prophet Moses and the prophet Jesus, are god's messengers, they are not to be scorned. It is the duty of any believer, irrespective of religion, not least any sober-minded person, to prevent scorn of such a great prince with such great importance amongst his believers, even amongst his sober-minded rivals.</p>
<p>2) It is thought-provoking, if there in Europe exist any, who would scorn semitism in the name of free speech and under the umbrella of democracy???</p>
<p>3) We do not need lessons on democracy, but it is actually us, who through our deeds and speeches educate the whole world in democracy. That the churchtowers are well preserved since the times of our greatness and until today is the best proof of that.</p>
<p>4) This dictatorial way of using democracy is completely unacceptable.</p>
<p>5) Can it be right, when values are undermined, when the good deeds of man is not recognized, when sanctuaries are scorned, when honour is not respected, when values and principles are not spared, and all this in the name of freedom? This kind of democracy, where the weak is abused by the strong, is sick.</p>
<p>6) There needs to be a balance between freedom of speech and freedom of religion. When one is undermining the other, a crisis will arise with unpredictable consequences.</p>
<p>7) Today, there is quite some confusion among Muslims, since it is not known which of these two things is the thruth: Is it so that the west is hostile to a certain group of Muslims because of their deeds, but simultaneously recognizes that Islam is a respectable heavenly religion. Or is the truth, and what appeared in the newspaper, maybe that Islam itself with all its symbols and sanctuaries is worth nothing, and that our prophet, Mohammad (pbuh) is the greatest terrorist?</p>
<p>8) Does the ridicule by democracy of what is most holy to Muslims mean that we should just let it be, as if as nothing happened, but also refrain from becoming annoyed and feel offended, so that supporters of freedom of speech can feel that Muslims finally have started to develop and are starting to listen to critique and other peoples' opinions, even at the expense of our faith and what is holy to us?</p>
<p>9) if we take a look at the much debated "integration", would it then be logical, that this immature action is the optimal path to integration? Or will it widen the gap? What was published in the newspaper, is like pouring oil on fire. The stupendious person , who has done such an unwise act, should take upon himself the responsibility for his act and its consequences, where the least of these is an increased division of the society, which is otherwise wished to be harmonic without any kind of disagreement.</p>
<p>10) The least Jyllands-Posten can do, is to regret this kind of ridicoulous philosophy, and apologize to the Muslims, who have felt offended in their holiest, that is their prophet. It should make itself felt, if you genuinely consider the feelings of your fellow citizens.</p>
<p>11) Finally I would like to address the sober-minded of this society and urge that they will intervene and stop this ridicoulous situation, and to refrain from using the idea of "war against terror", which is used to scorn religion, i.e. Islam, with all its symbols and sanctuaries.</p>

<p>Date: XX(blank) October 2005, Copenhagen</p>
<p>To: His Excellence (blank) ambassador of the country (blank)</p>
<p>In the name of God the merciful</p>
<p>God's peace and blessings ...</p>
<p>Regarding caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).</p>
<p>On behalf of our (Muslim) population segment, we seek to inform you that, during the end of September 2005, Jyllands-Posten - which is the Danish newspaper with the biggest circulation - published fantasy drawings of the person of the Prophet (PBUH) in the newspaper's culture section (a copy of the article is enclosed.)</p>
<p>This happened in connection with the promotion of a book, which has recently been published, and which contains these inappropriate cartoons, which are most strongly rejected by Islamic Shari'a laws, likewise its rejection of attacks on Islamic sanctuaries.</p>
<p>The newspaper attempts to utilize the tense situation in the world, and the campaigns to fight terrorism to limit the circulation of Muslim opinions and to make these abstain from protesting, out of fear that they (Muslims) be attributed opposition to democracy and calls for terror, in the case when a sharp reaction might occur.</p>
<p>A great assembly of Islamic unions and centers have communicated with each other and agreed to take a number of steps, on level with the importance of this event, and appropriate for our meager resources in a context in which the press enjoys unlimited freedom to speak about Islam and Muslims as it sees fit.</p>
<p>It is in this situation, that we turn to the diplomatic delegations in Denmark, representing the Islamic countries in Denmark to the Danish government; we urge them to communicate this account of the regrettable situation and this population segment's indignation and irritation to their governments and to the relevant authorities in their countries with the needed haste, to at least express their protests, and likewise - such that the relationship between Islam and the West does not continue into a dark tunnel with no end and not serving any cause - while the negative obstacles increase for all parties.</p>
<p>We hope that this important question may receive what it deserves of your attention. Receive our thanks and respect. God's peace.</p>

<p>Letterhead: Islamic Society of Scandinavia. Fundamental services for immigrants.</p>
<p>Date: XX(blank) October 2005, Copenhagen</p>
<p>To: (blank) minister/head of/organization</p>
<p>Regarding the fantasy drawings of the Prophet of Islam - Newspaper Jyllands-Posten - September 2005.</p>
<p>The Muslim population segment in Denmark sees no other course than presenting our protests to those responsible and to the relevant authorities regarding the publication of a collection of inappropriate caricatures of the person of Islam's Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) by the newspaper Jyllands-Posten, since everybody knows that the Muslim peoples still adhere to the sanctity and insist on it for both God and for His Book, the Qu'ran, and for its messenger Muhammad (PBUH) despite of the world encompassing distribution of secular forms of political government.</p>
<p>We call your attention to this case, and places it in your hands, in such a way that we together may think and have an objective dialogue regarding how an appropriate exit can be found for these crises in a way which does not violate the freedom of speech, but which at the same time likewise does not offend the feelings of Muslims either. In this context, (we) note the following:</p>
<p>1 - Muslim immigrants came voluntarily to this country and enjoyed its excellent services/facilities, and they know of the country's secular foundation and its democratic values, and they live with this reality in the best of ways. In the same way, they sought and received citizenship completely by their own free request.</p>
<p>2 - Muslims are eager to integrate in this society and they take every opportunity in word and deed to stress this eagerness within the official frame of cultural diversity, peaceful co-existence, and mutual respect. This is why it is difficult for Muslims to understand or accept any form of behavior, which can obstruct or damage the question of integration, no matter the source of this behavior.</p>
<p>3 - The legal and political understanding of the intellectual immigrants, make them appreciate the public and civil liberties such as the freedom of religion and freedom of speech, but in a way which is appropriate for the level of development of civilization in the western countries, and which likewise secures the permanence of order and good manners. Precedents illustrate this such as the episode in which the European Union pressured Austria into rejecting the inclusion of Jörn Haider's political party in its cabinet; like it is seen in the recent actions by the British government which warns Muslim preachers of as much as commending any Muslim which might be associated with terror, and by this means the preachers will be held legally accountable in the form of a charge for inciting of terror.</p>
<p>4 - We urge you to - on the behalf of thousands of believing Muslims - to give us the opportunity of having a constructive contact with the press and particularly with the relevant decision makers, not briefly, but with a scientific methodology and a planned and long-term program seeking to make views approach each other and remove misunderstandings between the two parties involved. Since we do not wish for Muslims to be accused of being backward and narrow, likewise we do not wish for Danes to be accused of ideological arrogance either. When this relationship is back on its track, the result will bring satisfaction, an underpinning of security and the stable relations, and a flourishing Denmark for all that live here. Humanity is today faced with a large list of challenges starting with the pollution of the environment and natural disasters, and ending with the AIDS epidemic. Between these: narcotics, unemployment, organized crime etc. In these great issues, we have the opportunity of conducting a dialogue and letting minds and currents interact, and no matter how heated the dialogue is or how hard the confrontation is, the fruits of it will in all cases be for the good of all humanity.</p>
<p>We hope that this imitative might become the beginning of a new era and better results serving Denmark and its people. Best regards.<br />

<p>The original picture did not refer to Mohammed, but in the dossier the caption "Here is the true image of Mohammad" had been added.

<p>A letter from a Danish atheist to Shaddi Lubbad.</p>
<ul>
<li>Translation from Danish text: "If you're a computer specialist, shouldn't you have as much sense that you can see that all that Christianity and religion is A FABRICATION. There was never any GOD or Jesus, Muhammad or Allah, Clumsy Hans and the Empreror's New Clothes [the last two are Danish fairy tales]. IT IS ALL A FAKE. In ancient times it was possible to make people believe this nonsense. That's because they were forced to take part in it. If not, they'd be hunted out of their homes. Convicted as witches or warlocks. Or beheaded in public. Like people do in the Muslim countries where people still live like they did 1,000 years ago. Repressed and denied of the right to think for themselves. And you come here and feel hurt and harassed because of a drawing. Poor little Muslim. [The following paragraph points to a picture of a fat woman in Muslim dress]. I suppose you have one of these as well, 150 kilos with a dark mustache and a voice that can shatter glass? Greetings and good wind. B.J."</li>
