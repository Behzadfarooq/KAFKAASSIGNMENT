<p>The name Agade is probably from the <a href="../../../s/u/m/Sumerian_language.html" title="Sumerian language">Sumerian language</a>, appearing e.g. in the <a href="../../../s/u/m/Sumerian_king_list.html" title="Sumerian king list">Sumerian king list</a>, the later Assyro-Babylonian Semitic form <i>Akkadû</i> ("of or belonging to Akkad") probably being derived from Agade. It is possible that the name, in spite of its unetymological spelling of A.GA.DÈ, is from AGA.DÈ, meaning "Crown of Fire"<sup id="_ref-crown_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-crown" title="">[1]</a></sup> in allusion to <a href="../../../i/s/h/Ishtar.html" title="Ishtar">Ishtar</a>, "the brilliant goddess", whose cult was observed in very early times in Agade. This is suggested by the writings of <a href="../../../n/a/b/Nabonidus.html" title="Nabonidus">Nabonidus</a>, whose record<sup id="_ref-nabonidus_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-nabonidus" title="">[2]</a></sup> mentions that Ishtar worship of Agade was later superseded by that of the goddess <a href="../../../a/n/u/Anunit.html" title="Anunit">Anunit</a>, whose shrine was at <a href="../../../s/i/p/Sippar.html" title="Sippar">Sippar</a>. It is significant in this connection that there were two cities named Sippar, one under the protection of <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shamash.html" title="Shamash">Shamash</a>, the sun-god, and one under Anunit, suggesting proximity of Sippar and Agade. One theory held (as of <a href="../../../1/9/1/1911.html" title="1911">1911</a>) was that Agade was situated opposite Sippar on the left bank of the Euphrates, and was probably the oldest part of the city of Sippar. Another theory is that the ruins of Akkad are to be found beneath modern <a href="../../../b/a/g/Baghdad.html" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>. Despite numerous searches, the city has never been found. Reputedly the city was destroyed by invading <a href="../../../g/u/t/Gutians.html" title="Gutians">Gutians</a> with the fall of the <a href="../../../a/k/k/Akkadian_Empire_3ddf.html" title="Akkadian Empire">Akkadian Empire</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/k/k/Akkad.html" title="Edit section: Origins of Akkad">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Origins of Akkad</span></h3>
<p>Akkadians had been present in the north of the region since pre-historic times, and achied pre-eminence after the flood with the first Dyansty of Kish where rulers with Semitic names had already established themselves, by about 3,000 BCE. One of them, contemporary with the last Sumerian ruler, <a href="../../../l/u/g/Lugal-Zage-Si_a35a.html" title="Lugal-Zage-Si">Lugal-Zage-Si</a> of <a href="../../../u/r/u/Uruk.html" title="Uruk">Uruk</a>, was Alusarsid (or Urumus) who <i>"subdued <a href="../../../e/l/a/Elam.html" title="Elam">Elam</a> and Barahs (Barahsi?)"</i> thus beginning the trend towards regional empire. While Sargon is traditionally cited as the first ruler of a combined empire of Akkad and Sumer, more recent work suggests that a Sumerian expansion began under a previous king, <a href="../../../l/u/g/Lugal-Zage-Si_a35a.html" title="Lugal-Zage-Si">Lugal-Zage-Si</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Sargon_and_his_sons" id="Sargon_and_his_sons"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/k/k/Akkad.html" title="Edit section: Sargon and his sons">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sargon and his sons</span></h4>
<p>But the fame of these early establishers of Semitic supremacy was far eclipsed by that of <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sargon_of_Akkad_4f46.html" title="Sargon of Akkad">Sargon of Akkad</a> (<i>Sharru-kin</i> = legitimate king, was probably a title he took on gaining power<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[3]</a></sup>) (<a href="../../../2/3/r/23rd_century_BC_4b25.html" title="23rd century BC">23rd century BC</a>), who defeated and captured Lugal-Zage-Si, conquering his empire. The earliest records in Akkadian language all date to the time of <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sargon.html" title="Sargon">Sargon</a>. Sargon was claimed to be the son of La'ibum or Itti-Bel, a humble gardener, and possibly a <a href="../../../h/i/e/Hierodule.html" title="Hierodule">hierodule</a> or priestess-prostitute to <a href="../../../i/s/h/Ishtar.html" title="Ishtar">Ishtar</a>/<a href="../../../i/n/a/Inanna.html" title="Inanna">Inanna</a> and one legend related in neo-Assyrian times of Sargon that <i>"My mother was a changeling (?), my father I knew not. The brothers of my father loved the hills. My city is Azurpiranu (the wilderness herb fields), which is situated on the banks of the <a href="../../../e/u/p/Euphrates.html" title="Euphrates">Euphrates</a>. My changeling mother conceived me, in secret she bore me. She set me in a basket of rushes, with bitumen she sealed my lid. She cast me into the river which rose not over me. The river bore me up and carried me to Akki, the drawer of water. Akki, the drawer of water, took me as his son and reared me. Akki the drawer of water, appointed me as his gardener. While I was gardener <a href="../../../i/s/h/Ishtar.html" title="Ishtar">Ishtar</a> granted me her love, and for four and (fifty?) ... years I exercised kingship."</i><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Originally a cupbearer to a king of Kish with a Semitic name, Ur Zababa, Sargon thus became a gardemer, responsible for the task of clearing out irrigation canals, which gave him access to a disciplined corps of workers, who may have doubled up as his first soldiers. Displacing Ur Zababa, the crown was set upon Sargon's head, and he entered upon a career of foreign conquest<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[5]</a></sup>. Four times he invaded <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syria.html" title="Syria">Syria</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canaan.html" title="Canaan">Canaan</a>, and spent three years thoroughly subduing the countries of "the west" to unite them with Mesopotamia "into a single empire." However, Sargon took this process further, conquering many of the surrounding regions to create an empire that reached as far as the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediterranean_Sea_0b44.html" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anatolia.html" title="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>, and extending his rule to <a href="../../../e/l/a/Elam.html" title="Elam">Elam</a>, and as far south as <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magan.html" title="Magan">Magan</a> (<a href="../../../o/m/a/Oman.html" title="Oman">Oman</a>), an area over which he reigned for 56 years. <i>(For a list of Sargon's battles, see the article at <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sargon.html" title="Sargon">Sargon</a>)</i>. Trade extended from the <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silver.html" title="Silver">silver</a> mines of <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anatolia.html" title="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> to the <a href="../../../l/a/p/Lapis_lazuli.html" title="Lapis lazuli">lapis lazuli</a> in <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, the <a href="../../../c/e/d/Cedar.html" title="Cedar">cedars</a> of <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebanon.html" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a> and the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copper.html" title="Copper">copper</a> of Oman. This consolidation of the city states of <a href="../../../s/u/m/Sumer.html" title="Sumer">Sumer</a> and Akkad, reflected the growing economic and political power of Mesopotamia, and represented the first example of one state conquering other societies to form a single political entity. The empires breadbasket was the rain-fed agricultural systems of northern Mesopotamia, and a chain of fortresses were built to control this imperial wheat production.</p>
<p>Images of Sargon were erected on the shores of the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediterranean_Sea_0b44.html" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean</a> in token of his victories, and cities and palaces were built at home with the spoils of the conquered lands. Elam and the northern part of Mesopotamia were also subjugated, and rebellions were put down in Sumer itself. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contract.html" title="Contract">Contract</a> tablets have been found dated in the years of the campaigns against <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canaan.html" title="Canaan">Canaan</a>; and Sarlak, king of <a href="../../../g/u/t/Gutian_period.html" title="Gutian period">Gutium</a>, today northern Iraq. Sargon throughout his long life showed special deference to the Sumerian gods, particularly Ishtar|Inanna, his patroness, and Zababa, the warrior god of Kish. He called hismelf <i>"The annointed priest of <a href="../../../a/n/u/Anu.html" title="Anu">Anu</a>"</i> abd <i>"the great</i> <b>ensi</b> <i>of <a href="../../../e/n/l/Enlil.html" title="Enlil">Enlil</a>"</i>, and his daughter, <a href="../../../e/n/h/Enheduanna.html" title="Enheduanna">Enheduanna</a>, the famous poet, was installed as priestess to <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nanna_%28Sumerian_deity%29_822b.html" title="Nanna (Sumerian deity)">Nanna</a> at the temple in <a href="../../../u/r/_/Ur.html" title="Ur">Ur</a>.</p>
<p>Troubles began towards the end of his reign. A later Babylonian text states <i>"In his old age, all the lands revolted against him, and they besieged him in Akkad (the city)"</i> .. but <i>"he went forth to battle and defeated them, he knocked them over and destroyed their vast army".</i> Also shortly after, <i>"the <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subartu.html" title="Subartu">Subartu</a> (mountainous tribes of) the upper country - in their turn attacked, but they submitted to his arms, and Sargon settled their habitations, and he smote them grievously".</i> These difficulties broke out again in the reign of his sons. Revolts broke out during the 9 year reign of his son, <a href="../../../r/i/m/Rimush_%28Akkad%29_0225.html" title="Rimush (Akkad)">Rimush</a>, who fought hard to retain the empire, and in the fifteen year reign of Rimush's elder brother <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manishtushu.html" title="Manishtushu">Manishtushu</a>.

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/k/k/Akkad.html" title="Edit section: Naram-Sin">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Naram-Sin</span></h4>
<p><a href="../../../n/a/r/Naram-Sin_3b6f.html" title="Naram-Sin">Naram-Sin</a> (= Beloved of Sin), Sargon's grandson, assumed the imperial title of "King Naram-Sin, of the four quarters (Lugal Naram-Sin, Šar kibrat 'arbaim)", and, like his grandfather, was addressed as "the god (Sumerian = DIN.GIR, Akkadian = ilu) of Agade" (Akkad), reminiscent of the divine honours claimed by the <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharaoh.html" title="Pharaoh">Pharaohs</a> of <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, also faced revolts at the start of his reign.</p>
<p>Naram-Sin also recorded the Akkadian conquest of <a href="../../../e/b/l/Ebla.html" title="Ebla">Ebla</a> and <i>Armani</i> (also read <i>Armanum</i> or <i>Armanim</i>). Rafayel Ischchanian speculates that the <i>Armani</i> correspond to the ethnonym <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenia.html#Etymology" title="Armenia">Armenian</a>,<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[6]</a></sup> though this and other possible early mention of the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenians.html" title="Armenians">Armenians</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-European_fc7a.html" title="Indo-European">Indo-European</a> groups, such as the finding of the place name <i>Ar-mi</i> <sup>KI</sup> at Ebla, is disputed.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[7]</a></sup> However, since <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyrians.html" title="Assyrians">Assyrians</a>, who are direct descendants of Akkadians, to this day refer to <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenians.html" title="Armenians">Armenians</a> by the inscription form <i>Armani</i>, leads many to see that it is indeed referring to Armenians. Others see Armani as a location between Carchemish and Ebla. To better police this area he built a royal residence at <a href="../../../t/e/l/Tell_Brak_cc4c.html" title="Tell Brak">Tell Brak</a>, a cross roads at the heart of the Khabur basin of the Jezirah. Naram Sin is supposed to have possessed a army of over 360,000 men, the largest size of any state up until that date. It enabled him also to campaign against Magan which also revolted, Naram-Sin, <i>"marched against Magan and personally caught Mandannu, its king"</i>. The chief threat seemed to be coming from the north easterner mountaineers. A campaign against the <a href="../../../l/u/l/Lullubi.html" title="Lullubi">Lullubi</a> led to the carving of the famous stele, now in the <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louvre.html" title="Louvre">Louvre</a>. This newfound Akkadian wealth may have been based upon benign climatic conditions, huge agricultural surpluses and the confiscation of the wealth of other peoples<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[8]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The economy was highly planned. After the Akkadian advancing forces from from <a href="../../../t/e/l/Tell_Brak_cc4c.html" title="Tell Brak">Tell Brak</a> tookn the massive (100 acre) site of <a href="../../../t/e/l/Tell_Leilan_cf21.html" title="Tell Leilan">Tell Leilan</a>, they destroyed nearby villages and brought the organisation of farming and grain distribution into its bureaucratic control. Grain was cleaned, distributed as rations of grain and oil in standardised vessela made by the city's potters. Taxes were paid in produce and labour on public walls, including city walls, temples, irrigation canals and waterways, producing huge agricultural surpluses<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[9]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Within 100 years the Empire of Akkad collapsed, almost as fast as it had developed. By the end of Naram-Sin's son, Shar-kali-shari's reign, it collapsed outright from the invasion of barbarians of the <a href="../../../z/a/g/Zagros_Mountains_3aa2.html" title="Zagros Mountains">Zagros</a> known as "<a href="../../../g/u/t/Gutian_period.html" title="Gutian period">Gutians</a>". It has recently been suggested<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[12]</a></sup> that the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Age_0a18.html" title="Dark Age">Dark Age</a> at the end of the Akkadian period (and <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Intermediary_Period_a065.html" title="First Intermediary Period">First Intermediary Period</a> of the <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Egypt_c49a.html" title="Ancient Egypt">Ancient Egyptian</a> <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Kingdom_3acf.html" title="Old Kingdom">Old Kingdom</a>) was associated with rapidly increasing aridity, and falling rainfall in the region of the Ancient Near East, possibly produced by a <a href="../../../a/s/t/Asteroid_impact.html" title="Asteroid impact">asteroid impactor</a> or major <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volcanic_eruption.html" title="Volcanic eruption">volcanic eruption</a>.</p>
<p>The fall of the empire established by Sargon seems to have been as sudden as its rise, and little is known about the <a href="../../../g/u/t/Gutian_period.html" title="Gutian period">Gutian period</a>. From the fall of Akkad until around <a href="../../../2/1/0/2100_BC_e314.html" title="2100 BC">2100 BC</a>, there is much that is still dark.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../s/u/m/Sumerian_king_list.html" title="Sumerian king list">Sumerian king list</a> after the death of Sharkalishari, states</p>
<p><i>"Who was king? Who was not king? Igigi the king; Nanum, the king; Imi the king; Elulu, the king - the four of them were kings but reigned only three years. Dudu reigned 21 years; Shudurul, the son of Dudu, reigned 15 years. (A Total of) 11 kings reigned 197 years. Agade was defeated, and its kingship carried off to <a href="../../../u/r/u/Uruk.html" title="Uruk">Uruk</a>. In Uruk, Urnigin reigned 7 years, Irgigir, son of Urnigin, reigned 6 years; Kudda reigned 6 years; Puzur-ili reigned 5 years, Utu-utu reigned 6 years. Uruk was smitten with weapons and its kingship carried off by the <a href="../../../g/u/t/Gutian.html" title="Gutian">Gutian</a> hordes.</i></p>
<p>The Kings of Uruk may have been contemporaries of the last kings of Akkad).</p>

Total 21 kings reigned 91 years, 40 days.</i></p>
<p>Evidence from <a href="../../../t/e/l/Tell_Leilan_cf21.html" title="Tell Leilan">Tell Leilan</a> in Northern Mesopotamia shows what may have happened. The site was abandoned soon after the city's massive walls were constructed, its temple rebuilt and its grain production reorganised. The debris, dust and sand that followed, show no trace of human activity. Soil samples show fine, wind-blown sand, no trace of earthworm activity and reduced rainfall, indications of a drier and windier climate. Evidence shows that skeleton thin sheep and cattle died of drought, and up to 28,000 people abandoned the site seeking wetter areas elsewhere. Tell Brak shrank in size by 75%. Trade collapsed. Nomadic herders moved herds closer to reliable water suppliers, bringing them into conflict with farmers. The ruler of <a href="../../../u/r/_/Ur.html" title="Ur">Ur</a> constructed an 180 kilometer wall called "the repeller of the <a href="../../../a/m/o/Amorites.html" title="Amorites">Amorites</a>". Increased wind erosion is also indicated by increased deposits in marine horizons off the coast of Oman, carbon dated to the period of the collapse of Akkad, reaching levels not seen in the last 10,000 years. The spread of arid conditions is also observed in northern Nigeria and the Ethiopian Highlands. This climatic collapse affected the whole of the Middle East and occurred at the time of the collapse of the Egyptian Old Kingdom. The collapse of wetter conditions in the Ethiopian Highlands may have had an effect on reducing the waters of the Nile, as at this time it was reported people spoke of being able to cross the Nile on foot. The climatic change at this period shows in Greenland ice cores, and as far away as cores from Andean glaciers in Peru, and probably lasted for nearly 280 years. A relatively well-known king from that period is <a href="../../../g/u/d/Gudea.html" title="Gudea">Gudea</a>, king of Lagash.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that the rapid climatic collapse of the Akkadian Dark Age may have been responsible for the religiously prescribed tabu against the raising and consumption of <a href="../../../p/i/g/Pig.html" title="Pig">pigs</a> that spread the Ancient Middle East from the end of the third millennium BCE. As late as 2,900 BCE pig bones comprised 20-30% of those found in the Middle East. Then after 2,200 BCE they disappeared in most Mesopotamian cities, later spreading as far as Egypt. The conventional reason for the disappearance of the pig from Middle Eastern diets is its possible infection of trichinae, a parasite that can prove fatal to humans, the fact that cattle, sheep and goats all carry fatal diseases for humans generally not considered. The fact that this animal disappeared as a time of drought seems to have in part been due to the fact that while able to forage of tubers, roots, nuts and fruits in forest or swampy environments, pigs have difficulty living off high cellulose diets of husks and stalks. In hotter and drier climates they are a great deal less productive, and need their diet supplemented by grain, in competition with human populations. They also need shade as they suffer badly from sunburn. Pigs also cannot be shorn, milked or ridden or used for traction as draught animals. While these economic problems may have been insufficient to explain the disappearance of the pig, the combination with the prolonged drought of climatic change and decline in rainfall and forest cover from 2,200 BCE may have been contributing factors<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[13]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The period between ca. <a href="../../../2/1/0/2100_BC_e314.html" title="2100 BC">2100 BC</a> and <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000_BC_0a8f.html" title="2000 BC">2000 BC</a> is sometimes called the <a href="../../../3/r/d/3rd_dynasty_of_Ur_a8e8.html" title="3rd dynasty of Ur">3rd dynasty of Ur</a> or "Sumerian Renaissance", founded by <a href="../../../u/r/-/Ur-Nammu_8c4e.html" title="Ur-Nammu">Ur-Nammu</a> (originally a general).

<p>After 1,900 BCE rainfall patterns recovered, and the Habur and Tell Leilan prospered again under Amorite Dynasties. But the scar on the Mesoptamian psyche remained. The Gods of <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylon.html" title="Babylon">Babylonia</a> were a good deal more vicious and less caring of humanity than the earlier Sumerian divinities had been.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/k/k/Akkad.html" title="Edit section: Government">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Government</span></h2>
<p>The Akkadian government formed the "classical standard" against which all future Mesopotamian states compared themselves. Traditionally the <i>"en"</i> was the highest functionary of the <a href="../../../s/u/m/Sumer.html" title="Sumer">Sumerian</a> <a href="../../../c/i/t/City-state.html" title="City-state">city-states</a>. In later traditions one became an <i>"en"</i> by marrying the Goddess <a href="../../../i/n/a/Inanna.html" title="Inanna">Inanna</a>, legitimising the rulership through divine consent. Initially the monarchial <i>"lugal"</i> (gal = great, lu = man) was subordinate to the priestly en, and was appointed at times of troubles, but by late Dynastic times, it was the lugal who had emerged as the pre-eminent role, having his own <i>"é"</i> (=house) or "palace", independent from the temple establishment. By the time of Mesalim, whichever dynast controlled the city of <a href="../../../k/i/s/Kish_%28Sumer%29_f3dc.html" title="Kish (Sumer)">Kish</a> was recognised as <i>"šar kiššati"</i> (= king of Kish), and was considered preminent in Sumeria, possibly because this was where the two rivers approached, and whoever controlled Kish ulimately controlled the irrigation systems of the other cities downstream. As Sargon extended his conquest from the <i>"Lower Sea"</i> (= Persian Gulf), to the <i>"Upper Sea"</i> (= Mediterranean), it was felt that he ruled <i>"the totality of the lands under heaven"</i>, or <i>"from sunrise to sunset"</i> as contemprary texts put it. Under Sargon, the <i>"en"</i> generally retained their positions, but were seen more as provincial governors. The title <i>"šar kiššati"</i> became recognised as meaning "lord of the universe".</p>
<p>One strategy adopted by both Sargon and Naram-Sin, to maintain control of the country, was to install their daughters; <a href="../../../e/n/h/Enheduanna.html" title="Enheduanna">Enheduanna</a> and Enmenanna respectively, as High-Priestess to Sin, the Akkadian version of the Sumerian moon god, <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nanna_%28Sumerian_deity%29_822b.html" title="Nanna (Sumerian deity)">Nanna</a>, at <a href="../../../u/r/_/Ur.html" title="Ur">Ur</a>, in the extreme south of <a href="../../../s/u/m/Sumer.html" title="Sumer">Sumer</a>, to install sons as provincial <i>"en"</i> governors in strategic locations and to marry their daughters to rulers of peripheral parts of the Empire (Urkush and Marhasi).</p>
<p>With Naram-Sin, Sargon's grandson, this went further than Sargon with the King being called "Lord of the Four Quarters (of the Earth)", and was elevated to the ranks of the <i>"dingir"</i> (= gods), with his ownb temple establishment. Previously a ruler could, like <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilgamesh.html" title="Gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a> become divine after death, but the Akkadian kings from Naram-Sin became God on Earth. Their portraits showed them of larger size than mere mortals, and showed them with some distance from their retainers <sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[14]</a></sup>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/k/k/Akkad.html" title="Edit section: The Economy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Economy</span></h2>
<p>The population of Akkad, like all pre-modern states, was totally dependent upon the agricultural systems of the region, which seems to have had two principle centres; the irrigated farmlands of Southern Iraq, traditionally had given a yield of 30 grains return for each grain sown, making it more productive than modern farming, and; the rain fed agriculture of Northern Iraq, known as <i>"the Upper Country"</i>. Southern Iraq, during the Akkadian period seems to have been approaching its modern rainfall regime of less than 20 milimeters per annum, with the result that agriculture was totally dependent upon irrigation. During the Akkadian period, the progressive <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salinity.html" title="Salinity">salinisation</a> of the soils, produced by poorly drained irrigation, had been reducing yields of wheat in the southern part of the country, leading to a conversion to more salt-tolerant barley growing. Nevertheless, it was this high degree of agricultural productivity in the south that enabled the growth of the highest population densities in the world at this this time, which gave Akkad its military advantage. The water table in this region was very high, and it was replenished every year by winter storms in the headwaters of the Tigris and Euphrates from October to March, and from snow-melt from March to July. The flat country, and weather uncertainties made flooding much more unpredictable than was the case of the Nile, serious deluges seem to have been a regular feature, requiring constant maintenance of irrigation ditches and drainage systems. Farmers were recruited into regiments for this work between August to October, a period of food shortage,under the control of city temple authorities, this acting as a form of unemployment relief. Some have suggested that this task for the king of <a href="../../../k/i/s/Kish_%28Sumer%29_f3dc.html" title="Kish (Sumer)">Kish</a> was the original employment of Sargon, and gave him his experience in being effectively capable of organising large groups of men; a tablet reads, <i>"Sargon, the king, to whom Enlil permitted no rival - 5,400 warriors ate bread daily before him"</i>.</p>
<p>Harvest was in the late spring and during the dry summer months, nomadic <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martu.html" title="Martu">Martu</a> or <a href="../../../a/m/o/Amorites.html" title="Amorites">Amorites</a> from north west, would pasture their flocks of sheep and goats to graze on the stubble and be watered from the river and irrigation canals. For this privilege, nomad shepherds would have to pay a tax in wool, meat, milk and cheese, to the temples who would distribute these products to the bureaucracy and priesthood. In good years all would go well, but in bad years, wild winter pastures would be in short supply, nomads would seek to pasture their flocks in the grain fields, and conflict with farmers would result. This seasonal cycle mythologically seems to have been the origin of the stories of <a href="../../../c/a/i/Cain.html" title="Cain">Cain</a> and <a href="../../../a/b/e/Abel.html" title="Abel">Abel</a>, examples of which have been found in the Akkadian mythic corpus.</p>

<p>As a result, Sumer and Akkad had a surplus of agricultural products but was in short supply of almost everything else, particularly metal ores, timber and building stone, all of which had to be imported. To some degree, the spread of the Akkadian state, to the "silver mountain", the "cedars" of Lebanon, and to the copper deposits of Magan (modern Oman), seem to have been motivated to secure control over these imports. A tablet reads <i>"Sargon, the king of Kish, triumphed in thirty four battles (over the cities) up to the edge of the sea (and) destroyed their walls. He made the ships from <a href="../../../m/e/l/Meluhha.html" title="Meluhha">Meluhha</a> (the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indus_civilization.html" title="Indus civilization">Indus civilization</a>), the ships from <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magan.html" title="Magan">Magan</a> (<a href="../../../o/m/a/Oman.html" title="Oman">Oman</a>) (and) the ships from <a href="../../../d/i/l/Dilmun.html" title="Dilmun">Dilmun</a> (<a href="../../../b/a/h/Bahrein.html" title="Bahrein">Bahrein</a>) tie up alongside the quay of Agade. Sargon the king prostrated himself before (the god) <a href="../../../d/a/g/Dagan.html" title="Dagan">Dagan</a> (and) made supplication to him; (and) he (Dagan) gave him the upper land, 9namely0 <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mari.html" title="Mari">Mari</a>, Yarmuti (and) <a href="../../../e/b/l/Ebla.html" title="Ebla">Ebla</a>, up to the Cedar Forest (and) up to the Silver Mountain".</i></p>
<p>The location of the Silver Mountain is uncertain, but it is believed to have been in the <a href="../../../t/a/u/Taurus_Mountains_f49c.html" title="Taurus Mountains">Taurus Mountains</a>, in southern <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anatolia.html" title="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>. Inscriptions from much later tell of a campaign as far as Purushkanda, which is believed to have been on one of the tributaries of <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Bey%C5%9Fehir_fe69.html" title="Lake Beyşehir">Lake Beyşehir</a>. The same inscription tells of securing the trade from Kaptara, which is believed to have been the Akkadian version of the location known to the Egyptians as <a href="../../../k/e/f/Keftiu.html" title="Keftiu">Keftiu</a>, thought to have been <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minoan_civilisation.html" title="Minoan civilisation">Minoan civilisation</a> of <a href="../../../c/r/e/Crete.html" title="Crete">Crete</a>. This concern with trade may have led the Akkadian forces to attack Byblos, denying <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Egypt_c49a.html" title="Ancient Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a> the cedars from here in the latter part of the Egyptian <a href="../../../s/i/x/Sixth_dynasty_of_Egypt_9d5e.html" title="Sixth dynasty of Egypt">6th Dynasty</a>, an important chronological correspondence between the two <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civilisation.html" title="Civilisation">civilisations</a>.</p>

<p>A <i>bas relief</i> representing Naram-Sin, and bearing a striking resemblance to early <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_of_ancient_Egypt_167a.html" title="Art of ancient Egypt">Egyptian art</a> in many of its features, has been found at <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diarbekr.html" title="Diarbekr">Diarbekr</a>, in modern <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_and_architecture_of_Babylonia_and_Assyria_7ba8.html" title="Art and architecture of Babylonia and Assyria">Babylonian art</a>, however, had already attained a high degree of excellence; two cylinder seals of the time of Sargon are among the most beautiful specimens of the gem-cutter's art ever discovered.</p>

<p>One tablet from this period reads, <i>"(From the earliest days) no-one had made a statue of lead, (but) Rimush king of Kish, had a statue of himself made of lead. It stood before <a href="../../../e/n/l/Enlil.html" title="Enlil">Enlil</a>; and it recited his (Rimush's) virtues to the idu of the gods"</i>. Akkadian artists also discovered the <i>"<a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_wax.html" title="Lost wax">lost wax</a>"</i> method of bronze casting, believed previously to only have been discovered at the time of classical Greece.</p>

<p>The empire was bound together by roads, along which there was a regular <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mail.html" title="Mail">postal service</a>. Clay seals that took the place of stamps bear the names of Sargon and his son. A <a href="../../../c/a/d/Cadastral.html" title="Cadastral">cadastral</a> survey seems also to have been instituted, and one of the documents relating to it states that a certain Uru-Malik, whose name appears to indicate his <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canaan.html" title="Canaan">Canaanite</a> origin, was governor of the land of the <a href="../../../a/m/o/Amorites.html" title="Amorites">Amorites</a>, or <i>Amurru</i> as the semi-<a href="../../../n/o/m/Nomad.html" title="Nomad">nomadic</a> people of Syria and Canaan were called in Akkadian. It is probable that the first collection of <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astronomy.html" title="Astronomy">astronomical</a> observations and terrestrial omens was made for a library established by Sargon. The <i>"<a href="../../../l/i/m/Limmu.html" title="Limmu">limmu</a>"</i> calendrical system, used henceforth in Mesopotamian history, whereby which years were named by one significant event, and these were listed, also began in the Akkadian period.</p>
