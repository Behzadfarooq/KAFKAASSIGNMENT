<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> instituted the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a>. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were <i>lawful combatants</i> -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatant.html" title="Enemy combatant">enemy combatant</a>.</p>

<p>The President ordered a recess, for Akhtiar’s Personal Representative to talk to him about his witness requests. Following the recess Akhtiar was allowed a single witness request. The transcript records: <i>“Since the other witnesses were only going to be character witnesses and character evidence is not relevant to the determination of enemy combatant status, the other witness requests were denied.

<p>Detainees who were determined to have been properly classified as "enemy combatants" were scheduled to have their dossier reviewed at annual <a href="../../../a/d/m/Administrative_Review_Board_9651.html" title="Administrative Review Board">Administrative Review Board</a> hearings. The Administrative Review Boards weren't authorized to review whether a detainee qualified for POW status, and they weren't authorized to review whether a detainee should have been classified as an "enemy combatant".</p>
<p>They were authorized to consider whether a detainee should continue to be detained by the United States, because they continued to pose a threat -- or whether they could safely be repatriated to the custody of their home country, or whether they could be set free.</p>
<p>Mohammad chose to participate in his Administrative Review Board hearing.<sup id="_ref-ArbAkhtiarMohammad1036_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-ArbAkhtiarMohammad1036" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>The memo summarizing the factors for and against captive's continued detention were always separated into two sections: those factors favoring detention; and those factors favoring release or transfer. The factors favoring continued detention were always further broken down into subcategories, like <b>"training", "association",</b> and <b>"intent"</b>. The factors within those subcategories were always numbered. The numbering and subcategories were usually repeated in the transcripts. But they were not preserved in Akhtiar's transcript.</p>

<ul>
<li>Akhtiar Mohammad acknowledged being a member of the Ittihad-E-Islami -- during the struggle to free Afghanistan from its <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_occupation_of_Afghanistan_3027.html" title="Soviet occupation of Afghanistan">Soviet occupiers</a>:
<dl>
<dd><i>“Yes, sir, I am going to tell you a little bit about my history leading me to being a member of this party. About 15 to 20 years ago when we fought against the Russians <sup class="noprint">[</sup></i><sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a><i>]</i></sup> <i>there were some parties, I was a member of this party mentioned here Ittihad-E-Islami.

Almost 25 years ago when I became a refugee and came to Pakistan, I joined the party for different reasons. One of the reasons was because, as a refugee in Pakistan, the Pakistani Police Authorities would not let you stay or walk around without a membership card. This was an ID for me as an Afghan."</i></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>One of the Board members had was surprised that an Afghan refugee needed to register with a rebel group in order to acquire an ID card that would prove an acceptable proof of his identity for officials in the countries he sought refuge in. Akhtiar confirmed that this was the case.</li>
<li>Akhtiar was asked the doctrine behind the party, its goal, what it stood for. He replied:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>“My idea was to just get rid of the Russians <sup class="noprint">[</sup></i><sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a><i>]</i></sup> <i>whatever ideological agenda they had was none of my business.”</i></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Akhtiar was asked if ridding Afghanistan of the Soviets was the party’s only goal. He replied:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>“Once the Russians <sup class="noprint">[</sup></i><sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a><i>]</i></sup> <i>withdrew from Afghanistan or were defeated, the party was no longer active and I did not have any more relations with them. Once the Taliban came into power we then had another problem.”</i></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Akhtiar was asked if he was aware of any Islamic extremist organizations. He replied that he did not have any relationships with the Taliban or any other fundamentalist parties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In response to the allegation that Akhtiar was appointed to a field grade rank while fighting the Soviets he replied that those fighting the Soviets did not use traditional ranks.
<ul>
<li>Akhtiar confirmed he was rewarded with the rank of Colonel by the Rabbani coalition government that followed the ouster of the Communists, and preceded the Taliban regime.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Akhtiar denied the accusation that he admitted meeting with known Hezbi-E-Islami Gulbuddin members. Akhtiar denied meetting with HIG members. He did not agree with their ideas.</li>
<li>In response to the allegation that he worked with (Gulbiddin) Hekmatyar, former Prime Minister, former leader of the the Hezbi-E-Islami party, and current leader of the Gulbuddin faction of the Hezbi-I-Islami party, Akhtiar confirmed that during the struggle to free Afghanistan of the Soviet occupiers all the militia groups made National unity their top priority, and worked with other militia groups to which they were ideologically opposed.</li>
<li>In response to the accusation that he had been conscripted into military service for one year Akhtiar replied:
<dl>
<dd><i>“Yes, sir. At the time of President Dahoud <sup class="noprint">[</sup></i><sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a><i>]</i></sup><i>, prior to the communist taking over in Afghanistan about 30 years ago, Afghanistan had an Army and everyone had an obligation to serve two years. At that time, if you graduated high school you only had to serve in the Army for one year and I graduated high school.</i></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>In response to the allegation that he fought in the jihad against the Russians <sup class="noprint">[<i><a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a></i>]</sup> Akhtiar and the Board had the following dialogue:</li>

<li>Akhtiar confirmed that the Rabbani government gave him a job in the border patrol.
<ul>
<li>When asked what his duties were Akhtiar said he commanded an infantry unit of 80-100 people in Gardez. They weren’t actually patrolling a border. They were eventually to patrol a protected forest, to prevent illicit logging. But that responsibility hadn’t been assigned during his time. Akhtiar described the real purpose of the unit to keep the men busy, and provide them with a salary.</li>
<li>Akhtiar agreed that in US terminology he would be described as a Company commander.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In response to the allegation that he was again given a leadership position, with the rank of Colonel, commanding a company of 80-100 infantrymen, Akhtiar replied:

</dl>
<ul>
<li>When one of the Board members asked if he knew Jaladin Haqani <sup class="noprint">[<i><a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a></i>]</sup> before his capture, Akhtiar replied Jaladin was famous, and he knew of him, but didn’t know him.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In response to the allegation that after Akhtiar left his post the Taliban took control of his company and arrested many of his men Akhtiar replied:
<dl>
<dd><i>“Yes, sir <sup class="noprint">[</sup></i><sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a><i>]</i></sup> <i>I did work there for 18 months.

In Pakistan they gave me a very hard time so I moved to <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panjshir.html" title="Panjshir">Panjshir</a>.</i></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>In response to the allegation that, in 1997, he fought with the Northern Alliance, for three years, from a base in Panjshir, Akhtiar confirmed that he went to Panjshir. But he denied he fought. He said he <i>“did not have the power to fight.”</i></li>
<li>In response to the allegation that he rented a house in Gardez when he returned to Afghanistan Akhtiar explained that renting a house was necessary because his home was in a portion of Afghanistan that was still occupied by the Taliban.</li>
<li>In response to the allegation that he was one of three individuals arrested on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_4.html" title="May 4">May 4</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, Akhtiar replied:
<ul>
<li>he was captured with one other individual, a Karzai government soldier named Nazar Gul Nazargul;</li>
<li>in his whole life Akhtiar testified, he never had any association with fundamentalist groups like the HIG.</li>
<li>the Gardez area was heavily occupied by US forces, so it was impossible for anyone to even think about training against the USA.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In response to the allegation that he was recruiting soldiers for the Karzai government when he was captured, Akhtiar confirmed that he was recruiting soldiers, and, in addition, the engineers, doctors, and the other kinds of workers the Karzai government needed.
<ul>
<li>Akhtiar confirmed that he sent army recruits to an official Army depot.</li>
<li>Akhtiar confirmed he was performing this duty as a Karzai government official.</li>
<li>When Akhtiar was asked if any Hezbi-E-Islami members were ever recruited into the Army, he named one individual he knew of who joined the Karzai government. But that individual, Marmor Fazal, had joined the government by running for office, and being elected to the <a href="../../../l/o/y/Loya_Jirga_e119.html" title="Loya Jirga">Loya Jirga</a>, and he had done so after repudiating Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. Akhtiar indicated that Fazal was not the only Hezbi-E-Islami renegade who had defected to the Karzai government.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Akhtiar confirmed that he was scheduled for a promotion to General, and his promotion would have come approximately one month after the date of his capture.</li>
<li>Akhtiar responded further to the claim that Hezbi-E-Islami documents had been found in the housing compound where he was captured.
<dl>
<dd><i>“There were no such documents of Islami in my possession, in my home, or in my room. I repeatedly requested these documents that they have in their possession. Please provide me with some evidence. When they captured me all I had in <sup class="noprint">[</sup></i><sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a><i>]</i></sup> <i>possession were two magazines. One was Newbahar <sup class="noprint">[</sup></i><sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a><i>]</i></sup><i>, the other was <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelid.html" title="Kelid">Kelid</a> <sup class="noprint">[</sup></i><sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a><i>]</i></sup><i>, a blank notebook which was IRC <sup class="noprint">[</sup></i><sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a><i>]</i></sup><i>, a passport, a medical book and my ID card.”</i></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Akhtiar confirmed that he was willing and able to help the United States.</li>
<li>Akhtiar expanded on the factor that he had stated he had never fought against or assisted anyone else fight against United States Forces:
<dl>
<dd><i>“Yes. The United States helped us twice in a very bad situation. One is that we defeated the Russians <sup class="noprint">[</sup></i><sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a><i>]</i></sup> <i>together, which they helped us with a lot.

<p>Akhtiar's Assisting Military Officer prefaced Akhtiar's statement with advice to Akhtiar. His advice was that Akhtiar should forget about the inability of the Guantanamo camp authorities to produce documents they claimed to possess, like his alleged Hezbi-I-Islami ID card, and focus on matters that would convince the Board that he did not represent a threat to the USA.</p>
<p>Akhtiar told his Board about the two men who denounced him to the Americans. Akhtiar told his Board that one of his denouncers was a former member of the Afghan KGB, during the communist puppet regime, named Aazar Gul <sup class="noprint">[<i><a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a></i>]</sup>.

<li>Akhtiar was asked whether any of his relative had been killed or injured during Afghanistan's decades of strife. He told the Board that the Taliban had beaten his brother so severely he wasn't expected to live, and that he was left paralyzed.</li>
<li>When asked if he owned an AK-47 Akhtiar said he did not. When asked if he had ever owned one, if he had owned one during the struggle against the Soviets, Akhtiar said during the struggle against the Soviets he had armed himself with an American made 11 <sup class="noprint">[<i><a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a></i>]</sup> gauge shotgun.</li>
<li>When Akhtiar was asked how his hand was injured, he replied that the captive's in camp four were allowed to play football with one another. He had been injured playing football.</li>
