<p>Hi, Akhillleus. Deleting the reference to Wilkens you forgot to delete the information from this unreliable source as well; It's about <a href="../../../s/c/h/Scheria.html" title="Scheria">Scheria</a>: "<a href="../../../l/a/n/Lanzarote.html" title="Lanzarote">Lanzarote</a>, one of the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canary_Isles_9015.html" title="Canary Isles">Canary Isles</a>, has been proposed as a possible location for Scheria. A map of 1764 by the Scottish explorer George Glass shows two ports on either side of the citadel. The port west of the citadel (now <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arrecife.html" title="Arrecife">Arrecife</a>) was called Porto Cavallos (port of the horses), while the port east of the city was called Porto de Naos (port of the ship) because of a rock resembling a ship off the coast.</p>

<p>Hi Akhilleus. Anonymous editor User:71.255.92.56 changed the gist and verifiability of the article on the ancient Greek <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharmakos.html" title="Pharmakos">Pharmakos</a> which I had carefully researched and written into, some time ago. I restored the old version after carefully reading the new version many times and seeing some unverifiability in it, even though it seems to present as a "cleanup" re-write. It's just not that. The old version is: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pharmakos&amp;oldid=78999545" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pharmakos&amp;oldid=78999545" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pharmakos&amp;oldid=78999545</a></p>
<p>I will be updating the article with more citations and verifiable text soon. Any thoughts&#160;?

<dd>Akhilleus, thanks for getting back to me expeditiously and your kind words. I just added a couple of new references to the article and re-worked the footnotes style. I was also puzzled by the "That which can cure can kill" bit put into the article by the anon editor because it didn't make much sense to me upon many readings and in-context. Rather the opposite sense with a pharmakos -- the sacrifice (killing) which will cure the community, etc. I will look into the many points you raised on the article and the anon's edition. Best Wishes and Many Thanks again. --- (Bob) <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiklrsc_e9c8.html" title="User:Wikiklrsc">Wikiklrsc</a> 19:42, 2 October 2006 (UTC) (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikiklrsc_ecb9.html" title="User talk:Wikiklrsc">User talk:Wikiklrsc</a>)</dd>

<p>Hi Akhilleus. Thanks for the revert on the <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharmakos.html" title="Pharmakos">Pharmakos</a> article to the "restore" made by <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlwfbird_72bb.html" title="User:Carlwfbird">User:Carlwfbird</a>. I don't know why he restored it to the previous fuzzy changes. I spent a lot of time on the article yesterday, with a couple of new citations, especially the Professor Jan Bremmer paper, "Scapegoat Rituals in Ancient Greece", January 1983. It's an excellent article from the journal, Harvard Studies in Classical Philology. Let's hope the article settles down again. I'll also try to refine it some more. Best Wishes. --- (Bob) <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiklrsc_e9c8.html" title="User:Wikiklrsc">Wikiklrsc</a> 13:15, 3 October 2006 (UTC) (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikiklrsc_ecb9.html" title="User talk:Wikiklrsc">talk</a>)</p>

<p>Hi Akhilleus.

<dd>Thanks, Akhilleus for your kind reply. Rich Farmbrough seems to have corrected the issue. Temple's being in the Canadian Dictionary of Biography was significant enough plus having been Governor of Nova Scotia, and a confidential friend of King Charles II of England, etc. etc. I am not quite totally up on that period of history myself but did the research.

<p>Hey, Akhilleus. I'll take a look at the <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_the_Great_5bb4.html" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a> situation later tonight or tomorrow, but to be honest I'm still a bit fatigued from the Cretanpride fiasco. I haven't been paying close attention to the most combative pages on my watchlist, just because I don't really feel like I have the energy to get involved. That said, I'll see if I can be any help in resolving the situation.</p>
<p>I agree that RfCs rarely bring in more than one or two new voices, but perhaps those one or two voices will be helpful ones.

<dd>Hi Akhilleus. I just left a note for Aldux on this - I am concerned at the imposition of an arbitrary conceit on the AtG article. One of the fellows involved in this even seems to think he can reach consensus all by himself. I see the breach of Wikipedia principles going on as dangerous and not to be condoned, since it is likely to spread. Any thoughts? <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 16:16, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I notice that <a href="../../../a/l/e/Talk%7EAlexander_the_Great_2250.html" title="Talk:Alexander the Great">Talk:Alexander the Great</a> has more than a few WikiProject notices. I assume you've asked for support at <a href="../../../c/g/r/WP%7ECGR_c1b8.html" title="WP:CGR">WP:CGR</a>, but perhaps <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIOGRAPHY_cf6c.html" title="WP:BIOGRAPHY">WP:BIOGRAPHY</a> or one of the other WikiProjects who have inscribed their sigils on the talk page might have some helpful hints. (To be fair, you should probably ask at <a href="../../../h/o/g/WP%7EHOG_4b65.html" title="WP:HOG">WP:HOG</a> as well, even though I fear the inhabitants of <i>that</i> project might have less-than-objective views on the subject of Alexander...)</p>
<p>Other than that, I'm really not sure. Perhaps somewhere on the Village Pump — <a href="../../../v/p/a/WP%7EVPA_ddcb.html" title="WP:VPA">WP:VPA</a> or <a href="../../../v/p/m/WP%7EVPM_e604.html" title="WP:VPM">WP:VPM</a>? — might be useful.

<p>Just wanted to thank you for your dose of common sense on <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julian_the_Apostate_6427.html" title="Julian the Apostate">Julian the Apostate</a>. Panarjedde returned from his 12-hour block and promptly restored his version of the article, but I'm keeping my hands off for the time being because I don't want to participate in an edit/revert war. Geokerk, meanwhile, has levelled the accusation that you "censored" his comment. This is the first time that I've run into this sort of obstinacy in the face of actual scholarship, so I'm not completely sure how these sorts of things are handled. Do you have any experience with this sort of thing? <a href="../../../d/p/p/User%7EDppowell_6cfb.html" title="User:Dppowell">Dppowell</a> 13:03, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for your support on that edit. I don't think reason is likely to work here, though, and expect that Panarjedde will revert again when he returns from his latest block. Would it be appropriate to request comments from members the Wikipedia classics/antiquity project in order to establish how widespread the consensus is on this issue? Or is deploying exhaustive evidence on the article's Talk page the way to go? <a href="../../../d/p/p/User%7EDppowell_6cfb.html" title="User:Dppowell">Dppowell</a> 20:43, 23 October 2006 (UTC)
