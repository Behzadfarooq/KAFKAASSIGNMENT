<p>I'm trying out a conditional template <b>{{<a href="../../../s/o/c/Template%7ESocks_eac9.html" title="Template:Socks">socks</a>}}</b> as an add-on to <b>{{<a href="../../../s/s/p/Template%7ESsp_8316.html" title="Template:Ssp">ssp</a>}}</b>. See above, both types of socks lists, confirmed and suspected, show up as links only when those categories actually exist. Is this useful as an add-on to <b>{{<a href="../../../s/s/p/Template%7ESsp_8316.html" title="Template:Ssp">ssp</a>}}</b>, or would you rather keep the <b>{{<a href="../../../s/o/c/Template%7ESocks_eac9.html" title="Template:Socks">socks</a>}}</b> function entirely separate? -- <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenedict_the_Moor_1d60.html" title="User:Benedict the Moor">Ben</a> 05:44, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Okay, you can now use <b>{{<a href="../../../s/s/p/Template%7ESsp_8316.html" title="Template:Ssp">ssp</a>}}</b> and <b>{{<a href="../../../s/o/c/Template%7ESocks_eac9.html" title="Template:Socks">socks</a>}}</b> entirely separately, as you see above. On the occasion you want both, use <b>{{<a href="../../../s/s/p/Template%7ESsp_8316.html" title="Template:Ssp">ssp</a>|</b><i>Mykungfu</i><b>|list=y}}</b>, and you'll get <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Mykungfu_%285th%29_15a3.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Mykungfu (5th)">WP:SSP page on "Mykungfu"</a><sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_sockpuppets_of_Mykungfu_d979.html" title="Category:Wikipedia sockpuppets of Mykungfu"> confirmed&#160;socks</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../s/u/s/Category%7ESuspected_Wikipedia_sockpuppets_of_Mykungfu_e298.html" title="Category:Suspected Wikipedia sockpuppets of Mykungfu">suspected&#160;socks</a></sub> . Note that <b>{{<a href="../../../s/o/c/Template%7ESocks_eac9.html" title="Template:Socks">socks</a>}}</b> still doesn't show the user's name, and <b>each</b> link shows up only when the category actually exists; that is, each link disappears instead of turning red if there's no such category -- they won't even leave an empty space on the screen, so there's no waste. (The red links are disposed of in an environmentally safe fashion and in full compliance with all pertinent EPA regulations.) -- <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenedict_the_Moor_1d60.html" title="User:Benedict the Moor">Ben</a> 06:38, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. I was the person who initiated this report. I noticed that when you closed the discussion, User:Hahahihihoho, <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThunderman_291a.html" title="User:Thunderman">User:Thunderman</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHorde_Zla_c78d.html" title="User:Horde Zla">User:Horde Zla</a> are all indef blocked for being the disruptive troll, Hahahihihoho. But I also noticed that <a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkalada_a328.html" title="User:Alkalada">User:Alkalada</a> (who is a <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Hahahihihoho_13f3.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Hahahihihoho">100% proven sock of Hahahihihoho</a>) is not currently indef blocked as his sock. I think this is not the right decision; besides the fact that he is Hahahihihoho, <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">User:Fred Bauder</a> gave <a href="../../../a/l/k/User%7EAlkalada_a328.html" title="User:Alkalada">User:Alkalada</a> another chance and unblocked him. But then, two days after the unblock, he was blocked again - this time for one week, for incivility, personal attacks etc. After that block expired, Alkalada was blocked <i>yet again</i> - this time for one month (See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Alkalada" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Alkalada" rel="nofollow">his block log</a>). This latest block expired recently, and he has immediately jumped straight back into his POV editing, personal attacks and blind reverts. I believe this user will never learn from his blocks, and will never change his ways. I think it's only fair that he be indef blocked, just like all the other socks of User:Hahahihihoho. <font style="background:none" size="3">—<a href="../../../i/v/a/User%7EIvan_Kricancic_d72f.html" title="User:Ivan Kricancic"><font color="darkblue" face="Vivaldi">King</font></a><a href="../../../i/v/a/User_talk%7EIvan_Kricancic_1dc4.html" title="User talk:Ivan Kricancic"><font color="darkred" face="Times New Roman"><b>Ivan</b></font></a></font> 05:31, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>You said they were "dynamically assigned"...now does that mean they are assigned to just that person or to a group of people? (I use cable internet, so I am not sure about DSL) If they are assigned to just one person, can Verizon be notified when the next vandalism/attack occurs and the person be ID'd and then caught while online? If so, this would take care of the problem without having to block any IP addresses. - <a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOrangemonster2k1_ef23.html" title="User:Orangemonster2k1">SVRTVDude</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../o/r/a/User_talk%7EOrangemonster2k1_f61c.html" title="User talk:Orangemonster2k1">Yell</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Orangemonster2k1_ce79.html" title="Special:Contributions/Orangemonster2k1">Toil</a>)</sup> 23:45, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

I'd removed everything I thought might have caused a problem, including every transclusion other than "rfcu" (which has nested transclusions). No "basepagename" invocations; even the little "⋅" character is given as the HTML tag "&amp;sdot;", just in case that somehow affects something. The code works right on the talk page... but then so did the previous version. What happens when it's a template transcluded onto subpages which are themselves transcluded onto a main page? Since "lab testing" didn't guarantee field success last time, we can't trust this "lab testing" result either. I've fixed every potential problem I could think of, short of taking "rfcu" out altogether, but I'd like to have someone watching <a href="../../../s/s/p/WP%7ESSP_fb6b.html" title="WP:SSP">WP:SSP</a> for any problems, and trying out every link in one or two actual users' tags, when we try the new update -- so if it doesn't work in actual use, it can be reverted immediately. That's the best idea I've got; if you can think of anything else, please tell me.

<dd>Ben, the problem is a bit difficult to describe. As you know, the SSP cases each have their own subpage, which are transcluded onto the main SSP page. Basically, halfway down the list of active cases, the listing went bonkers. The specific locus was in <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Classicjupiter2_465c.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Classicjupiter2">Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Classicjupiter2</a>, in the line where <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProtector777_efed.html" title="User:Protector777">Protector777</a> (<span class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProtector777_3c09.html" title="User talk:Protector777">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Protector777_cd80.html" title="Special:Contributions/Protector777"><span title="Contributions: Protector777">contribs</span></a> • <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log/move?user=Protector777" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log/move?user=Protector777" rel="nofollow"><span title="Page moves: Protector777"><font color="#002BB8">page&#160;moves</font></span></a> • <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_Protector777_0aed.html" title="Special:Blockip/Protector777"><span title="Block User:Protector777">block&#160;user</span></a> • <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_block_4a41.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_block_4a41.html" rel="nofollow"><span title="Blocklog: Protector777"><font color="#002BB8">block&#160;log</font></span></a></span>) was listed--instead of what you see there, there was a messed-up line that included the word "separator" as a blue link, "page move" as a red link. The following users in the list simply appeared as user, and the comments to the case didn't appear; the rest of the cases in the list didn't transclude properly, but simply appeared as links, like <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_Adversegecko_0f23.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Adversegecko">Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/Adversegecko</a>.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The weird thing is, the case subpage for Classicjupiter2 displayed normally, and so did the rest of the cases. I don't get it. It might be some peculiarity of my local setup, I guess. But we can try to test it, and see if the anomaly happens again. I'll be available for a few hours tonight, and again tomorrow afternoon. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 04:39, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, my eyebrows went up at the fact that the problem started halfway down the page. If it was inherent to the template, or even to how the template behaved when transcluded on a subpage that was then transcluded onto a main page -- it should have happened <i>every single time it was used there</i>, not work fine in the top half and break down in the bottom half. So this is a major clue that the nature of the problem is something else.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It doesn't surprise me that the subpage itself looks fine: there you're looking at a transcluded template but not on a transcluded subpage; you're seeing the page directly.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My first thought was that maybe something about that line, in the Protector 777 entry or just above it, had some odd character, extra {'s or whatever, that Wiki-parsing misinterpreted, sort of the way omitting or adding an apostrophe in the double-apostrophe italics tag early in a paragraph can screw up your italic or boldface formatting for the rest of the paragraph. So I went and looked closely at that area of that subpage... and found nothing even vaguely likely to have such a result. <i>(Drat!)</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My second thought, and my current working hypothesis, is this:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Transclusion creates a certain amount of overhead for the system. Not much for each transclusion, but it adds up. This is one of the reasons templates are no longer allowed in the signature or "nickname" of our account preferences. (Not the only reason; it would be too easy to change a signature all over Wikipedia by altering the template, both "changing history" and creating a sudden huge transclusion workload as all the signed occurences were changed.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, first of all <a href="../../../s/s/p/WP%7ESSP_fb6b.html" title="WP:SSP">WP:SSP</a>'s main page has a <b>huge</b> number of "user5" templates, due to all its transcluded subpages (compared to relatively few on each individual subpage). And secondly, the last update incorporated a bunch of subtemplate transclusions to "user5"... so, multiplied all together, it took the system a while to process all the changes. Apparently it had only gotten halfway down <a href="../../../s/s/p/WP%7ESSP_fb6b.html" title="WP:SSP">WP:SSP</a>, and after that the changes weren't fully processed.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I wonder whether everything would have looked normal had you seen the page five minutes later, due to the system catching up... or whether it would have stayed stuck like that, due to some limit on how many transclusions per page will be processed at all. But I don't wonder <u>enough</u> to want to go back and try it again just to find out.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One of my major changes from the last attempt was to eliminate as many transclusions as I could. Except for "rfcu" (which subcontracts its work to subtemplates), all the subtemplates -- including the separator dot, {{<a href="../../../%C2%B7/_/_/Template%7E%C2%B7.html" title="Template:·">·</a>}} -- have been replaced by hardcodes, reducing the workload immensely. That may be all the solution that we need. I hope so, and it would make sense given what you saw on the page. -- <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_7cee.html" title="User:Ben">Ben</a> 05:28, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ben, your explanation makes sense, although I did reload the page a couple of times before I posted the request to revert. I wonder if in the future SSP cases should subst the {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUser5_a4e5.html" title="Template:User5">user5</a>}} templates. The main page takes a long time to load sometimes.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Probably a good idea. It would vastly reduce the transclusion workload. <s>One side-effect would be the "rfcu" link would not update on any existing entry if a checkuser were later opened on that user, so you might miss seeing some relevant info from after the subpage's creation... but if your users are aware of that, and treat the absence of the link as "there was no rfcu report <b>then</b>" rather than "there is no rfcu report <b>now</b>", they can always check for new entries with a new rfcu request, even in preview mode and not saved.&lt;/s? -- <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_7cee.html" title="User:Ben">Ben</a> 05:54, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</s></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><s>... <s>or I could drop the whole idea of rfcu being a "disappearing" link in user5 (take out the "cond=n" parameter), and just let it stay a redlink when there's no rfcu page. But this was why Ryulong reverted the change to user5 before, he found that "ugly", and the "disappearing" feature was the condition he demanded to allow the update back in. His other suggestion was the WP:SSP use a new template with rfcu in it, and leave user5 alone. So you may want to think that one over.</s> -- <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_7cee.html" title="User:Ben">Ben</a> 06:14, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</s></dd>

<dl>
<dd>

<dd>I have decided to just try and put in the new {{<a href="../../../u/s/e/Template%7EUser5_a4e5.html" title="Template:User5">user5</a>}} code.

<p>Akhilleus, the GOOD news is that WP:SSP does not appear to have been hosed up. In fact, please tell me if it is any slower-loading than before, or the reverse. And the <i><u>other</u></i> GOOD news is that <b>{{subst:user5|Mykungfu}}</b> does <i><u>not</u></i> lose the auto-updating feature of "rfcu"; that <i><u>will</u></i> continue to show new pages created after the subst'ing.

<dd>I'm not getting that result now, and (from resolving the code by subst'ing) I don't see anything that could have caused it. The template hasn't changed... could someone have been working on the blockuser page itself, to change how a username gets parsed?

<p>Aha, there never was a problem with Firstocean's entry, which is why checking <u>that</u> block log never found one. The problem was solely with Prolancet's entry, and we could both have stared at our screens forever without seeing it... because it wasn't there to be seen.<br /></p>
<center><i>Last night I met upon the stair<br />
A little man who wasn't there.<br />
He wasn't there again today;<br />
I wish, I wish he'd go away!</i></center>
<p>The difference between the first and second times Prolancet's name was typed was that on the first try an <b>invisible character</b> was put after the final T and before the first closing bracket.</p>
<p>Here's a cut-and-paste of that segment → Prolancet‎}</p>
<p>Go into edit mode, put your cursor just after the bracket, and backspace/delete (NOT left-arrow): first stroke, you delete the bracket; second stroke, <u>nothing seems to happen</u>; third stroke, you delete the final T. That second stroke deleted the invisible character.</p>
<p>I would guess that, in trying to type the first closing bracket, some almost-correct key combination like control or alt or fn, plus ] or }, got entered, resulting in no wrong visible character, no visible character at all. Anyone would naturally shrug and go on to type both closing brackets correctly. Everything else parsed the username without a problem, but block-log could not....</p>
<p>It's the "intermittent" problem that's the real headache, isn't it, like the car that squeaks <u>except when</u> the mechanic is there. At this point taking a sledgehammer to the car is generally a great stress-reliever, though perhaps a bit more expensive in the long term than two pints of Guinness at the local pub while grousing to the publican and your fellow drinkers. <span title="Formerly ''Benedict the Moor''">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_7cee.html" title="User:Ben"><i><b>Ben</b></i></a> <small><sup><a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_22f7.html" title="User talk:Ben"><b>TALK</b></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ben_81a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ben"><b>HIST</b></a></sub></small></span> 01:44, 9 March 2007 (UTC) <span id="63298966092"></span></p>

<dd>Ben, thanks for your work on this. I'm in favor of implementing it, obviously; the only question is whether we should wait for comments. On the other hand, it seems like few people watch the SSP page, so we could reasonably claim that we two form a consensus... <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 22:45, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Alright, way to be bold! Thing is, the instructions are still complicated, because of the unfortunate decision someone made at the beginning of SSP to have separate pages (2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc.) for each case on a particular user. Using the {{<a href="../../../s/s/p/Template%7ESsp_8316.html" title="Template:Ssp">ssp</a>}} template to discover previous cases is clever, but it will be beyond the capability of some users. Is there any way to have the inputbox run a script to see if a case has already been filed on a sockmaster? Or, the other thing to do is to steal another idea from RCU and have each sockmaster get a single case page, no matter how many times they're reported. Looking at the subpages of SSP (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3APrefixindex&amp;from=Suspected+sock+puppets%2F&amp;namespace=4" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3APrefixindex&amp;from=Suspected+sock+puppets%2F&amp;namespace=4" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) shows a pretty healthy number of sockmasters w/multiple cases, and there's always the danger that one of them (like Mykungfu) might get a new case filed, and then you'd have 5 Mykungfu cases, with new information getting added to the 1st case. I'm not sure how to solve this problem, but I wanted the reporting system to be as simple, and elegant, as the one at RCU, and unfortunately it isn't. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 15:48, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Gahhh, what a long link to encode! Try <a href="../../../p/r/e/Special%7EPrefixindex_Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets__51f1.html" title="Special:Prefixindex/Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/">Special:Prefixindex/Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/</a> next time! I've just added [[Special:Prefixindex/{{FULLPAGENAME}}/|subpages]] to the "Closed archives" box on <a href="../../../s/s/p/WP%7ESSP_fb6b.html" title="WP:SSP">WP:SSP</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I completely agree with you about the complexity of the case-filing system. I use the same simple-minded search engine, {{<a href="../../../h/i/g/Template%7EHighrfc-loop_e038.html" title="Template:Highrfc-loop">highrfc-loop</a>}}, to search for RfAs, RfBs, RfArbs, RfC/Users, and SSPs, and it has to take account of not only the "_(2nd)" style of suffixes but also "_(2)", "_2", and "-2", because the different areas use different subpage-numbering formats, and sometimes more than one. I even thought about coding for Roman numerals, because some people have used those, but then I remembered actual usernames like "Giano II", and my brain began to hurt from trying to distinguish between "the second case involving 'Giano'" and "the first case involving 'Giano II'". It's bad enough that usernames might also end with "_2" or "-2", as it is.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, it would be much easier all around to keep one file per username and just add to it over time, the way <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCU_026f.html" title="WP:RFCU">WP:RFCU</a> does. Cross-indexing sockpuppet names would also be a wonderful feature to add, because right now it's not easy to find out whether someone's been investigated as a sockpuppet (rather than a puppetmaster) since the filenames don't cover puppets. You just have to hope the userpage got tagged at some point in its history.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The solution would be to adopt an RFCU-like system -- which would even allow cross-referring the cases between SSP and RFCU, as long as the two areas chose the same username to title the report on a group of IDs.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, first step: propose the change. Second step: get it approved. Third step: revise the new-case creation system to match RFCU's, wherein a little outright theft of code seems appropriate. Fourth step, and here's the heartbreaker: go through all the existing files, and consolidate the multiples.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For investigation: Will we have to make any other changes in file format (once they're all singles) to let RFCU's system work for SSP?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My lovable and cuddlesome and bright little {{<a href="../../../s/s/p/Template%7ESsp_8316.html" title="Template:Ssp">ssp</a>}}, whom you'd take home to meet your mother, will handle either system, without changing any code. The system change would make things simpler, not harder, for templates as well as for human beings. {{<a href="../../../r/f/c/Template%7ERfcu_707f.html" title="Template:Rfcu">rfcu</a>}} is simpler than {{<a href="../../../s/s/p/Template%7ESsp_8316.html" title="Template:Ssp">ssp</a>}}, though I think earnestness of character counts for something too.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now, just one more question, to make your brain hurt too: who gets to go revise all those {{<a href="../../../s/o/c/Template%7ESocksuspect_fb39.html" title="Template:Socksuspect">socksuspect</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../s/o/c/Template%7ESocksuspectnotice_9e3a.html" title="Template:Socksuspectnotice">socksuspectnotice</a>}} templates that are currently linking to (2nd), (3rd), (4th), etc., cases, and redirect them to the new single files? (Since they've been subst'd, we can't just change the template code and have the posted copies all snap into shape.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I'm in favor, but we'd all better realize that the changeover will take hard work, and time. We'll need to build the new version of <a href="../../../s/s/p/WP%7ESSP_fb6b.html" title="WP:SSP">WP:SSP</a> on a secondary page, copy over all the subpages too, make the changes to the copies, keep "mirroring" the updates to the main SSP, and test the new system thoroughly, so that on The Day we can just rename the main page to old, rename the new page to main (and thus with all the subpages -- we'll need to automate this step to make it happen <b>fast</b>), and there everything will be neatly in place to go on with. When we're sure it's solid, and nothing's missing, <b>then</b> delete the old versions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think this will take more than the two of us.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I, for one, don't have the system authorizations to do the moves and copies and deletes, or the skills (yet) to write the bots/scripts. At the speed I work, and the number of hours per day I can invest, I don't know how long it would take me alone just to consolidate multiples into singles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The archives, oh my goodness, they're organized by month of case-closing, so the same-username cases aren't even filed together... and who the heck would know (or care) <b>when</b> an old case was closed, if all they've got is a suspect username, and all they're trying to find out is whether User:JohnDoe is a sockpuppet or sockpuppeteer? Where the heck is an index of cases by <b>username</b>, covering both puppetmasters and puppets? Thank goodness for the userpage histories, if people remembered to use appropriate edit summaries (did they?) at least the taggings should show up -- but if the evidence wasn't conclusive enough on earlier reports, there won't be anything shown on the block logs.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yechh. I hope you're well-and-truly daunted by the prospect. I sure am. We need the advice of some seriously skilled and experienced gurus here. They may know ways to make this a much simpler conversion. For one thing, let's ask the people who set up RFCU for advice. It would be in their best interests, because the better SSP works, the less workload overflows into RFCU. -- <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_7cee.html" title="User:Ben"><span title="Formerly ''Benedict the Moor''"><i><b>Ben</b></i></span></a> <small><sup><a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_22f7.html" title="User talk:Ben"><b>TALK</b></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ben_81a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ben"><b>HIST</b></a></sub></small> 21:59, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I didn't answer this before: <i>"Is there any way to have the inputbox run a script to see if a case has already been filed on a sockmaster?"</i> I didn't see that option in the documentation, and have never seen the underlying code -- I assume it involves Javascript, but I don't really know even whether that's all it's written in. It would be a nice feature to suggest to the author, but I suspect the answer will be: "If you enter a pre-existing file name and click the button, you'll find the pre-existing file in front of you instead of the preload (unfilled-out form), and the editintro header <u>won't</u> be at the top of the page.

<p>Ben, I think you've demonstrated that the SSP filing system won't change soon. To merge all the Mykungfu cases, just as one example, would require merging page histories--the kind of thing that has to be done manually by an admin. And there are at least 55 suspected sockmasters that have multiple SSP cases. In contrast, changing the links in the subst'd {{<a href="../../../s/o/c/Template%7ESocksuspect_fb39.html" title="Template:Socksuspect">socksuspect</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../s/o/c/Template%7ESocksuspect_fb39.html" title="Template:Socksuspect">socksuspect</a>}} notice cases wouldn't be that difficult--as long as you know how to code a bot. I don't.</p>
<p>As a stopgap, though, one of the other kinds of inputbox is a search box. Maybe we could put one on the SSP page, so one of the steps in filing a case would be a search for "Special:Prefixindex/Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets/PUPPETMASTER". Try this:</p>

<p>Put "Mykungfu" in there, and you find his cases; put "Akhilleus" in there, and you find that so far, I'm clean...</p>

<dd>Thanks for the advice. As for the other three that were blocked, there is no connection between and those users. Once again, this is just another tactic by this particular interest group to be used against me. They saw that they were losing in this vote to keep a particular Category, so they went on a witch hunt to try to disqualify people. Thanks anyways for your help. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki_Raja_d537.html" title="User:Wiki Raja">Wiki Raja</a> 01:58, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Page moves actually never show up on people's watchlists, which is something I've never quite understood. Maybe you could leave a note on Cretanforever's talk page.

<p>I really appreciate your attention to this article. I'm well aware that no one really wants to be involved with another article where one's efforts there seem to require a perverse amount of effort in order to stick. I wonder if you might have a wise word, or any practical information, that can help me deal with the conflict I've found there with Doug Coldwell. His edits seem in good faith, in the sense that I think he regards his contributions as factual. But, as his interests grow to embrace more and more out-of-the-way topics in late antiquity, etc., I am plagued by a vision of crackpot irrelevancies (or worse) being added all over. What's the best thing to do in one's normal capacity as an editor? Are there any Wiki-procedures appropriate to such a situation? (I imagine it's not what is called vandalism, but on the other hand, I'm sure the community has had to deal with active editors with strange convictions before.) I know you may not know better than I, but I thought it couldn't help to check with someone I know values the quality of Wikipedia's coverage of the ancient world. I just saw your note on my talk page after writing this, so I know you're friendly too. Anyway, I don't know if even our augmented numbers over there are enough, so I'd appreciate any brainstorms. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWareh_c537.html" title="User:Wareh">Wareh</a> 00:37, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you for atleast contacting me and taking the time to discuss the issue. Look there are so many differences between the two, i'll list below if you like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Atheltic Trainers require a university degree for the title, whereas sports trainers only require a sports trainers accreditation.</li>
<li>Athletic Trainers are allied health care professionals, sports trainers are certified medical officers.</li>
<li>The roles do differ slightly, as the Athletic trainer has more medical knowledge and can provide more intensive care than a sports trainer.</li>
<li>Athletic trainers are used in america whereas sports trainers are used in australia/new zealand and i honestly can't see how it is such a big issue to have separate articles.</li>
<li>As above, no australian or zew zealander would know what an atheltic trainer is, so a sports trainer article would better assist them, and for their sake i don't think it is such a big issue to have separate articles when wikipedia has articles on fictional characters a sports trainer article should not be too much fuss.</li>
<li>Athletic trainers (as said on the page) are used mainly in schools, hospitals, clinics and some sports, whereas sports trainers are not used at all in schools, hospitals or clinics, there sole responsibility is in sports.</li>
<li>It is acceptable to call a sports trainer a 'trainer' it is not acceptable to call an athletic trainer a 'trainer'</li>
<li>The AMA does not recognise sports trainers as health care providers, it does recognise athletic trainers.</li>
<li>The salary and employment oppurtunites - Sports trainers salary is very little, in fact most sports trainer work is voluntary and is part time. Athletic trainers earn 25,000+ per year and employment is full time.</li>
<li>Once again with training, to become a athletic trainer one must hold a bachelors degree, a sports trainers accreditation can be obtained without any other formal qualification (expect first aid ceritifcate).</li>
<li>the history of the two occupations is so different.</li>
</ul>
<p>And i truely could go on if i need to. As you can see there is a number of problems with having the same article for both, and so many differences between them, Simply having a separate article which has already been created could solve all of the problems. It's the logical thing to do.</p>
<p>Do you now agree and see the need for separation? (<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradles_01_1eb7.html" title="User:Bradles 01">Bradleigh</a> 03:37, 18 March 2007 (UTC))</p>
