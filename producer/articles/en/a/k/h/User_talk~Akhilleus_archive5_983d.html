<p>If you thinks the Greeks would not have understood the concept of child corruption, you must not have had a look at Plato's Phaedrus. Check 241c,d. Socrates himslef recognizes that a bad lover can ruin not just the body of a boy, but his mind and spirit. And what difference do you see in pedo-philia and ped-erasty? They refer to the same business - "love" of boys, making boys into "lovers" respectively. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrenda_maverick_b15e.html" title="User:Brenda maverick">Brenda maverick</a> 15:09, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Mr. Achilles - I am very familiar with the literature, but I confess to spending way more time studying the original material (with some knowledge of Greek) rather than reading the critics. (I have read Dover's book more than once.) I believe etymologies are helpful, actually, especially if you study the original contexts of the words without prejudice. The passage in the Phaedrus to which I directed you is a case in point. Socrates himself admits here ( and elsewhere) that having an old lover is not "necessarily " a blessing for the youngster. Europe fell into a funk for 2,000 years partly on account of the denial of observation of evidence, and worship of authority. I do not seee myself doing what you disparage as "original research" so much as pointing out what is actually IN these texts - so that we can see what is there, and quit finding stuff that is not there. I do think these discussions are useful, by the by. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrenda_maverick_b15e.html" title="User:Brenda maverick">Brenda maverick</a> 16:28, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I still do not see how looking at the evidence in the text constitutes "original research". As for this particular point about corruption of the young: in this speech, Socrates goes on and on about the miseries of the boy in the arms of an old ugly drunk, and the grief that comes to him from the old man's faithlessness, irritability, and jealousy. He says the old man has no goodwill towards the boy but is just satisfying his appetites (as the wolf "loves" - "agape" his food). Its after this that Socrates says that a boy in this situation is injured ("blaptw") in property, body and mind. So for you to say that the Greeks "did not/would not have understood the concept of child corruption" cannot possibly be right. Besides this, they were human beings, and very advanced people at that, so it is absurd from that point of view. Clearly, Socrates and his cronies were good with sex with boys, but so are some elements of our own culture - congress and the catholic church for examples. There is no monolith of opinion even today on the matter, and doubtless there was not then, either. So this business about concensus (for which you are praised on this talk page) inevitably misrepresents reality, then and now. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrenda_maverick_b15e.html" title="User:Brenda maverick">Brenda maverick</a> (<a href="../../../b/r/e/User_talk%7EBrenda_maverick_5f48.html" title="User talk:Brenda maverick">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brenda_maverick_4f33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brenda maverick">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>All we were talking about was your remark - that the idea of child corruption was entirely foreign to the Greeks. I haven't been interpreting the Phaedrus anywhere in my articles, just trying to make the point that your rationale for deleting my sentence does not hold up. i did read the article on POV (and the other one) and I am trying to conform to it without doing violence to the material. And I read somewhere that "Achilles" mean "the people's grief" - but this is not certain. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrenda_maverick_b15e.html" title="User:Brenda maverick">Brenda maverick</a> (<a href="../../../b/r/e/User_talk%7EBrenda_maverick_5f48.html" title="User talk:Brenda maverick">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brenda_maverick_4f33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brenda maverick">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>Mr. Achilles, Fine to leave it out, but not for the reason you give, that the idea of child sexual abuse (as we term it today) was foreign to the Greeks. Even if you don't think Socrates was guilty of it (and I personally think the historial facts concerning the life of Socrates are not only irrecoverable but also irrelevant to understanding Plato), the important thing is that Socrates himself explicitly discusses the problem. Do you deny even this? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrenda_maverick_b15e.html" title="User:Brenda maverick">Brenda maverick</a> (<a href="../../../b/r/e/User_talk%7EBrenda_maverick_5f48.html" title="User talk:Brenda maverick">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brenda_maverick_4f33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brenda maverick">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>In the Charmides, Socrates gets excited at the sight of the inwards of a child's cloak and quizzes him about sophrosne (self-control). Charmides is in the company of his "epitrophos" - a surrogate parent, caretaker (we'd say "childsitter"). In the Lysis, the boys' guardians come to walk them home after they have been playing knucklebones. Do fourteen year old boys need to be walked home? In fact, plato carefully avoids giving exact ages. Why? Because it is a grey area and a matter of judgment, and the distinction between taking advantage of a kid and having a legitimate relationship is hard to codify. Why are you so sure Plato was not at least raising an eyebrow? Why does he have Socrates trash talk man-boy love, and then feel like he needs to beg the forgiveness of Eros? Why does he even raise the spectre of abuse? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrenda_maverick_b15e.html" title="User:Brenda maverick">Brenda maverick</a> (<a href="../../../b/r/e/User_talk%7EBrenda_maverick_5f48.html" title="User talk:Brenda maverick">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brenda_maverick_4f33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brenda maverick">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>I suspect that Skinner's argument is circular - young men must have been under the control of a male guardian until the age of 18 BECAUSE Socrates would not have been hitting on anyone under the age of 18. What is Skinner's independent evidence that Charmides (or the boys in Lysis - Menexenus and Hippothales) was 18 and not 11 or 12? I really try NOT to speculate, but boys who need to be walked home from school must be pretty young, too young to be making decisions about which old men are appropriate sex partners. But don't mistake me - I am just saying that Plato is full of innuendo. You can't be sure beyond a doubt of how to interpret him. But to take him at face value is to neglect his own warning- that "children" cannot find hidden meanings in literature, that books fall into the wrong hands. Why does Plato express so much anxiety about the misinterpretation of literature?</p>
<p>And this reminds me of what protagoras says to socrates, that it is not surprising that most people think virtue IS something that can be transmitted from adults (parents and teachers) to their children. he says what would be surprising would be if it were NOT teachable. I would say the same thing about this pederasty of pedophila (which you find different but I do not - the french use the first term, we use the second) business. What would be surprising is if there were NO men taking advantage of children. Civilized people worry about such things, as Plato appears to. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrenda_maverick_b15e.html" title="User:Brenda maverick">Brenda maverick</a> (<a href="../../../b/r/e/User_talk%7EBrenda_maverick_5f48.html" title="User talk:Brenda maverick">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brenda_maverick_4f33.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brenda maverick">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Thank you, Mr. Achilles. That little business was entirely confusing to me. There was some meddling that I could not sort out, but I am not as tech savvy as many of you guys. For the record here, I do think we have more in common than not. (So many people, unfortunately, could not care less about Plato.) So it would be a shame to let our relatively small differences sabotage the cause. A little conflict keeps things alive, but the last thing on my mind is to ruin anything. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrenda_maverick_b15e.html" title="User:Brenda maverick">Brenda maverick</a> 00:06, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>How can you say that the Theaetetus is PLATO'S theory of knowledge? Isn't this like saying that Hamlet speaks Shakespeare's "theory" of the uselessness of living? What's the difference? Seems like sloppy thinking to paste the writer and his character together as if there were no difference between them.

<p>I do not doubt for one instant that Plato wrote the dialog. It bears all the marks of his brilliance. All I am saying is that Plato playfully disavows it (he writes here like Soren kierkegaard, under a kind of "pseudonymity"). My only point is that we ignore Plato's details at our peril.

<p>I think it will be better if it is written, so if it is not others mk will do the same (puting the name infront of). Let it be please in the first paragraph with others names, i don't see any wrong. He has got also today's MK territory is it is right if it is written in that lang. By this way we can stop further vandalism and discussions about it. It was another user before me to put the translation and then me, and if not me it will be others by me and the story will last forever. So that way i think the discussion will end.</p>

<p>message 2: Akhilleus, I agree that it would be a good idea to archive some of the closed discussions, but the thing is that the chapter 'Naming, About Paganism, the Poll for the Requested Move of the page, Page Name is POV, NPOV is one of .......' are related to one another and are part of a perpetuum discussion. Everything else can be archived. I think especially the poll is vital for the context of this ongoing discussion. So please keep those related chapters.

<p>Akhilleus, I know the poll is 6 months old, but it is related to the posts from 17/18 februari.

<p>Nearly all secondary sources which form the basis of the articles we have use Peisistratus, which is a latinized half-measure in my view (I would prefer the -atos). In looking through the "what links here" it's all over the map; I've done most of the dabbing now, I'll probably finish after lunch, but haven't elected to really change the text of the various articles. Someone else is certainly free to do that and to move all the Peisistratae (or -ai) to Pis- names, but I have been working off the existing article's spelling but have -os'ed the tyrant. Has anyone done a Google scholar search to see what scholars choose? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 21:16, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I looked at <a href="../../../g/r/e/WP%7EGREEK_b3eb.html" title="WP:GREEK">WP:GREEK</a>, which is of no help (the vowel cluster here – ει – is to be transcribed "variable: to be discussed". In any event, the whole gist of <a href="../../../g/r/e/WP%7EGREEK_b3eb.html" title="WP:GREEK">WP:GREEK</a> is to avoid later, Latinized forms, here that would certainly include the "Pis-" spellings. In any event, <a href="../../../g/r/e/WP%7EGREEK_b3eb.html" title="WP:GREEK">WP:GREEK</a> has the big ole caveat (sorry for the Latin) that common sense prevails. So I tried to divine a "common sense" among the the ways various wikipedians have been using the name(s). Alas, there may be "sense" but little commonality; indeed I came across a couple of articles that used 2 different spellings of the same guy's name. So given that wikipedians' sense has no commonality, I turned to my trusty sources for the articles, which by and large are 19th century - hence public domain - scholarly British authors, who are fond of the Latin "-us" over "-os" but reject the "i" for "ει", even prefering "Alexandreia" over "Alexandria", the later being nearly exclusive usage in Latin authors writing in Latin, the former holding closer to the Greek original. So, I've made a judgment; others may differ, but there is no <i>absolute</i> policy one way or another; if you want to change all the "Peis" to "Pis" go right ahead; WP is free for all to edit. I think I may still do a google scholar search to if modern researchers in English have found common ground on a single spelling. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 21:54, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>For what it's worth, Google scholar shows:</p>
<p>Peisistratus <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Peisistratus" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Peisistratus" rel="nofollow">590 hits</a> Peisistratos <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Peisistratos" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Peisistratos" rel="nofollow">598 hits</a> Pisistratos <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Pisistratos" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Pisistratos" rel="nofollow">21 hits</a> Pisistratus <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Pisistratus&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Pisistratus&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=" rel="nofollow">783 hits</a></p>
<p>So while Pisistratus gets a plurality, it's not by much and it's no majority. What we have is 1107 ghits for Peis- forms, and 805 ghits for Pis- forms, with 1292 for forms in -us versus 619 in -os. What does this all mean? It means that one can go ahead and spell it like the pros, who spell it nearly any which way. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 22:14, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Akhilleus, to answer your last question, my opinion is that Classicjupiter2 is essentially a spammer who wishes to use wikipedia to promote himself. He has spent the past few years "getting close" with the <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrealism.html" title="Surrealism">Surrealism</a> article just so that he appears like a "resident expert" on the subject. In his position, he has pushed his personal <a href="http://www.surrealismnow.com" class="external free" title="http://www.surrealismnow.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.surrealismnow.com</a> link forward while at the same time discouraging others who challenge him.</p>
<p>Some of us, such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEvilPanda_f819.html" title="User:TheEvilPanda">user:TheEvilPanda</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C. Boyer">user:Daniel_C._Boyer</a> and myself, know him outside of wikipedia as Keith Wigdor, someone who has been rejected by the int'l surrealist movement as being an art opportunist who is interested more in his art career rather than anything else associated with surrealism, in the philosophical, activist, political meanings. For at least 5 years, Keith Wigdor has had a vendetta against various surrealists who have rejected him, and this has spilled into the wikipedia domain.</p>
<p>So to make a long story short, yes he is a spammer who's out to promote his own self-interest, but he also gets a thrill from disrupting others who are genuinely interested in the surrealist movement. Hence his attempts to block the discussion of the current, contemporary surrealist groups (such as the Chicago group) who just so happen to want to have nothing to do with him.</p>
<p>As you have seen, he has access to several IPs. If you block one of those, then he'll just find another one to use, like he has been doing for the past 2+ of his years on wikipedia. In light of this, what do you suggest?--<a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETextureSavant_0c61.html" title="User:TextureSavant">TextureSavant</a> 18:42, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Hopefully after the AMA going through, then maybe ArbCom will be the next step (assuming the sockpuppets keep appearing, which I suspect they will)?--<a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETextureSavant_0c61.html" title="User:TextureSavant">TextureSavant</a> 17:17, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Sparkit, did you know you've been listed as a party to this case?</p>

<p>I'm listed too, but I haven't been involved in this situation other than a few comments recently. Do you understand what's happening on the Surrealism page? <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 16:30, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Akhilleus! I did know I was named in that, but I don't know what being a party in such a case means, or what participation is expected or available to me. I do understand what's happening on the Surrealism page.

<dd>Sparkit, I don't understand what's happening on the Surrealism page--by which I mean, there seems to be a long-running dispute here, but I don't really understand what it's about, or what the various parties actually want. It doesn't seem to be just about adding a link to an external website...anyway, if you understand what's happening, could you explain it to me? Thanks. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 18:10, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, I did misunderstand. I'll compose a brief recap of my understanding of the conflicts. Hopefully by this evening. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparkit_6e56.html" title="User:Sparkit"><small>[&gt;&gt;</small>sparkit<small>|</small></a><a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESparkit_d651.html" title="User talk:Sparkit">TALK&lt;&lt;]</a> 18:16, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My read on the conflicts on Surrealism related pages centers on several core questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is "real" Surrealism? To <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andre_Breton_0241.html" title="Andre Breton">Andre Breton</a> and the original surrealists, surrealism was a change in thought processes, priorities and the like in an effort to revolutionize society. There's a political aspect to what at first blush is a visual arts or literature movement. It's my understanding that the original movement wasn't about creating works, but changing society and the works were a side effect, an artefact. Thus, part of what we're dealing with here is the differences in the definition of the term "surrealism" – originally surrealism was a process (and still is to many people) not the product, but the product has become known as surrealism. That's why there's a phrase in the article, " In more mundane terms, the word "surreal" is often used colloquially to describe unexpected juxtapositions or use of non-sequiturs in art or dialogue."</li>
<li>Closely parallel to "what is 'real' surrealism" contentions is who is or isn't a "real" surrealist. Some contend that surrealists are only those who adhere to the original tenets. To confuse the matter, much <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visionary_art.html" title="Visionary art">visionary art</a> and the like looks very similar to the work of the original surrealists, and thus the visionary art is called surrealism. There's some clamoring of individuals and groups to be recognized as surrealists.</li>
<li>What's happened with Surrealism since Breton's death? Some say the movement died with him. Yet other groups, besides the original Paris-based group have formed.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, inclusion of links, mention of various individuals, works and the like, IMO, are reflections of the contentions above. Disruptive tactics and ad hominem arguments make it difficult to sort out the problems.</p>
<p>I hope this helps. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparkit_6e56.html" title="User:Sparkit"><small>[&gt;&gt;</small>sparkit<small>|</small></a><a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESparkit_d651.html" title="User talk:Sparkit">TALK&lt;&lt;]</a> 19:17, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Sparkit, thanks, that's very helpful. But this isn't an abstract thing for some of these editors, right? Some of them believe that they are real surrealists and that other editors aren't real surrealists. And in the process, it seems like what the article says about surrealism has strayed from a conventional art historical understanding of surrealism. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 23:02, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As far as I can tell, it is very real to the participants.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The main article (<a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrealism.html" title="Surrealism">Surrealism</a>) as it stands now basically just covers the philosophy/thought aspect. At one time it contained the history and art aspects, too. But in Oct. 2006 HappyCamper branched the history section (<a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_surrealism.html" title="History of surrealism">History of surrealism</a>) into a separate article and Surreal-one broke the art part (<a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrealism_in_the_arts.html" title="Surrealism in the arts">Surrealism in the arts</a>) into another article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>After having left the scene for a number of months, and coming back and finding that an art article had been created, but material duplicated in the main article, I deleted the art stuff from the main article as a way to avoid maintaining the info on both pages.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I've been hoping that once the smoke clears we can join the main, history and art articles back into one. Then proceed to present the info in NPOV fashion by presenting the multiple sides of the story. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparkit_6e56.html" title="User:Sparkit"><small>[&gt;&gt;</small>sparkit<small>|</small></a><a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESparkit_d651.html" title="User talk:Sparkit">TALK&lt;&lt;]</a> 01:25, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As per <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Hillock65&amp;diff=111124094&amp;oldid=111122233" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Hillock65&amp;diff=111124094&amp;oldid=111122233" rel="nofollow">this</a>, please be advised that I observed both the user (Hillock) and the suspected sock account (Chuprynka) and they had very little in common. Hillock is a fierce POV-pusher but there were no evidence of Socking. Chuprynka was rather a reasonable editor. The sockpuppetry report was filed by a user who is a confirmed sock himself. Betacommand is not exactly known for thoroughly investigating before blocking (rather to the contrary) and if he took time to investigate this frivolous complaint, he would have seen that these users had little in common and that the request was filed by a confirmed (now banned) sock. Betacommand has no checkuser either. Anyway, the block of these accounts is not my concern since the users have left anyway and should any of them comes back, they will request the unblock. However, I reverted the false and unsupported accusation of socking and if you are to restore it, please make sure it is backed by some more solid evidence than just by "Betacommand said so".

<p>Thanks for pointing out my error, in my haste to stop the vandal who was doing damage faster than I could correct it, I wanted to get the report in ASAP and neglected to read the directions as their length was overwhelming in the face of continued damage.
