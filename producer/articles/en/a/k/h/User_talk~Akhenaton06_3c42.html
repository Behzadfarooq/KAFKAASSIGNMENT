<p>I'm glad to see your work on several South Carolina page, but please note that it is rather rude to replace images, unless there is a compellingly good reason to do so. In my years here, I uploaded a good many images, but I've only replaced someone else's work a couple times (because of very poor quality of the original), and it was with apologies to the originator. If you have a good image, there is quite likely a place for it, without bumping someone else's. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPollinator_822e.html" title="User:Pollinator">Pollinator</a> 06:30, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>thanks for your help on this article. The mediator has requested that all edits go thru him, so be careful about making changes, otherwise they may block you, but hopefully bobbydoop will be blcoked because he knew of the request. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> 13:21, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey Akhenaton06! I recently nominated <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Virginia_4016.html" title="West Virginia">West Virginia's main article</a> to be a candidate for <a href="../../../u/s/c/WP%7EUSCOTW_9176.html" title="WP:USCOTW">US Collaboration of the Week</a> since it is in need of major attention and reorganization. I felt that by making the West Virginia article a US Collaboration of the Week, it would be brought up to par with those of other <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._states_2158.html" title="U.S. states">U.S. states</a>.

<p>Thanks for uploading <b><a href="../../../t/i/n/Image%7ETingley.jpg_3ebc.html" title="Image:Tingley.jpg">Image:Tingley.jpg</a></b>. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is therefore unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then you need to argue that we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then you can use {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, please read <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>. See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a> for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other media, please check that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the "<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Akhenaton06_5aba.html" title="Special:Contributions/Akhenaton06">my contributions</a>" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting "Image" from the dropdown box. Note that any unsourced and untagged images will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#Images.2FMedia" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">criteria for speedy deletion</a>.

<p>The link you provide as the picture's source should confirm that a Creative Commons license has been announced by the picture's author. It doesn't presently. Lacking that confirmation, nobody has any way of knowing that you're not a thief, stealing somebody else's pictures and claiming them as your own. The way to avoid that suspicion is to make sure that when you tag a picture with a Creative Commons license, you provide an immediately verifiable confiramtion (via a link) to an announcement that the picture's author has published his or her work under that license.
