As they said "Damala Bouga Time" does actually mean "I Wanna F*** You". He was probably jst translating it for the interviewer! Puru Nacka Lu Lu Lu aint Wolof AT ALL!! They're jst makin all this up. Alioune Thiam is his real name. Akon is jst his name as an artist. Trust me, if any of ya'll go to Senegal and aks the ppl if that is a real name, they'll jst think its crazy!</p>
<p>Is his name really "Aliaune Damala Bouga Time Puru Nacka Lu Lu Lu Badara Akon Thiam"? There's no source, and it seems a bit absurd. I thought "akon" was his performing name, derived from the fact that he's an ex-con. And "lu lu lu" seems made-up, but we can't be sure if there's no source. Coquigamer 00:33, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just heard an Akon interview on a radio station in Atlanta and he confirmed that this is his birth name.</p>
<p>First of all, "Dama la beugg time" means "I wanna f*ck you" in Wolof, so I'm almost sure that someone made that up, especially with his new song on the air. I've never heard of anyone having "lu lu lu" in their name either, but that's also Wolof (it doesn't really mean anything, it's kinda like a repeated conjunction). Also, I've mostly seen Alioune spelled the French way (with an 'o' not an 'a'), but his may be spelled differently. Most of all, Badara is a common Pulaar name that goes with Thiam, and Thiam is a griot name, the singers and oral history storytellers of Senegal, so that seems right. I think it's probably Alioune Badara Thiam, but who knows. I speak Wolof and have spent a lot of time in Senegal and with Senegalese people, and am extremely skeptical that anyone would have a name like that. Any way to get in touch with him? -anne penda / Annekoplinka 17:34, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would like to add my contribution to the discussion about Akon's real first name by seconding the statement that his real name should be spelled "Alioune" and not "Aliaune". As an individual that grew up in Senegal as well, I have never heard of an "Aliaune", but "Alioune" is definitely right. It is indeed a Senegalese name. The name Aliaune does not exist to my knowledge. -Issa Dramé</p>
<p>I just found 2 sources - one lists his name as "Alioune Thiam" (as some have said it should be) and one that also provides his middle name "Badara" too (as Anne said it probably is above). <a href="http://www.observer.gm/enews/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1873&amp;Itemid=32" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.observer.gm/enews/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1873&amp;Itemid=32" rel="nofollow">[10]</a><a href="http://www.seneportal.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=print&amp;sid=1607" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.seneportal.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=print&amp;sid=1607" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>--Tfeng8 22:17, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. That first one seems less legitimate, it says he was born in Senegal, when he says himself he was born in the US. I'm going to cite the second one --<a href="../../../a/w/i/User%7EAwiseman_3fe1.html" title="User:Awiseman">AW</a> 23:10, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Even though there's the issue of whether or not his first name is Aliaune or Alioune, I think we can just leave it as Aliaune, since that's how it's being spelled by pretty much every source in the United States and I guess Akon is fine with that. But all the other parts like "Damala Bouga Time" should be excluded, in my opinion. There are never any Sengalese sources that have anything more than Alioune Badara Thiam. So I think we should just leave his name as Aliaune (Alioune) Badara Thiam and nothing more. Tfeng8 09:35, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The name is obviously a joke from Akons side, it's the chorus of one of his most famous tracks "I wanna f*ck you" AND I can asure you that <b>"Damala bouga time"</b> means I want to fuck you since I am also from the partially wolof speaking country of Gambia.</dd>
</dl>
<p>And as someone said earlier said that "even African middle names" should be written, is the joke itself, Akon knows that most westerners have a view that many Africans do have names like that. I hope we can be allowed to change this article without anymore, arguements about this joke. His name is most probably Alioune Badara "Akon" Thiam. Please trust us who do speak the language. We wouldn't doubt your knowledge in your mother tongues THANK YOU(Kuini86 05:01, 27 March 2007 (UTC))</p>
<dl>
<dd>The issue isn't that anyone doubts your ability to speak the language, but that Akon has said in multiple interviews that that is his full name. And who knows, maybe he had interesting parents who decided to include profanity in his name. Or maybe they don't speak the language and asked a mean-spirited passerby who does for a name suggestion. I know a girl named Alison Wonderland Smith. If she wrote children's books, and said her name was Alison Wonderland Smith, should we doubt her because her name happens to be the name of a famous movie? Until we have a source showing that he's lying to the world, he's pretty much the foremost expert on his own name. 24.17.242.238 15:45, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Aliaune is fine I believe. I am senegalese and usually it is Alioune, but I know that with the English pronunciation you can play around with names just looking at Gambian's name. It is just a matter of English vs french writings. Well "Dama le bougou time" = "I wanna fuck you". I dont think any parents would name their child that..If you think so well u can then leave it like that.</p>

<p>French is not the native language of Senegalese people. It is the language they speak in school, the language used for writing, and the language used on most television programs. However, it is not the language used in everyday conversation. Wolof, among other languages, is spoken in both cities and villages. "French is the official language but is used regularly only by the literate minority. All Senegalese speak an indigenous language, of which Wolof has the largest usage." (<a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2862.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2862.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2862.htm</a>) "Senegal is a small African country north of Mauritania, east of Mali and south of Guinea. Since Senegal was French colony the official spoken language is French, however the national/native language is Wolof." (<a href="http://www.nyu.edu/classes/blake.map2001/senegal.html" class="external free" title="http://www.nyu.edu/classes/blake.map2001/senegal.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nyu.edu/classes/blake.map2001/senegal.html</a>) As sources cited in the Wikipedia article explain, Akon did not even attend school in Senegal. Assuming he does speak French, it is highly doubtful that he is as proficient as someone who attended school in Senegal. And even if he had attended school in Senegal, French would still not have been his native language. --KCGU 16:50, 30 November 2006 (UTC)KCGU</p>
<p>I just listed to the song "Rebel Musik" that he does with Monsieur R. It is Wolof, not French, that Akon speaks in this song. I do not have any source to prove this, but I myself am fluent in both French and Wolof. I have spent over two years in Senegal. There is a little bit of French mixed into Akon's Wolof, but that is because all Senegalese people add some French into their Wolof, regardless of whether or not they are capable of speaking pure French. Akon says "Il faut ma defat ko boy...Senegal Dakar laa joge...Yu bare gëmuñuko..." which means, "I need to do it again, man... I'm from Dakar, Senegal... Many don't believe it..." Therefore, I believe that Akon speaks at least a little Wolof. I do not know how much French he knows. I welcome anyone who can corroborate this with some citations. The only thing I can prove is that he speaks English like an American and that he is an American citizen (since he was born in the US). --KCGU 20:06, 30 November 2006 (UTC)KCGU</p>
<p>-&gt; I agree, he speaks a little French and some Wolof, because he spoke to the crowd in Wolof when he came to Dakar to do a concert. However, his level of French and Wolof is really what I think people are wondering about Annekoplinka 17:43, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The page says "He is a Muslim, and cites his religion for his polygamist lifestyle; he has three wives".</p>
<p>Here's the problem. Islam doesn't order each and every muslim to take up polygamy. It merely tolerates polygamy. The vast, vast majority of muslims in the world have just one husband/wife. Change it to "He is a polygamist, which is permissable under the religion of Islam of which he is an adherent" or something along those lines.</p>
<p>Well he does cite his religion for his practice of polygamy, he has made it clear in a few interviews. as well this article is about akon not the islamic faith. --<a href="../../../d/u/h/User%7EDuhon_c0b1.html" title="User:Duhon">Duhon</a> Jnauary 18th 2007</p>
<p>The gripe is that it gives off the impression that he is obliged as a muslim to be polygamous, which isnt actually the case. In Islam, you can be polygamous if you want to be. It isnt a requirement at all. Change the ambiguous wording</p>

Secondly, I removed the line saying "Other sources have his name as "Alioune Badara Thiam". The only difference between that name &amp; the one cited in the 1st sentence is one letter ('o' instead of 'a'), which isn't surprising since the source was a French site.

Are you sure that source isn't merely simplifying his full name for clarity? <a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESpellcast_e5cd.html" title="User:Spellcast">Spellcast</a> 06:55, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All I know is the source says that, and other people here say that's right. All we can say is what is in there now - "However, other sources say his name is Alioune Badara Thiam" --<a href="../../../a/w/i/User%7EAwiseman_3fe1.html" title="User:Awiseman">AW</a> 15:50, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Akon got Punk'd, it was about him saying something in Japanese/korean without actually knowing what it means, "I am a fool", "I'm embarressed", "I just got Punk'd". Anyone going to put that in? -<a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHeckXX_0d44.html" title="User:HeckXX">HeckXX</a> 23:18, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Regarding the place of 'Origin' in the infobox, the <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_musical_artist_a77d.html" title="Template:Infobox musical artist">Template:Infobox musical artist</a> says it refers to:</p>
<p><i>The city from which the singer or group originated (that is, the city where the group was founded; or the city where individual performers started their career, should it not match the location of their birth).</i></p>
<p>He grew up in both the US &amp; Senegal. But 'origin' here refers to the place where he became notable &amp; it doesn't have to match the place where he grew up. And it was in the US where he became notable rather than Africa. <a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESpellcast_e5cd.html" title="User:Spellcast">Spellcast</a> 14:24, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
