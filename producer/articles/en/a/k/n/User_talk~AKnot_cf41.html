<p>My reason for removing Tooth &amp; Nail Records is because even though Solid State is part of Tooth &amp; Nail they are not the same thing. I do understand how it would fit there and I did think before removing it and I am sorry about. Even thought they are owned by the same people, I see Tooth &amp; Nail as a different label because they sign different types of artist than Solid State does.</p>

<p>Mr.NEWSMAN is written countless times on all CDs and in all Booklets as "Mr.NEWSMAN". I have all of their merchandise, and it is always written this way. If you have any scans you wold like to show me, feel free to e-mail me at notjake13@gmail.com. Also, one minor typo in a lyric booklet is no proof of a different title.</p>

<p>What exactly made the removal of this link necessary? It's not like everyone reading this article is fluent in Japanese and could never use translations for the lyrics. And as you may know as a dedicated fan (that much I can grasp from your nickname), some official translations are not all that accurate and do not come with any sort of notes about the extensive use of metaphors and wordplay. The translations on the site you unlinked do. Please reconsider this edit and maybe you could join us the article's discussion page from time to time, when there are disagreements of this kind.</p>

<p>Although the composer of "Mr.NEWSMAN" is definitely Die, the CDs with live tracks now simply list it as "Dir en grey". I can provide scans (unless you already have the CD) if you'd like a reference point to the composers. I think the standard of what is explicitly written on the CD case should be used.</p>

<p>I just checked my copy of the album and there's only one booklet with kanji only. Could there be different editions or maybe you got two albums mixed up? In any case, I removed the respective note in the article for now, I'd hate to hear about people who broke their CD case due to mixed up information.

<p>Hey, I really like the idea of having a page for the INWARD SCREAM bootleg...but I'm not sure wether or not it should be put up. It doesn't meet the standards of some people, but I know I'd like to have it up for reference. Maybe there should be a section on the Dir en grey Dicography page for "Bootlegs". I know of several bootlegged performances that I might be able to add information on. I have a great copy of a bootleg from Shanghai back in the Asia tours in 2002. Maybe you should talk to Cyrus XIII (sorry if I numbered that inorrectley), since he or she seems to know and run (very well I might add) the disco. page.</p>

<p>Well, like you said, you don't know for sure wether these instruments were ESP made or not. So pretty much anything you could write about these phantom bass guitars in an article would be pretty speculative. And please ask yourself, is this really so important? I recently had to remove nearly all the biographical information on these people because there where absolutely no sources given to back that up. How about rather digging up some well sourced information, which is worthwhile not just for hardcore fans of the band?

<p>Unearth is a metalcore band. They are not borderline thrash/post-thrash like Lamb of God, nor do they exemplify any deathcore or melodic death metal traits. Please, stop adding any genres such as "thrash metal" or "melodic death metal." Unearth is a band that is firmly rooted in the metalcore genre.

<p>Genre: I wouldn't agree with groove or post-thrash, simply because that label is given to bands like Lamb of God, who are considerably heavier. Regards, --<a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyouga_27f8.html" title="User:Ryouga">Ryouga</a> 02:41, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Lamb of God page, which SHOULD ALWAYS be metalcore/post-thrash w/ THREE cites is constantly reverted or changed and whatnot. God knows I can't be on here forever, so I appreciate your help on reverting the page.

<p>I have removed the "multiple" references in the album infoboxes, since such links are not common and the variety seen in Dir en grey's stylistic development does not necessarily apply to individual releases as well. Also, the section you linked to still lacks in quality, as it pretty much just throws genre names at the reader, including pseudo-genres like Japanese rock. - <a href="../../../c/y/r/User%7ECyrus_XIII_14b0.html" title="User:Cyrus XIII">Cyrus XIII</a> 11:41, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have noticed you commonly don't enter an edit summary as you didn't when you edited <a href="../../../a/s/_/As_I_Lay_Dying_%28band%29_7b43.html" title="As I Lay Dying (band)">As I Lay Dying (band)</a> (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=As_I_Lay_Dying_%28band%29&amp;curid=1386079&amp;diff=103053907&amp;oldid=102952388" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=As_I_Lay_Dying_%28band%29&amp;curid=1386079&amp;diff=103053907&amp;oldid=102952388" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>). This causes me problems. When I patrol for vandalism, I use the summary to make a preliminary decision on whether or not the post is a vandal edit or not. If the summary is present (or at least a section header, the part inside the /* */), I commonly decide the edit is legit and move on.</p>
<p>However, if no edit summary is available, I typically resort to loading the diff for the edit. This takes time. For that reason, if your edits are all valid, I ask that you provide edit summaries. For more on how to enter an edit summary, please read <a href="../../../e/d/i/Help%7EEdit_summary_ca7e.html" title="Help:Edit summary">Help:Edit summary</a>.</p>
<p>Incidentally, it is not just me that appreciate having edit summaries. When you omit your summary, you may be telling various bots that you are vandalizing pages. For this reason, please consider providing that summary. It is very important. You can enter that summary via the edit summary box on edit pages (as shown below).</p>

<p>Hello <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Metal_eefe.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Metal">WikiProject Metal</a> member.<br />
WikiProject Metal music is important in expanding encyclopedic coverage of the metal. It brings attention to the lesser-known bands, and significantly improves the quality of the famous ones. Five Featured articles and two formers is proof of that.<br />
This is the stuff I wish to achieve with the somewhat recently resurrected <b><a href="../../../r/o/c/WP%7EROCK_79c1.html" title="WP:ROCK">WikiProject Rock music</a></b>. I hope to also attract attention to <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_music.html" title="Rock music">rock music</a> articles of all sorts, and hopefully change some to GA or FA status. I invite you to come join us, and embrace the links between metal and rock music in general.<br />
<i><b>Rock on.</b></i><br />

<p>Hi, I was wondering whether the Dir en grey article would benefit from being put under the scope of one or two WikiProjects and since you're already a member of WP:Metal (which is one of those I consider likely candidates), I'd like your opinion on that. I guess WP:Japan and WP:Metal would be the most appropriate, WP:Rock music also comes to mind, but I really don't expect the band to drop the metal elements anytime soon and one genre is probably enough, projects-wise.</p>
<p>As your probably noticed, I've also added those samples, going with some but not all of your suggestions. Well, while I would put "Filth" on a best of album any day, I felt that bit from "Bottom of the Death Valley" would better represent the album as a whole. After all, <i>Kisou</i> had a strong emphasis on ballads as well. Same goes for the "Clever Sleazoid" sample, <i>TMoaB</i> is a loud record, to be sure, but it retains several melodic passages. By the way, how did you like the new album? Isn't it kinda weird how the first third of that All Music Guide review reads like the author spend some time reading Wikipedia? - <a href="../../../c/y/r/User%7ECyrus_XIII_14b0.html" title="User:Cyrus XIII">Cyrus XIII</a> 03:08, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
