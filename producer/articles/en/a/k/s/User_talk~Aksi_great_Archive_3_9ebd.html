<p>Hi Aksi great, it was great knowing you. Thanks for your wishes. I'd still be around but more infrequently. As far as RfA goes, <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> would be willing to review your contribs and nominate you just the way he did in my case, time permitting. So would I, as I had done in the case of nominating <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers">Redvers</a> but given the time constraints I am in, it'd probably take around a month by the time I get to it and hence you'd be better off if some one more active can nominate you. --<a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurubrahma_62f8.html" title="User:Gurubrahma">Gurubrahma</a> 17:18, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hi</span></h2>
<p>Hi! So you guys also had a anti-resevation march in IIM-A (I learnt from your comment is Srikeit's talk page). In fact, we also had same here on 10th from all the medical colleges.</p>
<p>Ahmedabad is improving greatly. No it's not easy to have an FAC. Especially with Nichalp around!! LoL. He is absolutely superb. Did you see the Kolkata FAC. Thanks to Nichalp, it almost did not have any oppose. In fact, the clause of the tentative oppose also pointed out by Nichalp beforehand (bad organisation of inline references). It was I who did not improve properly!</p>
<p>Best of luck. Bye.--<a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDwaipayanc_db12.html" title="User:Dwaipayanc">Dwaipayan</a> (<a href="../../../d/w/a/User_talk%7EDwaipayanc_1f27.html" title="User talk:Dwaipayanc">talk</a>) 06:14, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for looking at it. I am very sorry for disturbing you so much as you may already be nervous about your RfA. My advise to you would be to remain calm and let people 'vote' - whether oppose or support. There are a lot of people who put in their comments looking at the user and some without. Don't try to respond to all oppose comments just as you don't respond to all support ones. I have seen some really imaginitive opposes like 'lack of page moves'. - <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi_great</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/s/User_talk%7EAksi_great_f9ab.html" title="User talk:Aksi great">talk</a>) 14:45, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">calm down my friend</span></h2>
<p>Hehehehehe...calm down my friend. There is a gross misrepresentation of what adminship means. It is simply a bunch of extra tools, not critical for any user to have. It doesn't mean anything except a few extra ways to serve WP, and requesting those tools mean only a desire to help out in that section of work. Do not grieve, I mean that. Deeptrivia was similarly gross misrepresented - IMO, there is no need for any self-respecting person to put up with it.</p>
<p>I withdrew this nomination simply because I will not allow asatya to prevail. How can I allow people to call me uncivil and unable to deal with criticism after what I've been working on for the last seven months? If I had been unable to recogize my mistakes, would I have bothered to apologize to "Gurubrahma" - a person whose name nor any real detail I know about? I am sure most of those opposers didn't even bother to examine my record.</p>

<dd>Now I got the above mail. And, your mail sent to me when I was sick and confined to bed (during April 2006) was a pleasant surprise! It was on account of your anxiety and care to know about my welfare. I thank you for the same publicly. I responded to the same only two/three days before. My wife was talking of some other mails received during last 24 hours. As suggested by you, deleting the mail ID available with my page history is not a solution, as the miscreants already know the same. Now, I understand the reason behind <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> and several others not saying much about themselves.

<p>I didn't try to threaten or offend anyone. I just wanted him to stay away from the page simply because there were already too many disputes mainly because of me. I only want to update Rani's page. I'm trying to put new information on the page and making the page more appealing and professional. Only if editors could help me reframe my sentences. That would be great! I don't mind them toning it down. I have no problems with Pa7 or Plumcouch. It was only Zora who would completely revert my edits which would frustrate me. Plus, now this new guy was following her lead. I wasn't aware of that policy. No matter what I say, people will keep on editing on the page as their right.

<dd>I checked the guidelines &amp; I too feel that GA's can probably not be FA's. Although, I recently promoted a few articles to GA &amp; seen that they have had or are having peer reviews, which can only mean that the contributors are thinking of promoting it to FA. I think we should ask Nichalp, who is probably more experienced in this matter. As for the pics, I think a photo of Vastrapur lake will be good in the 'Demographics' section while I'm still not sure about what to add in the geography section, a satellite image will probably be nice, but I feel it will be a little out of place. BTW I was just reviewing articles like <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_of_Italy_42e6.html" title="Music of Italy">Music of Italy</a> &amp; have seen that the image placement looks good if they alternate each one right &amp; left rather than having all on the right like in the Ahmedabad article.

<p>After a lenghty, but much-needed Wikibreak, I'm happy to announce that version 1.2 of VandalProof is now <i>available for download!</i> Beyond fixing some of the most obnoxious bugs, like the persistent crash on start-up that many have experienced, version 1.2 also offers a wide variety of new features, including a stub-sorter, a global user whitelist and blacklist, navigational controls, and greater customization. You can find a full list of the new features <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalProof_b972.html#Suggestions_Being_Considered" title="WP:VandalProof">here</a>. While I believe this release to be a significant improvement over the last, it's nonetheless nowhere near the end of the line for VandalProof.

An example of one such SysOp tool that I'm working on incorporating is my <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_SHM_0af5.html" title="User:AmiDaniel/SHM">simple history merge</a> tool, which simplifies the process of performing history merges from one article into another. Anyway, if you haven't already, I'd encourage you to <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalProof_b972.html#Download" title="WP:VandalProof">download and install version 1.2</a> and take it out for a test-drive.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hall of Fame</span></h2>
<p>Hi - I propose creating a Wikipedia:Notice board for India-related topics/Indian Wikipedians Hall of Fame - with listings of people with highest number of edits, most FAs/FLCs/FPs, most vandalism fighting, most work on backlog, most images contributed, dispute resolution award, etc. This will be better - and will provide for your desire, as Nichalp will dominate most cats. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow">Rama's Arrow</a> 20:33, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, I did just close that one. Actually anyone can do this, the instructions are near the end. As to your specific question. It is now listed at the end of the article as empty and delete. You can edit the articles and remove the link to this cat. I usually add a comment about this being removed per CfD. When it is empty, just move the entry to the ready to delete heading. Normally there is a bot to do the work but I don't know about that. Also it seems like the editors that normally do the cleanup after the vote have not been around since there are 6 days worth of articles in the backlog. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 07:07, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Girls in Loyola</span></h2>
<p>I saw some of your recent changes in the Xavier's Loyola article.. I think we need to update the facts - since the statement "..it admits girls in the 11th and 12th as well.. (or something to that extent)" is only partially true.. They have started admitting girls in all standards. (gosh!! whew!). I don't know the exact details and I am not in a position to get the exact details, and hence I cannot make those changes.. --<a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERev.bayes_cd86.html" title="User:Rev.bayes">Rev.bayes</a> 17:38, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
