<p>Hi Akash,</p>
<p>The criteria is nearly the same, though we prefer to be not so picky, or we will be starved for SAs. The requirement is that Portals should only feature "High quality" content. This doesn't imply FA status. If you can critically analyse and suggest improvements during the SAC, do it. Just make sure they are actionable enough in the time frame. Scrutinizing wouldn't hurt as you'd have to do it anyway during/just before the FAC. As an example, I went ahead and copyedited the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thiruvananthapuram.html" title="Thiruvananthapuram">Thiruvananthapuram</a> article to FA standards. There are a few prose related issues left, that can be sorted out before/during the FAC. — <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbuj.Saxena_7172.html" title="User:Ambuj.Saxena">Ambuj Saxena</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/b/User_talk%7EAmbuj.Saxena_ee93.html" title="User talk:Ambuj.Saxena">talk</a>) 18:58, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Sir/madam, Thanks for ur help.I shall oblige what u suggested.I hope the other person in question wont mind copy+paste of this para into Belgaum_district. I just wanaa bring to ur notice that the sentence 'Ever since then, the issue has been kept simmering by Maharashtra politicians while Karnataka has continued to press for the implementation of the report.' is kind of anti-Maharashtra govt.I hope u will understand this.Also the newspaper Deccan herald belongs to a Kannada publication house which is bound to churn pro-Kannada news so this citations arent of much use.But regardless of above,I am content at the suggestions u made and I think justice is being done. <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 19:44, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No fights here,this is the Sarvagnya's version of Border problem which I was opposing located at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Belgaum&amp;diff=72456586&amp;oldid=72356098" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Belgaum&amp;diff=72456586&amp;oldid=72356098" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Belgaum&amp;diff=72456586&amp;oldid=72356098</a> -</p>
<hr />
<p>&gt;In 1956, with the <a href="../../../r/e/o/Reorganisation_of_States_793f.html" title="Reorganisation of States">Reorganisation of States</a>, Belagavi district became a part of Karnataka. The Maharashtra Government contested this as it wanted Belagavi district to be merged with Maharashtra instead. Under tremondous pressure from the Maharashtra government, The Mahajan Commission was constituted by the Union Government of India to look into the matter. The Commission was headed by Supreme Court Justice Meherchand Mahajan. The commission looked into Maharashtra's claims and recommended exchange of several villages between the two states(Maharashtra and Karnataka), but most importantly, rejected outright Maharashtra's claim on Belgaum city. As soon as the commission came out with its report, Maharashtra made a U-turn and refused to honour the report. Ever since then, the issue has been kept simmering by Maharashtra politicians while Karnataka has continued to press for the implementation of the report. Recently, the Maharashtra government went to the Supreme Court to press their case. The Supreme Court hasnt pronounced anything yet and Belgaum district along with Belgaum city continues as a legal and constitutional part of Karnataka state.</p>

<p>Do you call this vandalism? I think I do. If he is satisfied with your version(which incidentally is very similar to mine which he was opposing) why is he still venting his spleen on my talk page? Can you do something about this or are you busy? If that is the case, I'll try pinging other admins. Infact, for starters he's even got his facts about <a href="../../../d/e/c/Deccan_Herald_6dd9.html" title="Deccan Herald">Deccan Herald</a> all wrong! and yet, that didnt stop him from branding it untrustworthy <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 21:31, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To be frank, I had decided not to come back to you for mediation after you bailed out of the issue the way you did yesterday. At one point yesterday I had infact filed away another call for mediation by an 'Admin' but on second thoughts decided to give it more time and didnt 'submit' it.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, since its a new day for both of us and you seem to be in better spirits(me too infact), I've decided to repose my faith in you.
<ul>
<li>For starters, I need you to please tell Mahawiki in no uncertain terms to stop vandalising(trolling) on my talk page; infact on all talk pages.</li>
<li>Please tell him 'unconfirmed' is not derogatory.</li>
<li>Please ask him to bring back all the formal warnings I gave him to his talk page. He has deleted them against the rules and spirit of WP(see Sundar's comment on this issue on my talk page)</li>
<li>Drill into him that Deccan Herald being comic relief is <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a>.</li>
<li>Impress on him that 'Kannadi'(probably much like 'Madrasi') is a joke at best and derogatory at worst.</li>
<li>Please tell him that you arent and admin, not because i think you wouldnt make a good admin [:)], but because i wouldnt want an admin who strolls by to be mislead or confused. If possible ask him to replace all his references to 'admin' with your handle.</li>
<li>And I've said this a few times already, but please tell him again that my anon edits was by mistake. It WAS NOT intentional. It can be seen by how quickly I logged back in and continued to edit the article. I wouldnt be too concerned about convincing him of this fact, but I dont want to be at the receiving end of a Goebbelsian lie if this warring ends up with an Admin or goes for dispute resolution or something (though frankly, thanks to your(and AreJay's) efforts I dont foresee that happening).</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>And now the more important ones,
<ul>
<li>Ask him to stop messing up the whole place when he edits the article. Each time he edits the article, he ends up trampling all over the place deleting citations, messing up spelling/grammar etc.,.</li>
<li>I am apprehensive of even making spelling/grammar corrections to the article because it seems like each time he sees an edit from me, he throws a fit and rushes to make corrections to (and in the process insert POV) to parts that havent even been meddled with.</li>
<li>Ask him to first read up on WP's policies and please help him by directing him to all the important pages. He doesnt seem to know a thing even about <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotable_e66c.html" title="WP:Notable">WP:Notable</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiable_e5a8.html" title="WP:Verifiable">WP:Verifiable</a> to start with.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I would have liked to explain all these things(and some more that I might have missed here) myself, but I'd rather you do it since he seems to see red the moment he sees my handle on an edit.</dd>
<dd>Thanks again, for your efforts.</dd>

<p>P.S:The reason I've used the diff I've used above, is because there is hardly any difference between my version and Dinesh Kannambadi's. Also the diff stops and Sandipani's edit because beyond that pretty little has changed.</p>

<dd>For all his ranting, he has reverted it to one of AreJay's versions. And here is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Belgaum&amp;diff=72772767&amp;oldid=72539092" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Belgaum&amp;diff=72772767&amp;oldid=72539092" rel="nofollow">diff</a> between that version and mine. If you observe, the only difference is that "unconfirmed assertion" has changed to "...its opinion...". Both 'unconfirmed assertion' and '..its opinion..' were AreJay's edits and I had nothing to do with those words. So in essence <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">User:Mahawiki</a> has after lot of huffing and puffing and wasting everybody's time, reverted it back to MY version!!!

Dear Aksi, I shall also request u how Sarvagnya had edited our this article into a Kannadi advtg page.I plead to look into that matter.Plz check the current version of Border issue,IT IS NOT PRO-MAHARASHTRA.Seriously if this guy doesnt wants peace i vow not to budge.Im extremely sorry if anyonw has edited put citations,but I have just added 2 citation which are worth considering. For the citation hungry sarvganya here's this citation <a href="http://www.pudhari.com/Static/Features/Belgaon_border_issue/main_page.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.pudhari.com/Static/Features/Belgaon_border_issue/main_page.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pudhari.com/Static/Features/Belgaon_border_issue/main_page.htm</a> which gives an timeline with links to main article about how Marathis have lead a dignified democratic struggle against fanatic Karnataka govt. <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 06:05, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Dont do a Dhritarashtra on this issue</span></h2>
<p>With due respect to u,Aksi,I want to remind u again the sarvagnya version of 'Border problem' has been posted above.Infact u go and see it in the history. I strongly recommend to find out that urself and see how low this sarvagnya has stoop to satisfy his ego.</p>
<p>Anonymous editing done by a Sarvagnya shud suffice the deliberate provocations he meant by editing out 'Belgaon' and manipulating ur edition.Obviously,enraged by this I did write tht post on his talk page.</p>
<p><br />
In Maharashtra,there are few English readers and most often Marathi newspapers doesnt cry foul or give a one sided story like this crappy Deccan Herald.I strongly recommend to go thru their article about Belgaon,Kaveri dispute and judge urself the credibility of that newspaper.If at all its citation is allowed for the CONTROVERSIAL statements (I dont have any problem with reference u took from those articles) which contain bad-mouthing about Maharashtra,do allow me to use same reference from our Marathi newspapers.</p>
<p>I urge u,since we had honored ur decision on Belgaum,not to ignore Kannadi vandalism and take some drastic measures to stop this nuisance.U just cant say 'i have had final word' when it was sarvagnya who gossiped abt me b4.If anyone of us doesnt adhere to ur solution,strict measueres need to be taken.If u did the pains of resolving the issue with command,u shud ur power/right to keep NPOV intact.U just cant back out saying I have done my job.U make me handicap by 'some 3rr rules' which sarvagnya and his kannadi chauvunist gang doesnt give damn about it.This is not done. If at all u r unable to do above,plz forward this issue to higher authority or just allow me to answer tit for tat to these goons.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;If you had been blocked yesterday (and you came very close to it)..&lt;&lt; This is very unfortunate statement u have made.My stand was justified and I was just pleading 'to not to include statements which might show Maharashtra and Belgaon struggle' in bad light.It is really heartbreaking to receive such message from u when I completely followed ur suggestions,did not try to push Maharashtra's POV.Remember this is not because of the threat to blocking me.I shall NEVER tolerate injustice to Maharashtra whatsoever.With such stand of urs,I shall promise to reciprocate the Kannadi chauvinsits as they vandalise that article.I am for truth and hopefully Truth always truimphs.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">My plea about Belgaon article</span></h2>
<p>Unfortunately Sarvagnya has showing his true colors again.I request him to stop his childish behaviour since he deliberately changes the POV of Belgaum articleor frames a language such way that it is derogatory to Maharashtra and Belgaon struggle.Its citations are nothing short of kannadi fanatiscm.I dont mind their citations till IT DOESNT SHOW MAHARASHTRA IN BAD LIGHT.Statements showing Karnataka in bad light can also be removed.I beg pardon if any of us (me and Sandipani) have changed the POV.I request u to take a look at my edits of yesterday,i have just added 2 citations and corrcted the sentences which may be derogatory to Maha.From now onwards I shall also take help of Marathi citations,which fortunately are in abundunce and I am sure u wont mind them too.</p>
<p>I shall retain the warnings if its so much bothering for him.Plz advice on this.</p>
<p>Anonymous edits of sarvagnya (where he edited out Belgaon word) shows how restless and ill-minded he is.Those were certainly not accidental.</p>
<p>I would also liked to aplogise for my bad English in my edits.Fortunately others wikipedians are apt to correct them.Important is the content,language and grammar can be taken care of.</p>
<p>Lastly I really dont fear blocking me up.But it shall be very cruel and injustice for me who JUST WANTS THE LANGUAGE AND POV OF THOSE ARTICLES TO BE NEUTRAL AND NOT ANTI-MAHARASHTRIAN.</p>
<p>If Sarvagnya says Maharashtrians are not in majority in Belgaon,i wonder how would SEVEN MES Mla's are being elected everytime,all panchayats and local bodies have Marathi majority,how can Belgaon Mahanagar Palika UANIMOUSLY ask for merger with Maharashtra.</p>
<p>I am sure u shall act in neutral and justified manner in this issue.I am really very sorry to nag u all the time.I am afraid Sarvagnya who's expert in Wiki-policies and procedures will try his best to ban me using his bad mouthing and hiding truths. plz see his version of truth of border dispute b4 u had intervened in this link <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Belgaum&amp;diff=72456586&amp;oldid=72356098" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Belgaum&amp;diff=72456586&amp;oldid=72356098" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Belgaum&amp;diff=72456586&amp;oldid=72356098</a> <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 06:24, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think names in both Marathi and Kannada should be used.Unfortunately I dont have any citation for my claim that Belgaum is derived from Marathi counterpart Belgaon(pronounciation: beLgav).The Britishers had started using that word.It was in similar lines of Bombay, Peking, Calcutta whose original names were Mumbai, Beijing and Kolkata respectively.</p>
<p>I respect ur verdict but I am sad that despite the clear mention of usage of Marathi in Belgaon Mahanagarpalika,u have not agreed to display Marathi name here.A picture says thousand words- <a href="http://www.pudhari.com/Static/Features/Belgaon_border_issue/f_belgaon154.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.pudhari.com/Static/Features/Belgaon_border_issue/f_belgaon154.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pudhari.com/Static/Features/Belgaon_border_issue/f_belgaon154.htm</a></p>

<p>Hi Akash, congrats on the Ahemadabad article. Can you try and get Gandhinagar up to FA status? It should be easier than Ahmedabad since it does not have too much of a population. Infact most of the text can be cloned from the Ahmedabad article, and updated to reflect Gandhinagar's specific info. Should not take you more that 2 days to do this. I have 1 or two pictures that I can contribute. Sections such as culture can take a back seat, instead focus on the layout and important places.

<dd>Since I've been mentioned here, let me just weigh in - I think I voted to delete Hindu politicians cat before. This was before I knew that Muslim/Anglican/Catholic pols cats etc exist. My argument naturally doesnt hold given that those cats exist. However, when it was last created I spent some time removing the cat from pages like <a href="../../../r/a/h/Rahul_Gandhi_9a52.html" title="Rahul Gandhi">Rahul Gandhi</a> or <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devraj_Urs_98d8.html" title="Devraj Urs">Devraj Urs</a> whose religious beliefs are not in the public domain - they have attended and participated in Hindu ceremonies, but it is doubtful whether that amounts to a public profession of their religion. I believe the cat should be limited to people who are practicing Hindus, rather than those who may or may not be Hindu by birth. Is that sufficient? It seems to be analogous to what is set up for cat:Anglican pols, for example.</dd>
<dd>Further, I strongly object to the characterisation that I object to all 'Hindu' cats. I object to most pointless religious cats. I cant see how "Hindu sportsmen" cats are encyclopaedic unless the sportsman in question is relevant to Hinduism, either as an evangelist or the follower of a prominent guru, or something. Ditto "Christian sportsmen". I suppose it is interesting if you have a "Hindu Sportsmen" cat and limit it to sportsmen from outside India, but that isnt what is being suggested. I do not object, for example, to a cat that was "Hindu/Muslim/Xtian philosophers", as it is to be supposed that Hinduism/Islam/Xtianity would (a) affect their philosophy and (b)be clearly citable in their own work.</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">My rationale</span></h3>
<p>Hi Akash - I completely understand your concern regarding this category. The need for a new discussion arises from the fact that the Muslim politicians cat was voted to be kept on June 4, after the Hindu cat was deleted. Given that a whole network of religion based categories exist, it doesn't make sense to not have a Hindu category. The need to patrol this category is great, but that doesn't mean that there shouldn't be such a cat. We should not not do things just because some people will make mistakes or try to impose their views. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow"><font color="blue"><b>Rama's arrow</b></font></a> 21:11, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is very sad that despite I have taken a U turn in my attitude when u and Sunder suggested me,u r being partial on me.U are not asking any citations from Sarvagnya.I had removed the earlier warnings(when Sunder adviced me to do so) on Sarvagnya's page when he did the same against me.</p>

My folly.I had issued an warning against threats but since that user said it was irrelavent,I issued that admin's warning.I am sure u wont delete any warning which a normal user like me can pass on to him.</p>
<p>He has given me warning because of use of word Kannadi.See the <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kannada.html" title="Kannada">Kannada</a> page where Marathi wikitag says 'कानडी'.If I dont mind 'Marathis' word why should he issue an warning if i use Kannadi? <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 19:26, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok!But shoudnt Sarvagnya remove the warning too?I will term Kannadis as 'Kannada people'.I think its high time to block Sarvagnya,despite giving him TOO MANY citations he is actually wasting others time and energy..Anyways only thing which is in my hand is to follow ur advice.Its ur duty to be NEUTRAL and not lenient towards users who are unnecessarily creating fuss. <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 19:48, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, personally I am not a great votary of using INCOTW for taking articles to FA status. However, I see that lot of articles get improved much better when they are near to FA status rather than when they are near to stub status. In the latter case, people need to source info, where as in the ofrmer, it is a case of styling and streamlining. It may be worth bringing back the old rules. One quibble though: the current INCOTW template asks us to bring the quality up to FA standards - this is not easily possible for a stub in a week; it'd be better to ask that the article be improved. On an entirely different note, I feel that, of late, the Indian participation has declined in general and not just on INCOTW. --<a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurubrahma_62f8.html" title="User:Gurubrahma">Gurubrahma</a> 05:50, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I also think the rule should be considered for changing, as Guru has pointed out some problems regarding the "only stubs" rule. There are many stubs in need of improvement, but often sources are lacking on those topics.
