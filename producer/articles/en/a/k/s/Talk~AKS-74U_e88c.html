<p>"Semi-automatic versions of the AKSU are known as "Krinkov" on the American market."</p>
<p>Many of the created AKSU come with/are modified to have the ability too switch between full-auto and semi-auto. This was first done by the Soviet Union on the AK-47 in the early 50s ( not sure of the exact year ) too help rookies who have poor aim when firing in full-auto and too stop them from emptying an entire magazine without hitting anything. After the AK-74 was developed , variants were made , such as the AKS-74U , and most of thoughs have the option between Safty/Full-Auto/Semi-Auto .</p>
<p>I am pretty sure that even the AK-47 with the type 1 reciever (the first AK-47 type made) already had the 3-position safety (safe/full/semi). I think that even the prototype AK-1 and AK-2 weapons made by Kalashnikov had the 3-position safety. That would mean the late 40s, not the early 50s. Also, I am almost 100% sure that all military AKS-74Us had the 3-position safety, so they wouldn't have had to modify them to be able to shoot semi, as the weapon always came stock with that ability. The Krinks made for commercial sale generally have a 2-position safety, but that is only safe/semi. 64.131.10.67 16:38, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>MERGE</b>: This is a subvariant of the AK-74. This belongs in that section and does not require its own article. The AK-74 article itself is a sub-article of the AK-47 parent.--<a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsams10_5cf0.html" title="User:Asams10">Asams10</a> 18:51, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>2 things. First, I don't thing it should be merged because the aks74u and ak74 serve different purposes. Second, the ak74 is not a sub article of the ak47. --<a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERocco08_2671.html" title="User:Rocco08">user:rocco08</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't thing it should be merged - it's like merging m16 and m4 article or ak 47 and rpk .. similar base of weapon but adaptaded to different role</dd>
<dd>I support the merge. There is not enough original information to merit its own article. Furthermore I agree that the -74 article is a sub of the -47, although that is beside the point. The AK-74 is a variant of the -47, therefore most of the information regarding its history and development up to the caliber change is covered there. <a href="../../../c/y/n/User%7ECynicalMe_3fa2.html" title="User:CynicalMe">CynicalMe</a> 13:32, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think it should be merged. All AK's are alike to some extent, but this one is different enough, visually and functionally, that it should be kept here. --<a href="../../../k/d/e/User%7EKDerrida_6433.html" title="User:KDerrida">KDerrida</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think it should be merged. Many regard the AKS-74U as a completly different weapon then the AK-74, some even say it is even in a different classification, submachine gun. While it is true that it shares many features with the AK-74, it is not the same. That would be like saying the Uzi and the Ingram should be merged because they share the same action. Also, I think that the AK-74 should be unmerged from the AK-47, and so should the AKM. They are all unique, different weapons and should not all be crammed into one section merely to save space.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, I don't think it should be merged, but the AKS-74U is not, by definition, a submachine gun. Subguns are magazine-fed weapons that shoot pistol cartridges, not rifle cartridges. The AKS-74U shoots the 5.45x39 cartridge, which is a rifle cartrigde. Therefore, the AKS-74U is an assault rifle. If they made a version in 9mm or something, then it would be classifiable as a submachine gun. Also, the comparison to the Ingram/Uzi is not the best, because, although the two do share the same action, they were designed by different people and countries, which alone would put them in separate categories. They also have many differences beyond the similarity to the action. The AKS-74U, on the other hand, shares with the AK-74 not only the same action, but also the same country of origin, the same design and placement of the stock, barrel and other parts, largely the same dimensions especially in the bolt, barrel diameter, trigger group, and hardware, many other interchangeable parts, the same magazines, and the list goes on and on. A better comparison might be the M-4 and the M-16. --Ak person</p>
<p>It seems to me that the consensus is against merging. I am removing the merge flag from the article. —<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 21:36, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Video Games</b>: The AKS-74U plays a critical role within the storyline of Konami's video game "Metal Gear Solid 2" for the PlayStation 2. The player-controlled character (named "Raiden") must equip it, along with a Russian Spetsnaz Battle Dress Uniform (BDU), to masquerade as a Spetsnaz operative when walking through specific Spetsnaz-guarded areas within the Game, most notably an area containing a group of American hostages (B1 Level, Shell 1 Core). Within this area, the player's mission is to locate a Secret Service Agent holding mission-critical information, within the given hostage group, his only identifying feature being the use of an internal pacemaker. To succeed, the player must slowly walk through the hostage group, while frequently switching between the AKS-74U (for maintaining disguise) and a directional microphone. If the player is spotted by local guards equiped with anything apart from the AKS-74U, the mission instantly ends in failure, presumably with the capture of the player. This is one of the few points in the game where mission failure is instant (e.g., no warning). --user:SDBriggs</li>

<p>In some photographs, I've seen a weapon that looked like an AK-74SU, but it had a 30-round 7.62 mm clip from an AK-47. Does anyone know what this variant is called? 68.14.20.221 20:43, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Could you give a link to the picture?</p>
<p>Sure. Here's a picture of an airsoft version of that weapon. Will it do? Sgt. Bond 21:30, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>No offense, but that <i>is</i> an airsoft version. Any chance you could find a picture of a 'real' one? I've never heard of that variant of the 7.62mm AK, and there is a chance that it only exists in airsoft form. <a href="../../../c/y/n/User%7ECynicalMe_3fa2.html" title="User:CynicalMe">CynicalMe</a> 00:58, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yes, I know it's an airsoft version. However, I did see a real version in a newspaper picture once. I think it's called an AK-47U. Does anyone know if I'm right?Sgt. Bond 17:52, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I belive so, but read a book about the ak 47 to make sure</p>
<p>The airsoft version of the AKS-74u is a failed attempt by Tokyo Marui to recreate a AKS-74u using as many parts from the AK-47 as possible. But because it isn't a AKS-74u it was given another name. The only carbine version of the AK-47 was the AK-47S. officially, AK-47U is a type that does not exist. --Feldmaus</p>
<p>That could be the AK-104, an export version of the AKS-74U. Variants of this version include the AK-102 (5.56mm NATO) and AK-105 (5.45mm). --Fixen</p>
<p>It is true that there is a 7.62 version that does actually exist, although it may not be of Russian origin. I have seen Yugoslavian versions for sale; I forget what they were called exactly. They look very similar to the AKS-74U, except for the magazine, and an underfolding stock instead of a side folder. There may even be a model w/o a stock at all, but I have only seen a couple of military photos with those versions, so they may be field modified. --AK person</p>
