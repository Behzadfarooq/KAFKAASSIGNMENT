<p>I think the content is perfectly fine, but should be incorporated in <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hate_speech.html" title="Hate speech">hate speech</a> (as I did) or another similar article; phrases should usually not have their own articles but be mentioned where appropriate, as people are unlikely to search for a specific phrase or link to it (but the redirect can stay). --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a> 22:49 Feb 24, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<hr />
<p>If you just redirect it to <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hate_speech.html" title="Hate speech">hate speech</a> you are exercising judgement and failing to be neutral, specifically you are making an editorial decision that this is hate speech. Instead, let the reader decide for themself. If the only two "significant" times this phrase has been used have been related to Sebastian Bach and the Westboro Baptist Church, then why not just quote the phrase on those pages, and let the reader judge for themselves what the motivation of the person who used the phrase was? (anon)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is not possible to write anything at all on any subject whatsoever without "exercising judgement". The phrase is undoubtedly offensive, does not offer any prospect of becoming an enclycopedic topic, and the content belongs, if it belongs anywhere, in the entries on hate speech or particular prominent figures (if they are indeed prominent) who used it. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a></dd>

<hr />
<p>Well, even if I disagree as to where this info should go, I agree that it doesn't need to have a page of its own.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, it should have a page of its own because, as I just pointed out, it will be easier to find that way.

<p>If it is deemed that a redirect rather than a link to <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hate_speech.html" title="Hate speech">hate speech</a> helps the reader in any way, then fine, but the information from this article needs then to be added to that article. It took me a while to research, I find it interesting, and it is NPOV. Alternatively, suggest a better title for an article to hold this information. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 23:19 Feb 24, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've reverted the Hate Speech page to the version produced by Eloquence which included the information formerly contained on this article page. So the information is there, unless our anonymous contributor decided to revert that again (and this page) to return it here. (In which case, all of us busy reverting both pages will have to do re-reverts again, I suppose.) <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">JTD</a> 23:39 Feb 24, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>I see two separate issues here:</p>
<p>1: Some people think this deserves an entry of its own. 2: Other people think it should be merged somewhere else. 2a: Some prefer merging it with hate speech. 2b: Some prefer merging it with Sebastian Bach or Westboro Baptist Church.</p>
<p>I am in am camp 2b.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I'm still in camp 1, since the article is related to at least: <a href="../../../s/e/b/Sebastian_Bach_beb1.html" title="Sebastian Bach">Sebastian Bach</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hate_speech.html" title="Hate speech">hate speech</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_Shepard_ac9c.html" title="Matthew Shepard">Matthew Shepard</a>, LC Johnson, <a href="../../../r/a/i/RAID_cf91.html" title="RAID">RAID</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Phelps_24e6.html" title="Fred Phelps">Fred Phelps</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westboro_Baptist_Church_20ea.html" title="Westboro Baptist Church">Westboro Baptist Church</a>. All these articles need to link to the article covering the phrase, and this is unnecessarily complicated if the information is arbitrarily added to one of them. Simply put quotes around it and be done with it. We don't even have quotes around <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">fuck</a>, even though our article is about the word and not the act. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 01:23 Feb 25, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This should not redirect to "hate speech". There's no guarantee that the <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hate_speech.html" title="Hate speech">hate speech</a> entry will discuss the specifics of this phrase in the future. Therefore it is inadvisable to redirect this phrase to that entry. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Cunctator_a9b6.html" title="User:The Cunctator">The Cunctator</a></p>
<p>Why does that possibility exist? Are you trying to say that hate speech directed at homosexuals will be removed from the article? -- <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>No, I'm saying what I'm trying to say. I'm saying that the specific discussion of this phrase may be removed from the hate speech entry. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Cunctator_a9b6.html" title="User:The Cunctator">The Cunctator</a></dd>

<dd>The Cungcator is right about <b>one</b> thing: 'There are no guarantees."-<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo"><strong>&amp;#35918&amp;#30505</strong></a></dd>
</dl>
<p>There's no guarantee that the <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hate_speech.html" title="Hate speech">hate speech</a> article will mention this particular example of hate speech only in the same sense that there is no guarantee that the article will not be replaced by "fffdfdfdsfdfioj". I would hope that if a conscientious Wikipedian were to see a piece of factually correct, verifiable, NPOV information removed from an article, then they would just put it back in. (Or, if the article in question is not the right place for it, find a more appropriate article to put it in, and divert the redirect accordingly.) So there should never be a problem with the information on the phrase disappearing forever. -- <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOliver_Pereira_ccc2.html" title="User:Oliver Pereira">Oliver P.</a> 17:44 Mar 1, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree that Cunctator's argument is not particularly strong, but how about this: the principle of least astonishment requires that somebody who clicks on <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_Kills_Fags_Dead_a93f.html" title="AIDS Kills Fags Dead">AIDS Kills Fags Dead</a> or maybe better 'AIDS Kills Fags Dead' phrase gets to an article which discusses the specifics of this phrase, certainly including a link to <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hate_speech.html" title="Hate speech">hate speech</a>. Right now, these people are immediately redirected to <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hate_speech.html" title="Hate speech">hate speech</a> and have to wade through two screenfuls of only marginally relevant discussion of academic hate speech codes before they find the information they're looking for, if they ever get that far down in the article. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 18:24 Mar 1, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>To be honest, I'm not convinced by any of the arguments about where the information should be; I'm not sure it matters whether this phrase gets an article all to itself or not. (But if it does, I think the phrase should definitely be put in quotes and labelled as a phrase, or - more precisely - a slogan.) A counterargument to what you're saying about linking would be that hardly anyone is ever going to link to such a phrase. If a different article wants to mention the phrase, it could always be reworded to say, "The phrase ... (an example of [[hate speech]])". -- <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOliver_Pereira_ccc2.html" title="User:Oliver Pereira">Oliver P.</a> 19:09 Mar 1, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>The articles on <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skid_Row_%28heavy_metal_band%29_3c73.html" title="Skid Row (heavy metal band)">Skid Row</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_Shepard_ac9c.html" title="Matthew Shepard">Matthew Shepard</a>, and <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Phelps_24e6.html" title="Fred Phelps">Fred Phelps</a> currently link to this phrase; in the future, <a href="../../../s/e/b/Sebastian_Bach_beb1.html" title="Sebastian Bach">Sebastian Bach</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/i/Raid.html" title="Raid">Raid</a>, and <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westboro_Baptist_Church_20ea.html" title="Westboro Baptist Church">Westboro Baptist Church</a> probably want to link to it as well.</p>
<p>Your suggestion "The phrase ... (an example of [[hate speech]])" is not good enough, since it doesn't tell the reader that <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hate_speech.html" title="Hate speech">hate speech</a> has specific information about the phrase. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 19:21 Mar 1, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Okay, good point. "... (discussed in the article on [[hate speech]])" might work, though. -- <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOliver_Pereira_ccc2.html" title="User:Oliver Pereira">Oliver P.</a> 19:46 Mar 1, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>A suggestion: replace the <i>automatic</i> redirect with <b>See contents of</b> [[hate speech]]. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">JtdIrL</a> 19:58 Mar 1, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Nooo... A ten-word sentence effectively just saying "go away" is just going to annoy everyone. Links should always take the reader to some useful content, and if they don't, we have to rearrange things so that they do. The page should either have some useful content, or it should be a redirect. Until this argument has been sorted out, I'll make it a redirect. -- <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOliver_Pereira_ccc2.html" title="User:Oliver Pereira">Oliver P.</a> 00:49 Mar 2, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, then what exactly is the argument against making 'AIDS Kills Fags Dead' slogan, putting the material there, and linking from <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hate_speech.html" title="Hate speech">hate speech</a> and all the other locations mentioned above? That way, every link works as expected without strange constructs as "discussed under <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hate_speech.html" title="Hate speech">hate speech</a>". There's even a NPOV issue involved: apparently some people deny that hate speech even exists. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 01:15 Mar 2, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think the arguments are that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Phrases shouldn't have their own articles. (Well, a detailed discussion of a single phrase might look out of place in a general article, so perhaps they should only be briefly mentioned in the general articles, and discussed in more depth in their own articles.)</li>
<li>People are unlikely to link to the phrase. (You have disproven this above.)</li>
<li>People are unlikely to search for the phrase. (Maybe true; maybe not. But they can still follow links to it.)</li>
<li>The "specificity is highly suspect" - perhaps a more general article on <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobic_hate_speech.html" title="Homophobic hate speech">homophobic hate speech</a> would be better. (Indeed so, but it needs to be written first...)</li>
</ol>
<p>So, as I said above, I'm not convinced by any of the arguments. Any others to be added to the list, anyone? -- <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOliver_Pereira_ccc2.html" title="User:Oliver Pereira">Oliver P.</a> 02:32 Mar 2, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oliver says: "a more general article on <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobic_hate_speech.html" title="Homophobic hate speech">homophobic hate speech</a> would be better." Yes. Good idea. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 02:34 Mar 2, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>So it seems argument 4 is still standing. I don't quite understand it though "perhaps a more general article on homophobic hate speech would be better". What would that article contain, and it what sense would it be better? We would have precisely the same situation as now: several places link to the phrase, and people would be redirected to an article that discusses a general topic and then at the end gives an example pertaining to the phrase. Wouldn't it make more sense to have <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobic_hate_speech.html" title="Homophobic hate speech">homophobic hate speech</a> link to 'AIDS Kills Fags Dead' slogan as an example? Also, the new article title would still prejudice the question if the phrase is indeed hate speech, which is apparently contested by some, as is the whole concept of hate speech. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 18:02 Mar 2, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>It is not. This page should be deleted. It violates our policy of offensiveness. Second, its a question of proportion: The notion that this should be an article about a slogan, would (once again) depend on the merits of the material - does this slogan warrant a serarate article? I dont think so, and my lack using expletives should not be seen as compliance or complacence but as the slightest degree of politeness; perhaps developing into respect should such respect be warranted. -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo"><strong>&amp;#35918&amp;#30505</strong></a></p>
<p><br />
Our policy on offensiveness regards usernames, not entries. Noone would be allowed to have this entry's title as a username. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Cunctator_a9b6.html" title="User:The Cunctator">The Cunctator</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>There are a lot of entries on wikipedia that are short and stubby. Also, we have an article on <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">fuck</a> so your argument about offensiveness doesn't get you far.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Be as subjective as you want - we have a <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">nigger</a> article as well, as well as a <a href="../../../f/a/g/Fag.html" title="Fag">fag</a> article... Encyclpedically written... but this is beyond the boundaries, and y'all know it. Either you're trying to make some kind of lame, propagandist hate speech message with this, or your just trying to be a pain in the butt (Which is, ironically, the basis of a psychological theory about why...:) Thats what I think, I could be wrong. As far as stubs - they either seed a larger article, or are cut and incorporated into larger articles, like this one was. The argument you make about stubs is, essentially, based on a static concept of the Wikipedia: Its completely disigenuous if you understand, at all, the elementary notion that Wikipedia is not <a href="../../../s/t/a/Static.html" title="Static">static</a>. -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo"><strong>&amp;#35918&amp;#30505</strong></a></p>
<hr />
<p>I agree with Stevertigo. I think it is nothing short of <b>outrageous</b> and <b>disgraceful</b> to have this 'article' here. If it belongs anywhere, it should be in a hate speech page, Under <b>no</b> circumstances, even simply described as a 'slogan', should this be given an article under this heading. It is in <b>no way comparable</b> with a page like <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">fuck</a>. Fuck is a non-specific word, with a literal meaning that can in different contexts can be used 'deliberately' as an expletive or in some cases as method in particular contexts to add emphasis, as in 'it was fucking brilliant'. But this phrase is specifically targeted at one group in a naked expression of hatred. Calling it a slogan is questionable. But also a legal point. In many counties, using this phrase would actually amount to a criminal offence, as <b>incitement to hatred</b>. What is wiki's position <b>if printing this so-called slogan as an ARTICLE TITLE actually breaks the law in many countries, by being seen as incitment to hatred?</b> <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">JtdIrL</a> 21:01 Mar 2, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well-meaning bullshit, but still bullshit. I'm queer myself and don't find the article offensive; I find Sebastian Bach's attitude offensive.

<p>This has been discussed to death. It has been here and accepted by readers, users &amp; contributors. That IS a decision. If people wanted it moved, there would have been (yet) another debate. But yet again you have decided unilaterally that <i>you</i> are doing to put it where <i>you</i> want. If you think it should be moved, begin a debate here again with people and let them discuss it. Whatever decision they take is fine by me. Don't simply treat this like your prize possession that whenever the mood takes you you can simply move around. It isn't. If you want to move it, talk to people first. Or put on a summary message saying you think it should be moved and get some response, not wait until you think no-one is looking and do what you want. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">STÓD/ÉÍRE</a></p>
<p>STÓD/ÉÍRE, please don't accuse everyone who disagrees with you of making "unilateral decisions" and ignoring "consensus". There was originally an article specifically about the slogan, and there was no consensus to remove it in the first place; putting it back is just restoring things to the way things were. Several people said that there shouldn't be a separate article, but several people said there should. Witness the following:-</p>
<ol>
<li>Jimbo said on the mailing list that he thought an article on the slogan was okay: "Is the topic important enough to deserve it's own article? I think yes, it is, especially in conjunction with a more general article on homophobic hate speech."</li>
<li>Susan Mason said, "We can't have it in hate speech because its too limited and it needs its own page".</li>
<li>I said above, "the information is probably too specific to be comfortably absorbed into any more general article". I stand by this, since the article on anti-gay slogans looks very unbalanced with such a large proportion of it devoted to just one single slogan.</li>
<li>AxelBoldt still thinks the slogan should have its own article.</li>
</ol>
<p>So where's the consensus of which you speak, STÓD/ÉÍRE...? -- <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOliver_Pereira_ccc2.html" title="User:Oliver Pereira">Oliver P.</a> 10:46 Mar 14, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>So discuss moving it, how it would be restructed, etc. Axel yet again did one of his 'unilateral' moves without seeking agreement or telling anyone. Sv and I reverted it and if he tries <i>unilaterally</i> changing it without giving prior notice and asking opinions it will be reverted again. Jimbo didn't say there <i>should</i> be an article, he said there was no problem with an article. As for Susan, well . . . typical Susan. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">STÓD/ÉÍRE</a> 10:51 Mar 14, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I notice that you didn't answer my challenge from above, so I will repeat it here for reference.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please provide specific reference to the "at least three" decisions that "we" have made regarding this issue, as you claimed in your latest edit summary. Then stop referring to "consensus" where there is none. Then answer my arguments above.</dd>
</dl>
<p>You keep repeating that there was some decision by "readers, users &amp; contributors"; the only consensus I can discern here is the one among you and Stevertigo. I will note too that the article was moved from 'AIDS Kills Fags Dead' slogan to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-gay_slogan.html" title="Anti-gay slogan">Anti-gay slogan</a> by Stevertigo without any discussion or justification, except "(Removed text.. this just doesnt belong here.... sorry Homophobes....)" in the edit summary. As you rightly point out, Jimbo saw nothing wrong with the original article title, so Stevertigo's action required more justification than this, while my restoring the status quo did not; nevertheless I did justify it here.</p>
<p>Regarding the "discussion to death" you mention, I cannot find any cogent argument from Stevertigo, and the two arguments you have presented are</p>
<ul>
<li>the title 'AIDS Kills Fags Dead' slogan is offensive</li>
<li>the title 'AIDS Kills Fags Dead' slogan may be illegal</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding the first: I am admittedly a poor judge, since I don't know the feeling of being offended. However, I don't see how the quoted phrase can be offensive in the title but not in the article body. I would even argue that quotes cannot be offensive at all.</p>
<p>Regarding the second: Hate speech is legal in the U.S., and reporting about hate speech in a neutral way is legal everywhere.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>So discuss moving it, how it would be restructed, etc.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't understand what you want here, but I'll give it a shot anyway. The article is to be returned to its original title which presicely describes its contents, so that links to the phrase, of which there are now 5 all over Wikipedia, only link to the phrase and not to material only marginally related, like a general discussion of homophobic hate speech or anti-gay slogans. There is not going to be any restructuring; the article that was under 'AIDS Kills Fags Dead' slogan is to be restored, the material from <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-gay_slogan.html" title="Anti-gay slogan">anti-gay slogan</a> is to be removed and replaced with a link. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 18:41 Mar 14, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's not an attempt at bowdlerisation, it's for the same reason we don't have <i>separate articles about each and every Simpsons character</i> any more. There's very little in "anti-gay slogan", AKFD is the most famous anti-gay slogan, there are other less well-known ones which also belong in the same article.

<dd>Interesting point. I'm not sure I agree with it entirely, if at all, simply because most of the people on this page seem to be reacting to emotion and not logic, but whatever. I still think that one could make similar arguments about combining e.g. <a href="../../../f/o/l/Foley_artist.html" title="Foley artist">foley artist</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stand_in.html" title="Stand in">stand in</a> into terms about film or somesuch, which I would oppose as well. As far as I'm concerned, if it's more than a sentence or two, and certainly if it's as long as this article, it should be a separate article. But I'm not going to start an edit war over it, I just think this specific merge is probably irrational, and the general sense I get in reading this page is that people are not thinking past their own offense. <a href="../../../k/o/y/User%7EKoyaanis_Qatsi_7ab5.html" title="User:Koyaanis Qatsi">Koyaanis Qatsi</a> 17:59 2 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you think the arguments have already been dealt with and are applicable, you should have said so. You did not; you merely said "this should not be merged." Comments like this, without even a reference to an argument, are simply noise. As for past arguments, Axel Boldt's argument focuses on the linkability of the slogan, using a merged article "hate speech" as an example. This argument is valid; linkability should be retained. However, in all of the articles that currently link to AIDS Kills Fags Dead, a link to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-gay_slogan.html" title="Anti-gay slogan">anti-gay slogan</a> would be perfectly appropriate (e.g. ".. used the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-gay_slogan.html" title="Anti-gay slogan">anti-gay slogan</a> <i>Aids Kills Fags Dead</i>" or "invented the slogan <i>Aids Kills Fags Dead</i> (see <b><a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-gay_slogan.html" title="Anti-gay slogan">anti-gay slogan</a></b>)". Locating the correct section within that article is trivial since it focuses on a very narrowly defined subject, and it will be even easier with my automatically generated table of contents feature. In addition, a redirect is already in place. Lastly, it is quite likely that direct linking to individual sections will soon be possible. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a> 20:47 2 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So The Cunctator is all worked up about the merging. Again. *sigh*. And I <i>still</i> have heard him offer any logical argument put to justify his 'issue' here. Just yet more unilateralism again. Is it at all possible that sometime this decade The Cunctator could say more than 'this article should not be merged' and then go ahead unilaterally to demerge them? But then as was often said in the endless arguments the last time (and the time before, and the time before etc etc) The Cunctator will just go ahead and do what he wants anyhow. Why are we even wasting our time voting on it? Cunc will just do his own thing anyway. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 00:49 4 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been neglecting this discussion. Shame on me! Two points, one on each side:</p>
<ol>
<li>This is not analogous to the Simpsons characters. There, each character was a small article, so that content was put into a general Simpsons article and the character redirected there. When a character gets a lot of content (like <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bart_Simpson_19e2.html" title="Bart Simpson">Bart Simpson</a>), they get their own page. Here, <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_Kills_Fags_Dead_a93f.html" title="AIDS Kills Fags Dead">AKFD</a> has a lot of content, so it should get its own page. That <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-gay_slogan.html" title="Anti-gay slogan">Anti-gay slogan</a> has little content isn't relevant, since most of <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_Kills_Fags_Dead_a93f.html" title="AIDS Kills Fags Dead">AKFD</a> is too specific for that page. The proper action is to expand <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-gay_slogan.html" title="Anti-gay slogan">Anti-gay slogan</a> and live with its being short until that's done.</li>
<li><i>Point on redirect moved to <a href="../../../a/k/f/Talk%7EAKFD_redirect_cece.html" title="Talk:AKFD/redirect">Talk:AKFD/redirect</a></i></li>
</ol>
<p>These two points actually share something in common -- they're about not giving much credence to pages that were created only in the midst of the great edit/move war. <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-gay_slogan.html" title="Anti-gay slogan">Anti-gay slogan</a>, like the various "slogan" redirects, was created only in a silly attempt to <i>avoid</i> offence -- ironic that the various redirects now cause it! -- <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7EToby_Bartels_e090.html" title="User:Toby Bartels">Toby Bartels</a> 12:13 27 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>
