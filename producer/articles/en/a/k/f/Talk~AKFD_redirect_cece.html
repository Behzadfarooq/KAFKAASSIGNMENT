Refactoring by <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 22:01, 16 Aug 2003 (UTC), who voted for keeping many of these redirects</p>
<p>Many of the arguments for deletion are related to the search results for a search for "AIDS". See:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=site:www.wikipedia.org+AIDS" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=site:www.wikipedia.org+AIDS" rel="nofollow">google:AIDS</a> (English Wikipedia only)</li>

</ul>
<p><a name="Arguments_for_deletion" id="Arguments_for_deletion"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Arguments for deletion</span></h3>
<p>Arguments against redirects that do not have the word "slogan" in them, ie <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_Kills_Fags_Dead_a93f.html" title="AIDS Kills Fags Dead">AIDS Kills Fags Dead</a> and <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_kills_fags_dead_ea3d.html" title="AIDS kills fags dead">AIDS kills fags dead</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Make people think that this is an article expressing the POV of the slogan, rather than one which discusses the slogan in a neutral manner.</li>
<li>Cause offence (some think highly offensive)</li>
<li>Make Wikipedia look homophobic</li>
</ul>
<p>The arguments above are discussed with respect to what title the <i>article</i> should have at <a href="../../../a/k/f/Talk%7EAKFD_title_45aa.html" title="Talk:AKFD/title">Talk:AKFD/title</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_%28slogans%29_7438.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (slogans)">Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (slogans)</a>,</p>
<p>Arguments against having <i>too many</i> redirects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clutter up search results (for "AIDS", in particular, but other terms too)</li>
<li>Are annoying</li>
<li>Cause offence (some think highly offensive)</li>
<li>Make Wikipedia look homophobic</li>
<li>May incorrectly boost google <a href="../../../p/a/g/PageRank_8fe1.html" title="PageRank">PageRank</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Redirects are unused</li>
<li>Redirects are not useful (some qualify this by saying that <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_Kills_Fags_Dead_a93f.html" title="AIDS Kills Fags Dead">AIDS Kills Fags Dead</a> is useful, but not the rest)</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_kills_fags_dead_ea3d.html" title="AIDS kills fags dead">AIDS kills fags dead</a> should not be used in this form anyway.</li>
<li>These redirects are the result of a silly move/edit war.</li>
<li>Some of them were never used as the location of the article except for a very brief period</li>
</ul>
<p><i>this isn't the vote - it's just a section for providing reasons</i></p>
<p>Google pagerank trolling, highly offensive redirects, negative impact on searching for any word in title, etc.) <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Quinlan_49be.html" title="User:Daniel Quinlan">Daniel Quinlan</a> 08:27, Nov 17, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Redirects are meant to be helpful, not to preserve every possible permutation of every possible English spelling including misspellings. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarshman_417d.html" title="User:Marshman">Marshman</a> 17:01, 17 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Wikipedia now seems to be the main vehicle promoting this slogan. We don't "make the news". <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecretlondon_1805.html" title="User:Secretlondon">Secretlondon</a> 18:50, Nov 22, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Arguments for keeping</span></h3>
<p>Counter-arguments against the arguments proposed above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Since this article is related for AIDS, it is appropriate that it comes up in a search</li>
<li>The internal search results all have "slogan" placed appropriately, voiding this argument for deletion.</li>
<li>The external search results also have "slogan" placed appropriately, again voiding this argument.</li>
<li>The external search results do not show multiple results, as google merges them, so the argument that there are "too many" is void for external searches.</li>
<li>While internal search results do indeed show multiple results, this could be fixed: see <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/redirects_and_searching" class="extiw" title="meta:redirects_and_searching">meta:redirects and searching</a>. In any case, the number of multiple results is not wildly excessive.</li>
<li>Judging the offensiveness of slogans to determine whether redirects should be deleted violates NPOV</li>
</ul>
<p>Positive reasons to keep the redirects:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_Kills_Fags_Dead_a93f.html" title="AIDS Kills Fags Dead">AIDS Kills Fags Dead</a> is how we would normally title the page.</li>
<li>AIDS Kills Fags Dead (slogan) is the normal disambig style, which people may expect us to use.</li>
<li>AIDS Kills Fags Dead slogan is the "natural" disambig style (eg <a href="../../../j/a/v/Java_programming_language.html" title="Java programming language">Java programming language</a>), which people may expect us to use.</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_Kills_Fags_Dead_a93f.html" title="AIDS Kills Fags Dead">AIDS Kills Fags Dead</a> and <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_kills_fags_dead_ea3d.html" title="AIDS kills fags dead">AIDS kills fags dead</a> are both likely to be used for spontaneous links</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_Kills_Fags_Dead_a93f.html" title="AIDS Kills Fags Dead">AIDS Kills Fags Dead</a> is useful for linking</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/l/o/Slogan_%27AIDS_Kills_Fags_Dead%27_4dda.html" title="Slogan 'AIDS Kills Fags Dead'">Slogan 'AIDS Kills Fags Dead'</a> was around for a few months as the location of the article.</li>
<li>The standard arguments for keeping redirects in terms of avoiding broken links, etc</li>
</ul>
<p>On a side note, <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slogan_%27AIDS_Kills_Fags_Dead%27_4dda.html" title="Slogan 'AIDS Kills Fags Dead'">Slogan 'AIDS Kills Fags Dead'</a> contains some of the history of the material in <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-gay_slogan.html" title="Anti-gay slogan">anti-gay slogan</a> - but not all. the /page history might be one solution to this. Another might be to merge page histories (with caution). <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 18:44, 22 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>This one seems to have less support for deletion, both now and in July. Taking into account both months, just over half want this deleted. This rises to 75% in November, but is still a less clear consensus than the others I just deleted. It was also (I think) the original title of the article, which would seem some reason to keep this one more than the other ones. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a> 03:33, 29 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

</ul>

<p><i>These three were deleted on November 29th, having been on VfD for nearly two weeks. They all had near unanimous support for deletion in November, with the only opposing vote being made by <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7EReddi_47d8.html" title="User:Reddi">JDR</a> who had given no reason for this opposition. The total of the July and November votes were in all cases above 2/3 in favour of deletion, with 77% and 79% in favour of the first two. The July votes were given less weight as the nature of the issue had changed since the original article they were redirecting to no longer existed, except as a redirect itself. Note that <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLynch_c3a9.html" title="User:JackLynch">JackLynch's</a> vote was made after the deletion occured.</i></p>

<li>It was debated whether to require a 2/3 majority, or have a simple majority. This debate took place after many votes were cast.</li>
<li><a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Starling_d5f6.html" title="User:Tim Starling">Tim Starling</a> was unhappy at this, feeling that it ruined the chances of setting a useful precedent.</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> suggested that a mere opinion poll might be helpful, so not to give up hope. Tim Starling concurred.</li>
<li>People who had previously expressed an opinion were contactedby <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a>, and the vote was advertised in a few places, and this seemed satisfactorary.</li>
<li><a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7EToby_Bartels_e090.html" title="User:Toby Bartels">Toby Bartels</a> stated that "NPOV outranks votes" (because NPOV requires this article to be treated like others, regardless of people's opinions about the matters that it discusses).</li>
<li><a href="../../../k/o/y/User%7EKoyaanis_Qatsi_7ab5.html" title="User:Koyaanis Qatsi">Koyaanis Qatsi</a> argued that the vote was not valid, saying "deleting these redirects ... is a violation of NPOV".

<li><a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim_Starling_d5f6.html" title="User:Tim Starling">Tim Starling</a> disagreed - saying that policy was decided by consensus, and if the vote went against policy, then in some sense it is a vote on policy change.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The July compromise</span></h2>
<p>It's been a little while, and I think everyone's said what they want to. Would it be worth listing the least-supported redirect ('AIDS Kills Fags Dead' slogan) on VfD, copying across the votes to date, and taking it from there? The others all seems to have quite strong (if minority) support, but perhaps we can toss one redirect to the wolves to save the rest?&#160;;-) <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 12:36 27 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've just contacted the three who voted against deletion (Optigan, KQ, and Oliver P) - I hope they'll be willing to accept one deletion as a compromise.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'll just wait to see what they say - if they've no objections to this compromise, then the deletion should proceed nice and smoothly. Here's hoping. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a></p>

<dd>Hello. Yes, go on, then. If that's the compromise, I'll agree to it. I have a sneaking suspicion that this is one of those <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thin_end_of_the_wedge.html" title="Thin end of the wedge">thin end of the wedge</a> things (or do I mean a <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slippery_slope.html" title="Slippery slope">slippery slope</a> thing?) but if things start doing whatever they're supposed to do according to whatever metaphor it is that I'm thinking of, I'll think about it again then... -- <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOliver_Pereira_ccc2.html" title="User:Oliver Pereira">Oliver P.</a> 21:07, 6 Aug 2003 (UTC) <i>(links added)</i></dd>

<p>Thanks Oliver. I've updated my vote to reflect my support for this as a compromise option. Of course, I can make no promises...&#160;;-) <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a></p>
<p>As well as Oliver, also contacted KQ and Optigan. Optigan did not respond. KQ said that his opinion had not changed: he still opposed deletion of <i>any</i> redirects. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 22:16, 16 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>

He also suggests that those who voted at VfD for deleting redirects need to reregister their "apparent" votes in what he considers the "official place for such votes: namely <strong class="selflink">Talk:AKFD/redirect</strong>". --<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeone_else_bc03.html" title="User:Someone else">Someone else</a></p>

<dd>As far as I'm concerned (and I'm not alone in this), there was no "concord" on VfD. There was just a heck of a lot of confusion. A number of people expressed the general feeling that some stuff should be deleted (or, indeed, kept) without explicitly saying whether redirects were one of those things. That doesn't help us very much.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Where comments were definate, eg Jtdirl's comment of "delete this article <i>and all its unnecessary redirects</i>, then I've copied those across. But I'm not going to go around assuming that people who were more vague agree with either me, or with you.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Note that some people, both for and against deletion of these redirects, will not have bothered to re-express their vote when they've already made their position clear.

<dd>The articles they voted on are not the articles that exist now. They voted on redirects to "AIDS Kills Fags Dead", they didn't vote on redirects to "Gay hate speech". There's no vote "in progress": there was a previous vote that was acted on (and therefore must have ended.)

<p>Since you bring up real world politics, I'll remind you that most democracies have a vote every four years, not every four months. Where there are referundums, the practice of continually calling referendums until you get the "right" result is widely regarded as an abuse of the system. Not that this gets us anywhere.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Most legislative bodies have a vote every day. And votes for bills which have been rewritten have to be recast. The idea that a vote to keep "AIDS Kills Fags Dead" when it was an article should be counted as a vote to keep it now that it is a redirect should be a non-starter. -- <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeone_else_bc03.html" title="User:Someone else">Someone else</a> 19:37, 22 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Think through the consequences of that position: suppose an article is listed on VfD for four days, has a hundred votes to delete, and then someone comes along and corrects a few spelling errors. Should we ignore all the previously expressed opinions and start again?</dd>

<dd>I'm not arguing that opinions expressed in July need to be considered equal to opinions expressed now - I'm just arguing that they should not be ignored.

<dd>Yet the vote you've set up counts votes for a substantively different matter (not a spelling change) as equal to votes which reflect current reality and article content.

<dd>Not true: I clearly distinguish between the two types of votes. It is up to individuals to decide how much weight to give July votes vis-a-vis November votes. I am certainly not demanding that they be treated equally. Many of them are still here, incidentally.</dd>

<p>Martin, this is getting a <i>tad</i> confusing. It seems that we spend all the time voting on this issue. And everytime we seem to make a decision it is ignored and we start again. And again. And again. If we this time vote to delete these, can they <i>please</i> be deleted this time. And can we please have a vote on one page. At this stage these debate pages seem to be breeding like rabbits. Not alone, IMHO do we have a crazy number of redirects for a page with little credibility, we now seem to have a crazy number of pages about the redirects. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 22:03, 22 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, I'm not sure what you think we decided previously that has been ignored? Back in July, we decided to delete the redirect 'AIDS Kills Fags Dead' slogan, and it was deleted, as Oliver agreed to compromise on the redirect in question. On the matter of the other redirects, there was no decision either way, because a number of people voted to keep some or all of them. Since then, the issue has been periodically raised in <i>discussion</i>, quite strongly at times, but not got as far as another decision. The one time we did was with the two redirects that got an 80% vote for deletion, and Angela implemented that deletion.</p>
<p>I agree, it would be good to have the debate on deleting the redirects on one page: <b>this page</b>. That's what I said when this was re-listed on VfD this month. Unfortunately, a few people decided to ignore that suggestion, and instead expressed their views on VfD itself, or elsewhere, and often not particularly clearly, either. I continue to recommend that talk about the deletion of AKFD redirects should be located here on <strong class="selflink">talk:AKFD/redirect</strong>, as I have done whenever the issue was raised. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 23:00, 22 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Actually Martin is correct. There are some debates that are simply too long for VfD and so are redirected to /delete pages from the VfD. But the whole point of the /delete link is to make it clear they are a branch off the VfD page (and also then to preserve an archive afterwards). /redirect makes it sound like it is just another <i>lets talk around in circles for ages until we are all bored and nothing gets done</i> page. It should be at a /delete page, and follow the same rules as the rest. A decision taken in <b>7</b> days, and like all other pages on the VfD page, taken by votes cast <i>now</i>, not months ago, which is an utterly crazy notion that seems to have been dreamt up to keep these nonsensical AFKD redirects alive. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 00:38, 23 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To be fair, this page does precede much of the discussion we had on how to do deletion debates on seperate pages, so it's not entirely surprising mistakes were made. Today, I would have titled this page <i>/deletion of redirects</i>, and I'm sure Tim would have taken a different approach too.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It looks like we're going to get complete consensus on the talk page redirects, and probably rough consensus on at least two of the other redirects, perhaps more. So, even if we don't eliminate you problem with these redirects, we should at least reduce it sharply. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 00:52, 23 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It does certainly <i>seem</i> like extraordinary measures are being taken to avoid these specific deletions. It's the "herding cats" or "picking up mercury" scheme: as soon as a decision seems near, discussion is fragmented and shifted elsewhere. -- <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeone_else_bc03.html" title="User:Someone else">Someone else</a> 00:45, 23 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, my <i>impression</i> is that you are subverting the usual deletion process in order to preserve these pages.

<dd>Whether this is best page or not, it is the better than leaving it on VfD and I don't think whatever you regard as "<i>usual deletion process</i>" can be applied. It is clear this is not a normal set of pages, so the process is going to be different, as the pages have already been listed for deletion. There aren't any clear precedents, that I am aware of, that show what is done with relisted pages, so the process will be different. Regarding the move from VfD; that page was already far too long and people were just rambling on without even making it clear what they wanted deleted. This is why it was not possible to make a decision on these articles today - because there was no clear consensus. There was no <i>clear</i> anything. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a> 01:04, 23 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK. Here's a proposal. Start again. Create a AFKD redirects/delete page. Msg <i>everyone</i> who previously expressed an opinion before and ask them to come and vote. Put a banner message on the Recent Changes page and write to the wikip lists. Give it a clear timespan, say 10 days. Then ask people to vote on the following</p>
<ul>
<li>Delete ALL redirects:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Yes? - <i>thank you for voting</i>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>No?
<ul>
<li>keep them all? - <i>thank you for voting</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>No&#160;: Keep some, delete others? <i>Here is a list of redirects: Please indicate whether</i> it <i>should be deleted. Please also express an opinion on</i> each<i>.</i>
<ul>
<li>Redirect 1:</li>
<li>Redirect 2:</li>
<li>Redirect 3:</li>
</ul>

<p>...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Redirect 294:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Then tally the votes.</p>
<ul>
<li>If 2/3 say delete them all, delete them.</li>
<li>If 2/3 don't say delete, tally the individual votes on each redirect, Votes to delete everything + vote to delete specific redirect. If that accounts to 2/3 of votes cast on that option (delete everything + delete nothing + delete that specific one + don't delete that specific one) say delete, then delete. If less than 2/3 say delete, don't delete. <i>Issue solved</i>. --Jtdirl</li>
</ul>
<p>Another point you may want to consider is whether it would be best to discuss the article itself first, and only once a decision is made on that are the redirects discussed. If <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slogan_%27AIDS_Kills_Fags_Dead%27_4dda.html" title="Slogan 'AIDS Kills Fags Dead'">Slogan 'AIDS Kills Fags Dead'</a> is deleted, then obviously anything that ever redirected to it can be deleted, because they will be redirecting to a deleted article. They would be instantly deletable without votes or discussion as with any other redirect to a deleted page. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a> 01:32, 23 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Google link I gave was just hits within Wikipedia so I'm not sure what your point is, and if there is a difference of opinion, it isn't with me. I don't have any opinion on whether these are kept or not. I was just trying to decide the results of the vote and deleted according to what I felt the rough consensus was. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a> 06:51, 29 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I guess I didn't understand. Anyways, I think the amount of google hits on this subject is a fact of some relevence here. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLynch_c3a9.html" title="User:JackLynch">JackLynch</a> 07:05, 29 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Angela writes, "I was just trying to decide the results of the vote and deleted according to what I felt the rough consensus was." Hmm. I'm sure you acted in good faith, but I understood from the sentence "This was once a vote, but is now just an informal poll," that... well, that it wasn't a vote, but just an informal poll. Actually, I don't think there should be a distinction, because I don't think that decisions should be made by formal voting at all. But the fact that in ths case such a distinction was apparently being made needs to be recognised. I was under the impression that the formal vote was still to come. I therefore assumed that this was still up for discussion, and was still planning to contribute. I didn't see an announcement that it had become any sort of formal vote, or an announcement of when the formal vote was going to start, or when it was going to end, or what criteria were going to be used to decide the outcome of the vote. I also wasn't aware of any agreement on how the votes in the different months were to be weighted. (I consider it to be the same issue now as it was in July; the fact that the content has moved doesn't mean that people are now less willing to find it.) I therefore think that the deletions were out of process. What do other people think? -- <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOliver_Pereira_ccc2.html" title="User:Oliver Pereira">Oliver P.</a> 07:54, 1 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Aaaargh! Why did I ever get in involved in this? If you feel they are out of process, the undeletion policy states they may be undeleted and relisted on VfD. However, if you do this, may I please request that you attempt to contain the arguments on this page somehow rather than allowing it to spread all over the place again (VfD, VfU, dozens of user pages, archived delete pages etc) as was done a couple of weeks ago.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Personally, I think it is clear this was a vote. There is one line on this page that suggests it is not a vote. This is, I believe, left over from an older discussion and is not something which was added for this particular round of voting. <i>[Martin: Angela is correct - this was from the July round]</i> In contrast to that see the "<b>Voting</b> procedure" subheading on the page, the use of phrases such as "Please add your <b>vote</b> with...", links from VfD and RfD for over two weeks saying "please <b>vote</b> at <strong class="selflink">Talk:AKFD/redirect</strong>, messages left on various user talk pages asking people to confirm their <b>vote</b> and discussions on this page and elsewhere about whether the old <b>votes</b> be counted or not. The top of the page says "If you came here to <b>vote</b> on deletion of redirects, as discussed on VfD, there are NINE separate ones here for you to <b>vote</b> on." Also, it was not only votes taken into account, but the discussions as well, many of which do seem obsolete now the article does not exist.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I really can't see how there can be any confusion over the fact that people were voting and this might lead to deletion, but if you, Oliver, did hold this view that there was no such vote, please do undelete them and kick off the fight again. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a> 12:34, 1 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oliver, perhaps you should simply update your opinion on the vote (move after the "|time|" marker, express your opinions on the new items, etc). If sufficient people come here later and do likewise, we might want to reconsider deletion at that point. Regards process, it seems clear to me that Angela judged whether there was "rough consensus" in good faith and to the best of her abilities, so I think it was <i>in process</i>, even if reasonable people can disagree over whether it was <i>correct</i>. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 21:54, 1 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, I wasn't disputing that Angela was acting in good faith and to the best of her abilities and all that. I think she does a very good job, even if I disagree with her about things. I'm still not sure about the process, though, because although it was clear that something that some people described as "voting" was going on, it wasn't clear (to me, at least) how long it was going on for, and what criteria were going to be used to decide the outcome. But since this case was pretty much unprecedented, I'm going to conclude that there was no <i>process</i> to be <i>in</i> or <i>out of</i>, so I'll retract my accusation and apologise for making it (sorry, Angela)... Anyway, I've updated my votes, although I still haven't changed them for the ones I'd already voted on. -- <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOliver_Pereira_ccc2.html" title="User:Oliver Pereira">Oliver P.</a> 05:14, 5 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>
