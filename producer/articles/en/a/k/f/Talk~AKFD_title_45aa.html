<p>NPOV? You have got to kidding. Whatever about the content which is NPOV, the title is blatent encitement. If someone used a slogan 'kill pakis' it would not be used as the title; an NPOV title would be used linking to the page. NPOV doesn't simply mean content of a page, it also refers to the article title. And you can hardly find an article title more POV and less NPOV than this. If this belongs anywhere, it should be on the Sebastian Bach or Westboro Baptist Church, <i>not</i> on its own with a title like this greeting Wiki users.

<dd>I was just going to ask the same thing, since the original article is about the slogan as a slogan. I just saw part of the movie about the Laramie goings-on last night, and noticed that particular slogan in the background in a couple scenes, so when it appeared today in <a href="../../../r/e/c/Special%7ERecentchanges_05b8.html" title="Special:Recentchanges">Recent changes</a>, I was instantly interested in reading about it. Wikipedia already has article titles like <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">fuck</a> that are thoroughly offensive to large percentages of our intended audience, so somebody has already decided that the space of acceptable article titles is pretty broad. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan Shebs</a> 23:54 Feb 24, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What is the basis in law for the claim that the phrase, <i>in quotes</i> in an article title, could be construed as incitement to hatred in some countries? <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 01:36 Mar 3, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>In many European states, <i>Incitement to Hatred</i> legislation prohibits the use of a term that by its usage or reportage can be conscrued, however unintentionally, as encouraging the expression and reinforcing the opinion of hatred, based on gender, orientation, disability, race or belief. In this context,</p>
<ul>
<li>the use of the headline was unnecessarily provocative, in so far as other means could be used to convey the information;</li>
<li>it breaks general publishing ettiquete of usage regarding offensive slogans in encyclopædiæ and source-books, in which such slogans feature <i>within</i> the text of the article but <i>not</i> as the primary definitionary title; (such a title would never be used in any mainstream encyclopædia, for example because it would see seen as unnecessary provocative, POV and giving credence by usage to the term, even if that had not been the intention of the author or publisher, indeed they may have intended the exact opposite.)</li>
<li>As Jimbo Wales confirmed, it also ran contrary to Wikipedia's own rules and if it had not been renamed, would probably have been removed as a violation of Wikipedia's own mandate, principles and ethos.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the US has established the freedom of the press under the 5th Amendment, no such 'absolute' right exists in almost any other jurisdiction. In covering issues like that espoused in the words of the slogan, most publishing organs (whether the media or sourcebooks), both as a matter of principle and also because of legal considerations, would not contemplate using such a phrase in a headline or title. Putting it in quotations in itself is no defence if the fact that it is in quotations is not clearly shown to be an unambiguous disclaimer. Even on a printed page, that is difficult, unless you use a bolded large font for the quotations than for the quote. On a computer screen, it is almost impossible to visually draw instantaneous attention to the quotes before the quotation. That is why such a quote is by definition not used in a title, certainly not when the title consists almost solely of those words. Similarly, phrases that are used like 'kill the infidel', etc are not used in titles, but given a neutral NPOV definition in the title which they leads to the article explaining the quote, its meaning and context. Saying that you are simply reporting or explaining facts is no defence if you had the option of conveying the information in a less provocative manner and <i>chose</i> not to do so. Equally saying the <i>content</i> of the article showed the article was not intended to incite hatred would be no defence, for the issue would be the <i>title</i>, especially as anyone looking through Wiki would see the article title but only a small number would go so far as to read it, especially as some would interpret the title as suggesting that the article was at best validating, even if not agreeing with the phrase.</p>
<p>While the odds on Wiki running into legal problems were slim, the biggest danger was that some journalist doing a goggle search or having come into Wiki would have found the article title, contacted a body like in Ireland the <i>Equality Authority</i> or the Director of Public Prosecutions' office asked for a comment, got a condemnation, and then ran a major story - US WEBSITE ACCUSED OF ATTACKING GAYS, ENCYCLOPÆDIA ACCUSED OF GAY ATTACK, etc and <i>calls</i> from politicians, the media and gay rights groups, for criminal prosecution under the <i>Incitement to Hatred Act</i>, promoting a lot of very negative publiciity for Wikipedia and damaging its reputation, all for the sake of a badly worded title that broke wiki's own rules in the first place and for which, as Svevertigo has shown, there was a clear, less offensive and provocative alternative. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">JtdIrL</a> 03:06 Mar 3, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Heh, with all the US-bashing of late (and mind you, I'm no fan of Bush), it's ironic that it's the US where something this difficult doesn't have to be hidden away.

<p><i>after move to <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homophobic_hate_speech.html" title="Homophobic hate speech">homophobic hate speech</a>.</i></p>
<p>Why is this article titled "Homophobic hate speech", yet it only contains one example and no further discussion of the concept in the title? <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 01:36 Mar 3, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_Kills_Fags_Dead_a93f.html" title="AIDS Kills Fags Dead">old title</a> was offensive given the subject (Homophobic hate speech). Other cases can and should be added. See the 'Don't Overdo it' section on <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28common_names%29_764d.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)</a>. The other page title would be like having the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexual.html" title="Homosexual">homosexual</a> article at <a href="../../../f/a/g/Fag.html" title="Fag">fag</a> (which is the home of an article about the use of the word - which is fine). But the old title made an express POV statement. --mav</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The old title had the phrase in quotes; how could that possibly be offensive? The subject of the article is <i>not</i> homophobic hate speech as everyone here seems to agree; the subject of the article is the slogan. The article's subject does not agree with the title. Whoever renamed needs to justify the name change. <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 01:57 Mar 3, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Then Homophobic slogan would be a better title for this subject area. Slogans are designed to carry a specific POV message in and of themselves. How does 'George Bush kills babies' or 'AIDS kills niggers dead' sound? It causes a reaction in and of itself. We needn't have a single article on each of these slogans. The general rule we follow here is that we do not have articles on specific terms. There are a few exceptions but only for the most famous examples. --mav</dd>

<dd>The title "homophobic hate speech" had been suggested as "better" by Oliver Pereira, and Tannin agreed.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It seems that I've been misunderstood again... Hopefully now that Jimbo has said the article is okay, the issue will be settled quickly, but just in case it isn't, I think I'd better clarify my position.</p>
<p>My words were, "perhaps a more general article on homophobic hate speech would be better". This was in a list summarising the arguments (as I perceived them) against there being an article specifically about the phrase "AIDS Kills Fags Dead".</p>
<p>Just to make sure it's clear, my summarising the arguments didn't mean that I agreed with them. However, in this case, I did agree with the <i>statement</i>, although I did point out at the end of the post that I wasn't convinced by it as an <i>argument</i>. That is, I agreed that a more general <i>article</i> would be better, but pointed out that no such article had at that time been written. I apologise if my meaning was not clear, but I meant that in the absence of a wide-ranging article which could comfortably absorb the information from the "AIDS Kills Fags Dead" article, the mere fact that such an article <i>would</i> be better <i>if</i> it existed was not a convincing argument for the removal of the "AIDS Kills Fags Dead" article.</p>
<p>I'm still not convinced by any of the arguments against the presence of the article (now thankfully renamed), and have now decided that the information is probably too specific to be comfortably absorbed into any more general article. I have therefore now decided that I support the existence of the article. (I'm <i>still</i> not entirely sure about the name, though. I think the slogan 'AIDS Kills Fags Dead' would be less startling. The current title might look at first glance as if we're making a statement, and requires reading to the end of the title to see that it's about a slogan.) -- <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOliver_Pereira_ccc2.html" title="User:Oliver Pereira">Oliver P.</a> 13:38 Mar 3, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is a logical article title. There is a TV ad on British and Irish television where a product is advertised by saying 'it does exactly as it says on the tin'. When this is an article that is about exactly what the article title says. It is unoffensive (unlike the earlier attempt), it is accurate and its sums up <i>exactly</i> what the article is about.

<li>I agree the discussion should be kept. One solution might be to change the titles of the talk pages to remove the actual slogan from them, such as <strong class="selflink">Talk:AKFD/title</strong> rather than Talk:Slogan 'AIDS Kills Fags Dead'/title. That does cause problems with broken links though. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a>

<li>It's only removing the title from the talk pages, not the article itself. The point is to have fewer pages with this in the title to prevent it showing up so many times in the search. There is no reason at all that it should obscure what the discussion is about. If necessary, a line could be added to each to talk page stating the page is discussing the article with the title "Slogan 'AIDS Kills Fags Dead'" if it isn't already clear. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a> 02:16, 17 Nov 2003 (UTC)</li>

<li>Because more redirects keep getting made would be just one reason. --<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeone_else_bc03.html" title="User:Someone else">Someone else</a> 01:56, 20 Nov 2003 (UTC)</li>

<li>It would be, if it were true. No new AKFD redirects were made between the two times you [and Daniel] listed these pages on VfD. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 02:48, 20 Nov 2003 (UTC)

<li>It is difficult to find <b>exactly</b> how many AKFD redirects there are. My apologies if the two additional redirects/five additional talk pages were created earlier rather than later. Nonetheless, they need deletion. So far the argument for keeping them seems to be "they have histories". Perhaps we could prevail upon a developer to join the histories to the page on which the "info" lands? -- <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeone_else_bc03.html" title="User:Someone else">Someone else</a> 03:02, 20 Nov 2003 (UTC)

<li>Apology accepted. Try the "What links here" links to get a complete list of redirects, and the "Page history" links to find out when they were created. Similarly for the talk pages. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 03:16, 20 Nov 2003 (UTC)</li>

<li>Please delete all these articles/redirects. The content has been sufficiently moved to a new home, and all the debate about redirects, etc. is now moot. --<a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinesweeper_5696.html" title="User:Minesweeper">Minesweeper</a> 23:41, Nov 20, 2003 (UTC)

<li>I love this vote. This particular thread is discussing the deletion of certain talk pages. And Minesweeper says "delete all these articles/redirects" - they are neither! Heh, I guess this is what happens when VfD discussions get too long. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 01:00, 22 Nov 2003 (UTC)</li>

<li>Can anyone find ANY page ANYWHERE on the Internet that has the phrase "AIDS Kills Fags Dead" in its title? Other than in the Wikipedia, that is, which seems to have a great many of them. Do we have them all? And if so, can't we limit ourselves to having all 2 of them (an article and ONE talk page? -- <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeone_else_bc03.html" title="User:Someone else">Someone else</a> 07:10, 19 Nov 2003 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We have five(?) talk pages because people on Wikipedia have spent so much time talking about this article. If you dislike that, you're welcome to stop talking about it. And yes, I can find pages with "AIDS Kills Fags Dead" in the title - google groups has bunches of them. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 22:53, 19 Nov 2003 (UTC)

<li>No, we have five talk pages because the talk has not been gathered in one place. And I don't consider wikipedia pages and e-mails equivalent.--<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeone_else_bc03.html" title="User:Someone else">Someone else</a> 01:56, 20 Nov 2003 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And the reason I split the talk pages up and spent time refactoring them was because people spent so much time talking about it. Since you're the first person in the history of Wikipedia to complain about the existence of talk archives, you'll excuse me if I didn't anticipate your comlaint. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 02:56, 20 Nov 2003 (UTC)
