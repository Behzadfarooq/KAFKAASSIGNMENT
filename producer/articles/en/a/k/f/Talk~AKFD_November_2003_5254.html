<li>You certainly need VfD if you want to delete the redirect, don't you? 10 pages with AKFD in their titles pointing somewhere is still gonna rack up the google hits. -- <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeone_else_bc03.html" title="User:Someone else">Someone else</a> 19:56, 16 Nov 2003 (UTC)

<li>Sure, but first see if you can get agreement for merging the content, at <a href="../../../a/k/f/Talk%7EAKFD_merge_8b41.html" title="Talk:AKFD/merge">Talk:AKFD/merge</a>, then merge the content, and <i>then</i> see about deleting the resultant redirect, if you still feel that's necessary. IMO. Note that redirects don't "rack up the google hits" - google is smart enough to only give one hit, no matter how many redirects we create. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 23:04, 16 Nov 2003 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete. I don't think it is encyclopedic.

<li>The slogan has been dealt with in an NPOV way (I think if <i>anything</i>, people will surmise that the people writing the article have an <i>anti</i>-hate-speech bias). Plus the slogan was real and appeared in multiple places before anyone came along and wrote a Wikipedia article about it. So the slogan is a legitimate topic. It also is a legitimate SLOGAN, and not just a collocation of words. Compare this to "Bush is an idiot". Anyone who thinks George W. Bush = idiot could come up with the latter sentence independently (with idiot being a popular noun of choice for someone stupid, and stupidity being a not uncommon trait perceived in the president). "AIDS kills fags dead", conversely, only evolved once, and everyone else who used the phrase got it from him. The phrase required some originality and wit in order to coin, and the wording is distinctive (a person who wanted to say that AIDS was intended for killing gay people as God's form of "death control" for their sinfulness might spontaneously come up with "God made AIDS to kill gays" or "AIDS kills gays", or even "AIDS kills fags", but a speaker of modern English would not likely naturally come up with "AIDS kills fags dead". If the number of appearances really bothers you, you can get rid of a few of the less likely permutations as redirects (<b>AIDS kills fags dead</b> is an obvious possibility that people might search for, but <b>Slogan:AIDS Kills Fags Dead</b> without a whitespace after the colon is unlikely for someone typing it in in the URL box.) <a href="../../../w/i/w/User%7EWiwaxia_c8bb.html" title="User:Wiwaxia">Wiwaxia</a> 00:28, 25 Nov 2003 (UTC)</li>

<li>
<ul>
<li>Searching for "AIDS kills fags dead" on the web now gets wikipedia-derived hits in 8 of the first 11 spots. We're not simply reporting anymore: we're actively promoting this lovely sentiment. Time to shove this toothpaste back into the tube. -- <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeone_else_bc03.html" title="User:Someone else">Someone else</a> 17:14, 16 Nov 2003 (UTC)</li>
<li>Promoting the sentiment? Does having an article on <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazism</a> promote Nazism? Having lots of hits for Wikipedia articles does promote <i>Wikipedia</i>, I suppose, but I think that's a good thing.&#160;:) -- <a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOliver_Pereira_ccc2.html" title="User:Oliver Pereira">Oliver P.</a> 00:39, 17 Nov 2003 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is not like having an article on <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazism</a>, it's like having lots of pages whose titles are Nazi anti-Jewish slogans. <a href="../../../b/m/i/User%7EBmills_b6ed.html" title="User:Bmills">Bmills</a> 09:46, 20 Nov 2003 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>and that these slogans were marginal until we decided to promote them. I don't think this does wikipedia any favours. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecretlondon_1805.html" title="User:Secretlondon">Secretlondon</a> 09:59, Nov 20, 2003 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Having redirects from every marginal variation does suggest that we want to call special attention to it, yes. An encyclopedia with more entries in its index pointing to AKFD than it does to, oh, say, Nazi, does suggest that the encyclopedia is especially fond of the former, and has little rational planning or forethought about emphasizing important rather than unimportant concepts. The fact that you have to scroll down the bage to get to non-Wikipedia-related hits also suggests we might be inflating the importance of this particular phrase. And not all publicity is good publicity. -- <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeone_else_bc03.html" title="User:Someone else">Someone else</a> 00:57, 17 Nov 2003 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And that's exactly what we deserve. If we had left that informative and harmless article alone after it had been written and posted by, I think, <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">Axel Boldt</a>, there wouldn't be anything to complain about now. (Due to all those redirects it's now also difficult to find the original text.) Reading the above comments shows me that right now people aren't even sure <b>what</b> they want deleted -- the article itself or just the numerous redirects. Two more things (again): (1) Writing about a particular subject does <b>not</b> imply advocating it, just as it does not imply opposing it. Please see the <a href="../../../u/s/e/Use-mention_distinction.html" title="Use-mention distinction">use-mention distinction</a>. (2) Is there some kind of guideline on what to do when, after consensus or at least a majority decision has been reached and the matter is dropped, it is revived at a later point by someone who has just discovered Wikipedia? (I can hear voices telling me this doesn't belong here, so I may post my second question again at a more appropriate place.) --<a href="../../../k/f/_/User%7EKF_917d.html" title="User:KF">KF</a> 09:21, 17 Nov 2003 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To respond to Someone Else's comment about google hits, I think on balance I'm not too depressed if it takes longer for some Nazi punk to find a hate site because they keep getting hits from a respectable encyclopedia with a policy of writing from a neutral point of view. In any case, most of the Wikipedia-related hits are not being listed for deletion, being mailing list posts, user talk pages, meta pages, and other encyclopedic articles like <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Phelps_24e6.html" title="Fred Phelps">Fred Phelps</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/i/Raid_bug_spray.html" title="Raid bug spray">Raid bug spray</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_Shepard_ac9c.html" title="Matthew Shepard">Matthew Shepard</a>, etc. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 19:01, 17 Nov 2003 (UTC)</li>
<li>Delete. As SomeoneElse said, once we start "making the news" and bring up the majority of mentions/hits of the term, we are the ones determining the general popularity of the phrase. This is problematic. <a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzheado_f8f0.html" title="User:Fuzheado">Fuzheado</a> 00:06, 18 Nov 2003 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia doesn't make up the majority of hits on the google-indexed web: it's 84 of a total of 198, most of which are at our mirrors, or in places that nobody's proposed for deletion, such as meta, mailing list, or articles like <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Phelps_24e6.html" title="Fred Phelps">Fred Phelps</a>. It also doesn't make up any of the 494 hits on google groups. I doubt it makes up a significant minority of mentions in the real world - last I checked, folks who waved anti-gay banners tend not to do so in the context of building a collaborative encyclopedia. Nor are we making the news - neither of the two references to "AIDS Kills Fags Dead" on google news at the time of writing had anything to do with Wikipedia. On a side note, you haven't said what you want to delete, which would seem to be relevant. <a href="../../../m/y/r/User%7EMyRedDice_bcb5.html" title="User:MyRedDice">Martin</a> 22:59, 19 Nov 2003 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, accepting this straw-man argument at face value, it's not much better for us to have 17% of all the hits on the web. On a side note, I'd propose combining all talk on one page, and delting all redirects. If all the material now resides at "anti-gay speech", I'd advocate deleting all AKFD redirects. That would leave the material at "anti-gay speech" and rid us of our intensive network of AKFD redirects, and stop the emphasis on this particular page. -- <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeone_else_bc03.html" title="User:Someone else">Someone else</a> 01:56, 20 Nov 2003 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think its already been deleted, but I think the link from "AIDS kills fags dead" should continue to redirect to the anti-gay slogan article. This is very useful for people looking for articles of all sorts of topics. Wikipedia is not the easiest place to navigate, and things like this help alot. Access to info is good for everyone.
