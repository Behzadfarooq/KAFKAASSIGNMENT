<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/k/f/User_talk%7EAkfraik_0152.html" title="Edit section: Emperor Wu Debate">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Emperor Wu Debate</span></h2>
<p>Wudi (also known as Wu) ruled as emperor, of the Han Dynasty, from Jingdi in 156 B.C. Wudi was a good ruler of the people of China during the Han Dynasty. Wudi was a good Emperor because he followed the principles and rules found in “The Mandate of Heaven” and he did as his people wanted.</p>
<p>During the early years of his rule, Wu was a good emperor because he followed the Mandate of Heaven. He re-established a strong, central government and introduced Confucianism as a political philosophy. People could now take exams to for a civil service position and over 130,000 people would take it. Those who received the highest score would first become a civil servant. After proving himself able as a clerk, he might then move on to becoming a manger. Some would even be promoted to a higher position in the regional capital.</p>
<p>The Mandate of Heaven was created during the Zhou Dynasty as a concept used first by kings, then by emperors to rule. It was based on a blessing from Heaven, similar to a set of instruction, on how the kingdom should be ruled. If Heaven is displeased by what they are seeing, the present dynasty falls apart and the next dynasty forms.</p>
<p>Shortly after Wu became emperor, he created a new law. He did not like that the eldest inherited the crown, the estates and the land. So he made a new law claiming that everyone had an equal share and that everyone had a chance to be emperor.</p>
<p>Wu also followed the Mandate of Heaven mandate of heaven by providing protection to China. Wu did not think the defense wall (Great Wall of China) would be able to withstand future attacks. When China rose economically, Wu waged war and ceased payment to Xiongnu (Inner Mongolia). Wu thought that they were strong enough and that they could beat Xiongnu. People later viewed Wu brave and vigor.</p>
<p>Wu was able to support education, defense and re-establishment of the new government. Though, around this time, Wu began his search for immortality. He associated with magicians who claimed they could make divine pills with the right ingredients. Later, he began to worship various gods and continued his search. The magicians were highly rewarded. Some with political power, one even married his daughter (however, later executed as a fraud). I think he became more self-centered and did things his way instead of what was best for China.</p>
<p>In 106 B.C, Wu continued his domination over China, starting to organize the different conquered areas. While doing this, Wu divided up the extension of his conquests, into 13 prefectures. For each prefecture he assigned a supervisor, who visited the commandries every once and a while. They all went around a rotating basis, investigating corruption, disobedience and making the imperial edicts.</p>
<p>Wu also made peace with other countries to open up a trade route which is now known as “Silk Road”. It is a 400-mile trade route, where there are small cities where trade is the main business. To make peace, Wu would send out ambassadors to make peace diplomatically. Also creating more trade partners, and expanding China’s merchants’ trade routes.</p>
<p>In 104 B.C Wu built himself a luxurious palace. According to the Mandate of Heaven he was being a good ruler. According to the Mandate of Heaven this action made him a good ruler because he was making a new and better accommodation for the next ruler.</p>
<p>During the next decade, Wu was finishing his expansion of China, creating new defense plans and organizing his territories. In 88 B.C Emperor Wu fell ill and with Prince Ju dead, he had to pick a new ruler. Wu’s eldest surviving son and his brother were not to Wu’s favor, so he picked his youngest, Liu Fuling. Liu was only six at the time so he chose Liu’s advisor to be Huo (Wu’s favored general). In 87 B.C Wu died, shortly after crowning Liu Fuling who went on to be Emperor Zhao.</p>
<p>Since Wu had no Empress (due to her committing suicide) and there was no instruction left Huo had nothing to do but assume and make a guess. Huo had Consort Li enshrined, in a temple, with Emperor Wu.</p>
<p>Wudi became emperor from Jingdi in 156 B.C. Wu was a good ruler for the 69 years he ruled over the Han Dynasty. He followed and performed the principles of the Mandate of Heaven successfully and expanded China to its size. In my opinion, Wudi was a great rule who completed many great deeds.</p>
