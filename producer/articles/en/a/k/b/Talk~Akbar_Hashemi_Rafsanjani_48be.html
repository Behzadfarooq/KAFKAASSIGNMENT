<p>Technically Rafsanjani is not an Ayatollah. His official clerical title is that of 'Hojjat al-Islam,' which is a lower rank than Ayatollah. I believe his family owns the Khoshgovar beverage company (which is licensed by Coca-Cola), among many other large factories and businesses. The article may wish to state that he is one of the wealthiest men in the world, and theoretically has more power than the so-called 'Supreme Leader' Khamanei. He is also probably one of the most hated men in Iran. A very sinister character.</p>

<p>OK, so I am using the link that you yourself put in the article to "support" your Zionist lies. According to <a href="http://www.democracyforiran.de/Iran%20-%20past,%20present%20&amp;%20future%20-%20News%20August%2004.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.democracyforiran.de/Iran%20-%20past,%20present%20&amp;%20future%20-%20News%20August%2004.htm" rel="nofollow">this site</a> that you put in the article, (which is, by the way, too obviously a biased site) it says:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Hashemi Rafsanjani, head of an influential government council and president of Iran from 1989 to 1997, gave a speech on Dec. 14, 2001, <b>that has been interpreted widely as both a signal that Iran wants nuclear weapons and a threat to use them against Israel.</b> Describing the establishment of the Jewish state as the worst event in history.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>But the follwoing which is not "interpreted widely" and rather is a direct quote from him appears just a few lines below the above "wide interpretation" and reads:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"because of religious and moral beliefs and commitments that the Koran has created for us, we cannot and will not pursue such weapons that destroy humanity."</dd>
</dl>
<p>You and HKT are obviously trying to "help" promote the zionist lies about Iran's nuclear programme. What you people do not realize is that this overall strategy has actually helped both the Islamic regime as well as Iran's national unity tremendously, more than you can even imagine. You may win a few cheap media battles like this in the short term, but with this strategy, you are only helping your perceived enemy with more unity. As an Iranian, I can tell to all you Zionists and your Shabbath Goy Bush: Thank you!</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What has been "interpreted widely" is that Iran shares his sentiments. He is quoted directly as calling for nuking Israel. And your "just a few lines below trick" was actually a quote from three years later (!), when he recanted in the face of the coming election. (P.S. Please sign your posts. You can do this by entering ~~~~ after your post. Thanks). <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 15:39, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Just like <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmadinejad.html" title="Ahmadinejad">Ahmadinejad</a> called for nuking Israel? You really need to study News for yourself and not look on sites such as the one mentioned above and you have got to stop watching Fox News and/or Al-Jazeera.</p>
<p>About <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmadinejad.html" title="Ahmadinejad">Ahmadinejad</a>, he never called for Israel to get wiped off the map. No such idiom ("wiped off the map") exists in <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian.html" title="Persian">Persian</a> (<a href="../../../f/a/r/Farsi.html" title="Farsi">Farsi</a>) . An Iranian official said: "How do you wipe a country off the map?" obviously backing up the fact that in Persian, there is no such <a href="../../../i/d/i/Idiom.html" title="Idiom">idiom</a>.</p>
<p>Also, what <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmadinejad.html" title="Ahmadinejad">Ahmadinejad</a> REALLY said was: "The Imam said that this regime occupying Jerusalem must [vanish from] the page of time".</p>
<p>I think that this is a case of some idiot pulling an Ahmad-lie on Rafsanjani. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmyrifle9_e75f.html" title="User:Armyrifle9">Armyrifle</a> 19:03, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>a couple of points.</p>
<ol>
<li>Rafsanjani's words, interpreted literally, do not seem to mean what HKT says they mean. The words quoted are "If one day, the Islamic world is also equipped with weapons like those that Israel possesses now, then the imperialists' strategy will reach a standstill because the use of even one nuclear bomb inside Israel will destroy everything. However, it will only harm the Islamic world." Now, this clearly isn't showing friendly thoughts to Israel, but it's also not saying "Iran should get nuclear weapons, and then nuke Israel." As far as I can gather, Rafsanjani is saying that if the Islamic world gets nuclear weapons, it should use the threat of nuking Israel as a way to get what it wants from the imperialists. Later on, he says, "Therefore, in the future, the interests of colonialism and imperialism dictate whether Israel will survive or not." I think this suggests that what he's really threatening is nuclear blackmail, not actually nuking Israel. It could be interpreted that he wants to nuke Israel, but that's not what he's precisely saying.</li>
<li>More importantly, putting this one quote into the article, with no context on Rafsanjani's broader political views at all - this statement is <i>literally</i> the only one in the entire article about his actual views - is just completely POV. If the article were to be expanded to deal more broadly with Rafsanjani's political outlook, it would be completely fine to discuss this speech there (although not in a way that just repeats right wing news outlets' interpretation of his words). But as the article stands, it is completely unbalanced to just have one paragraph about one particularly inflammatory speech, without discussing at all the much more complicated issue of Rafsanjani's political position. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 17:55, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<p>As an example, how balanced is it to mention this speech, but not Rafsanjani's remarks a few months earlier where he condemned the 9/11 attacks? Or the fact that he was seen as the middle of the road candidate in the recent Iranian elections, and ultimately was reluctantly supported by the reformists in the run-off? <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 17:58, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The quote has been interpreted that way in a number of sources, including articles in major newspapers. In addition, it seems to me that articles on Israeli politicians are regularly inundated with unflattering and out of context quotes of theirs (e.g. <a href="../../../e/h/u/Ehud_Barak_d32a.html" title="Ehud Barak">Ehud Barak</a>), so this seems to be the standard. If it's added under the "Quotes" section will you be o.k. with it? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 18:07, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The quotes for Ehud Barak are equally stupid, and I've just removed them. Their presence is no defense for similar stupidity here. In terms of interpretation - again, the fact that something <i>has</i> been interpreted a particular way does not mean that we have the right to state that that interpretation is fact. Out of context quotations should generally be avoided. Until this article has a decent discussion of Rafsanjani's political views as a whole, there shouldn't be any mention of particular quotes. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 18:21, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>"<i>The use of even one nuclear bomb inside Israel will destroy everything. However, it will only harm the Islamic world.</i>" I've actually seen this translated as "<i>...whereas it will merely damage the Islamic world</i>." It seems to me that the most obvious interpretation of his statements is that he was actually suggesting nuking Israel. However, another interpretation is possible, the relevant section should be readded with that interpretation included. This story's extensive coverage (as well as the quote's sabre-rattling nature by any interpretation) makes it extremely notable, but I have no problem with the inclusion of an alternative interpretation of his statements. P.S. Arafat also condemned the 9/11 attacks in English and praised them in Arabic. Condemning those attacks was politically critical for nearly everyone. <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 18:37, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>You are taking it out of context. He says "then the imperialists' strategy will reach a standstill because" the quote you make. He is saying that getting nuclear weapons will change the balance of power in the middle east because the west will have to take this fact into account. He is not specifically saying that a nuclear attack should definitely be made - just that the threat of such an attack will change the calculus in terms of western support for Israel. Obviously, he's not ruling out such an attack either, but I don't think he's specifically calling for it. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 20:37, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Honestly, I don't have a complete transcript of his speech. Could you provide me with a link to one? It would be quite edifying. (I don't at all mind finding that he didn't call for nuking Israel; on the contrary, I'd much rather have nobody wanting to nuke it!)

<dd>There's a transcription by the BBC available on Lexis-Nexis, but I assume you probably don't get Lexis-Nexis. I could email a copy of the article to you, if you'd like. Personally, I think it's fairly clear that the speech isn't saying "The Islamic world needs to get a nuclear bomb so it can immediately nuke Israel." It's fairly clear, I think, that Rafsanjani is thinking in terms of the political effects of the existence of a Muslim nuclear bomb on the west (presumably, Pakistan doesn't count as Muslim in this context). I think it's equally obvious that Rafsanjani is <i>also</i> saying that the State of Israel should be destroyed, but I don't think it's at all clear that he means that this should be done by a nuclear attack - rather, the emphasis seems to be that the Arab world needs to do whatever it can to get the west to abandon Israel, so that it will be able to be defeated and a Palestinian state established in its place (and, presumably, the Jews of Israel driven forth into exile in Europe and America). The threat of nuclear attack, Rafsanjani seems to be saying, given the inherent assymmatricality of the threat, might be enough to accomplish this. I don't know that he's ruling out an actual nuclear attack, but I don't see that he's particularly calling for it. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 20:51, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, let's see how the Barak deletion stands; I suspect the quotes will be reverted back in soon enough. As well, that was the tip of the iceberg; similar things can be found either in the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Arabism_9893.html" title="Anti-Arabism">Anti-Arabism</a> article or in Wikiquotes for <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Ben-Gurion_1a9e.html" title="David Ben-Gurion">David Ben-Gurion</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/i/Ariel_Sharon_de21.html" title="Ariel Sharon">Ariel Sharon</a> among others (they used to be in the articles until they were moved to Wikiquotes). <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 18:41, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't really care about WikiQuotes - the point of that is to include quotations. The Barak quotes would be perfectly appropriate in his wikiquotes article, as would be the Rafsanjani one, or whatever. The <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Arabism_9893.html" title="Anti-Arabism">Anti-Arabism</a> article is pretty bad, but that's a problem beyond just the quotes. At any rate, once again, if we had a full discussion of Rafsanjani's political views in that article, a balanced discussion of this speech would <i>definitely</i> be in order. But as it stands now, any discussion of that one incident, out of his entire political career, is going to unbalance the article by making it seem as though this is the most important part of it. As to the 9/11 quote, I think the way Rafsanjani discussed the issue was sufficiently anti-American (most of his discussion was warnings to Americans about retaliating too hard, and complaining about an American double standard) that it is hard to say that this was just some sort of mushy statement for American consumption. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 20:37, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay, so as to prevent constant edit warring over this, I thought I'd present conditions under which I'd find mention of this quote acceptable.</p>
<p>1) It needs to be given some kind of contextualizing statement to start it off. It can't just be "during a sermon in 2001, Rafsanjani said." It needs to be more along the lines of "Rafsanjani has a history of making statements that..." or something along those lines. Otherwise it sticks out rather absurdly given the general lack of depth of the article</p>
<p>2) The gloss on his statements needs to be NPOV. It's fine to say that it was interpreted in the west as being a threat to use nuclear weapons against Israel if Iran got them. It's not fine to say that this is what Rafsanjani said, because that is not what he said. He was speaking hypothetically, and a little bit ambiguously. I think that he was really discussing how nuclear weapons would alter the balance of power in the Middle East, and how this would give the Islamic World leverage to help them destroy Israel, rather than actually saying that Tel Aviv should be immediately nuked. If an American politician during the Cold War had said something to the effect that the Soviets wouldn't dare launch an invasion of western Europe because they knew that the United States could utterly destroy them with nuclear weapons if they did so, would that count as a threat to nuke the Soviet Union? We need to be careful that we're saying. I think this is especially true because of the present-day implications of this statement. Of course, right now we are worried that Iran is trying to get nuclear weapons. A hysterical reading of Rafsanjani's statement is particularly significant in this context. We should be really cautious about interpreting a statement like this, and if we can't do it right, we shouldn't mention it at all. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 15:43, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The NYT article is not free - it is in their archives, and thus unavailable unless you pay for it. As to the quote, it seems to me that as it stands, it is unclear that we are quoting the Times - it might alternatively be a direct quote by Rafsanjani. As to the NYT, it seems unnecessary to quote it when a translated transcription of Rafsanjani's speech itself is available on Lexis-Nexis. I have quoted the relevant part of it on Jayjg's talk page. At any rate, SV, could you please read my comments above and tell me what you think? As I said above, I have no problem with saying that western media largely interpreted the speech as being a threat to nuke Israel, if indeed they did do that. I think looking at the speech itself, it doesn't seem at all obvious that this is what he was saying, and we should not rely on what the NYT says about a statement that is readily available to be read in full. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 17:21, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi John, the NYT article doesn't have to be paid for. I'm not a paying subscriber and I was able to access it, and anyway there's no requirement to provide links: a citation is enough (though a link is better, of course). The reason I picked on the NYT is that it's a mainstream, reputable source and this quote is being disputed, so we have to stick to that type of source. But if you have an equally reputable one, by all means replace it.</p>
<p>Regarding your point about the speech and the context: I haven't read the whole speech, but I'll do it now. As for providing a political context, I agree it's important, but I'd say it should be attributed throughout to others - i.e. this is what the NYT said he said, this is what X said he said, and this is the context in which Y interpreted it - so that we're not presenting any interpretation as the correct one. You wrote above that we have to be careful what we say, and you're right, but then so does Rafsanjani, and so does the New York Times. Give me a few minutes to read the whole speech first and I'll post back. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:36, July 13, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It says:</dd>

<blockquote>
<p>If one day ... Of course, that is very important. If one day, the Islamic world is also equipped with weapons like those that Israel possesses now, then the imperialists' strategy will reach a standstill because the use of even one nuclear bomb inside Israel will destroy everything. However, it will only harm the Islamic world. It is not irrational to contemplate such an eventuality. Of course, you can see that the Americans have kept their eyes peeled and they are carefully looking for even the slightest hint that technological advances are being made by an independent Islamic country. If an independent Islamic country is thinking about acquiring other kinds of weaponry, then they will do their utmost to prevent it from acquiring them. Well, that is something that almost the entire world is discussing right now.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>We could use this instead of the NYT. It's hard to be sure what he means. I don't see this as a direct threat to attack Israel, but he's definitely not ruling it out either. My understanding of his reference to the Islamic world is: although the bomb would destroy Israel, it would only damage neighboring countries, and therefore there's nothing irrational (self-destructive) about considering it. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:52, July 13, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, your interpretation of it here seems to be similar to mine - not a direct threat to attack, but not ruling it out. I do think that it's significant that he's talking in terms of <i>western</i> calculations - that is, that if Muslims get the bomb, the west will have to change the way it deals with the middle east because of the asymmetricality he brings up. At any rate, I still don't like the way it's referred to in the article. We can't just plop the quote down - including some context is really important here. We should make some effort to a) paraphrase the quote in some manner; and b) explain why it's significant enough to be included in the article, how it fits in with Rafsanjani's larger role, or whatever. As to wikipedia's responsibility to be cautious, as opposed to that of the NYT and Rafsanjani's, well, sure, but none of us has any control over what the NYT and Rafsanjani say, while we do have control over what wikipedia says about it. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 20:57, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The point he seems to be making about the West in the rest of the speech is that at some point he hopes the West will regard the cost of protecting Israel as too high, and that the cost will escalate, certainly in terms of tension, if Iran or any Arab country acquires nuclear weapons.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I've moved the quote to its own section, so that it's not stuck in the middle of two unrelated paragraphs. I agree that it would be good to provide context, though I'd caution against paraphrasing the quote. I'd suggest letting it speak for itself, and then perhaps trying to find some newspaper articles about the speech, and whether it was regarded as important, and if so, why. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 21:09, July 13, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article says that R. is "the first president of Iran who has stepped down willingly".</p>
<p>I don't think that's very accurate. As far as I know, he couldn't run for a third consevutive turn and so was legally bound to step down. He only willingly obeyed the law.</p>

<dd>This may come as a surprise to people familiar with my work on Wikipedia, but I support the publishing of Alberto Nisman's religion. It is cited and I have no reason to challenge the reliability of the source or accuracy of the statement. On the other hand, to ensure NPOV, if we include information about one of the prosecuter's religion, we must include information about all of the prosecuters' religions. The entire statement from "The Jewish Week" that 75.17.183.177 refers to reads: "Nisman, who is Jewish, and [Marcelo Martinez] Burgos, who isn’t, oversee a staff of some 45 people ...."[17] If we do not include the religion of Burgos and the fact that 45 people work for them (and let's be honest, most of those people are probably Roman Catholic), we would be distoring the truth slightly implying that only a Jew would come to the conclusion that Hezbollah is responsible for the AMIA bombing, or, in the words of 75.17.183.177, that "a Jewish person in authority might use his discretionary power to target Muslims and Iranians."</dd>

<p>I made the following entry in Wikipedia's request for unprotection page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection#Current_requests_for_unprotection" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_page_protection#Current_requests_for_unprotection" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>.</p>
<p>There has been an endless edit war between pro-Israeli censors and other users regarding disclosure of the fact that an Argentine prosecutor, who filed charges against various Muslims for a 12 year old event, is Jewish. I think this is relevant information because it may indicate that the prosecutor's discretionary decision was motivated by his religion. As anyone knows, the world is currently embroiled in a war between Muslims and Jews. Knowing the religious affiliation of a person can be very important to understanding why he did what he did. Unfortunately, a group of pro-Israel censors (their affiliation is clear from their edit history) refuses to allows the publication of the fact that the prosecutor is Jewish, even though it is well cited [2]. First they claimed it was irrelevant. They gave themselves, and not the readers, the authority to decide what is and isn't relevant. Then they claimed that he wasn't the prosecutor and was only working as part of a team. A quick google search of Alberto Nisman [3] reveals that he is the lead prosecutor. He runs the team and he is the sole prosecutor listed in all of the mainstream articles. Then they claimed that Jewish week isn't a respectable news source. They had the nerve to attack the reporter's (Larry Luxner) journalism! Then one of the pro-Israeli censors accused me of racism and banned my IP, simply for daring to suggest that a Jewish person's religion might have something to do with the discretionary decisions he makes towards Muslims! Their actions have now reached the height of intellectual dishonesty. Rather than disclose the information and let readers decide if it's relevant, they want to hide it, and deny the readers the ability to think for themselves. Please correct the articles under "hezbollah", "AMIA bombing" and "Rafsanjani" to add four simple words disclosing the fact that the lead prosecutor is Jewish. Please keep wikipedia as an objective source of information, and not a tool controlled by a mob of pro-Israel censors.." Although pro-Israeli censors seemingly dominate wikipedia (I seriously wonder if some of them are paid), they do not dominate the world and Wikipedia will be less relevant if it only presents facts they like. Alternatively, please set up an Alberto Nisman article and provide a biography of his life and accomplishments, and like every other biography article, disclose his religion. Your prompt and fair attention to this matter is appreciated. Footnote - The pro-Israeli censors are listed below. Their affiliation is clear from their edit history and user pages. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Isarig" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Isarig" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Isarig</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Humus_sapiens" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Humus_sapiens" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Humus_sapiens</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:GHcool" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:GHcool" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:GHcool</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Amoruso" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Amoruso" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Amoruso</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Moshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Moshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Moshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg</a> --75.5.1.216 18:43, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yawn ... It looks like 75.5.1.216's request was declined, but let's get the order of events clear:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>75.17.183.177 accused well-meaning Wikipedias of censorship.</li>
<li>Those Wikipedians challenged the relevance of Nisman's religion to the article on Hezbollah.</li>
<li>75.17.183.177 argued that Nisman's religion may have swayed him to "target Muslims and Iranians" because "there is currently a global dispute between Iranians and Jewish people."</li>
<li>I, GHcool, offered a fair, NPOV compromise to the problem: we should inform the public on Nisman's religion if and only if we include the religious affiliations of the other prosecuters as well.</li>
<li>75.17.183.177 argued that Nisman was the lead prosecuter and implied that therefore his religion is more important to the article than all of the other prosecuters' religions.</li>
<li>SlimVirgin, a neutral Wikipedian, agreed with Beit Or other like minds that Nisman's religion is irrelevent to the article on Hezbollah. She suggested that 75.17.183.177 find a "reliable source who discusses it and argues that it's relevant (but even then we'd have to be careful)."</li>
<li>75.17.183.177 misunderstood (intentionally or unintentionally) SlimVirgin's suggestion to mean that his source that told Nisman's religion, "The Jewish Week," was an unreliable source.</li>
<li>75.17.183.177 filed a complaint with the folks at the Wikipedia unprotection page.</li>
<li>That complaint was rejected. Long live NPOV.</li>

<dd>I made a statement in the arbitration complaint against your mob. I was not surprised that someone had previously filed a complaint against you. I also thank God that my existence is not so devious that I have to spend my days censoring information. Enjoy your misery as your efforts are largely futile. The real world thinks for themselves. --75.5.2.227 20:18, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's funny. I don't see any complaint against me on that page.</dd>
<dd>P.S. Why do you keep copying and pasting everywhere? Can't you just talk on the Hezbollah page like you said you would?--<a href="../../../g/h/c/User%7EGHcool_11e1.html" title="User:GHcool">GHcool</a> 20:37, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Well, my arbitration request was deleted. User Jayjg (his edit history is replete with pro-Israel wikipedia censorship) deemed the addition of Nisman's religion racist and banned me. Further, user Thatcher131 deemed that since I had been banned, I would not be given an arbitration request. So now it is impossible to even get a hearing on whether this information should be included. This whole affair is really beyond sad and is an indication that pro-Israeli censors are not interested in truth, but are rather interested in imposing their will. Having now dealt with you first hand, I am no longer confused as to why most of the civilized world holds a negative view of Israel and Israelis. May fate continue to justly bring misery to your oppressive lives, and may you waste your weeks futilely attempting to control people's thoughts. I can think of no better prison for you. --75.28.17.156 21:36, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
