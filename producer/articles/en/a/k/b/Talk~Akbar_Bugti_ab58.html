<p>Nawab Muhammad Akbar Khan Bugti was a HERO of Pakistan, specially for Balochistan and Baloch Peoples, Baloch tribe man are very hard working and face the hardships with boldly. They love their land more then their lives. Every time cunner and rubber government of pakistan keep cunning them and keep Baloch tribe in darkness. From SUI Gas field country earn 100000 of dollars per day, but unfortunately Baloch peoples couldn't get any benefit even a clean drinking water from the government. Every time government kill the baloch peoples and spent money on their own luxries. Nawab Akbar Buagi was killed with gunship and bombing helicopters were used on 27th August 2006. Dead body militry took and still they keep it in secrete. In all over the country specially Balochistan Province still burning. so many peoples were killed and arrested, The result of Bugti killing will be is very strick and long lasting battle will be between government and Balochistan peoples. Story is very lengthy but I try to short it.</p>
<p>"Written by Domki Baloch"</p>
<p>Bugti has made a really good quote in the economist "What is better than seeing your enemies driven before you and then taking their women to bed" Economist July 1, 2006 He is not a warlord at least they have morals, he is a crook. 64.173.196.113 22:44, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Reply: well he also proudly claims to have killed his first victim at age 12 and murdered many others. He also controls a private militia and tries to exercise power over an area. I think this qualifies him a warlord. Most warlords are also thieves. 159.53.46.141 01:13, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This article is full of a lot of extras which are not part of a biography. There are a lot of missing quotes etc. 67.118.46.150 18:42, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I edited the article extensively. But there is someone who keeps reverting the article back to its earlier biased version. Even in its current state, there's a lot more that can be added. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandbreak_66ab.html" title="User:Sandbreak">Sandbreak</a> 16:30, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Someone keeps vandalizing this page with blatant POV statements and propaganda. I did my best to get rid of all the hyperbolic statements but that same person reverted it. Just take a look at the terrible grammar of the article to figure out that this isn't encyclopedic quality. Also, there are a ton of factual errors that im not going to bother dealing with right now. I just wish that people who talk about things on the talk page rather than using wikipedia as their propaganda machine. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandbreak_66ab.html" title="User:Sandbreak">Sandbreak</a> 16:56, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>What a bunch of garbage. This page is crying out for an edit. I have twice attempted to rewrite this page but someone keeps on reverting them. Also, im assuming that this same person, keeps deleting any comments on the talk page so as to completely ban discussion on the topic. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandbreak_66ab.html" title="User:Sandbreak">Sandbreak</a> 16:42, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>what do you think will happen, will akber bugti win or lose this war??? 202.70.148.45 09:07, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>government is showing fake press conferences in which so called 'Bugti Commanders' are laying down their arms and switching over to the governments side, its all a big farce. Bugti's resistance force is strong AlhumduLillah and fighting in all corners of Balochistan!!!!! <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinster678_fa41.html" title="User:Spinster678">Spinster678</a> 16:40, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>i donot agree what is written above infact Nawab's grip on its people is going loose day by day because you cannot cheat people too long. Sui will progress &amp; the cheater will be punished thats sure. King Tanoli 17:56, 22 July 2006</p>
<p>I myself have edited this page to include only facts but Spinster678 keeps vandalizing it with his pro-Bugti nonsense. On this happy occasion of Bugti's death,I will edit this page again.</p>
<p><br />
A user named Khoikhoi keeps meddling in this article without knowing anything about Akbar Bugti. I keep putting in an article that has not POV but it keeps being deleted by Khoikhoi and a couple of other pro-Bugti fanatics. Both of them need to stay away from this article.</p>

<p>Ha ha ha, I love this article! The bizarre grammar and capitalization, the un-encyclopedic tone, the frequent non-sequiturs... this is comedy gold!

<p>I also dont agree with the author of this clearly biased article. I'm not a fan of Mr Bugti but i've at least attempted to write this article in a non-biased manner. The author has consistently added his own POV into the article.</p>

<p>Speaking as someone who doesn't particularly have an opinion on this fellow, his movement, or anything other than the quality of the article one way or the other, I'm putting in a request for clean-up. This is quite possibly the sloppiest, poorly-written, non-biographical-contented, non-NPOV "biography" article I've ever seen on Wikipedia.

<p>Nothing about his personal jails, and how Bugti and his clan used to torture his rivals?</p>
<p>Also...I am surprised to see that there is nothing about force marriages of women to Koran? It is a common practice among Waderas and Nawabs. They usually force their female family members to marry to Koran (if there is mo male available from the family)so that the family wealth won't go outside of family.</p>
<p>Firstly son i myself am related to the tribe and theres no such thing as marriage with quran.... you should do your research from some other source my friend &amp; secondly theres no such thing to keep the wealth in the family. If you are talking about inidan nawabs,,, then I cant say but in Baluchistan nothing like this ever happened atleast not in bugti tribe where someone forced some body to get married with Quran....</p>
