<p>Just a note: Although Ranma says "Kawaikunai" he pronounces it "Kawaikune", possibly to sound more aggressive. Nevertheless, "Kawaikune" is gramatically and contextually incorrect. 60.224.48.152 05:51, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/k/a/Talk%7EAkane_Tendo_7d88.html" title="Edit section: Kurumi and Natsume and aliases">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Kurumi and Natsume and aliases</span></h2>
<p>I would like to point this out, since it appears there's some confusion about it.</p>
<p>Kurumi and Natsume are not related to Akane, Nabiki and Kasumi and they apparently are not canon characters; In the OVA 'Akane and her sisters' where they appear, it is shown that Soun never recognizes them as daughters once Happosai appears and explains how he told them (lied to them is more likely) that Soun was their father. Therefore, Kurumi and Natsume are not related to the three Tendo daughters and are not their stepsisters.</p>
<p>As for the aliases, Akane is not called those names all the time in the manga or the anime (only Ranma calling her uncute/tomboy and Shampoo has called Akane 'pervert-girl' a few times), it is true that Akane said those names in the manga when asked to play a part for the drama club, but nobody calls her that everyday so I think they don't qualify as aliases. Facer 06:15, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Its true Kurumi and Natsume are not canon in the manga universe but they certainly are canon in the anime universe. Know it all guy</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/k/a/Talk%7EAkane_Tendo_7d88.html" title="Edit section: Hammerspace Mallet">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Hammerspace Mallet</span></h2>
<p>Unless you're talking about fanon specifically, please don't list fanon as fact.</p>
<p>I'm getting tired of seeing the mallet listed as one of Akane's attacks. Almost everyone in the manga and anime uses mallets, from Ranma right down to Happosai. It's not a martial arts technique, it's a comedic slapstick violence.&#160;:p</p>
<p>If you really want to list Akane's combat capabilities in the side bar, why not mention her weapon abilities or something? She's been shown to be trained to use a lot of weapons. Bow, shinai, whatever. The other characters have their weapons listed as attacks, so it shouldn't be stretching things. - Matrias, June 29th, 2006</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/k/a/Talk%7EAkane_Tendo_7d88.html" title="Edit section: Akane's training">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Akane's training</span></h2>
<p>"But generally, Akane does not train as extensively as the other fiancées appear to do. This is not to say that she does not train, it is simply that her training is lesser than the training done by the other fiancées, who are usually involved in combat during the majority of the adventures"</p>
<p>Is this in the Anime or something? I don't recall seeing Akane train much in the Manga, but neither do I see the OTHER girls train either.</p>
<p>- The girl's training is never really discussed. We only ever see the boys. Ranma, Ryouga, Mousse, and even Kuno. Everybody else is sort of implied, but never really shown.</p>
<p>As for Akane, At the begining of the series, it's obvious that Kuno is stronger then here and holds back, but in the Combat Cheer Leading Story Arc, Akane easily takes on Kuno in a Kendo match disguised as a boy. And this is after Kuno went through the Water Melon training, which supposedly made him much stronger and faster.</p>
<p>To me, it seems Akane's actual abilities are much greater in the manga and are de-emphasized in the anime. Akane handles herself fine in most situations in the manga. While it is suggested the other girls are better, Akane does all the superhuman martial arts things we come to expect (fence walking, super jumping, super strength, etc). - Matrias, Wednesday, May 03</p>
<p>The question, to the one who is editing lately, do you have to list all the people in the anime and manga who has ever, no matter how briefly had a problem with Akane listed in the rivals sections? It serves no use since they are not her main rivals and they are not really very important characters. Look, I know it's nice to see your changes here and all, but this is not a contest about how much you know about the manga and anime. It's only about trying to make a concrete and useful article, not a word by word transcript of the manga.</p>
<p>I thought kuno's watermelon was only good when watermelons where around,otherwise he was just the same old kuno. Know it all guy</p>

<p>The question, to the one who is editing lately every character in the Ranma 1/2 section, do you have to list all the people in the anime and manga who has ever, no matter how briefly had a problem with Akane (and other characters) listed in the rivals sections? It serves no use since they are not her main rivals and they are not really very important characters. Look, I know it's nice to see your changes here and all, but this is not a contest about how much you know about the manga and anime.
