<p>How do I find out how to fix my math "failed to parse (syntax error)"? --<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPring_4a17.html" title="User:Pring">Pring</a> 18:18, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi there. I had a look at your parse error. There are two ways to write it:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li><b>&lt;math&gt;L = \frac{(N^2 - N)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;</b> produces this: <img class='tex' src="../../../math/e/6/2/e625ec31a8236708ac01fa2a86f6487b.png" alt="L = \frac{(N^2 - N)}{2}" /></li>
<li><b>''L'' = (''N''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - ''N'')/2</b> produces this: <i>L</i> = (<i>N</i><sup>2</sup> - <i>N</i>)/2</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>The first method is using <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latex.html" title="Latex">latex</a> code, the other is simply html. When putting the &lt;math&gt; and &lt;/math&gt; tags on, it means everything inside those tags has to be latex code. That's why you were having a parse error, because inside the tags you had html instead of latex. <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28mathematics%29_835a.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (mathematics)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (mathematics)</a> gives more info on writing maths equations, and <a href="../../../f/o/r/Help%7EFormula_239e.html" title="Help:Formula">Help:Formula</a> gives help on writing latex code in particular.

<p>Hi,</p>
<dl>
<dd>Just a quick question. Do you routinely log out of Wikipedia if you're going to be away - say overnight or for a large part of the day. In other words, is it better to stay logged-on all of the time? <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_David_03f9.html" title="User:Michael David">Michael David</a> 04:52, 25 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I must say, that I'm not particularly sure what you mean by this question, but I'll try my best to answer it. I don't usually log off Wikipedia because I pretty much only use it at home, so there is no privacy/security issues to worry about. So when I finish doing whatever I'm doing on Wikipedia, I simply close the browser without logging off. Is this what you meant? - <a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAkamad_92a5.html" title="User:Akamad">Akamad</a> 10:02, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks, you pretty much answereed the question for me. My office is in my home, and my computer is in another room, so I don't really have a security problem. I have been routinely logging-off each night when I'm finished using it. So, if the main reason for logging-off is security I'll just stay logged-on all of the time.</p>

<dd>It was bound to happen. I have serious problems with some of the text in the Philip Leslie Graham article; particularly pertaining to his mental health &amp; cause of suicide issues.

<dd>Hi there. Firstly, let me apologise for taking until today to reply, I didn't notice your message until just then, I don't know how that happened. As for your question, I suggest you <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">be bold</a> and edit the article. But it might also be a good idea to leave a note on the talk page explaining why you did so. - <a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAkamad_92a5.html" title="User:Akamad">Akamad</a> 22:25, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm stuck. I'm trying to figure out how to add an External Link to an article. I have read the instructions, but somhow can't make it work.

<dd>Hi. As you would know, there are two types of links in Wikipedia, internal and external. External links are made using one set of square brackets:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>[http://www.google.com] will produce text that looks like: <a href="http://www.google.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>[http://www.google.com Google homepage] will produce text that looks like: <a href="http://www.google.com" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com" rel="nofollow">Google homepage</a>. The key thing there is the space after the <a href="../../../u/r/l/Url.html" title="Url">url</a>, this space ensures that the text following the space is shown on the page, but it will still link to the url.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>When creating external links at the bottom of the page, the second method is used. So the syntax is basically: [<i>url_of_site short description of site</i>]. There is also a link just above the edit box for creating external links (it's got a small picture of a globe). I hope this helps. If it still doesn't work, create the external link that you want to create either on this talk page or mine, and I'll (hopefully be able to) fix it up for you. - <a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAkamad_92a5.html" title="User:Akamad">Akamad</a> 08:26, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Akamad,</p>
<p>thanks for your nice welcome note!</p>
<p>I still have trouble editing my user page. I´ve seen some boxes on user pages, with fun things like: "this user supports Manchester United" for example. Do you know how and where I can get these boxes? I hope you know what I´m talking about, since I don´t know better words to describe them...</p>
<p>Sorry I can´t sign this message properly, since I don´t have this wavy line symbol on my keyboard.</p>

<dd>Hi. Those boxes you describes are called userboxes. Have a look at the <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUserboxes_3753.html" title="Wikipedia:Userboxes">Wikipedia:Userboxes</a> page, it lists all the different types of userboxes you can have, and how to craete your own. It also shows you one method of displaying them on your userpage. I'm suprised you don't have a tilde key (wavy line symbol) on your keyboard. This image shows you where it is on most keyboards: <a href="http://healthlinks.washington.edu/howto/navigating/tilde.gif" class="external free" title="http://healthlinks.washington.edu/howto/navigating/tilde.gif" rel="nofollow">http://healthlinks.washington.edu/howto/navigating/tilde.gif</a>.

<p>Thanks for your message. Here is the situation: I have proposed the article "Shane Filan" to be deleted. I have checked the votes and it seems this article is good to stay. I have no dispute with that, but one of the votes said that there were 69,000 Google hits on "Shane Filan" and that I should always Google something before proposing deletion. Not a bad idea, per se, but I wonder if just because Google has a large number of hits on something it is therefore worthy of an article. Trouble is, no matter how I write the above paragraph, it would seem defensive and antagonistic t the person who voted to keep the article, and I have no desire to create bad feelings. So I wanted to take the question and move it to a neutral place, and have it just as a general discussion.</p>

<dd>The idea of notability for individuals can be rather subjective. That's why there are guideline pages dedicated to them: <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a>, and a detailed one for musicians: <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Wikipedia:Notability (music)</a>. Many users do use the Google test when determining the notability of a subject. You might want to look at this page: <a href="../../../s/e/a/Wikipedia%7ESearch_engine_test_390d.html" title="Wikipedia:Search engine test">Wikipedia:Search engine test</a>. I haven't read it myself, but it seems to give a general overview of how and when to apply the Google test, and also its shortcomings. - <a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAkamad_92a5.html" title="User:Akamad">Akamad</a> 11:00, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for your explanation on how to create a userbox!</p>
<p>I was actually at the "bootcamp" chat room, and the so-called "authorities" told me that they won't help me make my own because they don't approve of userboxes as they find them "divisive". I couldn't disagree more. I find them a quick and convenient way to express your interests, political persuasions etc...all in the spirit of free speach. I can understand that the actual Wikipedia ARTICLES should be as professional and NPOV as possible, but when it comes to userpages and talk pages I see them as a great opportunity to have civilized debate with people all over the world with opposing views.</p>
<p>I actually need a bit more help with two other issues:</p>
<p>1) Where it says that I'm a Montreal Canadiens fan, I'd like to have the Canadiens logo in the spot where there's simply the letters "MTL"</p>
<p>2) Also, my userboxes always seem to be aligned in a sloppy, haphazard way, why is this? How can I have them arranged more neatly?</p>
<p>Thanks again! <a href="../../../l/o/o/User%7ELoomis51_de2c.html" title="User:Loomis51">Loomis51</a> 22:42, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi. Sorry about the late reply, but I've been kind of busy. I had a go with formatting your userpage userboxes, I hope you that's what you wanted. Have a look at the code to see what I did. Basically I used the {{boxboxtop||left}} tag. You can put a heading for the box by putting in an argument for the middle parameter: {{boxboxtop|heading of sorts|left}}.</dd>
<dd>I also changed the image for the Montreal Canadiens. I hope you like it. <a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAkamad_92a5.html" title="User:Akamad">Akamad</a> 22:10, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I really appreciate you helping me with my user page and so I feel a bit guilty about asking for more help, but it seems that your editions have caused a problem with the "Babel" box. There seems to be one big blank space where english and french used to be.</p>
<p>I understand if you're busy, and to be honest, I don't really understand why you'd be so generous with your time...but I appreciate it! In any case, there's no rush...but if you get the chance to look at my page it would be great if I could get the Babel box back to normal.</p>

<p>Hi, I was wondering if you could give me advice on the use of images in wikipedia as I'm a little confused about the wording of the GNU agreement. Basically I'd like to illustrate an essay with a picture of some pigeon colour morphs. I'm guessing it's acceptable under the rules but I'd thought I'd check and be safe.

<dd>This would depend on where you got the image. For example, if you took it (or made them) yourself, then you can use it. Most images downloaded from the web cannot be used, since they are most likely copyrighted. If an image is copyrighted it can be used under the fair use clause. As a rule of thumb, the following classify as fair use (I got the list from <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a>):</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Cover art.</b> Cover art from various items, for identification and critical commentary (not for identification without critical commentary).</li>
<li><b>Team and corporate logos.</b> For identification. See <a href="../../../l/o/g/Wikipedia%7ELogos_2117.html" title="Wikipedia:Logos">Wikipedia:Logos</a>.</li>
<li><b>Stamps and currency.</b> For identification.</li>
<li><b>Other promotional material.</b> Posters, programs, billboards, ads. For critical commentary.</li>
<li><b>Film and television screen shots.</b> For critical commentary and discussion of the cinema and television.</li>
<li><b>Screen shots from software products.</b> For critical commentary.</li>
<li><b>Paintings and other works of visual art.</b> For critical commentary, including images illustrative of a particular technique or school.</li>
<li><b>Publicity photos.</b> For identification and critical commentary. See <a href="../../../p/u/b/Wikipedia%7EPublicity_photos_4459.html" title="Wikipedia:Publicity photos">Wikipedia:Publicity photos</a>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, if you obtained the image from the web, it seems unlikely that it would classify as fair use, since the subject matter doesn't appear to fall into any of these categories.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Have you looked at the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_use_policy_10e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Image use policy">Wikipedia:Image use policy</a> page. It provides plenty of info. Plus the <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a> page is also good.

<p>How do I create external links to www.trenstar.com and also to the RFID report on trenstar.com?</p>

<dd>I created an external links category in the <a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobile_asset_management.html" title="Mobile asset management">Mobile asset management</a> article. This is the standard way to link to external sites (see <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External links</a> for more info). Having a look at how you did the external links, you had the right idea with the code, you just had an extra set of square brackets (only one pair are needed for external links). I hope this helps, if not, don't hesitate to ask me any questions. - <a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAkamad_92a5.html" title="User:Akamad">Akamad</a> 08:25, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>Sorry about that thing! I was just experimenting, that's all. R U an editor? I honestly never knew u can become an administrator...that's pretty cool.</p>
<p>To edit a page, do we just press edit page and actually edit? LOL...sorry</p>

<dd>Hi. I'm sorry but I'm not certain as to who you are. I haven't left you any messages (as far as I know). Either way to answer your question, yes I do edit stuff on here, but not frequently. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Truelife_9491.html" title="Special:Contributions/Truelife">It seems</a> that you've got a handle on editing things.

<p>Hi. I'm advocating a case on behalf of a user who is experiencing numerous problems with <a href="../../../r/p/j/User%7ERPJ_4c8b.html" title="User:RPJ">RPJ</a>. I can see from <a href="../../../r/p/j/User_talk%7ERPJ_cd6c.html" title="User talk:RPJ">RPJ's talk page</a> that you have interacted with him in the past.

<p>How do I add Van Morrison's name to the Officers of the Order of the British Empire under Category? I was able to add it to the list of celebrities but not the main list. Or you can do it if you want, that might be easier than telling me how. There is plenty of verification that he received the award on June 15, 1996. <a href="../../../a/g/a/User%7EAgadant_253e.html" title="User:Agadant">Agadant</a> 22:51, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I added Van to the category. Just to let you know, to do so, I put the line [[Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire]] at the bottom of the page. All the best. - <a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAkamad_92a5.html" title="User:Akamad">Akamad</a> 07:15, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Would you support the concept of moving the Earhart "myths" to a separate page or article? The reason for my suggesting this is that the main article should be an accurate and scholarly work while the speculation and conspiracy theories surrounding the disappearance of Amelia Earhart are interesting, they belong in a unique section. Most researchers, as you know, discount the many theories and speculation that has arisen in the years following her last flight. Go onto the Earhart discussion page and register your vote/comments...and a Happy New Year to you as well. <a href="../../../b/z/u/User%7EBzuk_3248.html" title="User:Bzuk">Bzuk</a> 05:02 3 January 2007 (UTC).</p>
