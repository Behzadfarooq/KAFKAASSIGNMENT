<p>I did tag the article, but I was just passing through. I'm not really knowledgable about it or qualified to make decisions about it.

<p>Hi again,</p>
<p>I see that you cannot leave me email or identify yourself. Fine I assume that you want to keep the mistakes in the shock wave article. Could you please explain why you insisting on keep the mistakes there. If you have a logical explain (don't have to be scientific just what are you secret motivations).</p>
<p>I can to do one of the two things</p>
<ol>
<li>let you keep it, insert some paragraph about the history and put somewhere big statement that</li>
</ol>
<p>it is not make any sense scientifically, or</p>
<ol>
<li>let the editors check which material make sense (you will have to show some credential</li>
</ol>
<p>in that case).</p>
<p>I am not hiding like you. you know who am I.</p>
<p>Genick</p>

Hi AKAF</p>
<p>You change the shock wave article and ask that I leave a message for you. You can read my reaction in talk to shock wave. You can email me at barmeir at gmail.com or tell me what is your name so I know who I am talking to. I will also would like to know what is your background so it will help me to explain the physics of shock wave and other things to you. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGenick_caaf.html" title="User:Genick">potto</a> 15:42, 1 February 2007 (UTC) Genick</p>
<p>Hi AKAF. you make good points on the talk page. It's a good discussion of the subject (my own research area is shock waves in water interacting with air bubbles). It'd be good to get some pictures of shocks, tho'.</p>

<dd>Hi, AKAF. I have also put a comment on Genick's talk page. I would like to comment on something you said to Genick on <a href="../../../s/h/o/Talk%7EShock_wave_d386.html" title="Talk:Shock wave">Talk:Shock wave</a>:
<dl>
<dd><i>I'm sorry, but your writing is not in English. It is not grammatical, and often doesn't make sense.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I suggest that this statement could have been written differently so as to be less likely to be taken with hard feelings, especially the "not in English" part. I would feel offended if someone said something like that to me about any language that I use at either high or low level of competence. Different people have different definitions of "English". I consider that Genick's writing is in English. Everyone makes some grammatical errors, I think. Some make more than others. It's not necessary to tell them they're not writing English. You could say something more content-oriented such as "I didn't understand this part, and that part, ..." etc. It's better to focus on discussing article content and try to avoid saying things that might offend other editors. It's more courteous to say "I don't understand" than to say "this doesn't make sense". If you <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>, you can assume all writing makes sense to the one writing it -- and can be explained. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 17:42, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your message on my talk page. I was already thinking, as I read along on the shock wave talk page, that there was an increasing level of cooperation going on. Congratulations for your patience with me as well as with Genick.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I, along with other Wikipedians I've encountered, seem to be accustomed to often interspersing comments so that comments appear close to the specific material they're answering, although it can make it more difficult to notice when new material has been added. Adding comments at the bottom of a section is also often done, and tends to be done when there's less of a reason to intersperse. I might try to stick to adding comments at the bottoms of sections at <a href="../../../s/h/o/Talk%7EShock_wave_d386.html" title="Talk:Shock wave">Talk:Shock wave</a> as I think you requested, but I don't promise to necessarily always remember or to do so if I see a particularly strong reason to intersperse. I may also add comments at the bottoms of sections slightly more often on other pages. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 09:48, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here below are your claim. And below you should find my explanation.</p>
<p>Lock Sir, Wikipedia isn't yours. If you don't know the topic and you do not have the education than perhese you should work on the English. If you insist that you know the material, at least read the report that you allege to have the solution. Just page 10 it is only 10 lines above NACA113 equation 150a to the equation. Genick --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGenick_caaf.html" title="User:Genick">potto</a> 05:06, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The standard analytical solutions to the oblique shock can be found in (for example) NACA1135 equations 115-170. If you claim that you are the first person to find an analytical solution to the oblique shock, I think you'll be disappointed. Your research may indeed be (new,interesting,correct) and if you can provide a refereed publication which agrees with you, then it could be added to comments about the standard solutions.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p><b>Good that you brought this point. Read the NACA1135 report and refer to the wiki article on oblique shock. or to NACA 1135 page 10 equation 150a. It state "No convenient explicit relations exist" please locate it in the report. This relationship is the most important one. Your comment simply insults over 50 Ph.D. who dedicate you find the solution to this equation (if you would like to have ref i can provide you). This solution is important because it deals with the most fundamental question what will be shock angle for given upstream Mach number and wedge angle. The approximation that confuse with the solution exist but it is wrong (this is what I refers to the error in NACA 1135. The assumptions are wrong .). Now you can review the solution, it is explicitly explain in my book or ask someone who know basic mathematic (no knowledge in differential equations is needed, just simple algebra, well, a bit more than high school, though some high school students can figure it out.). The equations that you referred to 115-170 include equation 150a (may be you should read again that report) are either approximations or showing the reverse relationship (which is 1 to 1 and not 1 to 3 (solutions)). I hope that my explanation convince you or direct you to read so that you can understand. If you understand what I am saying, should we go with the history section? or do you need more explanations? if so, what are the points that you do not understand? By The way, my book with the solution is wildely used many places.</b> --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGenick_caaf.html" title="User:Genick">potto</a> 05:06, 2 February 2007 (UTC) genick bar-meir</p>

<p>I was checking your correspondence on shock wave discussion. For example here</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Shock_wave#M.3C1_behind_an_oblique_shock.3F" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Shock_wave#M.3C1_behind_an_oblique_shock.3F" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Shock_wave#M.3C1_behind_an_oblique_shock.3F</a></p>
<p>It cannot believe how much misconception the people (including yourself) on this discussion have. The answer to the above question is simple always for strong sock and in some conditions for a weak shock. when strong or weak shock occur is depends on b.c. If you interested in unsteady state there is third solution which is M &lt; 1.</p>
<p>Another example,</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Shock_wave#Supersonic.3F" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Shock_wave#Supersonic.3F" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Shock_wave#Supersonic.3F</a></p>
<p>The discussion by WolfKeeper is totally wrong just read my book about moving shock. By the way, I was the first one to find analytical solution for this case. If he was right than you could not hear any one. Boy, he should read a book about this topic before writing this in wikipedia. genick</p>

<p>Hello AKAF. Thanks for the message. Yes, both <a href="../../../o/b/l/Oblique_shock.html" title="Oblique shock">oblique shock</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/v/Moving_shock.html" title="Moving shock">moving shock</a> are indeed <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog.html" title="Dog">dog's</a> <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog_food.html" title="Dog food">dinners</a>. My first thought was to merge them with <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shock_wave.html" title="Shock wave">shock wave</a> (on the grounds that they are Galilean transforms of a steady shock) but on reflection this isn't quite appropriate because a small amount of material on angles etc should really appear in a separate article. Would you agree with this? I must say, I think that Genick is acting in Good Faith, but his editing does need heavy revision by someone with a more (how to put this?) natural writing style.</p>
<p>While I'm writing, do you find the "types of shock wave" section in the <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shock_wave.html" title="Shock wave">shock wave</a> article in need of serious revision? The wording seems to imply that the list is somehow a natural typology of shock waves, and the actual entries are nothing of the sort. What do you think?

<dd>Congratulations to both AKAF and Genick for successfully shifting to a cooperative discussion focusing on article content. That is not easy to do when emotions have been involved. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 18:33, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just replied to your comment on my RFA, as far as I was aware my email had been activated for ages, but after you mentioned it I checked and it had been deactivated somehow! But I had set it to receive emails ever since User:Ginkgo100 suggested I do so, and have received emails from both Patchbook and Tony and Kintesbuffalo many times. I hope this helps answer your concerns! <a href="../../../s/g/g/User%7ESGGH_ea0b.html" title="User:SGGH">SGGH</a> 20:30, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
