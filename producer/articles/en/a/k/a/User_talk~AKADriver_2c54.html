<p>I have been looking over your recent edits to all S-Chassis related pages, and I am concerned as to the verifiability and method behind many of these edits. Since you have neglected to use edit summaries in the majority of these edits. Particularly your edit to the <a href="../../../n/i/s/Nissan_Silvia_b85f.html" title="Nissan Silvia">Nissan Silvia</a> page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nissan_Silvia&amp;diff=41706533&amp;oldid=41503138" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nissan_Silvia&amp;diff=41706533&amp;oldid=41503138" rel="nofollow">here</a> which I should also point out is not a <a href="../../../m/i/n/Wikipedia%7EMinor_edits_650d.html" title="Wikipedia:Minor edits">minor edit</a>, and should not have been marked as such. I am also concerned about the paragraphs you reduced, eliminating information without explanation. Whenever information is removed it should be indicated in the edit summary why, and if it is a substantial amount of information, it would bhe appropriate leave a not on the article talk page with a detailed explanation of why the information warranted removal. I am asking you to please go through and make these notations on the talk pages, or here, explaining the reasons for these removals and reductions. If you are unable or refuse to do so, I will revert to a previous version until I, or another wikipedian can identify a valid reason for removal.--<small><a href="../../../o/n/i/User%7EOni_Ookami_Alfador_f93a.html" title="User:Oni Ookami Alfador">Oni Ookami Alfador</a><sup><a href="../../../o/n/i/User_talk%7EOni_Ookami_Alfador_338e.html" title="User talk:Oni Ookami Alfador">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Oni_Ookami_Alfador_0ce1.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Oni Ookami Alfador">@</a></sup></small> 20:59, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have added comments about my changes to the <a href="../../../n/i/s/Nissan_Silvia_b85f.html" title="Nissan Silvia">Nissan Silvia</a> article to its <a href="../../../n/i/s/Talk%7ENissan_Silvia_f76f.html#Explaining_my_edit" title="Talk:Nissan Silvia">talk page</a>.</dd>
<dd>Expounding on what I wrote there, I'm trying to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and reduce ambiguity in the S platform articles. My source for all Japanese-market version info for these cars (except the Sileighty) is the "Nissan Museum" <a href="http://www.nissan.co.jp/MUSEUM/SILVIA/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nissan.co.jp/MUSEUM/SILVIA/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> maintained by Nissan Japan. Sileighty info comes from the original printed brochure for these cars and the info provided by the Gran Turismo series of games... I'll try to find a web-accessible source. Further S12 Silvia/Gazelle info comes from a Japanese owner's website. <a href="http://www.geocities.co.jp/MotorCity/9185/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.co.jp/MotorCity/9185/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></dd>
<dd>I've tried to keep references to production years consistent with <a href="../../../m/o/d/Model_year.html" title="Model year">model year</a> as it's defined in North America. The Japanese don't use our model year system but they have a registration year system that's similar. I know Australia, at the least, is more familiar with calendar years, though. If model years are too confusing to non-American readers, I don't mind seeing it changed back... or better yet, changed to year + month; readers familiar with the concept of a model year should know that a car introduced in October of year x will have been sold as an "x+1 model".</dd>

<dd>I dont see model years as any way confusing, so long as it is wikilinked (which I believe it is).--<small><a href="../../../o/n/i/User%7EOni_Ookami_Alfador_f93a.html" title="User:Oni Ookami Alfador">Oni Ookami Alfador</a><sup><a href="../../../o/n/i/User_talk%7EOni_Ookami_Alfador_338e.html" title="User talk:Oni Ookami Alfador">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Oni_Ookami_Alfador_0ce1.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Oni Ookami Alfador">@</a></sup></small> 21:58, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is this the messaging method we use? I couldn't find a "reply" option on your message to me...</p>
<p>As for the 200SX / Silvia naming problem with the Australian delivery, it's a sad sorry mess. Different marketing terms in different markets, with different engines on board. Cross-pollination between the Silvia line and the 180SX is also something I'm not entirely clear on, but I know there is one significant difference.</p>
<p>All the Silvia/200SX I have seen in Australia have been quite faithful renditions of the japanese domestic market (JDM) items. Since we drive on the same side of the road, there's been quite a grey market for japanese imports.</p>
<p>I don't recall seeing the "S13 Chuki" with the popup headlights, but I know we got S14 and S15 Silvias with the SR20DET badged as 200SX. Apart from the badging they are definitely Silvias. In fact, my car still has some Silvia badging on it, because Nissan Australia didn't want to pay for it's removal! By that time the Silvia name was already known and it probably helped them with the marketing.</p>
<p>I don't know if the JDM 180SX was the same basic chassis as the Silvia, but I do know that one major distinction apart from the engine capacity was the use of a lift-back rather than a coupe.</p>
<p>Then there's the American 240SX delivery based on the S-chassis, whereas our 240SX was a rather boring block of a sedan that didn't sell much. We also had a Gazelle in the late 80's but I don't know if it was based on the S platform as alleged in the wiki.</p>
<p>If I could show you the badgings of my S15 you'd see immediately the Silvia written in script on several places on the car. However I've left my quick-n-dirty photos on my home computer so I'll try to pass them on over the weekend. By all rights my Australian 200SX the entry should be in the Silvia section. Then again, if you go strictly on the marketed name, it does belong on the 200SX page. Perhaps the Silvia page should have a few sentences pointing out that Australia got the exact copy of the S14 and S15 Silvias but rebadged and "see the 200SX page".</p>
<p>I'm inclined to agree with whoever suggested that the 200SX and Silvia pages should be combined. Perhaps also combined with the 180SX and 240SX pages too!</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm comfortable with the move at this point. I still have a few facts to chase up that I haven't had time, and I want to show you some poor-quality pics of the Silvia badges on my car. I'll also put up a nice pic of the actual car; you'll see immediately that it's definitely a Silvia despite the marketing confusion.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is the right place!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have no doubt your car is a Silvia in everything but name... it's really just how they broke up the articles even before I came along. I've just tried to stay consistent, and your content was a perfect fit for the 200SX article, especially because I know the Australian meanings of "Spec-S" and "Spec-R" were very different from the JDM versions.</dd>

<dd>It'd be much nicer if we could combine all these different variants into the <a href="../../../n/i/s/Nissan_S_platform_b4e7.html" title="Nissan S platform">Nissan S platform</a> article and compare and contrast, but it'd be enormous! — <a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAKADriver_8b44.html" title="User:AKADriver">AKADriver</a> <strong class="selflink"><font color="#FF0000">☎</font></strong> 13:13, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's certainly a fact that when the Plymouth Neon was dropped, the PT cruiser was introduced, and it fit into a similar though not identical niche.

<dd>The Dodge Neon continued in the US as well as the Chrysler Neon in export markets until 2005. Not to mention, the PT is a Chrysler in all markets, never a Plymouth. Most Plymouth dealers were Chrysler-Plymouth, but not all. As far as I'm concerned, there were no replacements for any Plymouth-branded vehicles, and the PT ran concurrent with the Neon under the Chrysler brand.</dd>
<dd>The PT was also just plain never intended nor sold as a Neon replacement. The Caliber, on the other hand, <i>is</i> marketed as a Neon replacement even though it too is a different type of car.</dd>
<dd>I and a few others would revert that, yes. — <a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAKADriver_8b44.html" title="User:AKADriver">AKADriver</a> <strong class="selflink"><font color="#FF0000">☎</font></strong> 22:33, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi AKADriver. Instead of taking up the case (as stated in the title) myself for mediation, I would recommend you to seek the advice for the arbitration committee instead. They can better deal with this. Alternatively, contact some administrators to initiate a lockdown on the page (and just keep the short criticism section instead), and/or block SpinyNorman from constantly imposing his version on that page. Mediators can only mediate something when all parties are willing to compromise - something tells me SpinyNorman is not the compromising type. <a href="../../../j/s/w/User%7EJsw663_4769.html" title="User:Jsw663">Jsw663</a> 07:39, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

On Sep 9 at 4:19 Spiny was seemingly nice and encouraged me to add my sales numbers content to the S2000 page, see the bottom of the S2000 discussion page. Then he ruined it by citeing it in the arbitration, See bullet two under first assertion. I would think that using examples that occured after arbitration started wouldn't be fair. Also, the encouragement was contrieved to create evidence to support his case. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedruM_c390.html" title="User:RedruM">RedruM</a> 00:25, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I saw, he's also tried to backtrack things like editing his "nice try, short pants..." to say "actually..." to try to paint himself as the victim here. But the diffs are on our side, he's presented no evidence to the case (only weak refutations of things that are right there in black and white), I'm confident it will be open and shut.</dd>

<dd>Awwww, what's the matter boys, afraid I'm not really the boogieman you've tried to show to the arbcom? I think maybe the problem here is that you guys haven't figured out yet that I adopt the "what comes around, goes around..." attitude toward dealing with others. If a person is respectful to me, I will treat them with respect. If a person is rude or confrontational with me, that's what they'll get back. And as for your interpretations of my conduct, while I find it extremely amusing, you'd better be careful or Jsw663 is going to call you "paranoid". --<a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpinyNorman_fe2f.html" title="User:SpinyNorman">SpinyNorman</a> 07:36, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Personal attacks are no concern to me, though they're not helping you, either. I'm just trying to enforce NPOV in automotive articles. — <a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAKADriver_8b44.html" title="User:AKADriver">AKADriver</a> <strong class="selflink"><font color="#FF0000">☎</font></strong> 13:57, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do know Japan suppressed Korean culture and forced Japanese culture on the Korean, especially in the last 10 years of the occupation. I never denies that fact (although I found some exaggeration and descriptions against reality in Korean history textbooks<a href="http://japanese.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2004/11/20/20041120000000.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://japanese.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2004/11/20/20041120000000.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>).<br />
Why I put the sentence "Many young Koreans, who studied at school the suppression of Korean culture on the last years of Korean occupation by Japan......." on <a href="../../../k/u/m/Kumdo.html" title="Kumdo">kumdo</a> is not because I think the occupation is just something taught at school, but because most Kumdo practitioners nowadays do not "remember" the Japanese occupation. People who claims kendo or kumdo is originated in Korea are mainly those who were born after the occupation. And I often hear that somehow the young have stronger <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Japanese_sentiment_ca49.html" title="Anti-Japanese sentiment">anti-Japanese sentiment</a> than the elderly<a href="http://www.hani.co.kr/section-005000000/2002/06/005000000200206210723071.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hani.co.kr/section-005000000/2002/06/005000000200206210723071.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. That is why I editted kumdo. I would not like you to misunderstand me because I trust you as a man who postpones passion to the fact.<br />
But I really lament that the sentence "Some practice Kumdo without giving respect to Kendo, and believe and claim Kumdo or Korean fencing is the origin of Japanese Kendo and its swordmanship, but that is historically not the case.", which we agreed to keep after a long discussion, is deleted, no matter how many times I add it. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Friedrich_6b6a.html" title="User:Michael Friedrich">Michael Friedrich</a> 03:41, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi AKADriver, you were on the list of members at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Automobiles_13cd.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Automobiles">WikiProject Automobiles</a> and we are introducing a new way of listing members, as the old list was becoming too long. Our new method involves having all of our members in a category.</p>
<p>To add yourself to the category just add the userbox to your user page by putting <b>{{<a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWiki_Auto_Project_6d83.html" title="Template:Wiki Auto Project">Wiki Auto Project</a>}}</b> where you want the userbox. Alternatively if you don't like the userbox you can add <b>[[Category:WikiProject Automobiles members|AKADriver]]</b> to your userpage.</p>
<p>If you no longer wish to be a member of the project, simply don't add the userbox or category, there's no pressure.

<p>I've noticed your work on the drifting page which I've also contributed too as well as the Ford (Volvo) C1 Platform page in which I found an image of the C1 platform developed by Volvo with funding from Ford. Great to find someone who shares an interest in automobiles. Not keen on drifting though&#160;:P</p>
