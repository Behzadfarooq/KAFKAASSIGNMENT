	    <p>Do you know who I am? No, of course you don’t. You are not of this realm, and most likely never will be. I am not a mortal like yourself; I cannot be killed. No, indeed, for I live in the very midst of the dead, but I am not among them—I rule them. How is this? I am a god. I am the god of pain, suffering, and that which ends it all: death.</p>
<p>Hades, the god of the dead. Pah! No, no, I am the only god of the dead you will ever see. For I am the god who relieves you suffering souls of your burdens of life when you cannot bear them any further, take such beatings of the body and the mind just one more day. I am the one who saves you from that special room, just for you—dark, confining, full of black words that suck the hope from you and destroy it forever. I am the one who saves you—but you must make the first step. Free yourself with your sharp knife, free yourself…</p>
<p>For is that not what you want? Why else is it you would have come to me, with tears in your eyes, begging to end your miserable existence? Yes, don’t you see? If the a continuation of your tourcher is what you want, then it is not my place to cut you free of your mortal bonds and leave behind the life that you still wish to live; but is that truly the case? I thought not.</p>
<p>For you know as well as I that those who leave can never return, and yet is there a worse hell in all the worlds than the one you are living now? Who would miss you? Tell me honestly—do you know of any who would mourn your departure? Who would be there to tear out their hair in grief? No, there would not, would there.</p>
<p>Oh, Melpomene, Muse with the sharp knife, lend your blade to me that I may yet convince this poor, poor, soul to listen to reason. Perhaps with your way with words I shall succeed and lead you, you suffering child, on my dark path to mercy. But why do I wish to help you so? Why have I undertaken the task of guide to the underworld for those who need me most, those victims of the cruel, cruel world who cannot bear to live? This you do not know, yet you should. And so, my dear child, I shall tell.</p>
<p>My story begins thus: I came to life from the tears of Oedipus, who unknowingly was both son and husband to Epicaste. When he learned that he had committed this awful deed, sobbing in grief he tore out his own eyes and threw them to the ground. Weeping over the loss of his eyes and for the atrocity of their union, Epicaste hung herself above that very spot. Their tears fell upon the womb of stone that soon bore me.</p>
<p>When the sons of Chronus found me, still newly born from the rock, they knew not what to do. Mother earth would not let them destroy me as they wished to, and so they bound me and sent me to Hades, the god of the underworld and the brother who they most detested. He worked me as a servant and beat me often, for I was the only one in that desolate land who was still substantial and could feel his blows. Many a kind man is a cruel master, as you yourself know, but he was not a kind man. How ever cruel he was, though, his heart so cold could not compare to my heart of stone.</p>
<p>And so I am much like you, my friend, but I had not the choice I offer to you now—death is no option to those who are immortal. But even as I was far past the point where a mortal man would have died, my calling yet came.</p>
<p>“Hither,” called my great and evil lord, “I have a task for you. You who so longs for a death that you cannot be given, take care of these poor souls who have been granted your wish and who have taken the life from their bodies with their own hands.”</p>
<p>And with that he laughed, a terrible laugh, as terrible as the voice that laughs at you in your room just for you. And so you know what I had to endure. I wish so much to be given a place in my own kingdom—yet it is not for me that I reserve a space—I wish more to grant you the boon I cannot have. Yet my troubles did not end there. After I had mastered the art of walking my slippery path down to my fief, and had guided many souls there, Zeus, the great father, came to me and requested a boon. Ah, but what a boon it was—he wished me to turn one away from my dark path. But of course, I protested. “Why should I not grant that which I wish so much to those who feel as I do? If there is no joy, nor light, in life, why live? You, of all the gods, who may sit in his throne and watch the never-dimming sun revolve around you, you should know that a life without light is nothing, else you would journey down more often and join your much loved brother, oh dear Hades.”</p>
<p>At this, Zeus grew angry, for he was not use to being denied. “If you were not already in the land of dead and immune yourself to this awful plague, I would smite you down myself with my mighty thunderbolt!” He shouted much other nonsence, but none of it made any impact on my heart of stone. Seeing that there was no forcing me, his voice grew silky smooth, and charm and persuasion oozed from every pore. “You must save this man, for he is to sit beside me in the lightest of light, and is to have every wish he could desire answered.”</p>
<p>Here I cut him off, for I could bear it no longer. I confronted him with words that flew, “You will grant his every wish, any boon that he partakes? No longing shall be beneath your word nor beyond his reach? If that is true, than perhaps…” At this, Zeus began to look triumphant, he has a poor poker-face and I could easily beat him at cards, and so he answered thus: “Yes, now you are beginning to see! He would soon regain happiness in life, and he could wish his deepist desire, whether pigs for feasting, or men to adore him or women to be his wives. You see, this is truly what is best.” Thinking me convinced, he put a warm and friendly smile upon his face. I soon banished it to the corner of my realm with my next words. “If you are true to your words, give in to his pleas: this is what he wants; he has shown it plain enough to me that his greatest wish is to take no more of life.” At this, Zeus flew into a mighty rage, and struck me to the floor. He then bound me in the form I was then, that which you now see before you, and froze me there for all eternity. He did not allow me to finish my statement, which might have saved me from this prepubescent body, but I could merely have infuriorated him further, and what the next punishment would be I did not long to know. And thus I was cursed with this form, never to reach manhood, but now I think of it not as a curse but as yet another similarity that I share with you—a body that does not move quite right, awkward and stumbling without the grace that age gives you.</p>
<p>But that is a tale you will have much more time to hear. You can listen to it as we walk the gently winding path to my home in the underworld. You are coming, no? For can you not hear the footsteps of your beloved, come to take you to your room. Quick, take from me the blade of Melpomene while you still can and leave something for the blood-readers something to prophesize. Come with me, and you shall find that death is much more enjoyable than life.</p>
