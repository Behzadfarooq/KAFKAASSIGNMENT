<dd>We need a major overhaul of the "signature abilities". Signature abilities are defining moves that a character uses to a maximum; we should not list every single jutsu a character has used. As such, we can't judge something a signature ability when they've only used it once (example Hidan's weapon at the moment). Chiyo used taijutsu to attack Kakashi in her first battle scene, but it turned out taijutsu was not at all any of her sig. ablts. <a href="../../../g/r/r/User%7EGrrblt_2f06.html" title="User:Grrblt">Grrblt</a> 21:39, 23 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That weapon is obviously his signature. They're not exactly the type to drag about an arsenal just for fun. If he's tossing that scythe about now, you can be sure he'll be seen using it again. I'll agree that some other abilities can be cut, though not many of them. – <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy0830_d67f.html" title="User:Someguy0830">Someguy0830</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESomeguy0830_3c31.html" title="User talk:Someguy0830">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Someguy0830_4a47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Someguy0830">contribs</a>) 22:29, 23 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>How is it "obviously" a signature move of his? Itachi used a katana in the beginning! It is entirely possible he will just leave his scythe on the floor, as he has already commented on his low attack speed. Quite a lot of people have opened with some form of attack then scrapped it the next moment, because it was just an opener and nothing they expected to work. For the clean of the other signature abilities, we could have one line say "Signature abilities:" and one following with "Jutsu used:" because frankly, there is quite a difference. Signature abilities is more in line with the "Akatsuki powers" list that was here until just a few days ago. <a href="../../../g/r/r/User%7EGrrblt_2f06.html" title="User:Grrblt">Grrblt</a> 07:53, 24 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There's a difference between a common sword and a unique weapon such as Hidan's. As a general rule of thumb for this seires, most characters tend to keep a common strategy and don't change it right after the first use. I can think of very few characters which have done such a thing. – <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy0830_d67f.html" title="User:Someguy0830">Someguy0830</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESomeguy0830_3c31.html" title="User talk:Someguy0830">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Someguy0830_4a47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Someguy0830">contribs</a>) 21:15, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Signature ability implies something like Deidaras clay manipulation, Itachis Sharingan, elemental or such allignments like Kisame being heavily water based. What we have currently is an ability list and it should probably just be called Abilities. Itachis only signature abilities would be Sharingan, Mangekyou SHaringan and that Tsuyikomi(sp) and Ameratsu(sp). The suiton water jutsu especially isn't a signature ability. I understand the list existing because theres no article for the characters individually but it should not be referred to as Signature if it isn't an ability they are known for and use commonly. Kisame uses Samehada a lot for example, Deidara uses clay and Itachi uses the Sharingan.<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkwarriorblake_8272.html" title="User:Darkwarriorblake">Darkwarriorblake</a> 00:17, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is a fairly long article, and the vast bulk of it consists of character biographies.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Leader</span></h2>
<p>I'm not sure if anyone has mentioned this before, but upon close inspection of chapter 254 page 15, the leader seems to have the sharingan. If this is true, it discredits the idea that it is the Yondaime Hokage. This also makes more sense concerning Itachi's statement that if Sasuke learned the Mangekyō Sharingan the number of people able to do it would be 3 (4 now with Kakashi).</p>

<dd>You must be using the cleaned-up version from Inane. The Akatsuki Leader has <i>no</i> Sharingan. There have been many shots of the Leader where his eyes are clearly visible and none of those show any signs of Sharingan.</dd>

<p>(To post below this one) True that many shots of his eyes have no sharingan, but sharingan is not visible until the user activates it. The leader may have one, but he is just not showing it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It seem highly unlikely that the leader has the sharingan given Kisame's comment about how he 'never would have believed someone else had the same eyes as Itachi' when seeing Kakashi for the first time.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I've heard a theory something to the effect that the leader has mangekyou sharingan (MS from now on), which explains Itachi's speech of the "third" MS user. It's somewhat believable, since MS appears in people in different ways (Comparing Itachi to Kakashi, it is easy to see that their MS looks quite different). I dont know if I buy it though, seeing as to how we know absolutely nothing about the leader, and because I dont think anyone in akatsuki knows anything about leader (he may one day betray them all for all they know), and because it seems that MS degenerates eyesight, and requires ALOT of chakra. Not saying that the leader doesnt have, or doesnt have the potential to have, a large amount of chakra, or knows some way to use MS without hurting his eyesight, still, you cant really agree with something like that knowing so little of the circumstance. I'm starting to wonder if we will ever know, but I disgress.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for Itachi's role in Akatsuki, you can kind of believe that the leader is an Uchiha, because Itachi knows of another MS user, the Leader is strong, and there is obviously someone who is pushing Itachi to grow stronger. It seems that there is a tree of sorts. Unown nin (Possibly Leader) pushes Itachi who pushes Sasuke. In the manga, where it shows Itachi destroying his village (Chapter 196? I think? I'll check later), it looks as if there is another Uchiha alive during the massacre up ontop of the pole, then in the next frame you see Itachi killing his family. True, time may have passed, but it still may be another nin. This explains Itachi's knowledge of another, and it explains that there is a relationship between Itachi and another Uchiha. This is further supplemented by the fact that Itachi's target Bijyuu is Kyuubi. Granted that Akatsuki is gathering the Bijyuu to implant into their bodies, making themselves jinchuuriki, if Itachi gained the powers of Kyuubi, he could use MS to no end, making him essentially invincible. Too bad this is all speculation, and has many many many holes in it.<a href="../../../s/l/a/User%7ESlaserX_2ca3.html" title="User:SlaserX">SlaserX</a> 18:04, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That's because 4th Hokage is proven to be DEAD! -Grrblt</p>
<p>That theory makes absolutely no sense. Why would the fourth hokage, a man who risked (and probably lost) his life to stop kyuubi, to defend his country, turn evil, start a group of likeminded people, and start ripping the bijyuu out of people, when he himself sealed a bijyuu into someone! Why would he create naruto, then sit around waiting a few years to come back and try and rip it out! The notion is simply proposterous. If anything, Yondaime Hokage was reverted back to an infantile form of himself in Naruto, which explains why he was able to learn S-Rank jutsus so easily (Especially Rasengan, a particularly difficult jutsu to use). Even if you dont buy the infantile reverting theory, you could always call it a reincarnation, or something to that effect. <a href="../../../s/l/a/User%7ESlaserX_2ca3.html" title="User:SlaserX">SlaserX</a> 18:00, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Order of members in the group shot</span></h2>
<p>Ok, so there's been a lot of bitching with people changing the order of the member list on the lower part of the page. The members (except Deidara) are forming a circle, like this:</p>
<pre>
     Itachi   Sasori
 Giant           Unknown
Kisame                 Zetsu
    Unknown       Leader

       Seen from here
</pre>
<p>Starting with Kisame, the <i>correct</i> order is: Kisame (identified by sword), Unknown (Giant), Itachi (identified by hairdo), Sasori (identified by hairdo and height), Unknown, Zetsu (identified by weird thing covering his head), Leader (identified by hairdo), Unknown.</p>
<p>Since so many are editing this entry, probably due to lack of understanding the picture, do you think maybe I should try another way completely? Add numbers to the picture or perhaps list them simply from left to right? The latter option provides some difficulty with where to mention Deidara though. I'm changing the list back to the proper order for now, but I need some ideas on this one. <a href="../../../g/r/r/User%7EGrrblt_2f06.html" title="User:Grrblt">Grrblt</a> 20:23, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed, I think left to right would be far better. by the way, I'm presuming from thr right unknown (between sasori and zetsu) is kakusu based on the fact that he is one of the only two remaining unknowns and the only one with a forehead protector actually on his forehead. Thusly the unknown in front of kisame must be hidan, as giant would be notable in his eventual appearance. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidusunknown_ed20.html" title="User:Midusunknown">Midusunknown</a> 10:30, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Also would anyone be against adding a status section to each characters stat to say if they active or deceased? I'll do one big change and if anyone has any issues discuss it here and I'll revert it if need be or revert what you don't like.</p>

<dd>I do agree that the article kind of needs an overhaul, I don't think any of the members of Akatsuki should have their own members, Itachi included. I just think the main Akatsuki article should be the only page with Akatsuki member bios on it.

</dl>
<p>I don't think there's any problem with the speculation, provided it's phrased correctly. For example, Tobi's bio says "Many fans believe that Tobi is Obito." This is fact, because many fans DO believe that Tobi is Obito (Ie the fact that many fans believe it is true, though Tboi=Obito may not be true itself). If it said "Tobi may be Obito" then that's bad phrasing, but i don't think mentioning speculation is necessarily a bad thing. Phoenix1985 10:08, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes but its meant to be a page of facts.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Kakashi's Eyesight... going bad?</span></h2>
<p>I remember when this first happened in the manga, and Kakashi said something like, "What's wrong? Are your eyes getting weak?" or something, to which Itachi just sorta smirked and shook his head. Fans began to speculation that he was damaging his eyes and all that...</p>
<p>But, um, a few chapters later, wasn't it also revealed that it wasn't Itachi's real body, and because of it, his abilities were limited? I kinda figured that that's probably the reason that his sharingan was less useful than usual. :/ WtW-Suzaku 08:08, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No, you'll have to re-read the chapter. What Kakashi say's before the fight ever starts is something to the effect of "So..how far has your eyesight deteriorated?" to which Itachi responds with a somewhat shocked and bemused expression. This was all ::though I cant remember how:: said in the context of the MS btw, not the normal Sharingan. Nothing is confirmed, but it was definately a blatant implication that overuse, or perhaps simply use, of the MS deteriorates normal eyesight over time.--<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Shan_9db5.html" title="User:Master Shan">Master Shan</a> 10:32, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's really cool that within minutes of the raw's being put online people had info on hidan and kakuzu...however, I think people are really jumping the gun alot with speculations. Maybe we all should wait for higher quality, more respectable translation to come out before posting certain statements that base around a single scantalation groups translation. Or better yet, maybe we should wait a week for more revealing information to come out. Having the names and pic's are fine, they likely wont change, but saying things about hidan's speed and how he uses his weapon and jutsu's is just making this more like a forum of speculation and guesses, rather than an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidusunknown_ed20.html" title="User:Midusunknown">Midusunknown</a> 01:28, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think we could differentiate between just standing there like some prop, and actually interacting. Deidara and leader both speak (I think one other guy does aswell but dunno who that was), which is different from what most other guys did. Therefore, Deidara and leader can be considered to have made an apperance, but not the others. Also, I think these silhouette appearances should be changed whenever the member has a full apperance, like Deidara's being chapter 246 instead of 238. <a href="../../../g/r/r/User%7EGrrblt_2f06.html" title="User:Grrblt">Grrblt</a> 19:38, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, but speaking doesn't mean anything, because we don't know who they are. It's just a disembodied voice. Assume a person has never read the manga. They will not know that voice is Deidara, because they don't know his position in the circle. Likewise, those that do read the manga will count every member, because they know their position. Positive identification is a requirement for an official appearance, which means we go all or nothing on this. – <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy0830_d67f.html" title="User:Someguy0830">Someguy0830</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESomeguy0830_3c31.html" title="User talk:Someguy0830">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Someguy0830_4a47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Someguy0830">contribs</a>) 19:41, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, you're right. In that case I say we add in "shadow" or "silhouette" to every member, and keep it like that until their full, opaque appearance.

Thusly chapter 238/episode 135 is a cameo for most of the akatsuki members. A hint at their future appearance so to say (similiar to Wolverine having a cameo in Hulk #180 but his 1st appearance is Hulk #181).</dd>
<dd>For example: Deidara's First Appearance: Chapter 246; Episode ??? [Deidara made a cameo in chapter 238;Episode 135 as just a shadow).</dd>

Earlier today the Hidan article was changed from this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akatsuki_%28Naruto%29&amp;oldid=61215347" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akatsuki_%28Naruto%29&amp;oldid=61215347" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akatsuki_%28Naruto%29&amp;oldid=61215347</a> to this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akatsuki_%28Naruto%29&amp;oldid=61239619" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akatsuki_%28Naruto%29&amp;oldid=61239619" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akatsuki_%28Naruto%29&amp;oldid=61239619</a> I believe this changed helped organize subject matter in a more coherent article. This was subsequently improved upon by others in series of three or four updates, just to have someone completeling revert it to the link above. Though slowly it seems to be taking on the shape of the initial change I just found it annoying that somebody was perhaps upset that someone changed their work and reverted everything omitting things like the trivia section, and the link to Kakuzu. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../o/b/f/User%7EObf213_e218.html" title="User:Obf213">Obf213</a> (<a href="../../../o/b/f/User_talk%7EObf213_fb62.html" title="User talk:Obf213">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Obf213_aabf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Obf213">contribs</a>) 0:57, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>I think the first paragraph should be about his mission, and then a separate paragraph should be about his attributes. I think its much more academic than describing everything in one paragraphy with no transition i.e. "They successfully captured the Nibi on their last assignment. He wields a three-bladed scythe..." you see how that complete jumps topics with no transition, meh it could just be me put that sounds sloppy.--<a href="../../../o/b/f/User%7EObf213_e218.html" title="User:Obf213">Obf213</a> 21:11, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This article still needs a fresh-up. First it says Hidan was not happy about having to capture the Nibi alive, and then, on the last line, it says he successfully captured Nibi. I'm not sure exactly how to best rewrite it but it doesn't look too good right now. <a href="../../../g/r/r/User%7EGrrblt_2f06.html" title="User:Grrblt">Grrblt</a> 21:24, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Current status of the bijū</span></h2>
<p>I'm pretty sure they only have three bijū and one Jinchūriki at the moment. The map shows the areas that Hidan and Kakuzu have been searching for their assigned Jinchūriki not the location of all the Jinchūriki. When they say that the Fire Country is the last one, they are talking about their second Jinchūriki. That's the last place they need to search for it. The wouldn't be going after Naruto as he's assigned to Itachi. I really don't think that they could get that many Jinchūriki in a few weeks. <a href="../../../t/t/n/User%7ETTN_1fb9.html" title="User:TTN">Nemu</a> 22:52, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You have to remember the other comments. First, there's their "last one" statement, which in and of itself is not so much. However, add that map (you don't X off things you haven't completed) and the fact that they're heading to the Land of Fire and you have the heavy implication that they must be nearing completion. Also, there's no way Itachi and Kisame could handle the Leaf VIllage alone. They'll need backup. – <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy0830_d67f.html" title="User:Someguy0830">Someguy0830</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESomeguy0830_3c31.html" title="User talk:Someguy0830">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Someguy0830_4a47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Someguy0830">contribs</a>) 22:55, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>They would be checking off places that they've checked. They also say that they must be thorough in their search. If it was Naruto, they wouldn't say that as they know he's located there. The way they say it is that they have no idea where the Jinchūriki they're seaching for is located. I don't really know what the "last one" comment is meant to say, but I would guess that she was with a group or something and that she was just the last one. That's where the "you're not so bad" comment could come from meaning that the rest of the group was weak. <a href="../../../t/t/n/User%7ETTN_1fb9.html" title="User:TTN">Nemu</a> 23:02, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Taking a second look, I'm further convinced my original theory is correct. Take a look at the <a href="http://img105.imageshack.us/img105/55/bijumap3lz.jpg" class="external text" title="http://img105.imageshack.us/img105/55/bijumap3lz.jpg" rel="nofollow">Biju map</a>. Notice the fact that both the Land of the Rice Fields and the Land of Thunder have not one, but two checks within them, and there are three other checks on top of that. Given that we know the Land of Wind has had its biju taken, that would mean eight checks. Clearly, they are not just checking off countries. – <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy0830_d67f.html" title="User:Someguy0830">Someguy0830</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESomeguy0830_3c31.html" title="User talk:Someguy0830">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Someguy0830_4a47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Someguy0830">contribs</a>) 23:16, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I believe those are the different ninja villages(or major villages) that they have searched. I really think if they were after Naruto that they wouldn't have to "search thoroughly". Also, why would they have a map of all the Biju that have been captured when it is one assigned to each person? They don't deal with the other member's Jinchūriki unless they are close like Naruto was at the time. They would also make a bigger deal if there was one left. <a href="../../../t/t/n/User%7ETTN_1fb9.html" title="User:TTN">Nemu</a> 03:33, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Given that there's only one left (supposedly), I'd think they wouldn't want to take any chances. The leader wouldn't be like "Oh let's keep the two man team thing in the face of the most powerful shinobi village instead of working together to capture the last biju." They can change strategy if they wish, and given the fact that both Itachi and Kisame have had trouble, he wouldn't be so foolish as to only send them again. Remember, we do not know the exact workings of the organization. The two man team thing could simply be for tracking down and capturing (if possible) the various demons. They may not hold to it if trouble arises. – <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy0830_d67f.html" title="User:Someguy0830">Someguy0830</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESomeguy0830_3c31.html" title="User talk:Someguy0830">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Someguy0830_4a47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Someguy0830">contribs</a>) 03:38, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You make it seem like there is any comfirmation that more than just those to are heading to the Fire Country. Also, the fact that they say fire country rather than the Leaf Village would add to the X's being villiges that they've scouted. When they are talking, they refer to the Jinchūriki as theirs. They wouldn't do this if it was Naruto. They say "we have one more to take care of" which should mean their second one. <a href="../../../t/t/n/User%7ETTN_1fb9.html" title="User:TTN">Nemu</a> 04:30, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is a translated version, and something always gets lost, but they may have been assigned in Itachi and Kisames place. Theorhetically, they wouldn't draw as much attention. Also, we only know of the one Hidden Village, aside from Smoke, in the Fire Country, and the Smoke village hasn't exactly been portrayed as competent. Think about it logically. They mark seven specific points on the map. The eighth (Sand), is not in the cross-section, but we know that a biju was there, and would logically be checked. The Fire Counrty, point nine, has no mark on it. If the map were simple location marking, then they'd have the Leaf Village marked, because it's a fact that Naruto's there. The fact that only seven marks are on the map means that it's not a location map, as they'd mark off every scouted location were that the only case. Depending on just when they left to get Nibi, that map may very well have been marked with only seven points (including Sand), signifying that those seven were already captured. The way I see it, it simply can't be simple scouting, the numbers are too low and too inconsistent with scouting for that to be the case. – <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy0830_d67f.html" title="User:Someguy0830">Someguy0830</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESomeguy0830_3c31.html" title="User talk:Someguy0830">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Someguy0830_4a47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Someguy0830">contribs</a>) 04:54, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're making assumptions. You can't know for sure what the crosses represent (they could be meeting points, places to check, whatever). They say they're heading for the Fire Country for the last one, but that could be only the last one they've been assigned. And you're not even sure they're talking of Naruto ; there could be another Jinchuuriki than Naruto in the Fire Country.--195.221.0.6 08:40, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>They're logical assumputions, for one thing. Anyway, like I've explained earlier, it is very unlikely that they're places to check. If they were only checking, they'd either have the Fire County marked off (possible location) or may more checks on the map (process of elimination. Click the link above. Several countries are ignored, and only seven points are on that map. Of those seven, they only cover five countries. Sound and Thunder are marked twice in very differen positions. Akatsuki wouldn't be sending their members on random goose chases. That map would more than likely mark the exact location of each biju. Hidan and Kakuzu may not have visited every spot on that map, in fact it's far more likely other Akatsuki went there at the same time, but the fact that they are not heading to another mark means the other biju are being or have been dealt with by this point. I don't speculate unless I can back it up, and this seems the most likely outcome given the current information. – <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy0830_d67f.html" title="User:Someguy0830">Someguy0830</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESomeguy0830_3c31.html" title="User talk:Someguy0830">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Someguy0830_4a47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Someguy0830">contribs</a>) 20:01, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If they are checking the countries for their two Biju, why should they mark the Fire Country off? They don't know where they are located so they have to check each ninja village(that's where all of them will be located). If they're checking for theirs, they aren't going to mark of Naruto. They wouldn't be sending them on wild goose chases. They need to check each village for the Biju because the villages hide the fact that they have them, so it's hard to find them. <a href="../../../t/t/n/User%7ETTN_1fb9.html" title="User:TTN">Nemu</a> 21:05, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hm, maybe. The fact remains that the only people remotely capable of controlling a biju would be a hidden village. They wouldn't just let them wander off, unwanted or otherwise. Since no other demon aside from the nine-tails is mentioned in the Fire Country, why else would they be going there? It all seems a bit too convient for it to be much less than nearing completion of their goals. – <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy0830_d67f.html" title="User:Someguy0830">Someguy0830</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESomeguy0830_3c31.html" title="User talk:Someguy0830">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Someguy0830_4a47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Someguy0830">contribs</a>) 21:18, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It makes far more sense that they are approaching completion than that they are conducting a random search for biju from village to village. Keep in mind the amount of territory they have to cover and the fact that the Hiden Villages seem to know ::as evidenced by the nibi:: that akatsuki is hunting them. This means that the biju are far less likly to be predictably located. Knowing this Akatsuki would likly look elsewhere than JUST one or two Hidden Villages per country and their "search" map would be far more extensively marked. Given the map and the context of the dialoug it's safe to assume that Naruto's the last man standing.
