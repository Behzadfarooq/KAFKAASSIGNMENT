<p>Akako is the god of <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angst.html" title="Angst">angst</a>, especially <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolecent.html" title="Adolecent">teenage</a> angst. He came into existence many generations later than most <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_mythology.html" title="Greek mythology">Greek</a> legends. Born from the <a href="../../../t/e/a/Tears.html" title="Tears">tears</a> of those who could not take the troubles of life, his presence is now especially strong in the <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_7516.html" title="US">US</a>, and he has the most impact on those who decended from the greeks.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAkako_legend_e5f4.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Akako was initially a servant of <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hades.html" title="Hades">Hades</a>, the god of the underworld, and thus was largely ignored by the populous until he was summoned back to his original calling during the <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twentieth_century.html" title="Twentieth century">twentieth century</a>. At first, he was just something created by the humans in some way unknown to the gods. The major gods did not know what to do with him, but since mother earth would not let them kill the godling, they gave him a place in the palace of Hades. As more people, especially men, began committing <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide.html" title="Suicide">suicide</a> for the sole reason of seeing their loved ones again, Hades showed mercy upon them and gave them their own special place in the <a href="../../../u/n/d/Underworld.html" title="Underworld">underworld</a>. Although in the beginning this place was but a wing of the palace, it soon proved far too small an area, and so Akako was granted a plot of land to rule over. After several instances in his realm in which Hades was forced to personally intervene, Akako was given specific powers.</p>
<p>Now, although he is seldom recognized, he is generally accepted as the god of teenage <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depression.html" title="Depression">depression</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide.html" title="Suicide">suicide</a>, or, less drastically, the god of <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angst.html" title="Angst">angst</a>. He is also referred to as the god of <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love.html" title="Love">love</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/r/Sorrow.html" title="Sorrow">sorrow</a>, although less commonly. This is not to confuse him with <a href="../../../e/r/o/Eros_%28mythology%29.html" title="Eros (mythology)">Eros</a><small>1</small>, the god of love, or <a href="../../../d/i/o/Dionysus%2C.html" title="Dionysus,">Dionysus,</a> the god of tragedy<small>2</small>. He was called this because suicides in the ancient world happened most often when a lover died and the other did not have the will to live on alone.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAkako_legend_e5f4.html" title="Edit section: Influence/Origin of Name">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Influence/Origin of Name</span></h2>
<p>Proof of Akako’s influence is the word itself, <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angst.html" title="Angst">angst</a>, which bears a slight resemblance to the minor god’s given name, or the one he is sometimes known by, <a href="../../../a/k/i/Akito_Sohama_2abd.html" title="Akito Sohama">Akito</a><small>3</small>. After many generations of <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oral_tradition.html" title="Oral tradition">oral tradition</a>, it is believed that the tale arrived in <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>, where the name was changed to make it more Japanese. The original name presumably had enough similarity to the one the <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_people.html" title="Japanese people">Japanese</a> had given him that when tales of the godling spread once more, he became known as Akako. His Greek name is unknown, but it is speculated that it could derive from <a href="../../../a/e/n/Aengus.html" title="Aengus">Aengus</a>, which bears an even stronger resemblance to agnst.</p>
<p>Aengus was a minor protagonist in <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_mythology.html" title="Irish mythology">Irish mythology</a> and was a god of love, youth, and beauty. The son of one of the people of <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danu.html" title="Danu">Danu</a><small>4</small>, he fell in love with <a href="../../../c/a/e/Caer.html" title="Caer">Caer</a>, a girl who turned into a swan. After passing a test, the girl’s father allowed her to marry Aengus, but their happiness was short-lived. One day, when the girl was a swan, a hunter shot her. Aengus could not even quell his grief by laying her to rest in the proper way, as the hunter had taken her home and eaten her and put up her beautiful feathers as decoration. Aengus’ grief was inconsolable and after a year of <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mourning.html" title="Mourning">mourning</a>, he killed himself to be with his wife in the <a href="../../../a/f/t/Afterlife.html" title="Afterlife">afterlife</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Role_and_Powers" id="Role_and_Powers"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAkako_legend_e5f4.html" title="Edit section: Role and Powers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Role and Powers</span></h2>
<p>Akako’s role is to guide <a href="../../../s/o/u/Souls.html" title="Souls">souls</a> who have separated themselves from their body for reasons that are now commonly associated with <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depression.html" title="Depression">depression</a>. He is often ordered by <a href="../../../z/e/u/Zeus.html" title="Zeus">Zeus</a><small>5</small> to turn those with a great destiny away from his path, however because Akako is not god-born, Zeus does not have as much power over him as he does all other gods. Occasionally, Akako will lure one who is to be a great hero to his path of darkness or whisper into the ear of some widely loved king and thus bring devastation to the mortal world. In this way he is unpredictable, but everything he does to turn people to his path is done for some ulterior motive, but whom it benefits, only he knows.</p>
<p>As more and more souls choose the path to which Akako is the guide, he is given more power by <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hades.html" title="Hades">Hades</a>. He has the power to banish those he rules, either to Hades’ kingdom or to the world of the living, although he seldom does the latter. Perhaps the reason for this is because he does not want to anger the sons and daughters of <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cronus.html" title="Cronus">Cronus</a><small>5</small>. He also has the power to commune with humans outside of <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dream.html" title="Dream">dreams</a> and symbolic signs, and although he cannot change his shape, he looks much like a common person and so is adequately disguised. He ascends to the <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortal.html" title="Mortal">mortal</a> world much more often than any other god.</p>

<p>The most powerful of the gods, <a href="../../../z/e/u/Zeus.html" title="Zeus">Zeus</a>, has a particular dislike for Akako as he is not a descendent of Zeus and feels no need to obey the King of Gods. Zeus’s resentment grew to haltered after Akako drew <a href="../../../e/r/s/Ersa.html" title="Ersa">Ersa</a>, the daughter of Zeus by <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selene.html" title="Selene">Selene</a>, onto his shadowy path. Zeus was forced to use his power as the king of gods to punish Akako for this transgression by freezing him in the body he had, that of a tall and awkward youth, so that he would never reach <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhood.html" title="Manhood">manhood</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghost.html" title="Ghost">dead</a> that Akako presides over lead a privileged death, closer to the one the living live than any other bodiless <a href="../../../s/o/u/Souls.html" title="Souls">souls</a>. They can eat and drink when they please, but since they are insubstantial to the world of the living, they are never hungry. They are never tired, and never have to work. However, since there is no end to <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death.html" title="Death">death</a> as there is to life, all the souls there are there for eternity unless allowed to come back to life by Akako or reborn at the request of the higher gods.</p>

<p>Akako is tall and lanky with straight black hair that partially covers his face. Drawings of him usually depict him without <a href="../../../e/y/e/Eyes.html" title="Eyes">eyes</a>, and it is said the only ones to see his eyes are his privileged dead and those who are about to join them. He is generally dressed in tight-fitting clothing that covers nearly the whole of his body, and either his feet are not shown or he is barefoot. He is often depicted walking or guiding someone down a gently winding black path. Symbols that frequently appear with him are a <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thorn.html" title="Thorn">thorny</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rose.html" title="Rose">rose</a>, a black <a href="../../../p/a/t/Path.html" title="Path">path</a>, a starless night, and wisps of souls that cling to him like white fog. Akako stands alone. He is like no other god, for he was the child of tears from those who took their own life and a <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_%28geology%29.html" title="Rock (geology)">stone</a> soaked in their <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood.html" title="Blood">blood</a> and longing.</p>

<p><a href="../../../a/k/i/Akito.html" title="Akito">Akito</a> from <a href="../../../f/r/u/Fruits_Basket_d711.html" title="Fruits Basket">Fruits Basket</a> plays a different role than Akako did in Greek mythology. Akito is the <a href="../../../h/e/a/Head.html" title="Head">head</a> <a href="../../../o/f/_/Of.html" title="Of">of</a> <a href="../../../h/o/u/Household.html" title="Household">household</a> and would be much closer to Zeus in this way. Akako and Akito both tend to drive those they choose to influence to suicide (although Akito has never actually done so), but the reasons that they do so and the way they do so are very different. Akito strives to break the will of those around him, while Akito cradles the <a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghost.html" title="Ghost">souls</a> of the broken as he guides them gently to the happiest place they can find—death. In this way, Akako is more of a gentle, kind character, although with a scheming mind, and Akito is unwaveringly <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malicious.html" title="Malicious">malicious</a> and cruel.</p>

Please note that this is an entirely fictional legend. I have gathered and created a great deal of supporting evidence that there was a Greek God of Angst and have organized it in a wiki-like format. To the best of my knowlage, there is no relation between <a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAkako_e4ba.html" title="User:Akako">Akako</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_Mythology_4af6.html" title="Greek Mythology">Greek Mythology</a>. Unless of course I'm Greek. But that doesn't really matter, does it.</p>
