<dd>The other one also has semi-spikey hair.

<dd>The one next to the leader has a weird protrusion from his head (which is why people call him "the pineapple") and the one next to Sasori has spiky hair.

<dd>Kakuzu has been identified as the giant because of his ring. In this picture <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Akatsukihand.jpg" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Akatsukihand.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Akatsukihand.jpg</a> the person occupying the left middle finger is the largest, right? Kakuzu is the one who wears his ring on left middle finger. The ring positions work for every other member, which is why this is a positive ID. Now, unless Kishimoto decided to scrap one giant and turn someone else into a new giant, the biggest guy in both pictures are the same person. About Itachi, he is one of the few who had a full introduction before the 238 group shot. Kishimoto would not screw up an already introduced character in that page. He might draw some silhouette that he later decides to change, but he would not leave out the silhouettes we already recognize. Itachi has smooth hair (look it up if you want to), and the only silhouette that matches him is the one between the giant and Sasori. <a href="../../../g/r/r/User%7EGrrblt_2f06.html" title="User:Grrblt">Grrblt</a> 16:03, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm probably missing something here, but how do you make out who has which ring? I know that we know about Kakuzu's ring, but how do you notice the same ring on The Giant? The image of them all standing there is very dark in both the manga and anime. Unless they have more clear picture (to which we should upload it, since it would probably be more confirming). I can't see any rings in there. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Wretched_69e5.html" title="User:The Wretched">The Wretched</a> 23:23, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In fact I don't even know how anyone could see who's who in that pic. Kisame is obvious, what with Samehada on his back, but everyone else... <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Wretched_69e5.html" title="User:The Wretched">The Wretched</a> 23:28, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The only other one that's obvious just by looking is Sasori, since he's the shortest. Well, and Kakuzu, since he's the tallest. The others come from actual hints in the anime and manga. When Deidara speaks, he is shown upside-down in both versions. When the leader talks, that hologram of his shivers in the anime, so that's how we know it that's him. Zetsu's pretty obvious too due to the shape of the head. And Itachi... I guess it's just because of the shape too. <a href="../../../g/e/g/User%7EGeg_04e0.html" title="User:Geg">The Splendiferous Gegiford</a> 23:33, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But I'm saying that the Giant could be the last unknown. Kakuzu, as evident in recent chapters, is not much taller than Hidan. If he was the Giant, Hidan would have to be much taller than he is. I guess it's still possible that it's an error by Kishimoto, but if it is, then it should be mentioned. We couldn't do that yet though, 'cause, assuming that I'm correct that we really don't know who Kakuzu is, we don't know (Lol). <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Wretched_69e5.html" title="User:The Wretched">The Wretched</a> 00:55, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Look, here's the deal. Leader wears his ring on right thumb, and in chapter 255 he is standing on the statue's right thumb. Itachi wears ring on right ring finger, and stands on right ring finger. Zetsu wears on right pinky, and stands on right pinky. Kisame wears on left ring finger, and stands on left ring finger. Orochimaru wears ring on left pinky, and no one is standing there. See the pattern here? Now, from the recent chapters, we know Kakuzu wears his ring on left middle finger. Who is standing on left middle finger? The largest guy. Therefore, Kakuzu is the largest guy in chapter 255. It makes sense that the largest guy in 255 is the largest guy in 238, the "Giant". <a href="../../../g/r/r/User%7EGrrblt_2f06.html" title="User:Grrblt">Grrblt</a> 09:18, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Oh and if you're wondering how we can identify Zetsu, Leader, Itachi etc, just read the whole chapter (255). There are plenty of other pictures in the chapter that can be used to identify these dudes. <a href="../../../g/r/r/User%7EGrrblt_2f06.html" title="User:Grrblt">Grrblt</a> 10:05, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's a very simple pattern. Just see the image in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Akatsukihand.jpg" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Akatsukihand.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Akatsukihand.jpg</a> . The members are each occupying one finger on the giant statue (some spots are not occupied in that picture, but if you read chapter 255 you will see that they have been occupied later on). From the picture above we can only make out Kisame, but from various other images in chapter 255, we can identify a lot of the members and where they are standing. It turns out that everyone is standing on the same finger as they wear their ring on. The guy with a ring on his left index finger, is standing on the giant statue's index finger. Same applies for all other members. The only finger which is NOT occupied, is the left pinky. Orochimaru wore his ring on left pinky, and he is no longer with Akatsuki so no one is standing on the giant's left pinky. Do not continue reading until you understand this pattern. When you do, consider this: The largest guy on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Akatsukihand.jpg" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Akatsukihand.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Akatsukihand.jpg</a> is standing on the giant statue's left middle finger. Kakuzu wears his ring on left middle finger. That means Kakuzu is the largest guy. <a href="../../../g/r/r/User%7EGrrblt_2f06.html" title="User:Grrblt">Grrblt</a> 00:05, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>4th Hokage didn't have a doujutsu. Leader doesn't have to be strong to boss them around, he could just be the man with the plan. 4th is dead without a doubt; the manga describes him as dead several times. He is not a bad guy, because he saved his village from destruction, he is loved by everyone who knew him and Naruto wants to be like him. I was on topic so shut up yourself; not my fault that you don't like the fact that 4th and leader are different people. <a href="../../../8/1/2E/User%7E81.233.40.12.html" title="User:81.233.40.12">81.233.40.12</a> 19:09, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>sorry if i afended you but the leader has blonde hair not like the uchiha's hair, i know this because in the manga there is a flashback and they say: "the blonde haired worior and the old akatsuki leader face of and the blonde haired worior defeated the old akatsuki leader and becomes the new leader." i'm not saying thats"proof"but it does mean that it's not an uchiha. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGeterdone_74d9.html" title="User:Geterdone">Geterdone</a> (<a href="../../../g/e/t/User_talk%7EGeterdone_f6a4.html" title="User talk:Geterdone">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Geterdone_8348.html" title="Special:Contributions/Geterdone">contribs</a>) 23:02, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>Since when can an Uchiha not have blonde hair? Is there some law against it? I'm sorry to say, but the leader being the Fourth is never going to happen.

<dd>i didn't say its not possible its just unlikely and doesn't madara have black hair? but there is a jutsu that orochimaru has that resurected hokage to fight the 1st and the 2nd came out but the third one remained closed and oro was fighting the third so the 4th is the only one left and if one of the hokage is strong enough it can b indapedant and can't b controled by the user. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGeterdone_74d9.html" title="User:Geterdone">Geterdone</a> (<a href="../../../g/e/t/User_talk%7EGeterdone_f6a4.html" title="User talk:Geterdone">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Geterdone_8348.html" title="Special:Contributions/Geterdone">contribs</a>) 23:19, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p>Friends = leading cause of confusion. I'm not saying not to make friends, just don't trust everything they've said about any TV shows and/or Stories of any kind without reading it yourself. In fact, I wouldn't even trust Wikipedia fully right now. Lots of people add things that are mere rumor and could never happen or could, but don't have solid evidence yet. A prime example would be the claims that Shikamaru and Temari have a relationship. There are very minor hints but that's about it. Don't trust anyone when they tell you that Shikamaru and Temari are a couple. It could happen, but hasn't yet. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Wretched_69e5.html" title="User:The Wretched">The Wretched</a> 01:09, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm gonna have to say that I think it's either the Yondaime or Uchiha Madara. And if you say the Yondaime is dead...uh...yeah. That sure as hell didn't stop Orochimaru from nearly reviving him in his fight with Sandaime. Or, for all we know, he dodged death somehow. I mean, are we forgetting the jutsu that the Akatsuki Leader used to make the clones of Itachi and Kisame? The shapeshifting Jutsu? He could've stuck most of his chakra into that, and then had it go and seal the Kyuubi into Naruto while the real Yondaime gets the hell outta dodge. Just something worth considering - Viewtiful Rekk (Not sure how to sign these things still....&gt;_&gt;; )</dd>

<p>(this is another person intrudind)- the leader has browin light hair and may not be either of the two. The Uchiha clan tend to have dark coloured hair and theres the fact that Orochimaru konws who the leader is. All the ninjas have to do is find and ask Orochimaru. Dont forget he also has the ring he recieved from Akatsuki.</p>
<p>These rings have a special power in them thats everone haas forgotten about. The 4th did a technique that sent him to hell as the stomach of the death god (shinigami) is hell so all the hokages of konoha apart from the 5th are in hell. The only two possible way the 4th could come back to life is by the seal he placed on naruto breacking and therfore hisimprisoning breaking and him being set free.</p>
<p>The second is the Orochimaru using that technique to bring him back to life and the third (ive just thought of) is by someone devoloping a technique like chiyos which brings people back to life. if you look at the cover of chapter 317 in the manga youll see his hair is th colour of a light brown but personally i think hes Mandara because the Kyuubi state he was the only one who could supress the beasts chakra.</p>
<p>I think if they had a fight with all the Akatsuki members Kakashi would find out tobi is Obito Uchiha and they would fight and Tenzo(Yamato) would fight the Akatsuki Leader because one can control the power of the bijuu and one can supress the power of this. Also if the seal on Kyuubi broke Naruto would die and 4th would live again so it would be like one life for another.</p>
<p>when it comes down to it all the rivalries in naruto have to face each other and Naruto facing Saske will be the most interesting. thats all ive got...</p>

<dd>If he is a pre-existing character, I would bet that he is the fourth (guessing from the hair). For some reason, the story has been very very quiet about who the Fourth was and his relation to Naruto, but a lot about the Fourth's story seems fishy. He's so very much like Naruto (frog summons, same jutsus), yet no one mentions it directly (other than Jirya's cryptic "forgive me, fourth"). He supposedly died sealing the biju, and yet we've now met characters who have both sealed and released bijus without dying. Something is very obviously "up." But it's all speculation.</dd>

<dd>Oh, okay. Well, if that's what it stands for, then my answer is this: no one knows. I think it's very likely, as Itachi <i>did</i> mention that if Sasuke obtained it, then the total who could handle it would be 'three'. Itachi was the only known person with the ability at the time. Kakashi developed it much later. However, we can't jump to conclusions. It's still possible he could be talking about someone else... <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Wretched_69e5.html" title="User:The Wretched">The Wretched</a> 03:50, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would guess that if Madara is still alive, then he has the MS. Itachi said there were three capable of using it, and he did not consider Kakashi able to do it. But there is a very good chance that Madara was some strong Uchiha legendary from hundreds of years ago, and Sasuke is the only person since then to achieve his "cursed chakra" and that stuff. Of course, even if he did 500 years ago there's still a chance he had the MS. But in that case, he isn't the third MS user. <a href="../../../g/r/r/User%7EGrrblt_2f06.html" title="User:Grrblt">Grrblt</a> 09:01, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Where does he specifically say that Kakashi isn't capable of it? Itachi says that there are only three people CAPABLE of acquiring it, and given that he has just killed every single other known person with a Sharigan other than Kakashi and Sasuke (and himself), he might mean this quite matter of factly: there are now only three people left alive who even have the Sharingan in the first place (and thus only three who can attain it). Note also that just because Madara is Uchiha doesn't mean that the cursed chakra is related to the Sharingan. Sasuke's powers are quite litterally also based on a curse: the very curse powers that Sasuke believes make him special (more special than nine-tails powers). The Nine-Tails could just as easily be referring to that. We probably won't know for a while now regardless. &#160;:(Plunge 21:15, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(Someone)- The name Akatsuki means dawn or red moon like someone said already and Itachi can make a red moon like the name Akatsuki which could indicate whoever made Akatsuki could do that tecnique Itachi can do so he could be Uchiha Mandara. so its probaly Mandara whos doing all of this.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sasori listed as "former member"?</span></h2>
<p>Since the series will no doubt result in the deaths of many of the Atatsuki members, I would suggest that we should not establish a precedent of moving deceased members into the "former" category, at least until we know for sure that they will be replaced by another character at some point in the future. Orichimaru is legitimately a "former" member because he had left the group before we even meet him in the story. Sasori, though, we saw as an active Atatsuki member, and he merely died, not renounced his allegiance. None of the other pages work this way just when a character dies (for instance, dead members of the Sound Village are not listed as "former members") The format of the page should in general not be set up so that it changes based on future events in the manga. This is an encylopedia that has to look at the series from a more distant and objective perspective rather than something constantly shifting its structure in response to new events. 69.171.60.23 18:40, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Tobi looks like he is set to take Sasoris role so that would mke Sasori a former member. There could possibly be a deceased members section. I doubt many more Akatsuki are going to be replaced when they die,I'd be willing to stake a large bet that Tobi is the one and only.<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkwarriorblake_8272.html" title="User:Darkwarriorblake">Darkwarriorblake</a> 19:25, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First of all, that's by no means confirmed and all we hear of it is that Zetsu says it isn't that easy. But second of all, a wikipedia entry should not treat an entry on a fictional organization as if it were keeping track of the "current" roster of the group (as if it were chronicling real ongoing events!). It should speak as an overview of the storytelling as a whole, and generally the _structure_ of the entries should be biased to how things are at the start of the story, if anything (to avoid spoilers via implication). Orichimaru is sensibly in his own category as a former member only because that's his relationship to the organization as a story begins and remains his relationship throughout the story. If he rejoins Atatsuki at some point in the story, is then going to be taken OUT of the former member section, leaving only Sasori??? That just doesn't seem to be a sensible way to structure an entry on a fictional organization. 69.171.60.23 20:35, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dead or disbanded people can't very well participate, now can they? If it gets to the point where a lot of them die, then it'll be reformatted to indicate the group's non or reduced existence.

<dd>I agree. I had thought about this too, as I'm the one who originally added Sasori to the Former Members section, but as of now, he's the only dead member, so it's fine the way it is. If it gets to the point where it looks like several or all of the members will die (which, given the nature of Naruto and shounen mangas in general, will most likely happen), then we can worry about reorganizing everything. <a href="../../../g/e/g/User%7EGeg_04e0.html" title="User:Geg">The Splendiferous Gegiford</a> 20:57, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But you're all missing the point. You are treating this as if it were a blog or a news report instead of an encyclopedia entry. You're not supposed to update someone's status based on events that happen more than halfway into the story as if you were breathlessly relating recent current events. If anything, entries should be baised towards a structure that reflects the status of things at the start of the story, not altered so that they reflect the way things are now or at the end of the story (will every member then be in the "former" category???!) Furthermore, it's inconsistent with all the rest of the Naruto pages. The Third is dead, but he's not in a category of "former" Konoha villagers. Dead sound aren't "former" sound. etc.69.171.60.23 16:07, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First, there's one other person, so we is an appropriate generalization. Second, you're the one complaining over one measely person. He's dead. He's not a current member. Get over it. In fact, while you're at it, why don't you complain about the constant updates on the plot pages, or the character pages, or every other page for that matter. Wikipedia is routinely updated to reflect the most current information available. This will not change. It isn't like a paper encyclopedia, whose information will be out of date eventually. – <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy0830_d67f.html" title="User:Someguy0830">Someguy0830</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESomeguy0830_3c31.html" title="User talk:Someguy0830">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Someguy0830_4a47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Someguy0830">contribs</a>) 01:07, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Those changes all make sense because they proceed apace without changing the 'structure' of the entries. Atatsuki is a fictional organization, not a real one, and an entry on it has to describe its membership from the perspective of an overview of the ENTIRE series, not "what things are like in the manga right this second." That overview structure, again, should be if anything biased towards the structure of things at the start of the story, and updates and new events should be described within those entries or in the appropriate plot sections. Again, you can't treat a fictional group as if it were some current event with an up to date roster. There is no up to date: it's a story that has a start and will one day end.69.171.60.23 06:19, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And when it ends it'll still be up to date. You got your wish of moving him. My point is that you're being far too picky about a single character at some point in time.

<p>I'm gonna have to back the decision, its stupid to have him in the former members section. Orochimaru is a former member, he quit. Sasori simply died and his spot has yet to be filled, thusly until that point I say we keep him in the members section, otherwise we'd simply have to apply that everytime one of them died we would place them as former members until there is no members (under the presumption all of akatsuki will at some point likely be defeated and killed). If anything, sasori should be made part of a 'dead members' section until he is replaced, as for all intents and purposes he is still technically a member....just dead. So end point, PUT SASORI BACK IN THE MEMBERS SECTION. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidusunknown_ed20.html" title="User:Midusunknown">Midusunknown</a> 21:49, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Except it makes no difference. Tobi joining makes him a member, but that doesn't have anything to do with whether it makes any sense to call someone a former member because they died. If anything, it would make more sense for Tobi to be in his own section as a "Newer Member" since, again, wikipedia articles on fictional characters are supposed to be structured as an overview with a bias to the status of things as the story starts, not how it ends or proceeds halfway in.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hidan??? What's his village?</span></h2>
<p>I've noticed Hidan's headband doesnt seem to portray any village i've seen in the manga so far or in the anime. It is also not mentioned on the Wikipedia entry for the Hidden Villages. Its three curvy lines almost like a strange mist village mark. We haven't seen any of his attacks besides the use of that tripple-bladed scythe so we cant guess his element from his attacks.</p>
<p>I just wondered if anyone knows what village it is or if anyone has any ideas. -- Justice san, 17th July06, 18:00GMT</p>
<dl>
<dd>At first it seemed like it was a mistake by the artist, and that his headband bears the symbol of either Hidden Grass or Hidden Rain. However, a chapter later we got a good many views of it and it doesn't match either. Hidan is most likely from a not yet introduced village, or the headband could be a mark of his religion rather than his village (though I've no idea why he would scratch his religion's symbol). <a href="../../../g/r/r/User%7EGrrblt_2f06.html" title="User:Grrblt">Grrblt</a> 23:02, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">akatsuki clothes</span></h2>
<p>Wikipedia says that akatsuki means dawn or daybreak but people say it's red cloud and i thoght it meant dawn too but on the akatsuki picture they have red clouds on there clothes so does that mean it really does mean red cloud?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Many people believe Akatsuki means "Red Moon" because Aka can mean Red and Tsuki can mean Moon. However, this is the case of a homonym (just like "i <b>saw</b> him" and "hammer and <b>saw</b>" sound the same but have different meanings). The real translation for Akatsuki in this case is Dawn.

<p>In Kisame's profile you can notice this "Kisame is the only other person to use Suiton Ninjutsu without a water source besides the Second Hokage". The point that im trying to into is "Did Yamato use ( Suiton: Takitsubo no Jutsu ) without a water source&#160;??".

I don't have those particlar manga chapters so I'm not sure what it's for, but the fact that Gaara's in front of it leads me to believe that extraction ritual takes place there. It'd be helpful if someone who's read those chapters would elaborate. – <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy0830_d67f.html" title="User:Someguy0830">Someguy0830</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESomeguy0830_3c31.html" title="User talk:Someguy0830">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Someguy0830_4a47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Someguy0830">contribs</a>) 03:35, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can't take the time right now to write something decent, but the statue is so far only used for the bijuu extraction ritual. The leader apparently summons it, and releases (unsummons) it right after they're done. The members each occupy one of the statue's fingers, the same finger as they wear their ring on. It has nine eyes, one eye is opened for each bijuu extracted/assimilated (as would be the case with Sanbi). It wears a pair of handcuffs, leading some to speculate that it will break free once all eyes are opened. It kinda looks like it's made of wood, making some people think Leader is a mokuton user. As part of the extraction ritual, all members say the kanji of the "opposite" member; Leader on left thumb will say the kanji on Sasori/Tobi's ring on the right thumb and vice versa. Zetsu is the only one who says his own ring kanji, because his "opposite" member is the missing Oro. That's what I can remember right now. <a href="../../../g/r/r/User%7EGrrblt_2f06.html" title="User:Grrblt">Grrblt</a> 07:05, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

With this each Akatsuki member stands on The King of Hell Statue's fingers that match their ring position, then The Leader activates The statue with his technique and nine spectral dragon spew from the statue's mouth and enter the jinchūriki's body. After a certain time limit (Three dayus with nine Akatsuki rings) the Bijū is absorbed into The King of Hell Statue and one of it's nine eyes will open to show how many and which Bijū the Akatsuki have. This summon appears to be a key item in The Akatsuki Leader's plan since he quickly removed it from The old Akatsuki hideout in The River Country when <a href="../../../s/a/k/Sakura_Haruno_7ef1.html" title="Sakura Haruno">Sakura Haruno</a> and <a href="../../../a/k/a/Akatsuki_%28Naruto%29_bcb8.html#Sasori_no_Akasuna" title="Akatsuki (Naruto)">Sasori of the Red Sands</a> destroyed the cave it was held in. <b>Trivia</b></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Zetsu's country.</span></h2>
<p>Motion to remove Zetsu's country being listed as Grass. Theres is no evidence to support this.</p>
<p>Previous discussion has pointed out that he is shown wearing a grass headband during his first appearance. I've checked this myself and no, it does not show ANY headband, grass or otherwise.</p>
<p>As well, in the great herobook, it shows the symbol of the countries that the revealed Akatsuki members are from, except for Zetsu, who has a question mark instead.</p>
<p>Also, since Akatsuki members 1 to 5 (assuming the leader is 0) have shown to be following the tradional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_elements_%28Japanese_philosophy%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_elements_%28Japanese_philosophy%29" rel="nofollow">Five elements (Japanese philosophy)</a>, the first being earth (Deidara is from the Earth country), the third being fire (Itachi is from the Fire country) and the fith being sky (Orochimaru's ring reads as sky), Then it is safe to assume that member #2 is from a water related country (most likely Rain. He/she is shown wearing a miniature umbrella in his/her hair) and Zetsu from an air related country (most likely Lightning). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by HakuGaara (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HakuGaara_3eeb.html" title="Special:Contributions/HakuGaara">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>Just because a scan is darker and less visable doesn't mean a person should just edit it however they feel. Also, if it really was visable then why would the herobook (which came out well after) put a question mark were his country should be? I'm not asking to put his country as something else. just remove it as being Grass until there is more concrete confirmation aside from a doctored pic. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by HakuGaara (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HakuGaara_3eeb.html" title="Special:Contributions/HakuGaara">contribs</a>) .</small></dd>

<dd>It's OBVIOUS. Do a zoom in on both our respective pics. On mine it shows that area as being black on one side and white on the other. On yours it shows both sides being the white of a metal headband. Since its obvious that yours has had considerably more 'cleaning' done to it (yes, cleaning is a form of doctoring), it is safe to assume that the pictured headband is false. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by HakuGaara (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HakuGaara_3eeb.html" title="Special:Contributions/HakuGaara">contribs</a>) .</small></dd>
