<p>I wasn't promoting that Hidan is from the grass village (I need much much more evidence before I attempt to prove you wrong) I was indicated the three seperate bars, so if he's from any village currently known, it's most likely the rain. ReaperWarrior</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Itachi vs Kakashi</span></h2>
<p>Im not sure if im going too far into speculative but I was wondering at the beggining of the battle when Itachi attacked kakashi with Water Release: Water Fang Bullet so fast that kakashi could barley keep up, if Itachi used one hand to initiate the jutsu or if he just used his two hands under the cloak. In the anime I dont remember seeing movements under his cloak which lead me to think that Itachi used a one handed jutsu like Haku.BLaCk 20:11, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, Itachi DID state that he could put genjutsu on people using only one finger, remember? So I don't really see why he shouldn't be able to use one hand seals... Kakashi DID state that he couldn't "keep up with the seal formations" which might or might not imply that he was using fully visible seals, but at a speed that no eye could follow... It WOULD however make more sense if Itachi was able to use any kind of technique with one hand, or one finger in some cases... The only thing we can say for sure is: If itachi gives you the finger, you're in deep shit.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Kakuzu of Akatsuki</span></h2>
<p>In the recent manga chapter of Naruto (325), there was something seen. On the last page of the manga chapter where Kakuzu of Akatsuki picks up Hidan's head of Akatsuki, you can see part of his arm with a strange material on it. It is thought that, like Sasori, he only has certain body parts still functioning. All of his limbs are theoretically connected to a robotic sort of body. Like Sasori the rest of his body is made of a different material. This could explain why he covers himself completely so you can only see his eyes, and why he has such immense strenght. Also with his anger and rage to randomly attack things it is theorically thought that he was hurt by someone, possibly by Hidan's curse to be damaged so much.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What to trivia, what not to trivia</span></h2>
<p><b>Trivia can be defined as information that is <i>interesting</i> without being <i>important</i>.</b> from <a href="../../../t/r/i/WP%7ETrivia_e90c.html" title="WP:Trivia">WP:Trivia</a>. Twice now has the shogi connections been removed from trivia section into the main body of their respective entries. Right now, I fail to see how such information is <i>important</i> for those characters; they don't tell us anything noteworthy about the person. The connection is really only there when the two shogi pieces are mentioned together. Hisha (飛) can mean a number of things on its own and so can Kakugyo (角); in conjunction, however, the shogi references are clear. It's like in English, if you saw a character named Bishop you couldn't make any connections to chess. If, however, this Bishop person has a partner named Rook, then you would be on to something. And as of 325, Hidan and Kakuzu have done <i>nothing</i> connected to shogi - the name things just aren't <i>important</i> when explaining their persona (you wouldn't explain the etomology of a real person's name, because that's not important either). But as the connections are clearly there, they are still <i>interesting</i> and there must be a reason for naming them so. Hence, the fit the trivia description perfectly and I see no reason why the shogi connections shouldn't again be put into trivia section.</p>
<p>Also note that this is not intended to be a discussion solely on these two trivia items. People seem to have taken "too much non-notable trivia" to mean "delete the trivia, dude" when that is simply not the case, non-notable trivia is information that is neither interesting or important, such as the Deidara reference to the Sun Pagoda that I deleted a while ago. I just brought up the Hidan/Kakuzu things because it's what comes to mind right now and they are in pressing need of being changed. <a href="../../../g/r/r/User%7EGrrblt_2f06.html" title="User:Grrblt">Grrblt</a> 06:09, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, Hidan means something like Flying Step and google translation gives Kakuzu as "Angular Capital". The shogi references are inferred only because they're on the same team (if they hadn't been, it would have been as loose a connection as the one Ru.spider suggested for the Gyoku ring) and they don't explain the full name at all. A comparison with <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shichibukai.html#Donquixote_Doflamingo" title="Shichibukai">Donquixote Doflamingo</a> from One Piece would be more appropriate; the name Donquixote doesn't really mean anything particular in this case, but it is still a reference to a famous fictional character. It has, quite correctly in my opinion, been marked as trivia. Itachi's "weasels are bad omens" stuff should probably be considered trivia too, as it is likely one of the reasons for his name but it doesn't tell anything about the character (Itachi the ninja is not generally seen as a sign for bad omens). Kisame, Sasori and Orochimaru are different because their names are directly referring to their characters. With Deidara, Zetsu and Tobi I don't really know what their name means so I can't comment there. <a href="../../../g/r/r/User%7EGrrblt_2f06.html" title="User:Grrblt">Grrblt</a> 08:15, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>i believe Orochimaru left not because itachi is stronger than him but more of the fact he is hiding something. I think he left because he has one of the tailed demons in him. Maybe its the 8th tailed demon it said that it might be a snake. (Hence Orochimaru's snake like appearence and mastery of snake jutsu.)and the reason he took the ring with him is because i also believe that the ring can track down the tailed beast the user is meant to find, meaning the Akatsuki was going to find him soon so he lefted and took the ring with him so they couldnt track him. That is what i believe anyway.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Crooked like a Bishop?</span></h2>
<p>Frmo Kakuzu's entry: "Like a bishop, Kakuzu is crooked personality-wise, only doing things which can earn him money." If this is a reference to some japanese concept of the bishop character in shogi, that needs to be more explicit. As it is, it sounds like the article is saying that all bishops (which in the west mean largely religious leaders) are crooked and corrupt. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Plunge (<a href="../../../p/l/u/User_talk%7EPlunge_afae.html" title="User talk:Plunge">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Plunge_62ff.html" title="Special:Contributions/Plunge">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Did you read the sentence before that? Because it gives a link to what a <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shogi.html#Bishop" title="Shogi">bishop</a> is, and that meaning carries along to the next sentence.

<dd>Agreed that there is a link, but still: "Like a bishop, Kakuzu is crooked personality-wise"??? That seems like a pretty bizarre poetic pun, especially since "moves diagonally on a chess board" doesn't necessarily conjure up the meaning "crooked" in the first place (not to mention that Kakuzu hasn't demonstrated that he is especially "crooked" away: crooked about what? Has he betrayed anyone? Is he especially more of a criminal than the other Akatsuki? So we're left with "he's named like the bishop piece, which moves diagonally, which is sort of like something being crooked in space, which is sort of like being a crooked, decietful person, which is often associated with being greedy"). Unless this strange comparison is made anywhere in the manga, I say toss it. Wikipedia authors are not supposed to be making up bizarre leaps of descriptive logic like that. Either the connection should be an obvious and direct allusion, something widely discussed, or actually mentioned in the manga. This fits none of those things. Plunge 22:31, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is obvious, you just over analyze everything. Crooked like a Bishop means that Kakuzu doesn't always concentrate just on his mission, he gets sidetracked and focuses on his need for more and more money. If you still don't get it Crooked like a Bishop means that he doesn't move in a straight line (meaning he doesn't concentrate on his mission) instead he moves diangley, like a biship does (meaning that he gets sidetracted when on a mission).<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_ov_the_blue_sand_359d.html" title="User:Sam ov the blue sand">Sam ov the blue sand</a> 02:00, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Members</span></h2>
<p>Sorry that I post this here but I'm really not in the mood to start learning this whole posting thing.. The point is that I'm quite pissed off 'cause someone's claiming there are 10 Akatsuki members. I've fixed the fact twice and it's back to 10 again. There's never been 10 Akatsuki members! Who the heck said there had been?? When Sasori was alive, there was no Tobi in Akatsuki and so there were 9 members and when Sasori died, Tobi replaced him and, again, there were 9. So, if the one editing the page back to 10 is reading, I'd really hope you'd stop 'cause that's a big fact to mess up with and Naruto's sacred. --- Pissed.Off.Again. (20:50, 6 October 2006 (UTC))</p>

<dd>Maybe Sasori was but what about the others? I've never heard that anyone would have known when the members joined Akatsuki. And no-one's ever said there's been ten members so that can't be stated as a fact. Ok, I agree that maybe there HAS been ten members at some point but that's not a fact.

<p>Why? Because we haven't gotten around to moving the information yet. Also, for those claiming the info should have stayed here, the third comment <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGood_articles_Disputes_Archive_5_bc68.html#Akatsuki_.28Naruto.29" title="Wikipedia:Good articles/Disputes/Archive 5">here</a> might interest you, in which the fact that we have information that should go in more specific articles was given as a reason for GA delisting. Basically, character lists exist in two formats: First format is a "holding pen", in which the information is kept with the expectation that they be moved into their own article once sufficient length is met. The second format is a minimalistic description, which is not expanded into detail but simply gives a brief overview of the characters. We are definitely not being minimalistic here. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 18:19, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll add to that. Aside from their obvious treason, we don't know what many done beyond that. We know Kisame has assassinated at least one feudal lord and Itachi slaughtered his family.

<p>Just a new section of information, I really think it would be a good addition even if the info is scarce. The article if about Akatsuki and it's members, it should say everything about them. Also, wasn't Sasori wanted for something along with him leaving the Sand Village?ReaperWarrior</p>

<p>True. But if I recall he was responsible for the dissapearance and death of the 3rd Kazekage wasn't he? Even if it was a mystery at the time, the crime is serious, so it should be included if this addtion is made. Also Sasori himself said that with his Hundred Puppet Jutsu he took down a country which in my opinion, is very bad.ReaperWarrior</p>
<dl>
<dd>He was never convicted of either of those crimes, nor does anyone else aside from Chiyo and Sakura ever learn of the fact until shortly before his death.

<p>I suppose it could be that no one knew it was him that did it, hiding under Hiruko and all. All that could be put would be Treason, and crimes against humanity (human puppets). Anyways, we need to put in a list of crimes those 3 commited, if not soon, then what they did to be labelled as S-Class criminals will be said later in the series, we best put it in now, like what was done with the targetted tailed beast bits.ReaperWarrior</p>
<dl>
<dd>I removed the crime additions because all of them, with the exception of Kisame, are already mentioned in the respective character's descriptions. Furthermore, there are already far too many bullets for each category, and the <b>Crime/s</b> tops the cake for most useless. <i><b>~Snapper<a href="../../../s/n/a/User_talk%7ESnapper2_c216.html" title="User talk:Snapper2">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Snapper2_6870.html" title="Special:Contributions/Snapper2">o</a></b></i> 02:39, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, that is what I meant, yet it and a few other things didn't come out very well. While we're discussing additions to the article, maybe I can propose some removals?

<dd>The main reason for there being both a <b>Cameo</b> and an <b>Appearance</b> is because the Leader, who is known solely as a shadowy figure, has technically not made an appearance, or at least not to the same degree that characters like Zetsu or Itachi have. Despite this fact, he has played a fairly prominent role in the series, so it would be best to fudge and say he makes an appearance in chapter 245 or something.</dd>
<dd>This creates problems though, as Deidara has a line in episode 135, and Hidan and Kakuzu appear as silhouettes in the same episode. While their presence in that scene is of little importance, who's to say those aren't appearances as well? They are, after all, no more visible than the Leader always is, so if he is acknowledged as having appeared, so should all of the other characters, and this is why both bullets exist. Unless a special rule is made for the Leader and only the Leader's appearance, having only one of the two can't work. <i><b>~Snapper<a href="../../../s/n/a/User_talk%7ESnapper2_c216.html" title="User talk:Snapper2">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Snapper2_6870.html" title="Special:Contributions/Snapper2">o</a></b></i> 20:29, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

But I can accept the crime/s debate, I'll just add something in Kisame's profile on the assassination. ReaperWarrior</p>

<dd>You mustn't mistake my comment for being in favor of keeping either bullet; I still don't think the article needs either.

<p>1. I was being sarcastic by saying you meant the Fourth Hokage. 2.

Your last comment shows another reason why I don't like that site because sometimes you get differnt translations, and get confused on wether or not Hiden was talking to the leader or he was talking to god.

<dd>I'm pretty sure the "god" is referring to a "god of salvation/rescue", which is to say that Shikamaru's team's "god of rescue" wasn't the arriving back-up, but the Akatsuki leader - it's just a figure of speech, it doesn't mean that the Akatsuki Leader is literally a god. //Frostious 09:52, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's speculation, and still telepathy through a medium.

<dd>It's not clear whether the leader had to speak for it to work, but he does do that in one scene, and more importantly Hidan can communicate with him, and he spoke for the entire duration of their short conversation, I'm not saying it has to be something like Yamato's seeds, it could be a radio that picks up subvocalizations, or something similar to Hiraishin, or something completely different. My point is that the leaders' use of telepathy is speculation, especially since it's supposed to involve communicating information without using the normal senses, and both he and Hidan spoke. And unless the leader uses some sort of power other then chakra then telepathy should involve projecting chakra into someone else's brain, which would be considered genjutsu, and the leader, or any of the other members, doesn't seem like the kind of people that would like other people to be inside their heads.</dd>

<dd>Why do you seek to make a ridiculously complicated explanation for something so simple? Every member can astral project and the leader can contact them with no visible assistance. Telepathy is the easiest and most accurate assessment given what we saw him do. Also, how would Yamato's wood seeds be remotely capable of doing something like that? Let me make my point now. If they can send their minds to any place they choose, telepathy isn't a difficult trick. You're trying to invent some reason to somehow prove your point, which is even more speculative than telepathy. Telepathy is simple, direct, and in context accurate. – <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy0830_d67f.html" title="User:Someguy0830">Someguy0830</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESomeguy0830_3c31.html" title="User talk:Someguy0830">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Someguy0830_4a47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Someguy0830">C</a>) 05:21, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The clarifier "some form" is used before telepathy because we don't know exactly how he did it. All we know is he did it from a different, and apparently far away, city and transmitted the orders in such a way that only Hidan and Kazuzu heard him with no external help.

<dd>Two? Weren't Itachi and Kisame also there, since they had to go outside to control the clones? Zetsu may or may not have been there since he was told to scout with his real body, but that's still at least four, and the cover of 317 would suggest that they were all there, though I'm not going to claim that they are just because of that. And I know that the caves are different, that's why I wrote caves instead of cave. As for telepathy I just don't think anything like that should be put without it being explicitly stated, but in the end I guess it doesn't really matter since it'll be cleared up eventually anyways.

<dd>Deidara and Sasori are the only people known to be there. It's possible that the leader was there as well, but his whole "I'm a friggin' shadow-man friggin' all the time" thing makes it hard to tell. Chapter 255 suggests that Itachi and Kisame weren't there, as both are seen in their true forms after conversing with the Leader. While it's possible that this was just Yura and the other guy affected by the Leader's jutsu, the fact that they're seen together sitting down and in a "sealing" pose gives the impression that they're the real deal. <i><b>~Snapper<a href="../../../s/n/a/User_talk%7ESnapper2_c216.html" title="User talk:Snapper2">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Snapper2_6870.html" title="Special:Contributions/Snapper2">o</a></b></i> 21:09, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

By cornering the market on shinobi labor by charging lower prices than their competitors, Akatsuki will drive their competitors out of business. The shinobi villages can't afford to chage the low prices that Akatsuki would be charging, and thus would lose their business to Akatsuki.

<p>I know that rumors arn't supposed to be posted in wikipedia, but both Kisame and Kabuto's articles stated fans believed they might be Biju. Well, I read this, and realized how much sence it makes. Tobi could be Obito.</p>
<ul>
<li>Their names have very similar spellings</li>
<li>Obito would have one eye, Tobi's mask has one eye hole</li>
<li>Obito died in the Grass Country, he is Zetsu's subordinate, and Zetsu is from Hidden Grass</li>
<li>Their personalities are very similar, and both of their articles compare them to Naruto</li>

<p>He is thought to have died. Better? And other rumors have been posted before, such as Kisame having thought to been the Sanbi (as I mentioned before.) This one has a lot more evidence than that.</p>
<dl>
<dd>No it doesn't. Kisame had evidence. The man's a walking shark. Tobi's got nothing except an eye-hole, a vague age, and a vaguely similar name. The only similarity is in the kanji for their names: Tobi (トビ) and Obito (オビト). Just a partially reversed kanji is all. – <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy0830_d67f.html" title="User:Someguy0830">Someguy0830</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESomeguy0830_3c31.html" title="User talk:Someguy0830">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Someguy0830_4a47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Someguy0830">C</a>) 23:03, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And Gaara doesn't look like a Racoon Dog. Naruto only posses whisker things, not a whole body appearence of a fox. At least not until 4 tails are released. And Yugito doesn't look like a cat. So that evidence is not supported by what we've seen in the manga so far. And just because he resembled what could have been a shark, did not make it true at all. I could say that Obito/Tobi need to be mentioned in each others articles because I consider this evidence. I just think we should mention something about him being believed to be Obito.</dd>

<dd>Lately ive been behind in the manga reading a chapter or so evry once in a while but has anything developed about Kabuto and his red eyes seen in the chunin exam. And about the Tobi and Obito speculation if he didnt die in the cave what made him become a villain and how could he possibly have gained enough skill to be a member of the Akatsuki. Im only asking b/c in the opening paragraph of the Akatsuki article says its composed of the most powerful criminals. Another thing im asking is for people to look at his mask and tell me where is this so called "eye hole". If its on the left ok but if its on the right then it cant be Obito, his right side of his body was supposedly crushed in the cave. This may sound crystal ballish but still people need to think about thier speculations.Leader of Darkness 11:18, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How do we know these are bridge piercings? And that he has two? Ive looked at the picture but they could be easily be painted dots and there could easily be at least 3 rows since we can only see so much.</p>
<p>Also, is there a particular reason info on hair colour and eye colour is gone? I thought it was quite important and useful considering there are few coloured images of the characters about that are official and it helps a lot. Considering the first coloured image of Hidan left people fighting over his eye and hair colour due to the limited view of his eyes, that kind of info is useful considering this is an anime/manga article and this is the kind of stuff fans use eitehr for discussion or fan-art.<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkwarriorblake_8272.html" title="User:Darkwarriorblake">Darkwarriorblake</a> 18:16, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>With the exception of the Leader, every character has a color picture in their section of the article, so it's rather pointless to tell people something that they can see for themselves. And besides, putting what the color was in the article didn't stop people from arguing about it, as was evidenced by Deidara's eye color constantly being changed from blue to cyan to green and the Leader's hair color being changed to blond despite the fact that it is quite obviously not. <i><b>~Snapper<a href="../../../s/n/a/User_talk%7ESnapper2_c216.html" title="User talk:Snapper2">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Snapper2_6870.html" title="Special:Contributions/Snapper2">o</a></b></i> 18:35, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Itachi</span></h2>
<p>More than half of the stuff written for Itachi is speculation. Don't say he specializes in genjutsu, for all we know he could be taijutsu specialist. He has shown impressive power in ninjustu through amaterasu, genjutsu through tsukuyomi, taijutsu well he stopped sasuke's chidori with his bare hands, knocked him across the room with one kick. the fact is that he has the sharingan, and since he's in akatsuki he had the opportunity to copy 1000s of jutsus. we don't know what he specializes in, and could be well versed in all 3 jutsu types. and btw I don't see why you removed the omniscient part because his parents were both jonin and yet during the night when sasuke came to spy on their conversation when his dad was yelling at him, only Itachi automatically knew that sasuke was listening to them when he told him to wash up and go to bed, while their parents were quite surprised and didn't realize it. the other time was when sasuke came to rescue naruto from him and Kisame, he knew sasuke was standing behind him as he called him out while Kisame was surprised and hadn't even noticed until Itachi called him out, and Itachi knew he was there, just like the last without even looking at him. he doesn't need his sharingan for this because he's doing it without looking at them. when other ninja do this they at least have an opportunity to look at the direction in which their opponents are like orochimaru when he called naruto and sakura out to fight during the timeskip, but itachi doesn't even look to know what's going on. how much more do I have to say to prove he's omniscient. What I'm saying isn't specution or some weird theory, since I actually have shown proof in the story Noman953</p>
<dl>
<dd>The problem with your essay is that Itachi has only used taijutsu a couple or more times. I agree with you about the ninjutsu part considering that he has used more than just amaterasu, which by the way isn't a learned trait it's a Kekkai Genkai ability learned through M. Sharingan. I realy don't have a problem with the omniscient part it's just the taijutsu part I don't agree with.<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_ov_the_blue_sand_359d.html" title="User:Sam ov the blue sand">Sam ov the blue sand</a> 14:55, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Omniscience? All ninja have the ability to gather information from their surroundings from minute details. Given Itachi's intelligence and the analytical abilities of his Sharingan, he's simply incredibly good at it. Both your examples are inherently flawed. From likely long experience, Itachi could detect the nature of Sasuke's footfalls as well as logically deduce that he, as the only other person in the house, would be behind the door. As for your other example, he could have easily done the same thing or briefly looked behind him, as it could have been off-screen. The use of the word <a href="../../../o/m/n/Omniscience.html" title="Omniscience">omniscience</a> is also incorrect, as it implies knowledge of all things, which Itachi does not possess. As for your speech on Itachi's various jutsu skills, he has displayed greater skill in Genjutsu than any other character thus far (simply pointing his finger at an opponent to cast genjutsu, merely looking at Kakashi to trigger his genjutsu, easily reversing Kurenai's Demonic Illusion: Tree Bind Death on her, and obviously, Tsukuyomi), as well as displayed immense skill at Ninjutsu (the enormous fireball his clone creates, Amaterasu, and using seals so quickly that even Kakashi, with his Sharingan, could not see it - and even Itachi admits that Kakashi is very skilled with his Sharingan, yet he could not see Itachi's seal formation). He has shown nothing in comparison in Taijutsu skill other than kicking Sasuke down the hall and fighting against Kakashi in close-quarters combat. <a href="../../../s/e/p/User%7ESephiroth_BCR_dc57.html" title="User:Sephiroth BCR">Sephiroth BCR</a> 04:50, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

However, later in the article, someone keeps changing it to say that Deidara speaks of himself using male pronouns, HOWEVER, it then goes unto say that in the anime he has been given a deep, male voice. He has yet to appear or speak in the anime. Thus, this is not true, and should not be included in the article. Whomever keeps changing it to that, please stop.</p>

<dd>Yeah, we alrady know, but we don't know for sure who is in charge of gathering which. In fact, aside from Shukaku, the Neko, and the Sanbi, we don't know any of the others. Got a sneaking suspicion that Itachi's in charge of getting Kyuubi, but speculation is a no-no. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreima_b65e.html" title="User:Treima">Treima</a> 03:20, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think it's ever actually stated whether the Nekomata was Hidan or Kakuzu's biju, though I suppose I could have completely overlooked that detail. <i><b>~Snapper<a href="../../../s/n/a/User_talk%7ESnapper2_c216.html" title="User talk:Snapper2">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Snapper2_6870.html" title="Special:Contributions/Snapper2">o</a></b></i> 03:27, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems like it was Hidan's because Kakuzu was really lax about getting it and looked more interested in his bounty for Churiki or whatever his name is, although I'm probably wrong or there's nothing to back me up on it. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreima_b65e.html" title="User:Treima">Treima</a> 03:31, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">One more Biju</span></h2>
<p>It seems like the eyes of the head of the extracting jutsu show how many Biju there already are sealed. After sealing away the Sanbi the 5th eye opened, so they must have extracted one more Biju than there is stated in this article. That's what I think. Do you agree?</p>
