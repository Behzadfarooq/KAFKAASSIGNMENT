<p>When N.H.C. comes out does that mean we'll be under N.H.C. or Naruto or both? Also will have to move some characters (when they get their own articles that is) will be under N.H.C. and others won't? Where will Itachi and Kisame be at. I'll help any way I can (looks like I'll have to wait to ask for a Hidan article until after all this B.S. is over).<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_ov_the_blue_sand_359d.html" title="User:Sam ov the blue sand">Sam ov the blue sand</a> 17:07, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes I know that it's the same basic series in the manga so was DBZ but it has it's own article because it's considered a diffferent series and Naruto Hurricane Chronicles will be considered a different anime series apart from Naruto, so it will have it's own article. And what I mean "under" is where will the members (from akatsuki) be at, Naruto Hurricane Chronicles or Naruto because some are exclusive to Naruto Hurricane Chronicles and others aren't.<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_ov_the_blue_sand_359d.html" title="User:Sam ov the blue sand">Sam ov the blue sand</a> 19:50, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

We're not going to be shuffing around every character into different places when the manga and anime essentially follow the same path.

<dd>Sam, it will be the same series, just under a new banner to express the change from filler to standard storyline. Just as it went form Naruto to Kakashi Gaiden back to Naruto II. It's all the same story, all the same people, nothing will change but the name. It's not like DB GT, where every thing has a differnt age connotation, for NHC, it will all have the same connection as it did just after the Kakashi Gaiden miniseries ended. Nothing to worry about, no major changes will be made. It's all going to be the same, with perhaps a few refrences to filler epps in the anime. 05:27, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I think Xeago is right... Kakuzu's arm seemes to be severed from the rest of him if you look closely on page 5-6... The "threads" that extends from Kakuzu's hand doesn't reconnect with his arm until page 6... On the other hand (no pun intended), we should not put things up just because of their appearence but only as they truly ARE.</dd>

<dd>Issue 333, page 4. You see Kakuzu's Sleeve partialy cut off by Hidan's 3xScyth, no tendrils, no connection to Kakuzu. Page 4, the arm is shown snatching the trench knife out of the shadow (top of page), then it tosses it aside and hits the ground (much like you do when you get up). There is a pool of the black tendril stuff that comes out of the ground with no connection to Kakuzu shown. It then flies back to Kakuzu through the air (bottom of page 5), not back underground. If it was still connected at that point it would have had to do more damage to the ground between K. and the Trench Knife. Also, there are tendrils come out of the goo that are not connected to the hand, I think that this can mean two things: first, that the limbs cannot move themselves, but rather that the goo animates the limbs, and two, that the goo is actuly blood. My hypothesis (which will never see main page until it's proven or disproven) is that like Sasori, Kakuzu has sacrificed much of his humanity for the power that he has. This follows the deep running theme of the Akatsuki, and if I am right, Kakuzu not only survived the attack by Kakashi, but also is forced to show his true form. I expect to see at least a couple more issues with battle between them before either Hidan or Kakuzu are incapacitated.65.92.233.87 02:56, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Once again, Xeago and I think alike, but I believe that Kakuzu's ability is more like Kidoumaru's web skills IE. He mixes chakra into his blood and then remotly controls his detatced limbs with the chakra flow thoughout them... Actully, I've had the theory that Kakuzu and Hidan are mirror images of eachother... Think about it, Hidan is a religious fanatic, Kakuzu is a obsessive materialist, Hidan is a loud bigmouth, Kakuzu is down to earth and reserved, Hidan is immortal but rather weak and vaunrable in general, Kakuzu is mortal but he is strong and nearly indestructable... See any patterns here?</dd>

<dl>
<dd>You don't know that he's dead. You don't know that his heart was where Kakashi hit him. We already know he has exstensive body mods, but we don't know how far they go. The simple fact that he can separate part of his body while retaining control is a huge indicator that he's played around with his physiology some how. If I were him, I wouldn't leave my my heart in it's standard place, not if I had some say in it. <a href="../../../x/e/a/User%7EXeago_6245.html" title="User:Xeago">Xeago</a> 02:57, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Kakuzu definitely not dead. Also, update needed to his entry. There are now some better pictures of him we might be able to use. -Retlor</p>
<dl>
<dd>Notice the similarities between Kakuzu's eyes and those of the masks? I think that he's wearing a fifth mask that amplifies his natural elemental affinity. I'd bet a coffee that it's earth. Also, on the last page, Kakashi comments on how strong they are "Esspecialy the masked one", refering to Kakuzu still wearing a mask? <a href="../../../x/e/a/User%7EXeago_6245.html" title="User:Xeago">Xeago</a> 00:51, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Hmmm... Notice how my analysis of Kakuzu &amp; Hidan being mirror images of each other seemes to get more and more accurate? Sure, we don't know all details yet, thus we can't jump to conclusions, but I stand for my theory... I could bet a nickle that the "masked monster" that instantly died controlled suiton and once all of those "blood golems" are dead, Kakuzu is done for... Well, that's just speculation.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Both of our assumptions seem to be spot on. Although, I don't think that he will die if the 3 remaining masks break, rather, that he's without the enhancements he had been controling before. They seem to be puppet type beings, still controled by Kakuzu, but no need for strings. I think thats cause they are made out of his blood.

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I know speculaton is no-no but does anyone think the destroyed mask is the mask of water. I believe that Kakuzu's element is infact Earth because it seems the mask creatures use their own jutsu but I can't tell if they say them or not, and Kakuzu use his own hand signs to do the earth jutsu. One more thing the masks don't seem to grant Kakuzu any special powers besides controlling all five elements. And is it just me or did Kakuzu look sad when the one mask creature died, I mean he did look back at it didn't he?<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_ov_the_blue_sand_359d.html" title="User:Sam ov the blue sand">Sam ov the blue sand</a> 03:54, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>villians like him simply just don't die in one chapter, or from one hit for that matter. it's gonna be a long battle between him/hidan and kakashi's team and it's gonna be span over at least a couple more episodes even after 334.<a href="../../../s/p/h/User%7ESphinxridd_b2a4.html" title="User:Sphinxridd">Sphinxridd</a> 04:54, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Had you asked me 15 minutes ago (when I started writing this peice) what I thought Kakuzu's natural affinity was, I would have said earth. I can't be certain any more. I had thought this because he used hand seals to activate the iron body tech that Kakashi busted through. But, when he controls the 3 shinobi hearts, his hands stay moulded. whether this is just to maintain control, or to actualy activate the moves the beasts execute we can't be sure. I see something else too: Kakuzu's "face" has all the traits of the masks the beasts are faced by. Black eyes with white pupils. the mouldable/controllable string/tenticle stuff is still present, even after the monsters (who are made of the same stuff) leave. I think that like Sasori, Kakuzu's heart is able to move separate from his body main. I think he's like one of the creatures. Another version of a puppet master whos become like his puppets. A state of living death. Also, when his arm was moving on its own, it was by the will of one of the extra hearts. Any one else catch that? I'm working on a serious rework on the Kakuzu article to deal with some of the changes we've seen and to make it flow better. <a href="../../../x/e/a/User%7EXeago_6245.html" title="User:Xeago">Xeago</a> 02:48, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I found that someone wrote that the threads going all around his body is similar to Frankenstein's monster. I see what they are saying, but I doubt it should be put on the article.</p>
<p>Since Kakuzu can mold his masks together to attack as one, would this be considered a bloodline limit? It isn't an actual new element like wood or ice, but he does fuse his fuuton and katon masks together, and Kakashi says that the edition of wind makes his suiton attack unable to stop it. Kage-Lupus 02:17, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, A blood line limit is a handed down tech within a specific clan. His Tech is an advanced blood tech, but not a bloodline limit. His ability to mould two chakras is not his own ability, but an ability endowed by the multiple hearts he posseses. If he loses those hearts, he is unable to combine the two elements together. If he had a bloodline limit, he would only lose it when he died his final death. -Xeago (at work) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_207.236.93.210_1bc4.html" title="Special:Contributions/207.236.93.210">207.236.93.210</a> (<a href="../../../2/0/7/User_talk%7E207.236.93.210.html" title="User talk:207.236.93.210">talk</a>) 14:38, 30 December 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Future changes?</span></h2>
<p>When the english dub of the anime introduces us to the akatsuki and if they choose to name Akatsuki, "dawn" or sunrise", will this article change name into said name then? Like what happened to Maito Gai's article where he is called "Might Guy"?</p>

<dd>First off, Might Guy is Might Guy. "Maito Gai" is nothing but an accented Japanese pronounciation. Second, we'll cross that road when we come to it.

<p>It's true that Maito Gai is a katakana translation of Might Guy, but if Masashi had intended for Gai's name to truly be "Might Guy", I believe he would've settled for something like "Seiryoku Gai"... Personally, I still think that he choosed "Maito Gai" because it would be a clear referance to his strong character, but that's just me... Rasengan = Power Strike? And how many hate letters does the dubbers get each day? I'm a member of the movement that emphasizes the use of original names, both character, techniques and other things alike, instead of dubbed versions of them.</p>

<p>First, i want to cleear up the chidori lightning blade thing. Chidori(one thousand birds) is a lightning element jutsu that Kakashi created. Rakiri(lightning blade/edge/cut) is a enhanced version. So what he used on Zabuza and what he taught Sasuke are different jutsu's.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know what that statement is doing here (kinda off-topic), but since it is here I guess I can pay attention to it... No, Raikiri and Chidori aren't different techniques, the only difference between them is actually how "complete" the technique is... Raikiri is a S-rank technique, due to it being the "perfect" form of the Chidori (A-rank), but that's as far as differences goes... During Kakashi's training with Sasuke, he, himself, used "Raikiri" as a synonym for "Chidori" and during the chuunin exam, Gai said that "Raikiri" was the nickname Kakashi gave Chidori after cutting a lightning bolt in half (how true that statement is is still under debate).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Man they're calling Chidori "One Thousand Birds" now. How dumb. But I think we're going a little off topic here talking about Chidori and Rasengan and Raikiri. It's an Akatsuki article after all. Gaara the Fifth Kazekage 02:50, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Only the second hokage and Kisame can summon water out of no where. Most water jutsu specialists need a body of water for their jutsu. Apparently the second was so skilled at water jutsu that he surpassed this limitation. I don't know if Kisame can do this because I don't remember anywhere in the manga stating that he could.</p>
<p>He does it in his fight against Team Gai. -Retlor</p>

<dd>Though it would be an interesting conversation on a forum about the familial CHakra affinity of the First Hokage's family being water that's best left for a forum.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Akatsuki Leader/Itachi</span></h2>
<p>I'm gonna include how the eye pattern is similar to that of Yuhi Kurenai because it just is. Also I don't know why Itachi is listed only as a genjutsu specialist. Having the sharingan to copy jutsu of countless jonin who are sent after you since you are a missing nin will definitly make anyone a master in all three forms of jutsu. We've seen Tsukiyomi (genjutsu) and Amaterasu (ninjutsu), not to mention that exploding bushin trick (ninjutsu). so I'm gonna include both mastery on ninjutsu and genjutsu on Itachi.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Re: Leader - That would just be speculation, isn't it? Has it been confirmed in the manga that the leader and Kurenai had the same eye patterns?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Itachi Story</span></h2>
<p>I know that there was a debate about wether Itachi should get his own page. Akatsuki has a lot of members and I don't think all of them can fit on one page. Also Itachi has too little information present for him. For a guy who impacts main characters like Sasuke and Orochimaru he definitly should have more information. The problem is everytime I include stuff about his family/clan life its deleted. Since nobody else wants to do it, I'm willing to go into detail about Itachi's story and include factual not speculative things revealed about him. Don't worry I'm not gonna write 50 paragraphs; I'm just going to include as much is necessary. I'll check back this message to see if anyone has a problem with this and then I'll edit his article. <i><small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_74.108.56.182_da38.html" title="Special:Contributions/74.108.56.182">74.108.56.182</a> (<a href="../../../7/4/2E/User_talk%7E74.108.56.182.html" title="User talk:74.108.56.182">talk</a>) 11:22, 7 December 2006 (UTC).</small></i></p>

<dd>First of all Someguy0830 I always put factual information in here. You should learn to follow your own advise and discuss things before you delete them. If you want me to give you speculation then tell me why the Itachi article states that he chose to torture Kurenai, Asuma and Kakashi because he "wanted them to witness his power" (speculative because there could be many reasons for him doing this such him not really being an evil person or not wanting to get involved in unnecessary fights at the time, speculation makes this line unnecessary)or that Itachi's "main area of expertise is genjutsu". The fact remains we don't know enough about him to call him a genjutsu specialist. All I ever included was that he likely has mastered many jutsu because he has the sharingan and since he's chased by many hunter nins he might know many jutsus. That much isn't speculation but just fact or are you telling me that even with the sharingan all he has are amaterasu and tsukiyomi. I want to include what we know about him and you are wrong because everything we know about him isn't in this article (him killing shisui, his mother's weird line "he a bit special", him and his father walking past each other, his habit of not really making any friends which his father said, the uchiha clan secret meeting place and its secret inside the tatami mat and the significance of the tengu figurines around it, kyubi statement of uchiha madara and wether Itachi has the same cursed chakra). I don't want to get into that wikipedia game of you monitoring everything I do on this website and deleting whatever I contribute. So how about this, when I have the time, I'll write up an edit of the Itachi article and then we can DISCUSS whats wrong with it rather than going back and forth rewriting this stuff. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 74.108.56.182 (<a href="../../../7/4/2E/User_talk%7E74.108.56.182.html" title="User talk:74.108.56.182">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_74.108.56.182_da38.html" title="Special:Contributions/74.108.56.182">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd>Him killing Shisui is in the article, try reading it. How is walking past someone quietly anything but speculation when interpreting it? His mothers's line is also interpretable, so more speculation. No friends is of no consequence. Uchiha meeting place is all speculation, as we don't know what it's for. That whole list you just typed up is almost entirely speculative. Itachi focusing mainly on genjutsu is a fact, since he uses it more often than actual fighting. He's never been chased by any hunter nin that we've heard of, so also speculative. You need to learn the difference between what you think you know and what is actually known. Also, stop impersonating a registered account. Either sign in or sign your posts correctly. – <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy0830_d67f.html" title="User:Someguy0830">Someguy0830</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESomeguy0830_3c31.html" title="User talk:Someguy0830">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Someguy0830_4a47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Someguy0830">C</a>) 07:30, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Guys, no need to get upset. I think a little speculation is fine, as long as it's based on common sense and common logic. It wouldn't be much fun if the manga spills out every single little detail. It's the reader's imagination and reasonable speculation that make up for the missing pieces.

In context, Itachi was more than likely referring to his own power, but this can't be said for certain.

<dd>I don't mean to be argumentative - but a statment starts with "...does not appear to..." <i>is</i> a speculation. otherwise you'd say, "Itachi does not kill simply for the sake of it..." anyway, all I'm saying is a small amount of speculation is unavoidable and I understand where the other guy is coming from. - <a href="../../../s/p/h/User%7ESphinxridd_b2a4.html" title="User:Sphinxridd">Sphinxridd</a> 20:57, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Someguy0830 I really don't know what your issue issue but please don't have a spaz attack. I don't understand why you're being so confrontational, I really don't have time to waste on a fight. So anyway his father said he doesn't like making friends. This is important because it deals with Itachi isolative behaviour. His mother's line may not be as important but if you read that part in the anime or the manga, its shows her concern and saddness as she knows the weirdness that going around Itachi. That much isn't speculation. If I were to say that this line shows that she knew he was evil and got the clan to try to kill him, then that's speculation but I'm not going that far. All I'm saying is that this line exists and has something to do with his character and his mom. That's all. When I was talking about Shisui I meant including the stuff about how he was sent to spy on Itachi. Anyone following the Naruto story knows that criminals especially S ranked one are chased after by hunter nins. That's why hunter nins exist to chase after convicted criminals. Obviously Kishimoto not going to show people after every single person but we do know villages send them after criminals. Hunter nins are obviously high level ninja and Itachi has obviously killed his fair share and copied their jutsus because its impossible to believe that with the sharingan and its copying abilities all he has is the mangekyou sharingan. I'm not going to include the hunter nins part in the article, I'm just using it to show that you can't classify him as a genjutsu specialist because we just don't know enough about the guy to do that. Tsunade is medical specialist, Kurenai is a genjutsu specialist, because people in the manga have said that they are but no one has called Itachi a genjutsu specialist. Kakashi has shown water and lightning jutsu but we know he has more than that because he knows like 1000 jutsu as the manga states, so we can't classify him as a water and lightning jutsu specialist. Using this same reasoning Itachi can't be put under the simple classification of a genjutsu specialist. Please reply nicely and I will reply nicely, like I said I don't want to start a fight with you. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 74.108.56.182 (<a href="../../../7/4/2E/User_talk%7E74.108.56.182.html" title="User talk:74.108.56.182">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_74.108.56.182_da38.html" title="Special:Contributions/74.108.56.182">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>here you go. this is the edit I was talking about. I'm using quotes whereever its necessary, specially in those areas that are really debatable. Someguy0830 please tell me if you still feel I'm being too speculative because I AM listening to everything you're saying. I'm not including the hunter nin that was just to get a point across. I'm just trying to give background information to an important character. I'm really trying to understand you so please try and understand me as well. Just give me an honest opinion on what I've written before you start deleting stuff tell me what you feel is wrong with it. Noman953</p>
<dl>
<dd>nice details added, btw. since you went into greater details re: the confrontation between the 3 clan members and Itachi, maybe it should also be mentioned that Itachi in the end apologized for his remarks and denied the murder accusation. i don't know why, maybe because he spotted sasuke listening, but that's speculative.</dd>
<dd>also, "When three of his clan members confronted him on this matter, Itachi assaulted and effortlessly defeated all of them" did he defeat them? I thought his father interrupted before any real damage.</dd>
<dd>"...that if he wants to kill him he must spend his life hating him and acquire the Mangekyo Sharingan." Itachi didn't say that. He said something along the line, sasuke wasn't worth killing and if sasuke wants to hate, detest and kill him, sasuke should run and cling to life.</dd>
<dd>"Orochimaru has admitted that Itachi is stronger than he is, which is why he left Akatsuki in the first place." this is highly speculative. it could be one of the reasons, but no one knows exactly why Orochimaru left Akatsuki.</dd>
<dd>"However, a clone of Itachi created by the Akatsuki Leader, was defeated by Naruto's Odamaa Rasengan." kinda gives the wrong impression. does a clone's strength created by soemone else correlate to the real person's strength at all?</dd>
<dd>if we are going to cover him in great details, his encounter with Sasuke might also be mentioned, i.e. him telling sasuke is weak because he lacks hatred.</dd>
<dd>I didn't want to edit the article because I've only read the manga once and in a hurry. I didn't want to mess up the facts/speculations.</dd>

</dl>
<p>thank you for replying kindly, respect is all I really want between people posting. sinnce I have been accused of being a speculation monster I used quotes to avoid bias.</p>
<ol>
<li>we should add Itachi's apology after Sasuke screaming because its obvious that that's what made him kneel down. I'll see what I can do about that part.</li>
<li>he defeated and knocked all of the three clan members to the ground. defeated means he beat, I didn't say kill them,. remember if we just say he assaulted them then that's not enough because they were all knocked onto the floor.</li>
<li>Itachi's speech to Sasuke should be quoted as well. Telling him to hate him and acquire the mangekyou sharingan is what he told him to do. i remember that part clearly. the extra stuff like running and clinging to life was also in his speech but I didn't know how to add it in because he different translations seem to give different messages. But I would prefer we find his exact quote for this.</li>
<li>I remember Orochimaru's exact words to Kabuto after the Konoha invasion "if we had Uchiha Itachi to begin with this wouldn't have happened. But that is a far gone dream now. He is far stronger than I am. That's why I left that organization" there may indeed be other reason for Orochimaru leaving. I'm only writing down what I've seen and I feel going beyond that would be speculative. Itachi may be the only reason he left or one of them but we just don't know anymore than that.</li>
<li>his clone being beaten is interpretative as well. some could say he lost on purpose. or naruto could be becoming a strong ninja. if you look the jutsu that the leader used its one that copies everything about someone even their kekkei genkei so its better than other clone jutsu. I'll add your concern about the clone not being as powerful into the article.</li>
<li>I suppose we could add his encounter with naruto and Sasuke in the article, give me time and I'll do it or you can do it.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am concerned about how you edited the article though. Why you remove the translation on to tes my ability and the other stuff with it. When Itachi was talking about all three of them being killed he was referring to naruto's power not Jiraiya's. you also removed a lot of the quotes I added. the reason I put quotes in was so that people can come with their own conclusions of his goals via reading them. the quotes of him fighting his three members were important.--Noman953</p>
<dl>
<dd>"When Itachi was talking about all three of them being killed he was referring to naruto's power not Jiraiya's." You clearly do not know what you're talking about. Naruto was in no way skilled enough, dangerous enough, or in any way that severe of a threat. They were talking about Jiraiya. Quotes are excessive and riduculous in most cases. They don't need to be there when paraphrasing works just as well. – <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy0830_d67f.html" title="User:Someguy0830">Someguy0830</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESomeguy0830_3c31.html" title="User talk:Someguy0830">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Someguy0830_4a47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Someguy0830">C</a>) 01:55, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>there you go being confrontational AGAIN. from what I've read he was talking about the nine tails since they can't compete with a fully nine tailed naruto and Jiraiya was going to cause extra trouble that's why they needed to get rid of him. quotes are necessary because they show the article lacks bias. paraphrasing involves bias, which is funny because you yourself were so against speculation so quotes were necessary. --Noman953</p>
<dl>
<dd>Your logic makes no sense whatsoever. If they feared Naruto, why try to kidnap him at all? They specifically mention Jiraiya beforehand. Also, you're trying to use quotes to back up your speculation when it is still such.

<p>if you want to talk logic then its your argumentative and confrontational behavior that lacks logic. of couse they fear Naruto. the biju inside him is powerful if not the strongest biju of all but something being powerful isn't going to stop them from going after it. jiraiya was excess baggage that needed to be removed, thats all. you accused me of being too speculative so I used quotes then you started complaining about the unnecessary use of quotes. I'm not putting any of this in the article. I think I have shown the ability to remove speculation from fact. Everything that I've written about Itachi is what happened in the manga and the anime, none of it are my beliefs on the matter. all I ever wanted to do with this article was expand it to include known information about this character; a process that you've made very difficult. I don't know where is this fussiness comes from. Why am I the only one here you attack? you didn't include background information on him so I did. wikipedians should be able to contribute information without going through this Hell, man. And you know what I've done that so there isn't any point of me writing and arguing on this post with you because I've achieved what I came here to do. --Noman953</p>

<p>I agree with both Someguy and Noman...just on different things. Someguy you are confrontational, to the point of being a little scary, but perhaps you are extremely aware of the rules of Wikipedia and simply doing your best to enforce them, I don't know. But believe me Noman you are not the only person he has gotten on. That said you are wrong on this argument of Kisame and Itachi were scared of Naruto. They specifically stated in Manga and anime referred to him by name and title as one of the Sannin that they were scared of Jiraiya. This is further evidenced by the fact that they were in complete control when they confronted Naruto and their elaborate scheme to separate the two. Ninetails or not a Genin at his level is not gonna be able to handle the two of them (see Orochimaru shutting up the Kyubi in the Forest of Death). As far as details and paraphrasing vs direct quotes go, personally I believe in more details is better especially in an encyclopedaic context. However Wikipedia as per their guidlines don't appear to agree, so whichever gets the effective message across in the least amount of space should be used. On the subject of Itachi's speech what is currently in the article gets the gist of it, hate me, detest me, and when you have the same eyes as me come before me, becomes the concise hate me and get the Mangekyo Sharingan. I do believe as insight into Itachi and Sasuke that the last part of the speech should be added as well, Run, run, and cling to life should be added as well. This in short would become survive at all costs, signifying Itachi's desire to have Sasuke get stronger and more of Sasuke's motivations.Rayfire 19:30, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Should we use the word "greed" for Kakuzu?</span></h2>
<p>Ok, this is the topic that me and Someguy0830 have had a long controversy. As far as I'm concerned, we should not use the word "greedy", or "greedy" or "obvious greed" to depict as Kakuzu's characteristic. The info should be change to "strong desire for money". Someguy suggests me to bring it on this discussion. What about others' opinion?<a href="../../../c/a/u/User%7ECausesobad_a54e.html" title="User:Causesobad">Causesobad</a> 08:38, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Strong desire for money" is basically the definition for the word "greed". Unless you want to replace all of the words in the article with their definition, I see no reason why all <b>two</b> instances of the word "greed" should be replaced. <i><b>~Snapper<a href="../../../s/n/a/User_talk%7ESnapper2_c216.html" title="User talk:Snapper2">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Snapper2_6870.html" title="Special:Contributions/Snapper2">o</a></b></i> 21:51, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Greed is not always desire for money. It refers to material things in general. So if you said that it's a "basically definition for the word "greed" is wrong. For Kakuzu's case, he likes money, and money <b>itself</b>. Money becomes a tangible object for his desire. "Greed" is a wide range of material lust in general, but up till now, we don't know, also we can see or at least be mentioned in the series that Kakuzu has used money he got to serve his assumed-lust for "material thing" or not. For Kakuzu, money-loving has become a syndrome, not serving for his own need to use it, so we can't apply the word "greed" for him. <a href="../../../c/a/u/User%7ECausesobad_a54e.html" title="User:Causesobad">Causesobad</a> 18:42, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>He calls himself the treasurer of Akatsuki. He's not greedy? But Greed is an unhealthy obsession with material things, most commonly assigned to food or money. I think in leiu of greedy we should try something more "P.C.". Seriously I think money-motivated would work well for him, unless someone in story calls him greedy.Rayfire 19:32, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hidan's Prayer Beads</span></h2>
<p>So I was reading through this Akatsuki page today and I noticed that it says the charm on his beads is an upside-down triangle inside of a circle. I got confused for a bit because I knew that I had been drawing it as a rightside-up triangle and had been using references. The colored cover from chapter 317 (which is shown in the article as Hidan's picture) indeed shows it being upside-down. This got me to looking through the manga from where Hidan first appeared in 312 until the beads were broken when Asuma decapitated him.</p>
<p>When Hidan first takes them out in 313 to pray before fighting Yugito, the triangle is upside-down. They are not really shown again until the 317 cover where he is first seen wearing them as a necklace and it is upside-down again. The beads are not clearly shown after that until Hidan starts his voodoo ritual against Team Asuma where the triangle is rightside-up. For the rest of the fight until the beads are broken, the triangle remains rightside-up. So, I was right in my drawings, but the article is also right...</p>
<p>What should we do then? Would it be best to keep the orientation of the triangle out of the article to prevent contradiction? <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKangarugh22_9b3f.html" title="User:Kangarugh22">Kangarugh22</a> 18:23, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The volume 36 cover that can be seen now on leafninja.com has Hidan and Kakuzu on it. The triangle is rightside-up.

<dd>I think we should update it constantly, but not try to go beyond certain "borders"... It's rather pointless to recite an entire battle, as well as including minor facts that don't belong. For example, is it really necessary to spend so much of Kakuzu's article to give depth to Hidan &amp; Kakuzu's relationship, or Kakuzu's money obsession? (Seriously, those parts alone takes up at least one fourth of Kakuzu's article)... Try to set the goal at making this page look like something you could find in an encyclopedia, not something an Otaku would know by heart.</dd>

<p>Well I think you guy's missed something from the Hidan article. His forehead protector points to rain village and you guys said that we don't know his village. Well they are stripes that represent rain but they are kind of crooked so we don't know if it's the creator's mess up or something or we got a new village (highly unlikely). Well just saying.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's most likely not Rain, since the Rain symbol has 4 lines while Hidan's forehead protector only has three. That plus the lines are crooked -&gt; too many differences, thus not Rain unless Kishimoto says otherwise. //Frostious 16:49, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I just happened to watch the episode again. (...and reread the manga chapter to confirm) - it says they haven't met like this since 7 years ago when Orochimaru left the organization, and we know that Orochimaru and Itachi belonged together to Akatsuki at one point because Orochimaru left Akatsuki because of Itachi growing stronger. So Itachi was already a member 7 years ago, which means he joined before he was 11 years old. is that right?!?!

<dd>Nope. We don't know what mask it was. We know that he used an earth jutsu to protect himself, and that it was beaten, but we don't know that it was the earth heart that was pierced after kakashi broke through and destroyed _A_ heart. We know that he can use all FIVE affinities, and he has four masks, thus he has an affinity IN ADDITION to the masks. Therefore, it could be just as likely that his natural, original affinity is earth, and the broken mask was a water one.

<dd>It's just part of his facial structure. If you look at Kakuzu, he has similar features under his eyes. In a black and white comic, lines are often used instead of shading or coloring to show where aging might have occured. I would think that they might be fron lack of sleep or something similar, but thats just conjecture on my part. <a href="../../../x/e/a/User%7EXeago_6245.html" title="User:Xeago">Xeago</a> 03:20, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hidan's Ritual Appearance</span></h2>
<p>I wish to propose that the description of Hidan's "Grim Reaper"-like appearance be changed because it much more closely resembles images of the Vodoun(Voodoo) loa of the dead known as Baron Samedi. Skeletal visage and scythe do not a reaper make. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Trilaan (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Trilaan_2235.html" title="Special:Contributions/Trilaan">contribs</a>) 15:31, 30 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>A presonification of death is a personification of death, regardless of the religion which spurs the myth. When describing an appearance of such a personification, it's best to use the description most people will instantly associate with a face. People read "Voodoo Loa of the dead known as Baon Samedi" and they think, "Who the hell is that?" – <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy0830_d67f.html" title="User:Someguy0830">Someguy0830</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESomeguy0830_3c31.html" title="User talk:Someguy0830">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Someguy0830_4a47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Someguy0830">C</a>) 18:40, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Then I would simply like to request that since the description in the character stats listing says "Grim-Reaper-like" that the second instance in the 5th paragraph also says Grim Reaper-like if for nothing else than for article consistency.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Consistency is all well and good, but it can detract, too. It's repetitive to use thesame phrase over and over if it can be avoided. – <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy0830_d67f.html" title="User:Someguy0830">Someguy0830</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESomeguy0830_3c31.html" title="User talk:Someguy0830">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Someguy0830_4a47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Someguy0830">C</a>) 21:44, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't understand where you're coming from, honestly. Perhaps you could privately give me a longer explanation as to why you are so set against this alteration. It's true this is a minor thing but it's something I strongly believe in.</p>

<p>Okay, I apologize. So who is the proper person to take it up with?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't see why you care so much because no one will ever except "Voodoo Loa of the dead known as Baon Samedi" becuase the majority of people don't know who the hell he/she/it is and know the grim reaper more than your guy.<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_ov_the_blue_sand_359d.html" title="User:Sam ov the blue sand">Sam ov the blue sand</a> 01:24, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But it is true that the markings that shows up on Hidan's body during his curse ritual does bear a striking resemblance to the body paintings that are used in some voodoo rituals... And the long spike he uses to finnish his opponent off, gives me accosiations to the voodoo dolls that you stick needles into, to make your victim feel pain and such... Baron Samedi is as much fictional as the grim reaper, but lesser known of, voodoo is real (as far as religion goes) but I don't know if we have any pictures of that particular body painting, in medieval times, the picture of the grim reaper as an skeleton was the most common one, but these days when the word "grim reaper" is used, most people associate it with someone dressed in a long, black, hooded, robe, looking nothing like Hidan's curse form... Well, that's our options, none of them working out perfectly well.</dd>

<dd>Ov vey, just drop it, ask a random person "who does this look like?" and they will most likely say the grim reaper and if you said do you know who "Voodoo Loa of the dead known as Baon Samedi" is they will most likely say you the hell is that?<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_ov_the_blue_sand_359d.html" title="User:Sam ov the blue sand"><span style="color: #ff0000">Sam</span> <span style="color: #000000">ov</span> <span style="color: #000000">the</span> <span style="color: #0000ff">blue</span> <span style="color: #808000">sand</span></a> 18:11, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
