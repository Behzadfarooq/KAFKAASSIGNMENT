<p>I think I read somewhere about the reason Orochimaru left the akatsuki. It was something along the lines of "because Itachi is stronger than orochimaru, he cannot be the next host. Orochimaru left the Akatsuki to concentrate on getting Sasuke instead." those aren't the exact words, but it was something like that. By the way, it's spelled as "tsukiyomi", not "tsukuyomi" 80.192.53.79 02:40, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It can actually be spelled either way, but the more common way would be "Tsukiyomi", as "tsuki" is the correct way of spelling "moon" in japanese. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_217.208.26.179_8722.html" title="Special:Contributions/217.208.26.179">217.208.26.179</a> (<a href="../../../2/1/7/User_talk%7E217.208.26.179.html" title="User talk:217.208.26.179">talk</a>) 22:09, 6 January 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>The article currently reads: <i>"Kakuzu's four extra hearts are normally attached to four masks sewn onto his back, each one resembling a demonic animal. The visible three resemble an eagle, a lion, and an ox. The fourth is damaged by Kakashi Hatake's Lightning Blade before being unveiled, so it's unclear what animal it is intended to resemble."</i></p>
<p>If what this says is true, then the 4th mask is most likely the face of a demonic man, as the other three masks are the symbols of the evangelists, the 4 apostles who wrote the 4 gospels in the new testament of most christian bibles - matthew(man) mark(lion) luke(ox) and john(eagle). If you look at <a href="../../../f/o/u/Four_Evangelists_937f.html" title="Four Evangelists">Four_Evangelists</a> It mentions this, and if you look at the picture on the right, you'll notice it corresponds to Kakuzu's back, and the destroyed heart would correspond to the human. Of course, that's assuming those other three animals are correct. Frankly, I can't tell what they're supposed to be.&#160;:/ --66.159.174.12 06:57, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>From what I can tell, people on wikipedia generally don't like it when people make joke suggestions on the talk pages. So, to answer your question, yes, I am completely serious. Just reading the naruto articles indicates that there is plenty of mythology hidden in bits and pieces in the story, I don't see what it is about this that makes you think I'm joking. Three of the four masks are an ox, eagle, and lion, three of the four evangelistic symbols are an ox, eagle, and lion. The remaining evagelistic symbol is that of a man, who occupies the same space on the aformentioned picture, as the position of the destroyed mask on kakuzu's back.--66.159.136.184 19:49, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Be that as it may, it's still speculation and as such, probably not suitable for the page. Retlor 15:28, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ehrr? ... Let me get ths straight, despite the fact that everything in Naruto, up to date, has obviously been inspired by Japanese culture, you believe that Kakuzu is inspired by Chritiany? ... Had you put up this theory 2 weeks ago, I would robably had called you "blockhead", or something amongst those lines, and then lived on with my life like nothings ever happened... As it is now, I'm starting to believe that Hidan is voodoo inspired, and that would only make it "natural" if Kakuzu was evangelic inspired... Congratulations to an interesting theory, until proven correct, we must assume that it is false. 81.224.28.214 20:48, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Then how about this: the masks comes from the hand seals. I've heard that the Tiger seal is used with fire elements techniques, and Tiger and Lion are relatives, and there is seal for Brid and Ox that has not been given a element but they could fit in.

<dd>For that argument to work you would need to have direct evidence that the series took place before 1868 and since a timeframe is not stated in the show there is no evidence to suppprt it.

<p>Don't feel bad about it, just accept it... When I first came back after the name changes, I too felt annoyed, disgusted, and crancy... I still do to be honest, but as this is an encyclopedia, it must go home with the majority of the general public, even at the expence of it being generally wrong... Personally, I still don't fully understand this... It is true that this is an English article, but that doesn't nesseserly mean that the majority of those who watch/read Naruto and/or this article, watch/read the westernized version of the show, which, in turn, possibly creates even more confusion and frustration than it would do if the rules weren't properly followed. 217.208.27.4 21:07, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I can speak Japanese and my native language is english. My japanese friends who are bilingual also inherently know this.

<p>I don't know if this has been touched on before and until we see a databook or anime episode it will be hard to prove, but isn't it possible that Kakuzu's threads aren't threads but instead blood vessels.

<dd>Yeah, I've pointed out that the "threads" might've been chakra controlled blood (I don't think it's entire blood vessels since Kukuzu deattached his right hand and made it move on it's own), but that he used multiple hearts to charge/animate his blood with was something that I couldn't have immagined in my wildest dreams. 217.208.27.4 23:40, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>338 kind of implied that Shikamaru managed to kill him, with Asuma's spirit appearing and passing his Will of Fire onto him. Otherwise they wouldn't have made it so dramatic, but we should still wait for confirmation, which is why I put a (?) in his status.

<dd><i>Aw, Someguy beat me again.</i> When I said carcass, that was just me trying to fancily say "dead Hidan". To echo Someguy (since I typed this already), until someone says he's dead, that he can no longer be in Akatsuki, or his brain is seen oozing out his ears, he's still active. As for when to declare him this and that, it would depend on what we find out and when. If this week's chapter is dedicated solely to the fight with Kakuzu (ie. no appearances of Shikamaru and the like or general updates), then we can't really jump to conclusions. So we should just wait until we find out something more about his fate.</dd>
<dd>And because I like to share stupid ideas, and because I suspect Hidan will survive in <b>some</b> way, I think it would be hilarious if Hidan's head survived and Shikamaru kept it in a cage somewhere to torture whenever he was annoyed with something. Well, I guess the hilarity wouldn't be as great if it came to be true, as then it would seem predictable... I'm rambling aren't I? <i><b>~Snapper<a href="../../../s/n/a/User_talk%7ESnapper2_c216.html" title="User talk:Snapper2">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Snapper2_6870.html" title="Special:Contributions/Snapper2">o</a></b></i> 06:19, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This all is the very definition of speculation, but we can be pretty sure on a few details. For one, Shikamaru will have planned for the possibility of Hidan surviving the blast. Indeed, it is quite likely given what we've seen thusfar. This is where Shikamaru's "grave" enters the picture. Hidan's <a href="../../../g/i/b/Gibs.html" title="Gibs">giblets</a> are going to be dropped deep into the ground and buried for eternity, may they be living or not. That's the plan, at least. –<i><a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunslinger47_cf62.html" title="User:Gunslinger47">Gunslinger47</a></i> 15:06, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Maybe you've done other articles, and maybe they're of higher quality than what you did for Sasori; I don't know. If, however, you were to do for Hidan what you did for Sasori, I'd imagine I'd redirect it, as Hidan's section isn't nearly as long as Sasori's was. <i><b>~Snapper<a href="../../../s/n/a/User_talk%7ESnapper2_c216.html" title="User talk:Snapper2">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Snapper2_6870.html" title="Special:Contributions/Snapper2">o</a></b></i> 05:11, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am asking this question because on almost each of the members' profiles it said that their first cameos were in chapter 238. We know that Itachi, Kisame, Zetsu, Sarori and the leader were all members before the timeskip, but what about the others? Hidan said that he was the second newest member, so he might have joined during the timeskip. So I think we should remove the info about how some of the members' first cameo was in chapter 238. Omimon January 21 2007</p>
<dl>
<dd>I doubt it. Pretty much all of the members can be matched to the panel in 238. The only real difference is that Hidan and Kakuzu got redesigns (Kakuzu was made shorter and Hidan got a different hairstyle). And I'm pretty sure that was Hidan because when Hidan had a little cameo in chapter 250-something complaining about not being able to find his Bijuu he had a different hairstyle. <a href="../../../g/e/g/User%7EGeg_04e0.html" title="User:Geg">The Splendiferous Gegiford</a> 02:15, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's no reason to assume their membership has changed at all over the last few years, apart from the Tobi/Sasori switch.

<dd>Well, if we look at the shadow images of them during their first cameo, it would appear as if Kakuzu could've had another partner by then (that big, giant like guy)... This is further implied by the fact that Hidan said that he was, next to Tobi, the newest member of Akatsuki and the fact that Kakuzu said that he had tendencies of killing his partners, so the idea of Hidan joining Akatsuki during the time-skip really aren't that farfetched. 217.208.25.160 15:46, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hidan was not there before the timeskip. The leader mentions he is new at the same time he reveals to Hidan and Obito akatsuki's objective. Furthermore, the scythe, Hidan's trademark, is absent in the original akatsuki meeting scene. Kakuzu also mentions having killed the previous member(s) he was partnered with.</p>
<dl>
<dd>One, he does not give a timeframe. Two, shadows don't give specific details.

<dl>
<dd>That the scythe is absent is debatable. Looking to the rear, you can see a reclined member with four spikes coming from his head region. Five points are seen in the same scene of the anime, with the two outside ones seeming to be from the robe's collar. For all we know, the middle three spikes could be attributed to Hidan's scythe. As Someguy0830 says, the shadows don't give specific details, so we can't be sure. –<i><a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunslinger47_cf62.html" title="User:Gunslinger47">Gunslinger47</a></i> 01:53, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually I am positive that the person Gunslinger is talking about is Sarori. The four "spikes" is actually the feathers on Sarori's puppet shell. Also, we need to keep in mind that translations from manga sites arn't always perfect and we shouldn't quote them. Omimon 7 February 2007</p>

<p>now that hidan is well sealed in the earth, it's important to tell that the akatsuki can't reinforce other member to their clan because it's neccessary to have the ring of the member who died in order to join the team.

<dd>Just a few thoughts If someone like Zetsu could reach Hidan from underground, won't he be able to save Hidan (in pieces, but still alive)? That means if they succeed in finding Hidan, they won't need to replace him, unless they only want the ring and have given up on Hidan. I wonder what would happen if Zetsu just took the ring and then tried to eat him...would that eventually trigger the voodoo jutsu and kill Zetsu as well (hehe, just an amusing thought)? <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Ocoma_8939.html" title="User:Francis Ocoma">focoma</a> 08:43, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

As for Huidan's forehead protecter, I can see why people think it looks like the Rain village, though it also looks like the grass village.

<p>In the last paragraph of the Itachi section, one sentence reads "The few normal ninjutsu he uses aren't necessarily that powerful, but Itachi is able to use them so quickly that even another Sharingan user has trouble following the movements." While the second part of that seems true, can a statement like "The few normal ninjutsu he uses aren't necessarily that powerful" really be made?

<p>Now that Shikamaru took care of Hidan shouldn't he be listed under former members? I know that he's still alive but he's being guarded by the Nara clan so at least for now he's out of action.--Emokid200618 22:01, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Former is only for those permanently or willingly cut from the ranks. Hidan's condition is by no means one that can't be overcome.

<dd>Wait a second... Does that mean, that when Naruto is finnished, all of the members will (probably) be listed under the "former members" section? ... I guess we'll just have to focus on that matter when that time comes, eh? 217.208.25.18 02:00, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The useful fact about that is when every member is either dead or the organization scattered to the wind, we can smash the sections together into a single section.

<dd>I don't think they'll dig him up. If they do, they'll probably just try to find his ring. And probably all of the members will be dead when Naruto is finish (there goes 2 of my favorite characters). But what if only 1 member is left? Suppose Sasuke doesn't kill Itachi?

<p>Alright, I'm good with waiting until the end of the arc to put him under the former members section, but I doubt that they will dig him up, but there's no way to be sure, at least until Kakuzu is killed in some way since only he can reconnect Hidan.--Emokid200618 01:32, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There's still the issue of the ring. The Akatsuki do not replace members unless they can get the ring back, which makes them pretty motivated. –<i><a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunslinger47_cf62.html" title="User:Gunslinger47">Gunslinger47</a></i> 01:49, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well it's the end of the arc. So I guess Hidan should be put under the former members section. Dasherman 02:12, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think we can expect an appearance from Zetsu, maybe he'll rescue Hidan or eat his head and see if his immortality can withstand his digestive juices ... Annoymous X</p>
<p>Alright guys it's the end of the arc so who wants to put Hidan under former members now?--Emokid200618 01:43, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nobody. He's still in possession of his ring and he has yet to defect, meaning he's still a member. <i><b>~Snapper<a href="../../../s/n/a/User_talk%7ESnapper2_c216.html" title="User talk:Snapper2">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Snapper2_6870.html" title="Special:Contributions/Snapper2">o</a></b></i> 01:46, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Like Someguy said, he isn't a former member until he leaves, dies, or is forcibly removed. I don't think we've seen the last of him, because at the least the leader will be sending Zetsu out to get the ring back (or Hidan's pieces). Hell, his head might well dig itself out of the pit (those that think it isn't possible, neither is Naruto digging a tunnel large enough for himself to crawl through and uppercut Neji in less than three minutes). We know that he is immortal, so he isn't dead. Be patient. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreima_b65e.html" title="User:Treima">Treima</a> 01:56, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But that's your own speculation. There is a big difference between what Naruto did and a head digging itself out of tons of solid rock. Even Kishimoto probably wouldn't go there. While applying physics to a fantasy setting is a losing proposition, Hidan's head and body parts should have been crushed by the rock, making him no more than mush now. The Leader should comment on what happened to Kakuzu and Hidan very soon, giving us a definite word on the fate of Hidan. Dasherman 07:43, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>i appologise if this sounds stupid but im going to ask anyway, do you think it should say that their first episode appearance was when they were all silhouette, i mean i understand this is colaborated info from both the manga and the anime, but if we mention that they all basically appeared in episode 135, should we at least not mention that it was as a silhouette</p>

<dd>pardon my French, but stop with all the bitching and moaning, first off i agree with BOTH of you, yes re-linking is a pain in the ass(thats what copying and pasting the edit page into a word processor and using the <i>find/replace all</i> is for), and yes there should have been a new page because there is a lot of information. I mean, if we had 10 bio's for all the akatsuki members as long as the one for Kakuzu is now, then this page would be WAY TOO LONG(and thats not even including Orochimaru, Sasori and Kabuto's articles). PERSONALLY i think that as we learn more about akatsuki through the manga/anime this page its self should turn into more of a medium por-say in order to find basic information on ALL the members of akatsuki AND links to main pages about them so that we/who ever my be able to learn more about him</dd>

<dd>Kakashi asks him how far his eyesight has deteriorated. The context makes it pretty clear that it refers to his Mangekyo Sharingan. Retlor 19:11, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Also, earlier in the manga, Kisame comments that MS is dangerous for his eyes.Ikani87 19:14, 17 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In the episode where Itachi and Kisame fight Asuma and Kurenai Kisame comments that using the MS too much would be bad for his eyes. Some peope think that he was reffering to Itachi's chakra but it is actually that since I"tachi never turns off his sharingan that soon he would eventually lose his sight. Later in the manga when Kakashi is fighting Itachi he does ask how much Itachi's sight had deteriorated. This means that the mangekyo sharingan does have a side affect and Itachi is well aware of that because when you next see him after his first fight with Asuma and Kurenai he does not have the sharingan or MS activated when he didnt need it. So yes if Itachi has his MS on too much he would, in fact, go blind eventually. <a href="../../../o/r/o/User%7EOrochimaru12_22a1.html" title="User:Orochimaru12">Orochimaru12</a> 18:07, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

In the anime "it" has a more masculine style, but in the manga "it's" design is more femenine. I said it more of a joke in the first place, but actually it could be a travestie.

<dd>@ Black Dollar: Oh, how does one act when acting in a "non-man-to-man" way?

<p>Deidara is a man, a guy guy. Look at the anime, he looks like a young man, and he sounds like a young man, too. Look at the manga, he looks like a girl and wears eye liner. First, it might not even be eye liner, it may just be his eyes' outlines, or, if it is eyeliner, it could serve a similar purpose of the eyeliner that <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Sparrow_de2c.html" title="Jack Sparrow">Jack Sparrow</a> or American football players wear (it keeps the sun of their eyes). Second, sure he looks like a girl, so did <a href="../../../h/a/k/Haku_%28Naruto%29_944b.html" title="Haku (Naruto)">Haku (Naruto)</a>, but he was a boy. Third, Hidan does call him Chan (which is similar to our "Miss"), but Hidan is just such an ornery guy, he was probably making fun of Deidara. Besides, other males go by "chan", like <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackie_Chan_8b3e.html" title="Jackie Chan">Jackie Chan</a>. --<a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECountmall_b55e.html" title="User:Countmall">Count Mall</a> 18:58, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>ya kno Sam, they kinda do have a point on Deidara... although we could always wait a bit longer to see if any new info arises on him when they reveal who in akatsuki naruto and company will be fighting next, i mean if it is deidra i say it may be a good idea to go ahead and create his own seperate article, if not i say we wait. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAncientanubis_46ae.html" title="User:Ancientanubis">Ancientanubis</a> 05:49, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Most of Diedara's info is his abilities, which can be trimmed down a bit. So wait until he resurfaces as a main antagonist again and dies after that or if he survives another battle in an ark then we will go ahead with the article. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_ov_the_blue_sand_359d.html" title="User:Sam ov the blue sand"><span style="color: #ff0000">Sam</span> <span style="color: #000000">ov</span> <span style="color: #000000">the</span> <span style="color: #0000ff">blue</span> <span style="color: #808000">sand</span></a> 04:55, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Now, I'm not so sure of myself. I went back and looked up some translations from chapter 267, where the line comes from, and the first two I came to had a line like "Orochimaru was originally one of us", like these two: <a href="http://forums.narutofan.com/archive/index.php/t-42990.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://forums.narutofan.com/archive/index.php/t-42990.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <a href="http://forums.narutofan.com/archive/index.php/t-42994.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://forums.narutofan.com/archive/index.php/t-42994.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> But now that I go further than that, there are about 3 that do mention the partner thing.

<dd>Okay, I'll go back and readd the stuff I removed. A while back someone mentioned that it was a translation error, but looking at the original Japanese text, it does imply that they were teammates. Plus the fact that Japanese Wikipedia mentions Sasori and Orochimaru as a pair, and I doubt they'd be confused by their original language. <a href="../../../g/e/g/User%7EGeg_04e0.html" title="User:Geg">The Splendiferous Gegiford</a> 06:08, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>ik its may be irelivent now, but i took it upon my self to re-read all the post-time skip manga for some reason, the line in question(i assume) is "hey now, i didtn have anything to do wiht the yondaime. the ones who provided the help were my subordinates... although within akatsuki, I was origionally teamed wiht orochimaru, so we did alot together...." as i read more i'll post the mentions of sasori and orochimaru just so everyone is happy and we can all dance:P___<a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAncientanubis_46ae.html" title="User:Ancientanubis">Ancientanubis</a> 05:38, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>yay more information: in chapter 294 Kabuto says "sasori harbored much ill-will towards orochimaru-sama, and was always talking of how he intended to finish him with his own hands, if he's gone back on those words and sent you to do the job... then that means he's been reduced to a state where he can't do it himself"(pg 14 of chapter 294)..... hope this may clear stuff up some, or at least that i was of some help<a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAncientanubis_46ae.html" title="User:Ancientanubis">Ancientanubis</a> 21:19, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Would anyone be in favour of splitting this article into the info on the organisation and then a members page that would allow for more information for each without making the main akatsuki page too long itself?<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkwarriorblake_8272.html" title="User:Darkwarriorblake">Darkwarriorblake</a> 18:24, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>hmmm.... sounds very interesting, the only thing im worried about though is that to some people it may seem redundant to have 2 seperate pages for akatsuki.... then again, they've kinda done the same thing with <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollows_in_Bleach_5059.html" title="Hollows in Bleach">hollow's in bleach</a>, and <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollow_%28Bleach%29_31c9.html" title="Hollow (Bleach)">hollow's</a>, and it seems to flow fairely nicely... i mean, besides a lack of some visual's....... i guess i'm a go for it, as long as we find somewhat of a good way to break it up without spreading information too thin, like maybe keeping even shorter summaries of the characters on the main page as to make things easier for some people:P<a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAncientanubis_46ae.html" title="User:Ancientanubis">Ancientanubis</a> 20:01, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I was thinking an image of each member obviously, maybe keep those detail lists like status, a very brief (Maybe a paragraph, max 2) summary of their actions and a link to "Members of Akatsuki" or something of that nature. It just seems a bit awkward to have to move deceased members down into the former members section. Like people have pointed out before, eventually everyone is going to be a former member. Perhaps all members should be listed there which would be more doable with a greatly reduced section with their obvious status section or perhaps broken up into sections with headers while still in teh members section such as active, deceased, etc. I don't think any but Orochimaru have actually willingly left.<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkwarriorblake_8272.html" title="User:Darkwarriorblake">Darkwarriorblake</a> 20:29, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>personally, i think the whole "hollows in bleach" and "hollows" is a great example of how we could do it, i mean as long as we keep it simple enough for the common person to understand and also easy to navigate... i mean, keeping this in mind we also wouldnt feel that guilty on expanding more on akatsuki as a group also i think that it'd be a nice little project to keep us all occupied:P__ <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAncientanubis_46ae.html" title="User:Ancientanubis">Ancientanubis</a> 21:38, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Members section doesn't take up that much room. And with members dieing at a rapid pace they will soon all have their own articles.<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_ov_the_blue_sand_359d.html" title="User:Sam ov the blue sand"><span style="color: #ff0000">Sam</span> <span style="color: #000000">ov</span> <span style="color: #000000">the</span> <span style="color: #0000ff">blue</span> <span style="color: #808000">sand</span></a> 22:06, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That's hardly a good reason to keep it as is. It looks weird putting them down in the former members section for a start. THe main members section is the most eye catching when you view the article with former members almost seeming unimportant to a casual reader which isn't a good thing. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkwarriorblake_8272.html" title="User:Darkwarriorblake">Darkwarriorblake</a> 22:44, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Once again you're are forgetting the IP's if we got rid of the former members section they'd be like "WHERE THE HELL'S SASORI AND THE OTHERS!" and we will have to point them in the right direction time and again.

<dd>yes, but thats why they're sayin that if we keep a very small section on the main page, wiht a picture of each of the members(keeps the anonymous's happy) then we can have a seperate page with more indepth info on the members all while kinda spreading out the whole thing, i mean personally i've felt that the akatsuki page is VERY long, maybe breaking it up may be a better way to distribute the information<a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAncientanubis_46ae.html" title="User:Ancientanubis">Ancientanubis</a> 02:59, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's 12kb over the limit, but that's not the point. Unlike Hollows, we know next to nothing about the organization itself, other than the first sections, which constitute a bit more than a stub.
