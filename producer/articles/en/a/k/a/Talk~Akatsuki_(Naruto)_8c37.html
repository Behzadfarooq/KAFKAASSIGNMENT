<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but i think Itachi should get his own main page. i think he certainly has enough background information on him, and i think he plays a good enough role to get his own page. Does anyone else think this?24.185.163.37 23:15, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>hmmm..... to be completely honest, i am kinda split 50/50 on this, i mean... on one hand yes in the over all story(well at least for sasuke) yes he does play a major role........ but on the other hand, besides one main flashback and three fights( with kakashi and co,his fight with Sasuke/Naruto/Jiraiya and finally his fight with naruto/kakashi) he really has not made much of an appearance (probably not even really being in no more then 10 episodes)... basically i guess I'm indifferent either way, i mean I'd like to start seeing each member getting their own page, but also i don't think it'd be a good idea to basically have them all be mega-stubs(not quite a full article yet not a stub)<a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAncientanubis_46ae.html" title="User:Ancientanubis">Ancientanubis</a> 00:08, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I feel like I've memorised this answer. No Itachi cannot have his own article because of the following reasons:
<ul>
<li>Itachi has barley done anything in the series except for flashbacks and a few fights.</li>
<li>Itachi has done nothing for Akatsuki, except hunt for Naruto.</li>
<li>And he has yet to have a major involvement in Naruto Shippuden.<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_ov_the_blue_sand_359d.html" title="User:Sam ov the blue sand"><span style="color: #ff0000">Sam</span> <span style="color: #000000">ov</span> <span style="color: #000000">the</span> <span style="color: #0000ff">blue</span> <span style="color: #808000">sand</span></a> 01:10, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'll give you that, but thats just it. Hidan and Kakuzu were defeated. That's why they'd have to send itachi and kisame to finish the job! if not them then another pair, but they may be defeated too, as what happens with all fights with the main character involved. But whatever, idk for sure. KKIPPES 05:52, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What? Is this debate already resolved? I really think Itachi should have his own article. Kakuzu and Hidan both have their own articles, and Itachi doesn't have one! His story is really important if one wants to know about Sasuke's story and motivations. And as for the fights, Itachi already had many fights. He fought with Kakashi, Kurenai, Jiraiya, Sasuke (a very brief one), did some sort of clone jutsu and fought Naruto and Kakashi, and then he also appeared in Orochimaru's memories in the manga, where he apparently used his sharingan to deflect his jutsu. That is enough material to create a main article with. And being clearly one of the key characters that propel the plot, the reason for Sasuke's defection to Konoha, which in turn is the reason for Naruto trying to master a new jutsu, which in turn, basically, is the whole I'm-getting-my-friend-back plot of the story -- this guy long deserves to have his own article. <a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoonwalkerwiz_807c.html" title="User:Moonwalkerwiz">Moonwalkerwiz</a> 06:44, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Despite appearing for a handful of battles, Itachi has mostly watched from the sidelines during these battles and hasn't actually done much in terms of fighting. Whatever article there would be on him would focus mainly on what he did before joining Akatsuki. <i><b>~Snapper<a href="../../../s/n/a/User_talk%7ESnapper2_c216.html" title="User talk:Snapper2">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Snapper2_6870.html" title="Special:Contributions/Snapper2">o</a></b></i> 21:40, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think so. I agree that it would be impossible to create Itachi's main page and divide into arcs like others, but I think we still can write a fairly lengthy piece without dividing it into those sections. The first section could be his history with Sasuke and how he got the Mangekyo Sharingan, and the other half could be his participation in Akatsuki. <a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoonwalkerwiz_807c.html" title="User:Moonwalkerwiz">Moonwalkerwiz</a> 00:45, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure that would be an adequate length, but that remains to be seen. As I've said elsewhere, all attempts at giving Itachi an article have consisted of copying and pasting his section in this article into a different one. If someone were to put more effort into giving him an article than that, he might have had an article long ago. Try it if you (or someone else) must, but I'd be very disappointed if I saw a near identical copy of his section in this article with maybe a couple extra paragraphs. <i><b>~Snapper<a href="../../../s/n/a/User_talk%7ESnapper2_c216.html" title="User talk:Snapper2">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Snapper2_6870.html" title="Special:Contributions/Snapper2">o</a></b></i> 02:32, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Listen, all im saying is hidan and kakuzu do not play as an extreme a part in naruto as itachi does, and yet they get their own page. snapper, you're right about the being disappointed if there was a copy of his section with a few extra paragraphs, but its just like that for some people. if it gets too long, he should have his own page. plus, moonwalker makes many good points about what to put in his article, so my vote on itachis own page stands.

<p>To the one above Gunslinger47: If orochi cared and itachi didn't, then why would it be in itachi's page? Orochi was like a mosquito, to use Gunslinger47's metaphor (or something like that). If you had an autobiography, would you put that you swatted a fly? if that fly survived, and it magically recieved the ability to write, it probably would, but you wouldnt.

<p>no it is important to itachi...he is responsible for Oro leaving Akatsuki and to say Oro is a fly is a little wierd he is very important character to say there wasnt any relationship between Oro and itachi is just wrong and this is on a Akatsuki page and it effects all of Akatsuki JKAP2KAP 16:36, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Let me elaborate on my original message. This is already mentioned in the article under Orochimaru's section.

<dd>I have 2 agree with Gunslinger on this one, I mean yes when some major event occurs to multiple characters(for example how with Sasuke and Orochimaru's recent fight is mentioned in both their articles), but this is on a way smaller scale, I mean, I guess its like saying in Naruto's article that during Naruto and Sasuke's fight Sasuke stood there 'blankly' while he thought about all the events leading up to this, or vice versa, Sasuke stood there while Naruto remembered how hard it was for him growing up... it's just a bit redundant I guess...<a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAncientanubis_46ae.html" title="User:Ancientanubis">Ancientanubis</a> 18:16, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If it turns out that this event has major significance to Itachi himself, then it will be revealed in the upcoming chapters. As of now, it's simply a minor incident in which Itachi overwhelmed Orochimaru, and this likely led to his departure from Akatsuki. To Itachi himself, it has little relevance, especially considering that Itachi was quite aware of his inherent superiority in this fashion. <a href="../../../s/e/p/User%7ESephiroth_BCR_dc57.html" title="User:Sephiroth BCR">Sephiroth BCR</a> 19:19, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm amazed that this debate is over, too. Whoever said that this match doesn't matter to Itachi's history or perspective? Did anyone ask Masashi Kishimoto and got the answer straight from him? Itachi have always worn that impassive face. Even when he was murdering his family and his whole clan, or when he's fighting really powerful ninjas like Kakashi or Jiraiya, he'd always looked bored and that it doesn't matter to him. And if these seemingly unimportant details do not matter that much, then tell me why it was mentioned here that Deidara tried to choke Tobi with his legs? I believe that this match is more defining than Deidara and Tobi's match. It illustrates how powerful Itachi is compared to Orochimaru. And since when did we judge that an information is irrelevant if the subject deems it irrelevant? I've never heard of that Wikipedia rule before. I say, let's give Itachi his own article and include these details there and others. <a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoonwalkerwiz_807c.html" title="User:Moonwalkerwiz">Moonwalkerwiz</a> 06:59, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>if orochimaru wont be included into itachis history, then why should sasuke be? at least not that much of sasukes history should be in there, since its not revelant to itachi. <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELetuce_be13.html" title="User:Letuce">Letuce</a> 19:27, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Itachi's section is devoid of most things he does after joining Akatsuki. Until his role while "fighting" the Konoha Jonin, trying to capture Naruto, and stalling Team 7 is included in his section, there's no reason why his cutting off Orochimaru's hand needs to be mentioned. <i><b>~Snapper<a href="../../../s/n/a/User_talk%7ESnapper2_c216.html" title="User talk:Snapper2">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Snapper2_6870.html" title="Special:Contributions/Snapper2">o</a></b></i> 21:40, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>To Gunslinger, I don't get your point. I've read the links you provided and I think they even support my argument. In the article, "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information," there is nothing there that says you cannot add a certain info if that info is well referenced and have relevance to the subject. And the article about the Pokemon test actually proves my point. The Naruto enterprise is continually growing and the main article itself says that its popularity is comparable to Dragonball. Consequently, its characters, especially the key ones, deserve their own pages. I believe Itachi Uchiha is a key character (see my argument above on "Itachi main page"). I do not want to mention it just because it's mentionable, I want to mention it because I think that it's relevant. As I said, if you guys add things like Deidara choked Tobi with his legs, and then you don't add things like Itachi's Sharingan can seem to cancel all of Orochimaru's jutsu experiments, then I think you guys are really confused. <a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoonwalkerwiz_807c.html" title="User:Moonwalkerwiz">Moonwalkerwiz</a> 00:41, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>WP:NOT#IINFO says "That something is 100% true does not mean it is suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia." Meaning, when you said you you can add something if that "info is well referenced and have relevance to the subject", you were not necessarily correct. Being relevant and referenced are prerequisites for adding information, not reasons in themselves. Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information.</li>
<li>WP:POKEMON is not a guideline, and from some perspectives, it's a logical fallacy. I pasted it in response to the assertion that other sections have indiscriminate information, therefor this information should also be added. I'm not defending this thinking, but am rather opposed to it.</li>
<li>"Deserve their own pages". Pages are not people. They deserve nothing. They exist if they meet our guidelines on <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>, otherwise they will exist as redirects to superpages such as this one.

<dd>So what is "suitable for inclusion" for you? I'm not even sure why I bother debating this with you, and not just add it myself. You still don't answer my argument that you're adding seemingly insignificant details in the story and yet not adding this one. And what's with the "pages are not people"? Don't be cryptic. If you're arguing notability, then I think Itachi is more notable than Kakuzu or Hidan. They are dead in a single arc. Itachi had been there from the start, echoing in Sasuke's memory. Please be more clear about what you think is suitable to be added here and not, and also, what deserves its own article. <a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoonwalkerwiz_807c.html" title="User:Moonwalkerwiz">Moonwalkerwiz</a> 02:12, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've personally done no such thing. User:67.84.124.203 asked if mention of the event should be added to Itachi's section, and I've replied that according to Wikipedia policy... no, events shouldn't be mentioned simply because they happened. If the event somehow illustrates something you're trying to get across, then that's fine. I'm sure there are similar examples on Wikipedia, in this article and beyond, that fall under indiscriminate information. According to policy, perhaps they should not be included as well?</dd>

<dd>Oh sorry I didn't say hi (I always say that to people I haven't have the pleasure of meeting), but I was in a rush. ^_^ So anyways it's no rule or policy it is just a guideline so we don't have articles that don't belong (such as stubs, though nothing against them, they're alright ^_^) and this way we can see if they even deserve their own article, for example if Zetsu was to drop dead then he wouldn't be deserving of his own article (I forgot to mention that in my first post). Oh and it also helps to keep the same discussions from appearing (like this one). Again sorry for not saying hi or explaining my reasoning further. ^_^ <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_ov_the_blue_sand_359d.html" title="User:Sam ov the blue sand"><span style="color: #ff0000">Sam</span> <span style="color: #000000">ov</span> <span style="color: #000000">the</span> <span style="color: #0000ff">blue</span> <span style="color: #808000">sand</span></a> 23:39, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the clear response. I'm getting tired of Gunslinger's rules. Now I understand why these two still don't have their own separate articles. However, I still keep to my argument in the other sections above, that Itachi must have his own article despite the fact that it would be difficult to divide his into arcs. Akatsuki members each have their own different stories, and so it could be problematic if we stick to that guideline. I predict that some of them will not die and will survive long into the series, probably not doing any "major" battle for a very long time. Itachi, for example, already had many fights, albeit small ones. And being one of the major antagonists, his major battle might not come soon. However, he is a key character, and having his own article seems to me a must, since his role in the story provides motivations for the other major characters: Sasuke, Orochimaru and Naruto. As for Deidara, isn't his fight with Gaara considered a major battle? He also fought Kakashi and Naruto, and seen capturing a tailed beast. In fact, among Akastsuki and aside from Sasori, Deidara's character is very well explored in the manga, although his history is still not revealed. <a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoonwalkerwiz_807c.html" title="User:Moonwalkerwiz">Moonwalkerwiz</a> 01:19, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Try to catch on here, because you've already carried on at least two pointless discussions and the inability to listen becomes annoying very quickly. We know what Itachi has done, not about him. Hidan gets a hell of a lot of character development, as does Hidan. That and Sam is just as annoyingly persistent as you in this regard.

<dd>The amazing thing is, the same thing can be said of you guys that "You" are basing your entire argument around what "you" believe "you" know and don't know." Hidan gets "a hell of a lot of character development"? What are you talking about? All we know about Hidan is that he's an immortal, he has a weird religion, he killed Asuma and he got buried by Shikamaru. As for Itachi, we know about his history and he also had many battles. You're only saying you know many things about Hidan and Kakuzu because it's <i>easier</i> to write their articles because they only fight two major battles and then it's over. You're trying to cram the story into this "standard" that you made for yourselves. You're not the only editors here. What makes you think that you can set guidelines for everybody? I'm only speaking of this matter this way because you seem to think that I carry out "pointless discussions." But I give up. I'm tired of this discussion and of people like you who take control of articles, thinking that they know all about it, and are unquestionable about the matter.

<dd>hey buddy, ik i have not posted much but i cant stand by and idly by and listen to your babble anymore... just because we think we know something about a character doesnt mean we should run off and add it... we post facts here, not suspicions... yes we understand that itachi drives the motivation behind ALOT of characters in Naruto... but tell me, how many episodes/chapters has he really been in???? episode wise(prior to the time skip) he was seen in about 4 episodes(not including flash backs in which maybe it bumps up 2 8(of which those 2nd 4 are just them explaining what happened in the past in which all we learn is that 'he killed his clan and basically forced sasuke to hate him and extract revenge on him' why did he leave him alive?, why did he seek so much power?, we dont know and were not going to post guess's...)) AND ANOTHER THING... people like sam, gun slinger and someguy are not wiki gods or anything, and they haven't taken over the article... anyone is free to edit this article BUT it's people like them who frequent this page and make sure that the information is not only correct, but has a good enough reason for being here... AND there's nothing wrong with doing this... hell i've recently taken a page <a href="../../../6/6/6/666_Satan_ea96.html" title="666 Satan">666 Satan</a> that started out as basically nothing and have worked my ass off 2 make it a respectable page(ask sam if ya don't believe me) and theres nothing wrong with frequenting a page you've but ALOT of work into in order to make sure it stays respecable... i personally know that i'll frequent the 666 satan page for as long as possible inorder to make sure that all my hard work doesn't go 2 waste... it's a matter of pride and the fact that we've put so much time into something that drives us 2 do this... i mean, if it weren't for people like sam, someguy and gunslinger then people would go off and do w/e they want with this article and it'd prob go 2 crap and represent naruto in a bad light which would upset naruto fans, so instead of bitchin and moaning about how they're not agreeing with your opinion to give itachi or who ever there own article, you should be thankful for people like them who keep the article in such good shape... AND if you really want itachi or who ever to gave there own article, then you should do what the rest of us would do in any regular cituation and create a very convincing argument on why they deserve it... basically something besides "his actions drive many characters"...and im really sorry if that sounds harsh but i just couldn't sit by and watch you not listen to what anyone had to say... granted wikipedia is not a democracy, but we still try 2 have an overall agreement on what should be done prior to doing it... <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAncientanubis_46ae.html" title="User:Ancientanubis">Ancientanubis</a> 06:34, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not questioning the amount of effort you've put into creating articles. I'm an editor myself and I know how difficult it is to write a good article. I don't edit naruto pages that much, in fact, come to think of it, I've never edited any naruto article. And like I said, I give up on this discussion. If you don't want to consider my reasons to give Itachi and Deidara their own articles (and god knows I've done my best to make them clear, I usually don't debate this much except in the Reference Desk) then so be it. But I just want to make it clear that I appreciate all your work and I thank you all for it. Still, I find it hard to see this "overall agreement."

<dd>how are they being 'squashed'... and to be honesty you haven't really given much of an argument about itachi, basically all i've heard is that he has effected other people and that's about it.... if you really want to convince us then you need facts, good reasons and maybe specific policy's as to why it should be created... i mean honestly i feel like yes itachi could use his own article.... BUT the only reason that it hasn't happened is because of the fact that even though he's effected the naruto universe in a large way he has yet to really appear in many chapters/episodes so i understand why we have yet to decide that he deserve his own article... you've got to look @ the big picture of what is good for the article as a whole instead of your opinion of just one character....<a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAncientanubis_46ae.html" title="User:Ancientanubis">Ancientanubis</a> 07:21, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Enough. There's no article for them since there isn't a suitable amount of information to make a worthwhile article. For Itachi, you can discuss his abilities, his time with his clan before annihilating them, and his very brief fights during the actual series. Not sufficient, nor would it be conclusive. Out of all the members of Akatsuki, Itachi is most likely to recieve the greatest amount of development, as he is directly linked to several of the major characters. Once his role has been properly concluded, an article can be added that will certaintly have sufficient information. As for Deidara, you can have a brief synopsis of his abilities - considering that never any great discussion about them nor variety, and you can mention the fights he has been involved in. Compared to the present articles (Sasori, Kakazu, and Hidan), he has a pitiful amount of information available to write an article. There's little more to include than what is already mentioned on the page. <a href="../../../s/e/p/User%7ESephiroth_BCR_dc57.html" title="User:Sephiroth BCR">Sephiroth BCR</a> 07:52, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My suggestion wasn't "Death = Page", but rather that for "villain of the week" enemies, the point of their death or defeat is a good time to determine whether the character required a page of its own, since we know little more information is likely to come in. –<i><a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunslinger47_cf62.html" title="User:Gunslinger47">Gunslinger47</a></i> 02:22, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Right. Regarding Itachi, he is undoubtably significant, from virtually all perspectives. However, we don't have anything more to say about him that can't be put into a single, well-phrase paragraph. He's was a genius from the Uchiha clan who entered ANBU before killing his best friend and clan because people in <i>Naruto</i> are psychotic. He left his brother alive because of reasons mentioned in the preceeding sentance, as well as to supposedly challange himself. He joined Akatsuki, after which he has had fleeting encounters with various individuals where he dispatches them while bored, demonstrating his strength as a genjutsu user and the overpowering might of his mangekyo sharingan. The use of this eye technique has caused his eyesight to degrade, as fitting with the reoccuring theme in <i>Naruto</i> that all surpremely powerful abilities are self-destructive. –<i><a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunslinger47_cf62.html" title="User:Gunslinger47">Gunslinger47</a></i> 03:18, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Even though plenty of work has gone into the articles, do we really need them?

<dd>Excluding the plot summaries, I'm surprised by the length of the three. I do agree that none are in the spotlight for very long, but I also think there's certainly enough information on each of them to warrant remaining. While there is a certain amount of bias in this belief, putting them back in this article would just recreate three lengthy article-sized sections. <i><b>~Snapper<a href="../../../s/n/a/User_talk%7ESnapper2_c216.html" title="User talk:Snapper2">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Snapper2_6870.html" title="Special:Contributions/Snapper2">o</a></b></i> 03:48, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Considering the Anime has yet to even truly reach these three, I expect there will be a need to keep them. The pace of shippuden is rather slow and thusly I think they will become the villians of major story arcs, rather then simply "villians of the week" as you put it. Considering Zabuza has his own article at under 15 episodes, I think these guys earn since they're going to take a fair bit more, have ties to a group of major villians, and may not be completely out of the story yet (you never know what flashbacks and plot twists may bring, hell, zabuza has been recently brought up once more even). -- <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidusunknown_ed20.html" title="User:Midusunknown">Midusunknown</a> 07:54, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
