<h2><span class="mw-headline">Tobi's manner of speech</span></h2>
<p>In Tobi's entry, it says that his manner of speech is very formal and correct. I'm not sure this means anything to most people, at least not in English. Can someone explain what this description is supposed to mean and polish it up so its a little more informative/intelligible? Otherwise, it should probably be taken out. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Plunge (<a href="../../../p/l/u/User_talk%7EPlunge_afae.html" title="User talk:Plunge">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Plunge_62ff.html" title="Special:Contributions/Plunge">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>Can't really put it much simpler. Formal - not causal. Correct - not slurred.

<dd>In japanese there is more definition in speech patterns that define how you view whoever you might be addressing. the most common example is using honorific terms, titles, and the fairly well known masu format of speech. Rather than casual statements you'd make to your equal, tobi is speaking in a very repectful format that is very formal and stiff, showing great respect to whoever he speaks too. This could be the difference of saying im going casually "Ikeru" to im going in a formal fashion you'd say to perhaps your teacher "ikimasu". Of course this is very simply defined ever so elloquently in the article as formal, so it need not be changed. --<a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidusunknown_ed20.html" title="User:Midusunknown">Midusunknown</a> 10:50, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Most readers of the ENGLISH version of wikipedia know nothing about the various forms of speech in Japanese, and certainly "correct" means little (do other characters commonly speak in gibberish). I'm just sugguesting a better explanation for causal english-speaking readers. Or perhaps a link to a discussion of japanese honorifics?</dd>

<dd>Or perhaps they just might take formal to mean just that: formal. You telling me you don't know the definition of formal, or suggesting that others don't? Formal is fine.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">unnamed member-accessory or hole</span></h2>
<p>I have a copy of shonnen jump weekly vol. 35 with the spread of akatsuki and even i can't define if it is a crack in the rock or some accessory. It is the exact same colour as the rock itself, however it overlaps the members head and is shaped far different from the other cracks. My point being, this undefinable piece should not be included under his section until the character is seen further and one side or the other can be proven. --<a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidusunknown_ed20.html" title="User:Midusunknown">Midusunknown</a> 10:53, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Comparing to this picture <a href="http://groups.msn.com/NarutoMangaReturns/vol27.msnw?action=ShowPhoto&amp;PhotoID=13554" class="external free" title="http://groups.msn.com/NarutoMangaReturns/vol27.msnw?action=ShowPhoto&amp;PhotoID=13554" rel="nofollow">http://groups.msn.com/NarutoMangaReturns/vol27.msnw?action=ShowPhoto&amp;PhotoID=13554</a> it should be pretty obvious that it's something that belongs to the head and not the background. When we only had chapter 238, it could have been a cleaning mistake, but now we have two pics from the same angle showing the same thing. It's definitely part of the character. <a href="../../../g/r/r/User%7EGrrblt_2f06.html" title="User:Grrblt">Grrblt</a> 18:29, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would hardly say its definite, but i'll concede that its enough evidence to include it, only know it would be a constant back and fourth if i did not. I personally hold no strong opinion one way or another, but all I know is from the colour spread, its undefinable. add it. --<a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidusunknown_ed20.html" title="User:Midusunknown">Midusunknown</a> 07:10, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with Midusunknown|Midusunknown. That 'thing' near the unknown Akatsuki member's head apears to be just detail from the background; a crack or something to that effect. --<a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeef_noodles_d1c0.html" title="User:Beef noodles">Beef noodles</a> 01:45, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Could it be a "crack or something" on the same member in two separate pictures? Remember, when we got 238, the only thing that stood out about this member was the "pineapple head". The cleaners had not seen the color pic and they had no idea what this thing was. Now we get a color screen, showing the thing on the head in the same position as the old one. The same "crack" wouldn't appear in the same place twice unless it was something else than a crack. <a href="../../../g/r/r/User%7EGrrblt_2f06.html" title="User:Grrblt">Grrblt</a> 09:08, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Deidara</span></h2>
<p>Deidara is a female Gaara has called her a she many times. ~ Wickanprince</p>
<dl>
<dd>No. He is a guy. <a href="../../../t/t/n/User%7ETTN_1fb9.html" title="User:TTN">Nemu</a> 00:35, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Gaara called Deidara a she in some translations, because the original Japanese didn't reveal Deidara's sex. Instead of 'he' or 'she' like in English, Japanese commonly uses things like 'that person'. In order to make the English translation sound OK, the translator had to <b>guess</b> and write either he or she. Unfortunately, some chose 'she', and when it was later discovered that Deidara refers to himself using male words (they have male and female 'I'), the damage was already done. Deidara also doesn't have any breasts, which is quite uncommon for females in manga. Also, the shadow of Deidara speaking in anime episode 135 has a very deep male voice.</dd>
<dd>It should be noted, however, that Orochimaru talks using female pronouns; a feature to make him seem even creepier. But in his case, other characters have referred to Oro as male and his gender is not really up for discussion. Still, it shows that the male pronouns that Deidara use are not a 100% guarantee, but until we see someone refer to Deidara as female (in the original language), he should be considered to be male. <a href="../../../g/r/r/User%7EGrrblt_2f06.html" title="User:Grrblt">Grrblt</a> 09:44, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How can you tell she doesnt have breast she could be an A its hard to tell with that robe. Plus many charecters have opisite sex vioces Haku for example is a guy and dresses like a girl and kinda sounds like one. Personly I think we should just say it in the discription as the gender is unknown although I believe she is a girl.~Wickan prince</p>

<dl>
<dd>We can tell Deidara doesn't have breasts, because we've seen him from some angles where the robe wasn't in the way. Check out the Unnamed member, that's how breasts look in the Akatsuki robe. Haku was 15 years old. And I know a few men age 15 that don't have very male voices, but I have <b>never</b> heard a female speak with Deidara's voice. Besides, Haku's voice actor was decided after the manga revealed Haku to be a "girly male", while Deidara only had that small speech in the Akatsuki cave. The anime team would not have chosen such a dark voice without first asking Kishimoto if that person was a girl. Right now, everything points at Deidara being male <i>except</i> a few unfortunate translations. <a href="../../../g/r/r/User%7EGrrblt_2f06.html" title="User:Grrblt">Grrblt</a> 13:40, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Speaking of Deidara, isn't his eye colour cyan? If one takes a look at the "current Akatsuki roster" image at the main page and makes a google image search for "cyan", doesn't Deidara's eye colour match that colour perfectly?</p>

<p>Trust me. He is a guy. He has a guy's voice and there are lots of girly men in Naruto. It's only his hair that is girly, actually. His hair is what gets everyone confused. And the fact that he wears nail polish. But all Akatsuki members wear nail polish.</p>

<dd>It might serve little purpose, but it serves some purpose. A search on the article for "unknown" gives 11 matches, and all those have been used to show that we, the editors, have thought about an issue and that right now we don't possess the information.&#160;? fields does the exact same thing. If someone new to Akatsuki reads the article and finds "Age:&#160;?" he will immediately understand that information is currently unavailable. But if he sees "Age: 31" on Kisame and no age on Hidan, he might start thinking "hey I want to know Hidan's age, why haven't they listed it?". An encyclopaedia should not only tell what we know, but also what we don't know.&#160;? fields serve the purpose of telling people that we don't know. <a href="../../../g/r/r/User%7EGrrblt_2f06.html" title="User:Grrblt">Grrblt</a> 17:25, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't remember it because it didn't happen. Sarutobi blocked the summon. If the Fourth hadn't been dead it wouldn't have worked in the first place (summon empty coffin technique???)

<p>How could it possibly be Tazuna? Tazuna doesn't live in Konoha.</p>
<p>OK, I know this sound weird but I think it Tobi. Now listen Tobi has a hair style like the leader's hair. Plus we never seen Tobi's face and the Leader face was a shadow. Also The we don't know the jutsu of Tobi or the Leaders so he could use shadow clone jutsu.</p>

<p>How could it possibly be Tobi or Tazuna? There is more evidence pointing to the leader being the Fourth Hokage and the Fourth Hokage being Naruto's father. First of all, They show the leader covered by a shadow, so you don't know his hair color. Second of all, the leader looks like the Fourth Hokage. And lastly, The Fourth Hokage is the only other person with blond hair and blue eyes. You see? The evidence points to him. Tazuna doesn't live in Konoha. And Tobi could never, ever, possibly be the leader. By the way, None of the Akatsuki members knows who the leader is. They don't even know his name!</p>

<p>OK.</p>
<dl>
<dd>A couple of points: 1: We know that the Leader has ginger hair, he's the top-right guy on the color page. 2: The Leader has odd eyes that the Yondaime Hokage didn't have. 3: There is absolutely no proof that the members don't know the identity of the Leader. 4: Yondaime Hokage is dead. 5: Even if he was alive, there would be no point in him becoming a criminal. Absolutely zero chance of Yondaime being the Hokage.</dd>
<dd>So there is actually more proof for Tobi. We haven't seen Tobi's eyes, Tobi is alive and Tobi is a bad guy. Yet, nobody believes Tobi is the Leader and I hope it remains that way.

<p>you know i would really like this trivia added to zetsu about the similaritys between his character and two characters of the manga and anime scryed "Zetsu has a similar character design to alter power "Zetsuie" from the serialization scryed. He also seems to have similar powers of another alter power of the character Urizane in that they can both travel through plants that cover a large amount of distance in a short period of time."</p>

<dd>It's not notable in the sense that people not familiar with the other manga will have no idea what you're talking about and I honestly doubt they will be that interested. It's a fact that most anime characters nowadays are inspired by another character from another manga and it's not particularly sensational that Zetsu would be as well. However, I think the two pieces on Hidan and Kakuzu should stay; it is interesting to note that both halves of this team (and nobody else) have names that originated from Shogi. Kanji names are usually for signifying a very special meaning, and it's no coincidence that these two both have Shogi names at a time when Asuma makes ill-fated Shogi analogies. So I think the best course of action is to reinstate Hidan's and Kakuzu's, leave the Zetsu inspiration out of the article and cut the Sun Pagoda trivia on Deidara (which is pretty much the same thing as Zetsu's). <a href="../../../g/r/r/User%7EGrrblt_2f06.html" title="User:Grrblt">Grrblt</a> 17:15, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Meaning of Akatsuki</span></h2>
<p>I noticed that on the Akatsuki page it says that Akatsuki means dawn or daybreak. Now I don’t speak or read Japanese but I did some research and found another possible translation. According to my findings Aka can have a couple of different meanings one of them being Bloody then I found out that tsuki means moon so I believe that Akatsuki could mean Bloody Moon.</p>
<p>I also believe that if that is the case than it could be a reference to an ill omen in the wiccen belief called blood on the moon. One of my reasons for thinking this is that it is a bad omen and I cant think of anything much worse than having a run in with the Akatsuki.</p>

<p>Aka means red and Tsuki means moon. Don't ask me why they put red clouds. Someone else has an idea, though. Here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SilM52CBAJ8" class="external free" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SilM52CBAJ8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SilM52CBAJ8</a></p>
<p>One have to consider the kanji when reading japanese, if Akatsuki's name meant "red moon" instead of "dawn" it wouldn't even be called "Akatsuki" but rather "Akaitsuki" (赤い月), and the red clouds are a referance to how the sky looks in the early morning hours. trivia: Akatsuki is a pseudonym for "In the event of" but this is written with a different kanji so don't start walking around thinking that Itachi is a member of the "in the event of" organisation now.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Easy to anger</span></h2>
<p>So, in the light of the latest chapter (322) we learn that Kakuzu has the habit of killing his teammates in flashes of rage. Someone reminded me of how, in their introduction, Hidan was introducing himself as the one easy to anger and suggested that perhaps Hidan was just parodying on Kakuzu's violent behaviour. It would explain why Kakuzu, the one with the anger management problem, was all "shut up Hidan", and it fits with Hidan's attitude of not worrying about pissing Kakuzu off (since he can't die).

<li>Too much "non-notable trivia"</li>
<li>In-universe perspective</li>
<li>Lack of inline citations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of those, the easiest, though potentially most time consuming is #3. All we need to do is pick facts from the page, find the place where they are first stated, and then use a &lt;ref&gt;Source, chapter, page&lt;/ref&gt; tag to cite the information. #1 Just consists of trimming junk out. The hard one will be in-universe perspective, since that's practically just a judgment call by the reviewer, but it should still be doable.</p>

<p><a name="change_in_infolists" id="change_in_infolists"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">change in infolists</span></h2>
<p>I have a few suggestions for changes on the info list. First off, standardize all lists for the "real members" (current+Sasori). Right now, Itachi has a bunch of extra info like Ninja Academy Registration number and Voice actor. I'm personally no fan of including this info at all (specially registration number, who cares), but at least we should give the same kind of info on everyone. Oro, Kabuto and Yura (and any future subordinates) can keep their info list with only the Akatsuki-relevant stuff, as they don't all have rings or partners for example. Second, Debut should be split into First cameo and First appearance or something similar. With the current system, Deidara's debut is listed as 247 even though he appeared in 238 and even played a major part in the dialogue of that scene. 238 would be considered his First cameo, 247 his First appearance. Third, I think we know enough to add a Target bijuu to the info list. Itachi is after Kyuubi, Deidara caught Shukaku, Hidan caught Nibi, Tobi caught Sanbi and Sasori didn't know himself. It could be listed as Target bijuu: [[Kyuubi]], jinchuuriki [[Uzumaki Naruto]] (not captured). Fourth is a small note really, <i>Position</i> should be renamed as <i>Ring position</i> to avoid confusion. Fifth is concerning the Unique traits that I believe should be changed into Defining characteristics. Someone, I believe it was Someguy####, mentioned in an edit summary that personalities aren't really unique and thus shouldn't be listed. However, it is just that kind of information that should be listed, and some traits listed right now aren't even unique either ("commonly uses water based jutsu", "master of the Sharingan", etc). Characteristics is good because it can include both skills and personalities. <a href="../../../g/r/r/User%7EGrrblt_2f06.html" title="User:Grrblt">Grrblt</a> 14:35, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Another suggestion: list the members by ring position, not alphabetically. Presently, we have one guy alphabetized under L for Leader, but Unknown is after Zetsu. We could list the right hand from thumb to pinky, and then the left hand in the same order. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 17:17, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not so sure that is the best way of doing it. Right now it doesn't follow the same order as the list of Akatsuki Rings and looks just weird. However, as Oro is right in the middle of that list, it would look weird if we conformed the member order to the way the rings are listed as well. It all boils down to the fact that only nine rings are present in the Current Members so ordering them by their rings would make it look crippled. The alphabetical order is a pretty sensical way of doing it IMO, although I suppose you could put Unnamed above Zetsu if you wanted. <a href="../../../g/r/r/User%7EGrrblt_2f06.html" title="User:Grrblt">Grrblt</a> 12:36, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Three days and no complaints, I went ahead and made the changes. I also reverted the name order to alphabetical as described above. <a href="../../../g/r/r/User%7EGrrblt_2f06.html" title="User:Grrblt">Grrblt</a> 11:16, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, didn't notice your comment or I would have objected to the ordering change.</dd>
<dd>Counter-proposal: Place Sasori (deceased) before Tobi. Orochimaru will now be in his proper ring position at the bottom of the list. Since ring position will not change based on the passage of time, we will never have to mess with the order again, and it will be more encyclopedic that way. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 18:07, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I still don't like it. Listing by rings would have worked if Sasori hadn't been replaced, but we can't list 11 people at 10 positions. Current members, old members in alphabetical order works a lot better to me. People not familiar very with Akatsuki will consider the ring order to be a funny order anyway (talk about in-universe perspective), while alphabetical order is the way of pretty much everything else and everyone will understand it. <a href="../../../g/r/r/User%7EGrrblt_2f06.html" title="User:Grrblt">Grrblt</a> 18:15, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>But they don't all have names, and former members is itself an in-universe criteria. Additionally, the rings are the closest thing we have to an Akatsuki designation of rank. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 18:21, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We don't know all their names, but we can identify them all by <b>a</b> name. Listing by current and former members is something everyone can understand, regardless of how familiar they are with the Naruto universe. They idea of moving from in-universe perspective is so that people will have an easier time reading it; listing the members in an order they won't understand won't help that. The rings have never been hinted to have a connection to any form of rank; in fact there's never been any hint that there even are ranks save for the Leader. The only problem with the current list is that the order might change a little when the two last names are revealed and that is hardly an issue. Ordering them by rings will either give a broken series (because Oro's ring is missing), an order that does not follow the one given in the Akatsuki ring list (which we can't change since it corresponds to a picture), or a list with all 11 members that does not comprehensibly convey the current member list. Disregarding the disadvantages of a Ring order system, I also just don't see the point of changing a list that already works. <a href="../../../g/r/r/User%7EGrrblt_2f06.html" title="User:Grrblt">Grrblt</a> 20:12, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>No Akatsuki member deserves their own article as long as they are acting as group members first and foremost. Sasori's entry may be long, but he's still an Akatsuki member through and through and thus should be in the Akatsuki page. Itachi is the only member that might warrant an own article, because he has plot relevance outside of his Akatsuki business (Sasuke stuff). However, right now he too is acting completely on Akatsuki motives, which is why he should stay here as well. The only thing that would change my mind is if this page got up to about 80-100 K size, then it might be an idea to break it down. Otherwise they should all be onthe Akatsuki page. <a href="../../../g/r/r/User%7EGrrblt_2f06.html" title="User:Grrblt">Grrblt</a> 11:20, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The plainest argument for giving Sasori an article is that the Akatsuki is currently 46 kb long, and Sasori's section is 15 kb of that. If we gave him his own article and then made his appearance here short like Orochimaru's it would bring our article length under the suggested norm. Additionally, since we could avoid anything less than fully notable about Sasori this way, which would aid us in our (or at least my) attempt to get this back to GA status. In effect, Sasori already has his own article length section on this page. Why not split it? Plus, Sam wants one, and Sasori is as much a major character as Zabuza. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 22:30, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Now that's what I'm saying finally somone finally gets it thank you Tjstrf you are the first to finally get what I'm talking about now hopefully all the other HATERS (I don't like to use slang on the computer)out there will finally understand too. Also why the heck do you think my name is Sam ov the blue sand a pun off of Sasori of the Red Sand has anyone noticed that I'm a Sasori freak yet? <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_ov_the_blue_sand_359d.html" title="User:Sam ov the blue sand">Sam ov the blue sand</a> 22:42, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Uhm, they aren't being haters, they're just saying he doesn't need his own article. Which is true. But, since giving him his own article will help the quality and style conformance of this article, not hurt anything, and he does have enough info for a mid-sized piece, why not? --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 22:47, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There has to be a line somewhere though. If Sasori, who will most likely be the least important of Akatsuki as his role in the series is over, is given his own article, all the other members will have to have their own articles as well. And then where will this article be? Itachi's the only one who would ever warrant his own article, and possibly the leader as well if his role is made large enough. <a href="../../../g/e/g/User%7EGeg_04e0.html" title="User:Geg">The Splendiferous Gegiford</a> 22:58, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Along with those reasons, Sasori's section could probably be trimmed down in the first place. <a href="../../../t/t/n/User%7ETTN_1fb9.html" title="User:TTN">Nemu</a> 23:01, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First off sorry to all the people I just called haters that inculdes you The Splendiferous Gegiford. Second Tjstrf is there going to be an artical or not if so who's going to make it hopefully not me. Thirdly The Splendiferous Gegiford not every akasuki member needs an artical only the ones with enough information. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_ov_the_blue_sand_359d.html" title="User:Sam ov the blue sand">Sam ov the blue sand</a> 23:32, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article is supposed to be on the organization to begin with, not the characters. They're only here as a holding pen until they have enough info to be split. I've made the trim, as well as started the article <a href="../../../s/a/s/Sasori_%28Naruto%29_ffd3.html" title="Sasori (Naruto)">Sasori (Naruto)</a>. (So have at it Sam, it does need some work).

<p>YES finally thank you Tjstrf you're like the only person here who get's what I'm saying I also understand what your saying and I respect that.

<dd>At the rate the series is going though, every member will have enough information to create an article. So you're saying that it's better for every member to have their own article rather than just the most important members? If you were going to create an article for one member to help save room in the article, the best choice would be Itachi has he has a larger role in the story than any of the other members. <a href="../../../g/e/g/User%7EGeg_04e0.html" title="User:Geg">The Splendiferous Gegiford</a> 16:14, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Split each character off into their own article once enough info about them has been gathered to write an article.</li>
<li>Don't, and instead simply trim the information about each character to an acceptable minimum, which will then be expanded as little as humanly possible. In other words, don't give in-depth coverage of the Akatsuki members as individuals.</li>
<li>Create an article called Akatsuki characters in Naruto or something similar to contain detailed summaries like those here.</li>

<dd>For me, the biggest issue is this: Akatsuki is a delisted GA. How can we fix this? I made a topic on it above, but got no replies. I'm willing to put in time to get citations (and have already spent a couple hours doing so). But how do we deal with the non-notable trivia? The thing that immediately comes to mind is splitting off the developed characters, turning their sections here into a summary of their Akatsuki activities. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 17:29, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
