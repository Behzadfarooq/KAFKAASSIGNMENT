<p>Recent scans and a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZmUMbUiBgU" class="external text" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZmUMbUiBgU" rel="nofollow">Japanese commercial</a> confirm that <a href="../../../i/k/e/Ike.html" title="Ike">Ike</a> (the main character of <a href="../../../p/a/t/Path_of_Radiance_db9c.html" title="Path of Radiance">Path of Radiance</a>) is in fact returning for <i>Goddess of Dawn</i>. His class is Hero, or Brave and he is equipped with Alondite, which is a different sword to the one used by the Black Knight (which was called Ettard in the Japanese version).

<ul>
<li><b>Ilyana</b></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>A stat sheet for Ilyana recently surfaced. It has her class listed as 'Thunder Mage.' She joins in Micaiah's chapter, being the second returning character to join after Sothe.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Tauroneo</b></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>A recent trailer shows the return of Tauroneo, still at Lv. 14. But, it also shows that Tauroneo has 38 HP, 10 HP less compared to Path of Radiance, when he had 48 HP. His class is Glory Dux.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Zihark</b></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The same trailer shows Zihark, apparently as a Swordmaster with 30 HP. A strange fact is that Myrmidons have 100 Hit on him, which is a very uncommon thing to happen with Swordmasters. The Myrmidon also had 42 Crit, which is likely obtained from the Killing Edge (30), the class bonus (5) and from a limit of 14 Skill (7). This, of course, does not factor in Zihark's Luck stat. However, he may become as good as in FE PoR considering that a unit can promote twice, as opposed to once.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Jill</b></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>A Japanese magazine recently released a new issue featuring an older Jill, clad with new armor and longer hair. Her class is listed as Dragon Knight (localized as Wyvern Rider), although she now fights initially with axes.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Tormod</b></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Recent scans confirmed the return of Tormod, Muarim's beorc friend. He appears as a 'Fire Sage.' He joins Micaiah's team alongside Muarim.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Muarim</b></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>An ally Beast Laguz was seen in a screenshot in a Japanese ad. Although it was not confirmed to be Muarim, the character bears striking similarities to him, and is referred to as Muarim by most fans. In the screenshot, he uses his fist to uppercut the enemy soldier while in human form, which may mean Laguz can fight outside of their animal forms in the game. Like Caineghis, he was also equipped with the "Fang" weapon. A recent scan confirmed that this character is indeed Muarim.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Marcia</b></li>
</ul>
<p>"Marcia, a Pegasus Knight and sister of Makalov, joins Elincia's part as one of the starting units.</p>

<li><b>Geoffrey and Lucia</b></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Geoffrey and Lucia are also slated to return and are in Elincia's story. Lucia returns as a swordmaster, and Geoffrey's class is "Glory Knight." A recent trailer <sup id="_ref-game_cm_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-game_cm" title="">[2]</a></sup> depicted an execution of Lucia at the hands of soldiers in white armor. She is saved by Ike soon after. Geoffrey appears in a second trailer, attacking an enemy in white armor with a new weapon called a Long Lance. Both Lucia and Geoffrey act as the 'main character' for one chapter each for Elincia's team.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Nephenee</b></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Nephenee appears in Elincia's part, with her and Brom acting as the 'main characters' for a chapter. She is a promoted Halberdier and her class can equip Long Lances too.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Brom</b></li>
</ul>

For an unexplained reason, Devdan's name was in reverse Japanese hirigana, effectively giving the equivalent spelling of Nadved. In Path of Radiance, Nadved is a picture Devdan drew and voiced in a support conversation with Largo. In the character relations chart it shows two Devdans one being Devdan and the other being Nadved. It showed them as being the same person with a question mark in it.</dd>
