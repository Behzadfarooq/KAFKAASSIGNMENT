<p>Thanks, I have been watching that. And thanks for running point on this; as you know, I get a little hot-headed this close to the problem. If you need me to do anything specific on this, just let me know.</p>
<p>I keep meaning to say this, but forget or procrastinate. On the J85 problem, I think the proposal to set it up like the CF6/TF39 page sounds good. I understand your point of view, but given your job, I assume that comes from a more direct knowledge than the rest of us have. However, all the verifiable sources we have seen tend to list the CJ610 as a civilian model of the non-afterburning J85, or at least a close variant. As they say, Wikipedia is based on verifiablity, not truth. If you can give us a source that backs up your position (one one the internet is easiest to check), then I'll support you 100% in keeping the pages separate. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 06:39, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. The source I'd refer to is print, not internet, and would be the tech manuals, but as I'm now a helo mech, not a FW mech, I don't currently have access to the pubs. I believe in 1)consensus and 2)picking one's battles carefully, and it's just not one that I want to work that hard on. Heavens knows, I have a hard enough time completing the projects I <i>do</i> take on here! <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 06:43, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>That's totally understandable. I'm learning to pick my battles too, slowly but surely! I just wanted to let you know where I stand on that. I've worked with you long enough to know you have a good reason for your stand on this. Funny thing is, I think our first contact wasn't good, but we did learn to get along, and I hope to appreciate each other's work, as we do ask for the other's help at times. I've had some conflicts with most of the regulars on WP:Air, but we were also able to get past that and learn to work together. It's too bad it doesn't work out that way with everyone. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 07:01, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's what's totally wierd about our "friend"...his initial edits to a couple of the WASP-related pages were excellent, apart from a lack citations. When I mentioned this requirement to him, he politely complied. But it was all down-hill from there.

<p>LOLOL.

<p>Please let me know why the link to <a href="http://eclipseaviationcritic.blogspot.com/" class="external free" title="http://eclipseaviationcritic.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://eclipseaviationcritic.blogspot.com/</a> was removed from the external links. The aviation geek community is quite small and I am squarely of the opinion that the growing dissent over the viability of this aircraft and company is worthy of discussion. Heck, the FAA is planning on the skies being darkened by their imminent success and we feel that it is worthy of discussion too. <b>If there is a flat out policy against linking to expert blogs?</b> Stan's page is actually pretty good. Also.. <a href="http://www.richardaboulafia.com" class="external text" title="http://www.richardaboulafia.com" rel="nofollow">Richard Aboulafia</a> of <a href="http://www.tealgroup.com" class="external text" title="http://www.tealgroup.com" rel="nofollow">The Teal Group</a> in DC concurs, never mind the legions of lesser aviation experts. Not to mention most, if not all serious 3000+ air taxi operators in the US don't see the end game with this airplane. If the marketing fluff is permitted in wikipedia, why not the enginner, pilot and commercial operator perspective as well?</p>
<p>Is it possible you'd prefer to see the debate in the article itself? I could write a nice paragraph that highlights the reasons why it is a great aircraft (timely, etc.) vs. the detractors who feel that their is essentially another Comet in our midst. Let me know either way. Concerned aviation geek. <a href="../../../a/i/r/User%7EAirwebster_cf36.html" title="User:Airwebster">airwebster</a> 20:22, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The issue isn't the criticalness (is that a word?) of the link, it's that generally blogs are not used as links (see <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> for more), mainly because of the very temporary nature of blogs on the web and because blogs usually are more akin to an editorial, representing opinion on issues, rather than the kind of hard facts that we'd prefer. I run a widely recognized blog myself, and though it's considered authoritative in many areas, generally even it isn't allowed here. Please remember, that this is an encyclopedia, not a forum, and perspectives as you put it, around here called POV, are generally not appropriate. This is not a place to discuss the merits of a company or a product, this is a place to describe the rather dry facts of the subject. So, rather than discussing the merits of an aircraft or how it's marketed, what we want to see is basic history, descriptions of the aircraft, noting any unique technologies, etc. So how does that flesh out into an actual article? Well, if there are shortcomings in the actual aircraft, and if these are documented by industry media in verifyable sources, then sure, that's great to include. But if what we're talking about is pundits' views on whether the aircraft will be successful, then no, that's not what an encyclopedia is all about. I hope that helps. For what it's worth, the Eclipse was in my hangar for a few days during the flight test program, so I got to see it up close and personal. Whether it's viable from a marketing point of view or not I don't really care that much. What I do care about is that the Eclipse represents some pretty interesting advances in aircraft construction and technology, and anything that advances technology like that is definitely worth covering in an encyclopedia. The fact the Cessan and Piper are playing in this market makes things interesting, but I really wouldn't put too much stock in the industry critics and pundits...remember the lesson of the Cessna Citation: It was very coldly received by the industry critic (remember names like "Nearjet" and "Slowtation"), but in the end that product line has done quite well. Anyway, I've gotten way off the subject of your question, so if there's anything I can help you with further, do drop me a line. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 01:37, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, I think I understand. Basically the problems with the aircraft, the investors, etc. is not pertinent to wikipedia. If you find that the worthiness of the matter gets to a deafening roar, I'd be happy to build a paragraph or two on the pro vs. con microjet folks. The key issue with this aircraft (and yes, I've gotten up close and personal with it too) is that it is a great innovation and design, etc. But there are simply too many folks seriously alarmed at the projections (did Citation predict hundreds or thousands of deliveries year one?) and other assumptions that seriously skew the financial viability of the company, let alone its practicality as light jet for air taxi folk. Perhaps a good gauge of how pertinent the debate is to run a Google search for Eclipse Aviation IPO - that will give some idea of the actual strength of the concern within the industry. You'll see the "critic" scores pretty high - and I think that is a function of folks who actually care and the public in general. In my opinion, the debate about its viability "is the story" with this aircraft, since if it succeeds, the naysayers will be documented thoroughly on the web. <a href="../../../a/i/r/User%7EAirwebster_cf36.html" title="User:Airwebster">airwebster</a> 01:35, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it's rather amusing that you're referring me to Wiki guidelines, though you flagrantly disregard consensus, guidelines and policy. You have a lot to offer, but you have to realize that this is a <i>community</i>, and that you need to work with others, especially the more experienced, established editors. Much of what happens here is based on respect for each other, and when you insist on <i>your</i> way over consensus, when you insist on forcing everyone else to view thumbs at the size that looks good to you on your monitor, that just shows a huge lack of respect and willingness to work with others. Please reconsider how you approach this project, and work <i>with</i> others, instead of taking an "in your face, I'll do what I want" attitude. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 23:09, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Alan, if you've checked the history on the C-12, you've seen it was quite a mess. Then, back in June. someone decided to create an article on the RC-12 Guardrail. It had hardly even been Wikified since, so I decided to merge it without discussion. Whatever you can do to the article will be fine. If I don't like what you've done, I'll just continuously revert, ignore any attempts to discuss it, claim you're not actiing like an adult, vandalize your home page, remove thumb sizings from all articles you edit, call your discussions assine, and accuse you of not working with me&#160;:)&#160;:) (To any admin reading this, this is called SARCASM.)</p>
<p>As to our friend, yeah, I'd try to talk to an admin. I really don't know what they can do tho, but it's worth a shot. At least it would bring some others in on this, and go to show we're not the ones causing trouble. I pray it works out well.

<p>The C-12 looks good. Considering that the late-model Super King Airs no longer use the "Super", we should definitley keep all the civilian types on the "King Air" page. But what about the C-6/U-21/T-44 types? They are all King Air 90s, but with 3 different series designators/numbers. Is there enough content to warrant a separate page for them, or do we keep them on the already-crowded King Air page? If we do move them, what would we call them? THe C-12 page is crowded enough, so I don't wnat to put them there either. Just wondering. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 00:01, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Howdy! Actually I believe the phrase "Olympic class" is meaningless without a link. Giving the reader the class of the ship is pointless without linking to the namesake ship. Which means it is especially pointless in this paragraph since the Olympic is linked in the very next sentence.</p>
<p>Also, I think in the context of the first sentence, the phrase "Olympic class" implies to a layman that there is something special about Olympic classed ships. It sounds like a superlative, rather than just a description. Like: Bruce Jenner is an Olympic class athelete.</p>
<p>If you think the phrase should stay, I would suggest moving the link for the Olympic from the second sentence to the phrase "Olympic class".</p>

<p>You mentioned on my talk page that you wanted to do a mass change from <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canard.html" title="Canard">canard</a> to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canard_%28aeronautics%29.html" title="Canard (aeronautics)">Canard (aeronautics)</a> for the appropriate articles. I wonder if you have explored using some of the tools used to do multiple changes. I don't know anything about them, but I saw that someone used it on one of my pages to correct a common typo regarding a name. You seem like a big enough contributor such that it may be worth it for you to learn it. The tool is called <a href="../../../a/w/b/Wikipedia%7EAWB_3de3.html" title="Wikipedia:AWB">Wikipedia:AWB</a>. <a href="../../../s/l/f/User%7ESlffea_5d57.html" title="User:Slffea">Slffea</a> 02:10, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know AWB, but maybe you can make a list of the specific articles which need to be changed, and have AWB only operate on those. It seems pretty clear which are aeronautics articles, so you could highlight and make them into a list. Also, it looks like most of the articles linked to canard are aeronautics related so maybe you could change every article there and then go back and revert by hand the few that shouldn't be changed. <a href="../../../s/l/f/User%7ESlffea_5d57.html" title="User:Slffea">Slffea</a> 07:05, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>I had also wondered about splitting the Supers off from the King Airs. If we do that, then we really won't need to split off the military 90s (C-6/T-44/U-21). If you want, we can put a split tag on the King AIr article for <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beechcraft_Super_King_Air_2c44.html" title="Beechcraft Super King Air">Beechcraft Super King Air</a>, and solicit some other opinions. I'm inclined to support the split, for the reasons you outilined, and because it would divide the current content just about in half. But if you just want to go ahead an split them, I'm game for that too. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 23:38, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

I was about to do the same as this editor uses multiple IP addresses (may not be intentional, just a circumstance related to his ISP). At any rate, he's been blanking images continuously since December on several articles. Reminds me of your ongoing battle on the P-51 image. This character doesn't give a reason and doesn't stay around long enough to respond to warnings although I know I've gotten to him in the act now that he had enough of a pattern that his activity can be traced. I posted a summary on the latest IP he used and the last two as well and put short notices in the Discussion pages he likes to hit so often. I don't see a problem going to another image, but his action leaves the article with nothing. I was going to contact you anyway due to your P-51 edit war to see if you had a suggestion.

<dd>Hi HJ, Going after an IP vandal can be hard. I know IPs can be blocked, but there is reluctance to do that because of the multiple user issue. Besides watchlisting and reverting, I'm not sure there's a lot that <i>can</i> be done. I'll invite Chris to share his thoughts on this. Which are the most frequently hit targets? I'll add them to my watch list, as I check in fairly often throughout the day. Chris: is there a way to check if multiple people use an IP, and if not, can it be blocked? Any other suggestions? <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 03:45, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Lately, these 3 are hit daily, but he's also been to the Aircraft Carrier article as well. As one editor noted, he doesn't seem to like any image with US carrier next to a Brit carrier...go figure on that one. If he had a better image, tthen that would be another story, but blanking over and over with no Edit Summary? That starts to cross the line into vandalism. Here's the three he blanks the most:</p>

<dd>Does this user change IP addresses or is it the same? If it is all the same IP address then it would be possible to do a little resarch and possible issue a long term block (there are some ip address with blocks up to 6 months). If multiple ip addresses are used, are they all in the same subnet? I.E. do they all start with the first 3 numbers and only the last number changes? If so, it is possible to medium duration range block that would deter them and maybye make them give up. I will look at the articles and semi protect them until I get some answers regarding this!

<dd>Usually I do as well, but there have been a few cases lately where I've dealt with some moves, and as a part of that, I've gone back and made direct links. For instance, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canard.html" title="Canard">Canard</a> recently was moved to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canard_%28aeronautics%29.html" title="Canard (aeronautics)">Canard (aeronautics)</a>, and instead of the original page just becomeing a redirect, it became a disambiguation page, so there were a whole bunch of links that needed to be changed there (the russbot helped with that one), because it's not advisable to link to a dab page when you can link directly to the actual article. There was also a <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canards.html" title="Canards">canards</a> redirect page, and I just went ahead and instead of leaving one level of redirects, since I was cleaning everything else up, I threw the few that went there into the mix, as well. I also worked some on making direct links after <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scaled_Composites_Voyager_f843.html" title="Scaled Composites Voyager">Scaled Composites Voyager</a> was renamed <a href="../../../r/u/t/Rutan_Voyager_23f7.html" title="Rutan Voyager">Rutan Voyager</a>, because I was asked to by an admin involved in the project.

<p>Travel in space is not a requirement for the Astronaut infbox. The infobox has been used for many people who trained but did not fly in space, see Acaba, McAuliffe, White, etc. <a href="../../../r/i/l/User%7ERillian_e63f.html" title="User:Rillian">Rillian</a> 02:42, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>NASA nor the FAA doesn't decide who gets called an astronaut, they decide who is a member of the NASA Astronaut Corps and who qualifies for FAA Astronaut Wings, respectively. Per <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astronaut.html" title="Astronaut">astronaut</a>, the English word "astronaut" is used for anyone trained to command, pilot, or serve as a crew member of a spacecraft. If Loria and Acaba qualify, so do Shane and Siebold. Regards, <a href="../../../r/i/l/User%7ERillian_e63f.html" title="User:Rillian">Rillian</a> 13:23, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Then you should make it abundantly clear in the article that they are astronauts in name only, and have not been rated as astronauts by the FAA nor have they flown in space. Our first responsibility is to provide clear, accurate information to our readers, and the casual reader will not be aware of such hair-splitting differences and assume that these two are actually licensed astronauts. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 15:38, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not sure what you mean by "licensed astronauts". I'm not aware of any difference between those who flew SS1 above 62 km and those who trained to do so but did not fly above 62 km in terms of licensing. Melville and Binnie were awarded the FAA Commercial Astronaut badge for flying in space, but their training was the same as Shane and Siebold's. Crossing the 62 KM limit makes a you a space traveler, training to pilot a spacecraft makes you an astronaut. <a href="../../../r/i/l/User%7ERillian_e63f.html" title="User:Rillian">Rillian</a> 17:23, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, you are correct in a way, there is no such thing in the U.S. as a "pilot's license". We have Pilots Certificates and associated ratings (but we don't have "badges"....I have no idea where you get the idea of a "badge", as there's no such thing). Melvill and Binnie didn't get a "licence" but a rating added to their pilots certificate for flying into space. The other two did not. It wasn't something "honorary", it was an actual rating, so they are rated as astronauts, while Shane and Siebold are not. You can train as a pilot all you want, but until you take the checkride, you don't get the rating or certificate. For the astronauts, you don't get that until you make the actual flight. Though I didn't say this earlier, by calling those who aren't really astronauts such a title, you denegrate the work and qualifications of those who have accomplished it. Let's bring this back to wikipedia-land, though: you have to have verifiability for statements, you don't get to make up stuff yourself. NASA certainly doesn't officially recognize these two as astronauts, so that leaves the only other body who can officially recognize them as astronauts, and that is the FAA. If you can point me to some other official, verifiable source that has designated these two as astronauts, then I'll gladly concur with you on this, but until you can, we should stick with wikipedia verifiabilty guidelines. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 21:22, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Sure, I'll clean up those links, but I might not get to it tonight. Being that it's Feb 14, my daughter and my wife are expecting some pretty exclusive attention from me this evening! If not tonight, I'll take care of it tomorrow. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 02:52, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Alan. Thank you for the cleanup on the 1900 article.</p>
<p>I found something interesting at FlightSafety's LaGuardia facility: a Raytheon poster showing Beechcraft's type history. I amended my C-12J data based on it, and I will go back and look if there is anything on the King Air or Queen Air, and other military types as well. It would be tough to cite to, and since it is mounted on the wall, I can't run off with a copy. But the information looks solid.</p>
<p>Have a little information on Skyway's 1900's, too. I am a Check Airman at SYX, and yesterday the company announced that it is getting out of the turboprop business. The company also flies a fleet of Fairchild Dornier 328JETs, and it is moving to a one-type fleet, probably by the end of '07. We are terminating our Essential Air Service contracts by the end of summer, and that was the rationale for continuing to fly the 1900. So for us, soon the 1900 will be a thing of the past. I will miss the plane.</p>
<p>For me personally, I just got the call from Midwest to start class next month, so I am moving from "little brother" to "big brother". Don't know whether I will be working on the 717 or MD-80 yet, tho.</p>

<p>Hi, Alan. Got your note.</p>
<p>The changes actually came from me. I was certain that I was signed in when I made the changes to the C-12J section; perhaps I was mistaken.</p>
<p>Frankly, I am not sure how to source this. I was at FlightSafety LaGuardia this week, and on the wall there was a large framed Raytheon poster describing all of the Beech aircraft from the Model 17 Staggerwing on. It described the C-12J variant of the 1900C, and the C-12J2 variant of the 1900D -- which was news to me.</p>
<p>Since your DoD sources don't confirm this, is it possible that the designation never took? I see that the Army Aviation site (not a government site but a commercial one), describes "Beechcraft 1900D" in Army colors (one of the pics is actually of a -C, the other of a -D). I have googled C-12J2 and come up blank.</p>
<p>Thoughts? Best, Mike. Mikepurves 06:43, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanx for formatting the C-130J-30 loss link. I am really good on content, but less facile when it comes to some of the editing architecture.</p>
<p>BTW, does Wikipedia have a template for national military insignias? We have about a half dozen in use in the C-130 loss list, but I haven't been able to figure out how to generate the appropriate roundels for the more off-beat air forces...</p>

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>About the fact that from your opinion my accounting entries look more like a manual. It does, I agree, all my entries are about specific points in basic accounting or pure accounting definitions one can find only in an accounting manual. Whatsoever, I focus on what's the most difficult to understand for someone who starts learning accounting, unless someone completes my work (which are examples I've made up myself because I'm French speaker and my French understanding of accounting inspires me in making up English examples...).</p>
<p>However, I believe these accounting entries can be extended to softwares and ERP, that's why there is a link toward double entry accounting and from this page you can go to databases that are related to accounting. That's one point.</p>
<p>The second point is about you saying Wikipedia is not a manual as such. When one looks at computer languages here on this site, he can learn the basic such as printing "hello world" on the screen, but there are some stuffs that go further. I position myself there.</p>
<p>To be honest, it took me a few days to make up this arguments. I understand the idea of an encyclopedia goes beyond what manuals in any subject have to offer.</p>
<p>So I have no choice but to leave the final to you. As for me, accounting is the only knowledge I can write about in a way that is profitable (I keep learning...) and examples (my entries are not only examples...) are from my mind. You won't find these words anywhere else someone can prove he published it before I publish here on this site or challenge me about any of my entries on this site.</p>
<p>To conclude, my goal is not to publish all the accounting entries one can imagine of, just a few, easy to update from my experience in learning...</p>
<p>So the decision is on your side, I hope you will share your view quickly with someone else about this...</p>
<p>My respect for the being of this site.</p>

<p>Hello Akradecki! I quite agree with your recent revert on the article, which makes me again think that the best way to proceed, at least for the intro, is too keep to factual description of the process, without entering rhetorics and politico-ideological debates. I wonder what you thought about the draft I submitted, of if you saw any problems in it. We should really keep debates and commentaries, such as calling the term "torture by proxy", in a subsection (which could be divised into "supporters" and "critics"). However, I really think, although it is sometimes difficult to do, that first dividing facts &amp; commentaries is a very important thing to do here, and that, at the end, the importance of facts largely precede commentaries (although clearly justifications of ER as well as critics are also historical facts which must be inserted, but maybe not in the intro).

<p>Thanks for helping out on the <a href="../../../t/-/6/T-6_Texan_II_d180.html" title="T-6 Texan II">T-6 Texan II</a> merge. I found the CT-156 page from a link on the Canadian Forces Air Commamnd navbox. It's amazing the orphaned pages that are Wiki. I did alot of work on the T-6 II several weeks ago, and had no clue the CT-156 page even existed! Sounds a lot like the RC-12 situation we ran into a few weeks back. Maybe we should suggest something on WP:AIR to find orphaned and neglected articles. I'm not sure the best way to find them, but we could use a list somewhere of the ones that are found, so the project members can know where they are, and give them some attention.</p>
<p>On another subject, I've tagged the Air FOrce One article for a split to make a Boeing VC-15 page for the aircraft themselves. the Navy one and Marine one pages both deal with the name and its usage only, with coverage of the aircraft on other pages. (Marine Onne does cover the helicopters in some detail, but not AF1 on the VC-25.) I have a test page for the VC-25 up at <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_Test_Article_3_96da.html" title="User:BillCJ/Test Article 3">User:BillCJ/Test Article 3</a>, but not for the AF1 as yet. I plan to keep the history of all the planes as they are for now on AF1, but take out those details relating specifically to the VC-25s, like the Infobox, specs, etc.</p>
<p>On the test page, the Intro needs alot of work, as right now its basically the Intro from the AF1 stuck under the Intro from the <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_C-32_4b51.html" title="Boeing C-32">Boeing C-32</a>. I don't foresee any major ojections to the split, but so far have gotten no comments either way.

<p>Sigh. I don't really have the time or inclination to get involved in administrator action, but I'm definately frustrated by this too. Including the infobox isn't consistent with the discussion on <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astronaut.html" title="Astronaut">Astronaut</a> like Rillian claims, but it is consistent with the Astronaut article itself, as Rillian has it worded currently. Personally, I've never thought of people who haven't flown in space and aren't trained by a government space flight program to be astronauts, and I don't think most people do either, but I can't find a good source to back that up. It just seems to be common sense that this guy isn't an astronaut – but Rillian can be tough to convince. My editing philosophy is usually to cede disputes about things that aren't terribly important, and put my time to use on other articles. — <a href="../../../s/w/p/User%7ESwpb_9c6b.html" title="User:Swpb">Swpb</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/w/p/User_talk%7ESwpb_ffe5.html" title="User talk:Swpb">talk</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swpb_aa66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swpb">contribs</a></sup> 04:04, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're taking his comment out of context. He also said, "An astronaut is a space-traveler. (So is a cosmonaut). Unless there is some Astronauts Union that claims some legal status that one can't be called "astronaut" unless one is a professional astronaut." In context, he was talking about professional verses passengers in terms of who gets called an astronaut. Doug Shane didn't even fly SS1! He's a great test pilot and a classy, honorable man.

<p>Hi Mr. Akradecki, Thanks for your help on all the aircraft projects to which I have submitted my pittance of knowledge. BTW, I wonder if you could take a look at the Avro <a href="../../../c/f/-/CF-105_Arrow_983c.html" title="CF-105 Arrow">CF-105 Arrow</a> discussion page. It seems to have degraded into a discussion over the relative merits of the decision to cancel the Arrow. However, there is an editor that has been compelled to take the discussion into a bizarre turn. He actually backs up his own opinion with comments from an unknown IP address that can be traced back to... him? I don't need anyone to intercede except for maybe an administrator but take a look and give me your opinion. <a href="../../../b/z/u/User%7EBzuk_3248.html" title="User:Bzuk">Bzuk</a> 04:39 4 March 2007 (UTC).</p>

<dd>Alan, that you for your note. Yes, I am extremely reluctant to actually quote from my own books. The one article where that has been an issue on Wikipedia is the <a href="../../../a/v/r/Avrocar_%28aircraft%29.html" title="Avrocar (aircraft)">Avrocar (aircraft)</a> article where there are very few authoritatitive references sources on an obsure topic. I have done my best to support the article from other sources but since the majority of the original edit came from another editor, it was difficult at times not to refer to the material that was found in my books. BTW, thanks for your support in the awkward situation I have encountered in the Avro <a href="../../../c/f/-/CF-105_8702.html" title="CF-105">CF-105</a> article. <a href="../../../b/z/u/User%7EBzuk_3248.html" title="User:Bzuk">Bzuk</a> 10:38 4 March 2007 (UTC).</dd>

<p>Hi Alan:</p>
<p>If a rewrite of the CF 105 article is done,the thesis <a href="http://scaa.usask.ca/gallery/arrow/thesis/thesis9.htm" class="external free" title="http://scaa.usask.ca/gallery/arrow/thesis/thesis9.htm" rel="nofollow">http://scaa.usask.ca/gallery/arrow/thesis/thesis9.htm</a></p>
<p>Gives original sourcing,&amp; is "accurate"as a guide.</p>
<p>If we do not rewrite,I would suggest that we cut the "Political &amp; Black Friday" sections right out of the Article. These two sections are embarrassing to wikipedia. Mr. Campania , as a source, is "special" at best.</p>
<p>Heck, Arthur Haileys' "in High Places" Novel, fictionalizing the Arrow cancellation, is a 'published work,' too. }:-')</p>

He has been inserting a lot of info lately, primarily from a book by Hobson (what he inserted that you thought was vandalism) on US activities in the war.</p>
<p>His major problem is that he seems to have no interest in learning how to use Wiki's proceedures to cite his additions properly. I do believe he has registered (I forget what name), but has gone back to his IP for the last few days. Other editors have posted links on how to cite on his IP userpage, but he has eitehr not bothered to read them, or otherwise ignored them.

<p>Two thoughts - there were two Sublette families bumping around the USAF when my Dad was in - we ran into them, usually responding at the base pharmacy for "prescriptions for Sublette"! The last time I remember encountering them was circa 1971-72 at the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norton_Air_Force_Base_ec73.html" title="Norton Air Force Base">Norton Air Force Base</a> dispensary in San Bernardino, California... That may be the Sublette you encountered...</p>
<p>Also - in regard to roundels - the Hercules has been used in both civil and military operation - I am using flagicons for the civilian registered aircraft, and roundels for the military.</p>

<p>There seems to have some confusion regarding the EC-18B ARIA. It was origianlly part of the "ARIA" page, but most of the page dealt with the EC-135N/E aircraft used for that mission.

Some changed the EC-18 link today to <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_707.html" title="Boeing 707">Boeing 707</a>. Since there is no text in the EC-135 page describing the EC-18, I think maybe we should find a blurb on it (and the C-18 too), and put thatg in the C-137 article for now, with the C-18/EC-18 links redirecting there.

I think Kern Co.'s gorgeous ship is a 205...will double check. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 13:47, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</s> Never mind...just found out that it's an old H model. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 13:49, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>By civilian, I mean non-military. I think we could include former military models in civilian service in the article, at least a brief text mention, at least enough to justify a few pretty pics. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 16:38, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sounds good. Helitack 408 was, afterall, rebuilt to 205 standards. Also, you might want to consider including the B210 in the article. If you're not familiar with it, it's the current "production" civilian version. Essentially, Bell is taking old H-model airframes, completely disassemblying them and rebuilding them as "new" FAA-certificated aircraft. The main difference between the 205 and 210 is that the 210 uses the 212 rotor system. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 17:22, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
