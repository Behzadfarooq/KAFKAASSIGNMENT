<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/k/r/Akron_neighborhoods.html" title="Edit section: Chapel Hill">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Chapel Hill</span></h2>
<p>Location: North / East Side</p>
<p>Chapel Hill is one of Akron’s two large commercial districts. Located in Northeast Akron it borders <a href="../../../c/u/y/Cuyahoga_Falls%2C_Ohio_5a80.html" title="Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio">Cuyahoga Falls</a> to the north and <a href="../../../t/a/l/Tallmadge%2C_Ohio_0346.html" title="Tallmadge, Ohio">Tallmadge</a> to the east. The area is mostly commercial north of Tallmadge Avenue, with a commercial and retail mix on Tallmadge Avenue. Single and multi-family residential use predominates south of Tallmadge Avenue. There is major retail development along Home Avenue, Howe Road, and Brittain Road, with the retail area anchored by the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chapel_Hill_Mall_%28Akron%2C_Ohio%29_ea74.html" title="Chapel Hill Mall (Akron, Ohio)">Chapel Hill Mall</a> at the northeast corner.</p>
<p>Chapel Hill is accessible off <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_Route_8_%28Ohio%29_4a99.html" title="State Route 8 (Ohio)">State Route 8</a> via two interchanges. Chapel Hill is one of Akron’s smaller residential neighborhoods, with only 2.5% of its population and 3% of households. Chapel Hill lost a higher percentage of its population than the City during the 1990s. Although average household income is lower than in the City as a whole, there is also a lower percentage of persons in poverty. 61% of Chapel Hill residents are under 45 years of age. Chapel Hill also has a higher proportion of elderly residents than the City.</p>
<p>According to The City of Akron’s statistics there are 5,466 people living in 2,934 households. Chapel Hill is 79% Caucasian. The average household income (1999) is $33,930, about seven thousand lower than the city average.</p>
<p><a name="Downtown" id="Downtown"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/k/r/Akron_neighborhoods.html" title="Edit section: Downtown">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Downtown</span></h2>
<p>Financial and legal offices, hotel, hospital, government and other civic buildings predominate in Summit County’s county seat. Commercial uses and light industry are the primary land uses south of Cedar Street, in Opportunity Park and along Wolf Ledges. The historic Ohio and Erie Canal provides business, recreational, and unique residential location opportunities. Downtown features adaptive re-use of historic structures such as the B.F. Goodrich plant (Canal Place on South Main Street), combined with modern additions. These include the Canal Park baseball stadium, Knight Convention Center, Inventors’ Hall of Fame and new library. Residential redevelopment includes conversion of the YMCA into modern apartments and construction of new condominiums at the Landings at Canal Park.</p>
<p>Downtown has the lowest percentage of Under 20s in the City, and higher percentages than the City of all adult age groups. The dominant age group is 20-44 years.</p>
<p>Downtown is about equally divided between Whites and African-Americans. Lower household incomes can be partially explained by a high percentage of persons living alone, and the high number of income restricted housing units. The number of persons in poverty declined, though by a lower percentage than the City.</p>
<p>The percentage of persons with no high school diploma is almost double that of the City. A little more than a third of Downtown residents have some college or higher education, against almost half of City residents.</p>
<p>The occupational profile of Downtown residents differs from the City in having a substantially lower percentage of persons in Management and the Professions and a higher percentage of Service occupations.</p>
<p>Downtown is most notable for the high incidence of non-family households, especially persons living alone.</p>
<p>Downtown has some of the oldest, as well as some of the newest, housing in the City. The mix of housing is quite similar in age to that of the City. Downtown has one of the lowest owner occupancy rates in the City, but newer construction spurred one of the largest increases in owner-occupancy of any neighborhood from 1990-2000. The value of Downtown owner-occupied units is 78% of those in the City.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/k/r/Akron_neighborhoods.html" title="Edit section: East Akron">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">East Akron</span></h2>
<p>Location: East Side</p>
<p>Industrial / commercial land uses east of Kelly Avenue; with single-family housing predominating west of Kelly Avenue, and multi-family housing in the south. If South Arlington Street is East Akron’s “Main Street”, the 11,375 square foot East Akron Community House (E.A.C.H.) is “Town Hall”. Located south of I-76 and east of I-77, the neighborhood has good highway access.</p>
<p>East Akron is younger than Akron, with over 70% of the population under 45.</p>
<p>East Akron is an ethnically diverse neighborhood about equally divided between African-Americans and Whites. Household income just kept pace with inflation from 1990 – 2000. The number of persons in poverty declined, though by a lower percentage than the City.</p>
<p>About three-quarters of East Akronites have either a high school diploma or some college, but the percentages of those with bachelor’s and graduate/professional degrees trail the City.</p>
<p>In most occupational categories, East Akron is similar to the rest of the City, except there are fewer people in Management and Professional positions and more in Production, Transportation, and Material Moving.</p>
<p>Persons Living Alone is the largest category of households. About half of East Akron households have children under 18. The percentage of Married households, with or without children, is smaller than Other Family households.</p>
<p>The age of housing units in East Akron is similar to that in the rest of Akron, with a slightly lower percentage of units built from 1980 – 2000 and a slightly higher percentage of units built before 1940. There are fewer total housing units in East Akron in 2000 than 1990, plus a large drop in renter-occupied units. The value of the average owner-occupied housing unit is 61% of that of the City. Owner-occupied housing appreciated at a slightly lower rate during the 1990s.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/k/r/Akron_neighborhoods.html" title="Edit section: Elizabeth Park Valley">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Elizabeth Park Valley</span></h2>
<p>Location: North / West Side</p>
<p>Elizabeth Park Valley was developed around the old Ohio &amp; Erie Canal in the mid-1800s. The area is located within a walking distance of Akron’s downtown. Many people have old canal locks in their back yards. The park, a part of the Cascade Locks Historic District, is the site of the restored Mustill House &amp; Store, which served as a general store to canal users from the 1820s till the end of the 19th century. The Towpath Trail, which will one day stretch from Lake Erie to New Philadelphia, brings thousands of hikers and bikers to the area each year.</p>
<p>According to The City of Akron’s statistics there are 4,166 people living in 1,838 households. The average household income (1999) is $28,430.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/k/r/Akron_neighborhoods.html" title="Edit section: Ellet">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ellet</span></h2>
<p>Location: East Side</p>
<p>Ellet is physically separated from the other neighborhoods by a Highway <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstate_76_%28east%29.html" title="Interstate 76 (east)">Interstate 76</a>, a river, and an airport.</p>
<p>Ellet petitioned the City of Akron for annexation in 1929. In the 1990s when Akron’s total population was reduced by over three percent, Ellet started booming. In fact, one in twelve houses in Ellet were built after <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>. Situated at the far eastern edge of Akron, it borders <a href="../../../m/o/g/Mogadore%2C_Ohio_e2f9.html" title="Mogadore, Ohio">Mogadore</a> to the east and <a href="../../../s/p/r/Springfield_Township_915f.html" title="Springfield Township">Springfield Township</a> to the south.</p>
<p>Ellet includes many of Akron’s bigger attractions including the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Akron_1e60.html" title="University of Akron">University of Akron’s</a> Rubber Bowl, a former city owned property that was sold to the University for only a penny. Next door is Derby Downs home of the annual All-American Soap Box Derby. The Goodyear Airdock, which used to house construction projects for <a href="../../../g/o/o/Goodyear.html" title="Goodyear">Goodyear’s</a> new blimp designs, is also nearby. Today it is owned by <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lockheed_Martin_7877.html" title="Lockheed Martin">Lockheed Martin</a>, which runs a sizeable operation in Ellet. The Akron Fulton airport is also nearby. Fulton is municipally owned. Annual flights to and from the airport have increased from 24,000 in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a> to 35,000 in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>.</p>
<p>The neighborhood includes numerous single family households. Commercial activity is scattered mostly on East Market Street, part of Ohio Route 18 and Eastgate Plaza on Canton Road (<a href="../../../s/t/a/State_Route_91_%28Ohio%29_0137.html" title="State Route 91 (Ohio)">State Route 91</a>). In recent years, new retail redevelopment has also taken place south of Hyre Park.</p>
<p>According to The City of Akron’s statistics there are 18,132 people living in 7,892 households. Ellet is 94% Caucasian. The average household income (1999) is 40,864, representative of the city average.</p>
<p><a name="Fairlawn_Heights" id="Fairlawn_Heights"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/k/r/Akron_neighborhoods.html" title="Edit section: Fairlawn Heights">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fairlawn Heights</span></h2>
<p>Location: West Side</p>
<p>Situated in Northwest Akron, bordered by Fairlawn, with easy access to I-77, Fairlawn Heights was designed to be a single-family neighborhood featuring elegant homes on large lots in a country-like setting. Retail, office, and some apartment development along West Market Street are the sole exception.</p>
<p>Fairlawn Heights’ age profile is older than that of the City. Nearly half of the population is 45 and over.</p>
<p>Fairlawn Heights is a small neighborhood, with 1.4% of Akron’s population. Fairlawn Heights’ population is 90% white, 5% African-American, and 5% Asian. With more than twice the City’s average household income, Fairlawn Heights is Akron’s most affluent neighborhood. However, while real income of households grew in Akron during the 1990s, it fell nearly 40% in Fairlawn Heights.</p>
<p>The education level of Fairlawn Heights residents is considerably higher than the residents of the City. Over half of adults have bachelor’s or graduate degrees.</p>
<p>Approximately half of Fairlawn Heights residents are in Management or Professional occupations. Technical, Sales, and Office occupations are the next largest group, followed by small percentages of residents in other occupational groups.</p>
<p>Fairlawn Heights has a high percentage (over 60%) of Married households. Children in Fairlawn Heights who are under 18 are eight times as likely to live in Married households as in Other Family households. Fairlawn Heights is the only neighborhood in Akron where the number of households composed of persons living alone is smaller than the number of Married households.</p>
<p>The 1960s were a peak building period for Fairlawn Heights. Four out of five housing units were built from 1940 – 1980. A limited amount of housing continues to be built. More than four out of five housing units are owner-occupied. This is the highest owner-occupancy rate in the City. Fairlawn Heights owner-occupied housing has the highest average value in the City. With the average value of owner-occupied homes already exceeding $200,000, it appreciated less than any neighborhood in the City during the 1990s.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/k/r/Akron_neighborhoods.html" title="Edit section: Firestone Park">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Firestone Park</span></h2>
<p>Location: South / East Side</p>
<p><a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvey_Firestone_a7ac.html" title="Harvey Firestone">Harvey Firestone</a> embarked on creating a neighborhood with tree-lined boulevards curved around a central park. He saw families of different income levels living together in diverse styles of homes. He saw churches, schools and stores within walking distance. When Seiberling started on his ambitious housing initiatives in Goodyear Heights, Harvey Firestone did not want to be outdone. Like Seiberling, Harvey Firestone hired his estate landscape architect, Alling S. DeForest, to design the layout for Firestone Park. Akron officials have pushed the limits of the area beyond its original borders. City publications draw the park as far south as Firestone Country Club, annexed from Coventry Township in 1985. Firestone Park is located in south Akron, bordering Coventry Twp. Firestone has easy access to two freeways, <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstate_77.html" title="Interstate 77">Interstate 77</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstate_277_%28Ohio%29_aea5.html" title="Interstate 277 (Ohio)">Interstate 277</a> / <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Highway_224_c2e8.html" title="U.S. Highway 224">U.S. Highway 224</a>. The 2000 U.S. census can explain the attraction objectively. It paints a portrait of an educated working-class population with good incomes and home values. Firestone Park, a public park shaped like the original Firestone shield emblem, is at the heart of the community. It is surrounded by churches, a school, a community center, a new library, and a small business district.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/k/r/Akron_neighborhoods.html" title="Edit section: Goodyear Heights">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Goodyear Heights</span></h2>
<p>Location: East Side</p>
<p>As early as 1910 Frank A. Seiberling, founder and then president of Goodyear Tire and Rubber, realized how detrimental the housing shortage was to his workers and his company. Even though labor was abundant, Seiberling believed that the transient nature of the work force cost the company a great deal. Training wasn’t cheap, and the cost of constantly retraining new employees was proving to be unmanageable. To solve this problem Seiberling proposed purchasing a large parcel of farm land half a mile from the Goodyear factories. The board was not convinced. The company felt that it was too risky to get involved in the intimate affairs of their employees. However, Seiberling was so committed to the project that he bought the land himself. Seiberling choose a rural plot of farmland just northeast of Goodyear’s main plant.</p>
<p>Seiberling hired his personal landscape architect to spearhead the project. He chose sweeping streets over a grid infrastructure and included provision for all modern conveniences like gas, electricity, and telephones. The main thoroughfares were also designed to eventually carry street cars. One of the key differences between Goodyear Heights and Firestone Park was the hospitality extended to non employees for the purchase of a home. Though Goodyear opened the door of purchasing a home to all Akron residents, the 25 % increase in selling price and the lack of company sponsored financing made it very unlikely that non Goodyear employees would buy. Goodyear Heights Realty had an explicit policy against selling to African Americans. Goodyear Heights borders <a href="../../../t/a/l/Tallmadge%2C_Ohio_0346.html" title="Tallmadge, Ohio">Tallmadge</a> to the east and has access to <a href="../../../i/-/7/I-76_%28east%29.html" title="I-76 (east)">I-76</a>. Goodyear Heights remains an overwhelmingly single-family residential community. There is neighborhood-level retail development at Six Corners. Eastwood Avenue near Darrow borders suburban style strip shopping centers. The Goodyear Heights Metropolitan Park provides a wide range of recreational activities to people throughout the area. Though the majority of the housing was constructed between 1940 and 1980, the city has been buying up land to build new developments, the latest one being built along Honodle.</p>
<p>According to The City of Akron’s statistics there are 20,556 people living in 8,817 households. The average household income (1999) is $42,746, slightly higher than the city average.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/k/r/Akron_neighborhoods.html" title="Edit section: Highland Square">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Highland Square</span></h2>
<p>Location: West Side</p>
<p>Highland Square is known as one of the more eclectic areas of Akron. It is a pleasant residential area where famous residents such as <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_S._Knight_39ce.html" title="John S. Knight">John S. Knight</a>, Senator <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Dick_ac12.html" title="Charles Dick">Charles Dick</a>, presidential candidate <a href="../../../w/e/n/Wendell_Willkie_3ec8.html" title="Wendell Willkie">Wendell Willkie</a>, industrialist Paul Litchfield, and <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholics_Anonymous_e1b5.html" title="Alcoholics Anonymous">Alcoholics Anonymous</a> founder Dr. <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Smith_%28doctor%29_23fa.html" title="Bob Smith (doctor)">Robert Smith</a> have lived.</p>
<p>Highland Square, with its multi-story apartments, is more densely populated than the rest of Akron, which is vastly single unit homes. There are many apartments clearly visible when driving through the neighborhood’s major thoroughfare, West Market Street. Many of the older apartment buildings on North Portage Path bear the names of the builders' daughters. Highland Square is strongly progressive; <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kerry_b44b.html" title="John Kerry">John Kerry</a>’s Summit County Headquarters was located in a Highland Square storefront during the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._presidential_election%2C_2004_3ccd.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 2004">2004 Presidential Election</a>. Many homosexuals have made their home here and many businesses are either gay owned or <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_friendly.html" title="Gay friendly">gay friendly</a>. The commercial part of Highland Square is anchored by the historic Highland Theatre. The <a href="http://www.highlandsquare.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.highlandsquare.org/" rel="nofollow">Highland Square Development Association</a> works to maintain the character and atmosphere of the area. Every summer the association promotes and operates Art in the Square, a festival featuring local artists and musicians.</p>
<p>The region's oldest feature is the Portage Path, which passes along the street of that name. For decades the statue of an Indian has watched over this famous pathway where <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States_7838.html" title="Native Americans in the United States">Native Americans</a> carried their canoes between the <a href="../../../c/u/y/Cuyahoga_River_2694.html" title="Cuyahoga River">Cuyahoga</a> and <a href="../../../t/u/s/Tuscarawas_River_24eb.html" title="Tuscarawas River">Tuscarawas Rivers</a>. The Portage Path was part of the effective western boundary of the white and Native American lands from 1785 to 1805. When first erected by Gus Kasch, an area real estate developer, the Indian statue stood along the curb on West Market Street. The refurbished statue now stands on a landscaped site on the corner of Portage Path and West Market Street.</p>
<p>According to The City of Akron’s statistics there are 12,561 people living in 6,264 households. The average household income (1999) is $42,958, slightly higher than the city average.</p>

<p>Location: South / West Side</p>
<p>Following the trolley right-of-way between southwest Akron and Barberton, Kenmore developed rapidly between 1910 and 1920 as a new residential area. It was incorporated as a self sufficient city supporting its own doctors, lawyers, and churches. Kenmore Boulevard served as the retail and commercial center. In 1929, residents of then City of Kenmore asked to be annexed by the City of Akron. Kenmore is located in the southwest region of Akron and is bisected by <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstate_277_%28Ohio%29_aea5.html" title="Interstate 277 (Ohio)">Interstate 277</a> and <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Highway_224_c2e8.html" title="U.S. Highway 224">U.S. Highway 224</a>.</p>
<p>Kenmore land use is primarily single-family residential, with the following exceptions: East Avenue, which has mixed residential and retail uses; Manchester Road features retail uses; and the area between Wilbeth Roadand Waterloo Road is mostly industrial-commercial. Summit Lake and Margaret Park, Nesmith Lake and Park, Prentiss Park, Mud Run Golf Course and Kenmore Community Center on Kenmore Boulevard offer recreational opportunities.</p>
<p>Kenmore’s dominant age group is persons from 20 - 44. The age distribution of Kenmore residents is very similar to that of the City.</p>
<p>According to The City of Akron’s statistics there are 18,239 people living in 7,998 households. Kenmore’s population is over 90% White. Average household income in Kenmore ($39,776 [1999])is similar to the City as a whole, as was the neighborhood’s 13.9% increase in average household income during the 1990s. During the 1990s, Kenmore experienced a small rise in the percentage of persons in poverty.</p>
<p>Kenmore’s over-25 population has higher percentages of high school graduates and lower percentages of persons with college and graduate school degrees than Akron.</p>
<p>Fifty-eight percent of employed persons 16 and over are in Technical, Sales and Office or Production, Transportation, and Material Moving occupations. The percentage of persons in Management or Professional Occupations is lower than the City.</p>
<p>Married couples head forty-six percent of Kenmore households, more than Akron. Thirty-nine percent of Kenmore households (26% married; 13% single-parent) have their own children under 18 living with them. Kenmore has a slightly lower percentage of Nonfamily households than the City.</p>
<p>The age profile of Kenmore housing is similar to, but slightly older than Akron housing as a whole. The percentage of owner-occupied housing is higher than the City as a whole. There were small decreases in owner-occupied and increases in renter-occupied housing units in the 1990s, unlike the City’s small increases in owner-occupied units and decreases in renter-occupied units. Kenmore’s owner-occupied housing appreciated by 26.8% in the 1990s. The average value of Kenmore’s owner-occupied housing is 75% of the average value of owner-occupied housing in Akron.</p>

<p>Location: West Side</p>
<p>The Lane – Wooster neighborhood is located just west of downtown Akron. In the early 20th century, the area became home to African-American families who were moving to Akron from the south. The Akron Zoo, which has recently been remodelled, is located in the Lane Wooster area. Miller South School for the Visual and Performing Arts, draws children from all parts of Summit County. It serves children from 4th grade to 8th grade. Wooster Avenue was recently renamed <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vernon_Odom_f44b.html" title="Vernon Odom">Vernon Odom</a> Boulevard, a nod to the neighborhood’s African American heritage. The area is the largest black neighborhood in Akron, with 87% of residents identifying themselves as such.</p>
<p>During the 1970s, the Innerbelt was built and some 3,000 families were displaced. It continues to be a disputed call if the Innerbelt has benefited the inner city; proponents have said it is an essential throughway for Akron’s impending growth, while dissenters contend that it has caused Akron to lose some of its cohesiveness.</p>
<p>Lane Wooster is accessible from three highways, The Martin Luther King Jr. Freeway <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_Route_59_%28Ohio%29_01e7.html" title="State Route 59 (Ohio)">State Route 59</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstate_76_%28east%29.html" title="Interstate 76 (east)">Interstate 76</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstate_77.html" title="Interstate 77">Interstate 77</a>.

<p>Location: West Side</p>
<p>This neighborhood in northwest Akron (locally known simply as "The Valley") provides a range of housing sizes, styles and price points. Single-family housing is mixed with large-scale condominium and apartment development. Retail and office development around the intersection of Portage Path and Merriman Road offers restaurant, live theater, convenience and niche shopping opportunities. Much of the Cuyahoga River valley is parkland, offering significant recreational opportunities.</p>
<p>Merriman Valley residents are slightly older than the City as a whole, with more people in the 20 – 44 range and fewer under 20. However, the distribution of the 45+ population is quite similar to the City.</p>
<p>The Merriman Valley experienced the largest percentage increases in population and number of households in the City. Merriman Valley continued to be among Akron’s higher income areas, with 42% higher average household income than the City. Fewer than 3% of the population was in poverty.</p>
<p>The Merriman Valley experienced the largest percentage increases in population and number of households in the City. Merriman Valley continued to be among Akron’s higher income areas, with 42% higher average household income than the City. Fewer than 3% of the population was in poverty.</p>
<p>Residents of Merriman Valley are better educated than residents of the City. There is a lower percentage of persons with a high school diploma or less and higher percentages of persons with Bachelor’s and Graduate degrees.</p>
<p>Over 60% of Merriman residents have Management, Professional, or Technical, Sales, and Office Professions.</p>
<p>The percentage of Merriman non-family households is higher than in the City as a whole; 42% of Merriman households are persons living alone. Thirty-two percent of households are married or single parent households with children under 18.</p>
<p>Merriman housing is much newer than that of Akron, with nearly 60% of housing units built since 1980, and fewer than four percent built prior to 1940. The average value of owner-occupied Merriman Valley housing is 73% higher than the average value of City owner-occupied housing. Merriman Valley average owner-occupied housing values were flat from 1990–2000, while City housing values rose. The large number of apartment units is reflected by the lower percentage of owner-occupied housing.</p>

<p>Location: East Side</p>
<p>The village of Middlebury on the Little Cuyahoga River was the first settlement in what is now Akron. Middlebury is located immediately east of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Akron_1e60.html" title="University of Akron">University of Akron</a>. Middlebury is home to Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company’s world headquarters and Summa Hospital. Middlebury is accessible by both <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interstate_76_%28east%29.html" title="Interstate 76 (east)">Interstate 76</a> to the south, and <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_Route_8_%28Ohio%29_4a99.html" title="State Route 8 (Ohio)">State Route 8</a> to the east. Middlebury is the most diversified out of the Akron neighborhoods, with almost six percent of ethnic backgrounds being neither African American nor Caucasian. In the 2000 Census, average household income was 74% of average household income in Akron. Even though household income lagged the City, there was a large percentage drop in persons in poverty and an almost equally large rise in average household income. Middlebury has the highest percentage of pre-1940 housing stock of any City neighborhood. Although some new construction occurred between 1940 and 1980, new housing development was slow in the 1990s. According to The City of Akron’s statistics there are 8,062 people living in 3,445 households. The average household income (1999) is $30,600.</p>

<p>Location: North Side</p>
<p>North Hill served as one of the melting pots during Akron’s expansion and soon many Italians were settling down in the area. The main roads still have low-rise commercial buildings, scattered in between the used car lots and mechanics. Many blame North Hill’s problems on the closure of the deteriorated viaduct that connected North Hill to downtown Akron. The All-American Bridge restored the tie in 1981, but things have been slow to improve. The motorists eventually returned, but few businesses did. They bypassed North Hill's aging buildings and limited parking for places like the nearby shopping hub of Chapel Hill, which exploded in the 1980s. Many authentic Italian eateries still stand, harkening back to the old North Hill, when Italian immigrants turned this area into an Old World village where they could speak their native language and partake in the traditions of their homeland. Although the area still has pockets of Italians, the area has largely diversified since the great <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_flight.html" title="White flight">white flight</a>. According to the U.S. Census, the share of North Hill residents claiming at least partial Italian ancestry was 20 % in 1980, 17 % in 1990, and 15 % in 2000.</p>
<p>According to The City of Akron’s statistics there are 16,272 people living in 7,048 households. North Hill is 73% Caucasian. The average household income (1999) is $40,240, which is representative of the city’s average.</p>

<p>Location: West Side</p>
<p>Northwest Akron has a strong tradition of single-family homes set on large lots, with apartment buildings along Portage Path, in the Valley, and in the North Hawkins area. West Market Street offers convenient retail. Large estate homes around Portage Path and Merriman Road offer upscale residential options. The Northwest Community Center, Hardesty Park and the Sand Run Metropolitan Park provide numerous recreational opportunities.</p>
<p>Northwest Akron’s age distribution skews older than Akron. Almost half of residents are 45 or older.</p>
<p>Northwest Akron has a larger percentage White population than the City. Northwest Akron has an average household income 68% higher than the City. But average household income dropped 11% from 1990 - 2000 while in the City it rose 12.9%. Northwest Akron’s poverty rate is less than 5%.</p>
<p>Northwest Akron adults 25 and over are among the City’s best-educated residents. Eighty-one percent have at least some college, and 22% have graduate degrees. Fewer than 5% have a high school education or less.</p>
<p>Management and Professions are the dominant occupational group in Northwest Akron. Over half of employed residents are in this category. This group, plus those in Technical, Sales, and Office occupations, comprise over three-fourths of the population.</p>
<p>Over half of Northwest Akron households are traditional married households. Only 17% are Other Family households. Forty-five percent of married and non-married households have their own children under 18 living with them. A smaller percentage of households are persons living alone or other nonfamily households than in Akron.</p>
<p>Northwest Akron housing is much newer than the City’s, with almost 90% of units built since 1940. New construction continues at a pace about the same as Akron. Over three-quarters of housing units are owner-occupied. The adjusted average value of owner-occupied housing units was almost flat during the 1990s, while City housing appreciated 33.3% in real dollars. Nonetheless, the average value of owner-occupied housing units in Northwest Akron was 180% of the value of City housing units.</p>

<p>Location: South / West Side</p>
<p>With just more than 1,000 housing units, Rolling Acres is the least residential of Akron's 21 neighborhoods. Rolling Acres, like Chapel Hill, is a major commercial hub, stationed at the south-western border of Akron, with <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Acres_9786.html" title="Rolling Acres">Rolling Acres Mall</a> as its anchor. Rolling Acres has more undeveloped land than is typical of Akron neighborhoods. The Rolling Acres Mall and big box retail dominate Romig Road. East Avenue has mixed retail and residential use. Auto dealers, a grocery, and a mix of retail and office uses exist along Vernon Odom Boulevard. Although the Rolling Acres area is not thought of first as a residential area, proposals regarding the commitment of additional land to residential development are continually under consideration. The Mud Run Golf Course is in the center of the neighborhood. The largest residential areas are west of East Avenue. Rolling Acres has 1,120 housing units with 2,414 people living in the area. There is a lower percentage of children in this neighborhood than Akron has on the whole. The average household income (1999) is $41,467 which is just above the city average.</p>

<p>Location: South Side</p>
<p>Located south of Downtown and University Park, the neighborhood has easy access to I-76 and I-77. South Akron is predominantly a residential, single-family area between Lovers’ Lane and Archwood Avenue. A mix of light industrial activity and residential use occurs between Lovers’ Lane and I-76. Small areas of retail use occur along South Main Street, South Street, Brown Street, and Grant Street.</p>
<p>South Akron’s population is young, with a higher percentage of under 20s and lower percentages of persons 45 and over than the City.</p>
<p>South Akron’s population mix almost exactly mirrors that of the City, with about two-thirds White and slightly less than one-third African-American. A Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Laotian enclave in the area around Brown Street and Lovers’ Lane creates a diverse mix of cultures. Although average household income in South Akron grew in the 1990s at twice the rate of the City, it remained below that of City households. South Akron’s poverty rate decreased during the 1990s, but less than that of the City.</p>
<p>A higher percentage of South Akronites did not finish high school than City residents. Lower percentages have college or graduate degrees as their highest educational attainment.</p>
<p>South Akron residents are less likely than other Akronites to be in Management and Professional or Technical, Sales and Office occupations. They are more likely to be in Service or Production, Transportation and Material Moving occupations.</p>
<p>There is a lower percentage of Nonfamily households in South Akron than in Akron as a whole, and a higher percentage of Other Family Households. The percentage of Married households is about the same as the rest of the City. Thirty-seven percent of households have their own children under 18 living with them.

<p>Location: South Side</p>
<p>The Summit Lake neighborhood lies between Downtown and Kenmore, with easy access to I-76/I-77. Summit Lake land use is primarily mixed residential, with multi-family housing on the east side of the lake. Summit Lake occupies a large portion of the area. The Ohio and Erie Canal Towpath currently ends north of the lake. The Summit Lake Community Center and Park is on the east side of Summit Lake, and Margaret Park is on the west side. A large industrial area occupies land south of Kenmore Boulevard. Light industrial or retail uses exist between Main Street and Broadway.</p>
<p>Summit Lake’s population is the youngest in Akron, with 43% under 20, and 78% under 45. The area has much lower percentages of persons 45 and over than the City as a whole.</p>
<p>Summit Lake is Akron’s most diverse neighborhood. Eighty-three percent of the population is about equally split between White and African-American; the remaining population consists of Other racial and ethnic groups. Although average household income in Summit Lake grew faster in the 1990s than in the City as a whole, it remained only two-thirds that of City households. Summit Lake’s poverty rate remained high, at 37%, even though the poverty rate decreased more than in the City as a whole during the 1990s.</p>
<p>Nearly 40% of residents 25 and over did not graduate from high school. Three percent of the population has a college or graduate degree, compared to 18% in Akron as a whole.</p>
<p>Summit Lake residents are most likely to be in Service or Transportation and Material Moving occupations. Compared to the City, they are less likely to be in Management and Professional occupations.</p>
<p>There is a significantly lower percentage of Nonfamily households in Summit Lake than in Akron as a whole, and a much higher percentage of Other Family Households. The percentage of Married households is much lower than the rest of the City. Thirty-seven percent of households have their own children under 18 living with them. Other Family households are slightly more likely to have their own children living with them than Married households.</p>
<p>Summit Lake housing is considerably older than that of the City as a whole. But in recent years, the percentage of new housing starts exceeded City housing starts. The 11.5% increase in new housing about equals the reduction in renter-occupied housing units. Slightly over one-third of housing units are owner- occupied, significantly less than 55% in the City. After appreciation in the average value of owner-occupied housing units more than double that of the City in the 1990s, average value was 61% of the City.</p>

<p>The University of Akron campus dominates the University Park neighborhood. Areas south and east of the University developed as and remain working class, with a significant mix of student rental housing. Wolf Ledges Parkway in the Southwest is lined with modern low-rise office buildings. A neighborhood retail cluster on Exchange Street called Spicertown serves the University area, as does retail along East Market Street. An older industrial area lies between Carroll and Exchange Streets.</p>
<p>With over 90% of the population under 45 years of age, the University Park area is primarily home to young adults. The dominant age group, by far, is persons from 20 – 44 years of age.</p>
<p>University Park has slightly higher percentages of Whites and ethnic groups other than African-Americans than are typical of Akron. University Park lost a higher percentage of its population in the 1990s than any Akron neighborhood. During the 1990s, the rise in average household income was three times that of the City, and the decline in the poverty rate was 10 points higher. Average household income was 75% of that in the City.</p>
<p>University Park’s educational profile is higher than that of the City. Over half of adults 25 and over have at least some college; 24% have attained either college or graduate degrees.</p>
<p>University Park residents are more likely than other Akronites to be in Technical, Sales, and Office or Service occupations, and less likely to be in Construction and Maintenance or Production, Transportation, or Material Moving occupations.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of University Park households are Nonfamily households. These are about evenly split between persons living alone and other nonfamily. Twenty-six percent of households have their own children under 18 living with them. Other Family households are slightly more likely to have their own children living with them than Married households. Family households are about evenly split between Married and Other Family households.</p>
<p>In recent years, the percentage of new housing units equaled new City housing units. Other housing is older than City of Akron housing, split about equally between pre-1940 units and 1940 – 1980 units. University Park experienced a one-third decline in owner-occupied housing. Fewer than one in eight housing units is owner-occupied, the lowest rate in the City. The average value of owner-occupied housing units appreciated by about the same amount as the rest of the City. The average value of the remaining owner-occupied units was about 57% of City owner-occupied units.</p>

Wallhaven is a destination retail area offering groceries, restaurants and specialty retail. Wallhaven also has numerous professional offices in converted residences and mostly one-story or low rise office buildings. The International Chemical Workers Union Building is a notable high-rise exception.Modest well-maintained single- family homes dominate the areaeast of Hawkins with a more varied mix of residential activity west of Hawkins. Hardesty Park, Forest Lodge Park, and the Northwest Community Center nearby offer recreational opportunities.</p>
<p>Wallhaven’s population is older than that of the City of Akron. While persons 65 and over are around 14% of City residents, they are nearly 20% of Wallhaven’s population. The percentage of under 20s is among the lowest in the City.</p>
<p>Wallhaven has a majority White population with some ethnic diversity. During the 1990s, the percentage rise in average household income was about half that of the City, and the poverty rate rose by 10.7%, against a decrease in the City of 17%. Average household income in 2000 was 112% of City average household income.</p>
<p>Wallhaven’s population is relatively well-educated, with 39% of adults 25 and over having college or graduate degrees compared to 18% of City residents.</p>

<p>Over half of Wallhaven households are Nonfamily households. Most of these are persons living alone. The percentage of Married and Single parent households with children under 18 is about the same as City households, but the ratio of Married households with children is about three times that of Single parent households.</p>
<p>In recent years, the percentage of new housing units equaled that of the City. The remaining housing is newer than City of Akron housing, with about two-thirds constructed from 1940 - 1980. Due to decreases in the total number of housing units, and a decline in neighborhood population, there was a reduction in the percentage of renter-occupied units.

<p>There are several neighborhoods in Akron that, while not officially recognized by the city, are commonly recognized by residents of the area.</p>
<ul>
<li>Maple Valley - The neighborhood covers the west end of Copley Road, before reaching <a href="../../../i/-/7/I-77.html" title="I-77">I-77</a>. Along this strip are several businesses using the name, as well as the Maple Valley Branch of the <a href="../../../a/k/r/Akron-Summit_County_Public_Library_4988.html" title="Akron-Summit County Public Library">Akron-Summit County Public Library</a>.</li>
<li>Spicertown - Falling under the blanket of "University Park" found above, this term is used frequently to describe the student-centered retail and residential area around East Exchange St. and Spicer, near the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Akron_1e60.html" title="University of Akron">University of Akron</a>.</li>
<li>West Hill - West Hill is roughly bounded by West Market on the north, West Exchange on the south, Downtown on the East, and Rhodes Ave. on the West. It features many stately older homes, particularly in the recently recognized Oakdale Historic District. The neighborhood is served by the active West Hill Neighborhood Organization (WHNO).
