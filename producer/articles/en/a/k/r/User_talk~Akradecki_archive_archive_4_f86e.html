<p>Which is the problem with the article? <a href="../../../j/o/%C3%A3/User%7EJo%C3%A3o_Felipe_C.S_f479.html" title="User:João Felipe C.S">João Felipe C.S</a> 18:18, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've already stated that in my nomination for the AfD...this is material that belongs in the Brazil article. We don't need multiple articles about the same subject. The subject here is Brazil. It's economic rise is a subject to be discussed in the article about the country, and/or in the article about the <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economy_of_Brazil_44a0.html" title="Economy of Brazil">Economy of Brazil</a>. And, as others have said, the article is poorly sourced and essentially Original Research. I could raise a number of logical reasons why Brazil isn't anywhere near being a superpower, but that's irrelevant to the encyclopedia, just as much as your assertions that it <i>is</i> a superpower. The point is to report what the mainstream media and reputable journals are saying, and to do that reporting in the most relevant places. For you to champion your <i>theory</i> that Brazil is an emerging superpower is not appropriate in an encyclopedia. Does that make more sense? <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 19:36, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>-i have been trying to delete that page because it is full of errors. the citations are all mixed up. it should be deleted ASAP, so as to not mislead anyone, especially serious researchers. i created that article. no one else has worked on it. thanks. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevewk_8d14.html" title="User:Stevewk">Stevewk</a> 23:32, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I looked at the history, and a number of other users have edited it. If the citations are mixed up, then fix them, or the specific incorrect information. The listing, though, is worthy of keeping. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 23:36, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>not so. those IPs are all mine, and no other sign-in has edited that article. i am disavowing all connection with that article; i am not going to "fix" anything because its all a mess and would take too much time and effort to do so. i apologize for that. so, unless you want a bunch of erroneous citations there just waiting to be absorbed by some unsuspecting researcher, kindly do the world a favor and delete the article. thanks, <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevewk_8d14.html" title="User:Stevewk">Stevewk</a> 01:21, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would suggest that instead of trying to work this out by see-saw editing, take the discussion to the talk page. It looks like you've had a bit of discussion there, but it needs to get more in-depth. And, I note, this definition stuff isn't new...there's actually quite a bit on the talk page. I think one of the things that hindering your argument is lack of real citations. Find a couple of text books that back you up and that elaborate on the Adams quote, and cite them (a one or two line quotation, properly cited, is allowed). It really sounds like there's a common definition and then there's a technical definition. Even one of the responses on the talk page said your approach is valid but as an alternate. Ok, start discussing how a primary and alternate definitions could be included. Bottom line, though, and I can't stress this enough: cite sources! <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 23:08, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>need your help again, i'm afraid. i'm convinced i'm being reverted by someone who simply doesnt want me to have the rewrite. he's acting like an admin, but he hasnt stated anywhere that he is one. i just left him this:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>if you're a admin, i dont know why you havent stated it so far, so i'm going to assume you're not. the talk on this page, shows that you're simply intent on making sure i dont get the edit. so, i'm going to go ahead and report this to someone who i know is an admin. in the meantime, i'm restoring the template warning from before, and as much as i know you dont want to believe the rules apply to you, we'll see.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<ul>
<li>and you wanted sources, right? i provided them. he just continues to revert, now in the face of evidence. this last time, he reverted a version with an 'ActiveDiscuss' inserted. lemme know, ok? for more background, both of our talk pages, and that of 'Republic'. thanks, <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevewk_8d14.html" title="User:Stevewk">Stevewk</a> 15:57, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Alan: Thanks for your help! I annotated some of my contributions, as you suggested. I also tightened up some intros, e.g. Art History, Classical Music. This is fun! Hey, you asked me if I'm published in print media... I'll ask you, How do you DO that? P.S. are you some sort of Wikipedia honcho or something? All the best, Julie Martello 21:29, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ha! No, I'm not a honcho or admin...at least not yet! When I have a couple of more months under my belt, I may seek the admin mop, though. No, I'm just an editor who has the luxury of time to put to the effort, and I like encouraging other like-minding folks. As to publishing photography or writing? From the photography angle, I get published because I have aviation-related access that few others have, so when I get something good, usually all I have to do is call up an editor of a related magazine and pitch it to them. Sometimes I have them come to me, as they know I have the access. As for writing, I've done two books, one was a very limited release for a museum in Los Angeles. I pitched the idea to the museum director for a small (40 page) book that coincided with an exhibition they were planning, and she liked the idea. For my other one, the one on the Mojave Airport, no one had done anything on the place, even though it's really popular with aviation enthusiasts, so I convinced some friends of mine who are also business associates in a textbook publishing venture that it was worth the investment risk to stray from the type of book they were typically doing. It just made sense, so they agreed to the financial risk and the project was born, and has received good reviews. I've got 2 more books in the works, and as before, I'm writing and shooting from a perspective that I've not seen others do, so I know my stuff is unique. I also have written on occasion for a weekly aerospace trade journal, and again, its merely having an idea for a story that's unique and isn't being covered otherwise, and then I call the editor and pitch it...9 times out of ten he'll be enthusiastic. When there's a big event that a lot of other press photogs are covering, you'll never see me shooting with them...I'll always try to get off by myself to find a different, unique angle, that way my material is equally unique (of course, there is this one photog that tends to follow me when I do that, so I figure I must be doing something right!), which improves its chances of getting accepted. So I guess that's my top advice...never compete...find a story or an angle that isn't being covered, and come up with material that you don't have to compete with others to get accepted. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 21:46, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for you contribuations, but you have messed the true story to a version which i haven't seen any where in the news.for the cnn and abc i would say both don't have first hand coverage of the area and both are also affected by pov of their goverments.i'm only refering this in this case.<a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYousaf465_3422.html" title="User:Yousaf465">Yousaf465</a></p>

<dd>I've gone back and added the ABC and CNN reports and their information. On Wikipedia, they are considered proper, independent sources, and your deletion of them could be viewed as POV.

Thanks for the cite web template,I was searching for it but couldn't find it.Now onwards i will this temp.About cnn and abc i would like to say that as this strike was conducted on pakistani soil so a local paper such as dawn's sources will be more realiable than a foregin one so i was following the dawn report.If it had been a new york air strike i could have followed the cnn.similar is the case for abc.Best Regards.<a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYousaf465_3422.html" title="User:Yousaf465">Yousaf465</a></p>

<p>Hi A.K.!</p>
<p>I'm pleased to see that you have put up a page on John Radecki. A couple of things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Needs pics. Do you have any? There is a signed window at St Michael's Cathedral Wollongong which I could probably take a photo of.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have pics (not very good) of the Art Nouveau leadlights at Central Station, which are very beautiful, but I have been told that Radecki wasn't pleased with them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Concerning Wikipedia style- I can't remember quite how your introductory sentence goes, but in general you oughtn't used expressions like "generally regarded as the finest....." unless you have the weight of History to back you up, and in this case you have the advocates of Alfred Handel, Napier Waller and so on, to argue with.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What one does, in this situation, is a direct and acknowledged quote from whatever source one can find. You can employ whatever sort of O.T.T. language that you like to describe your relation's work, as long as it's in quotation marks, it's published and verifiable and you didn't write it yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<dd>In general "aviation english", this would be translated as "twin-engine" and "single-engine" (for instance, I work on a twin-engine Bell 412 helicopter, and the one parked next door is a single-engine Bell OH-58). When the term is used repeatedly, it's also acceptable to abbreviate it slightly to "twin" and "single", example: a Cessna 441 is a twin, a Cessna 150 is a single. Hope that helps. My teenage daughter is learning French at school, and since I help her with her homework a lot, I'm pretty much learning it, too...although we're still at the "beginner" stage. Oh, by the way, I added the standard UAV project info box to the LOGIDUC page, but wasn't sure which of the aircraft to put specs up for.

<p>The aircraft articles do not BELONG to some self-endorsed sub-group of Wikipedian aircraft enthusiasts. As another Wikipedian aircraft enthusiast I take exception to individuals tagging articles as poor or indifferent in quality without them taking the trouble to say how they could be improved. As for vandalism I deny this completely. What is closer to vandalism is the wanton, careless, lazy, ARBITRARY, unreasoned and unconstructive tagging of the articles. That's closer to vandalism than the removal of the unwanted and unneeded graffiti I will continue to do. Fear not: An assessment accompanied by reasoning will be warmly welcomed by me. <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 03:24, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you don't like <i>how</i> it was assessed, that's fine...but you don't have to completely remove that tags. Assess them yourself, if it's so important to you. These tags are being systematically added to all aircraft-related articles, many just as a starting point. By removing the tags completely, you remove the opportunity for editors - who might not have the detailed project knowledge to put the tags back in - to add to the assessment. You're absolutely right, the aircraft articles don't <i>belong</i> to certain editors, and just as well they don't belong to you, so your unilateral and arbitrary decision to remove someone else's contribution, especially when it's a part of an established project process, does indeed stray close to the vandalism line. Bottom line: if you don't like what you see, don't tear it down, improve it yourself. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 03:31, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>seems like there is a needless Level 2 headline at the top of the BLB article (the one that reads 'The Blue Letter Bible'). It forces the contents box up higher than what I've seen on other articles. Should I get rid of it? Or if you agree, feel free of course.... Being a novice, I'm not very bold yet..</li>
<li>When I link to the article, the link only works as 'Blue letter bible', not 'Blue Letter Bible'. Is some kind of alias or referral necessary, or what should I do? Should I rename the article with capitals?</li>

<dd>Hi Frank, I've moved the article to <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Letter_Bible_ea77.html" title="Blue Letter Bible">Blue Letter Bible</a> since it's a title. Article titles are case-sensitive. I've also removed the header that you pointed out...the opening paragraph shouldn't be under an initial header, as that messes up some advanced features of the encyclopedia such as popups.

<dd>Many thanks Alan for all your changes, and greatly for your encouragement, which I definitely need. Seeing that WP:WEB stub was stressfull, but of course it deserved it. Pretty clueless of me to throw that first version up, and right before a board meeting, and Thanksgiving! I'm still challenged by the case-sensitivity. The wikilink "Westcott-Hort" fails, but "Westcott-hort" works in the sandbox. Both work in a search box when selecting "Go". I could have sworn I tested it! Not yet intuitive to me...</dd>
<dd>Quick question: when you moved the title from "Blue letter bible" to "Blue Letter Bible", did you have to make extra redirect pages, or did the 'system' 'do it' automatically? Speaking of the 'system', I won't tell how how long I tried researching how to make that nifty 'contents box' on my own, and then it appeared on its own!

<dd>You're most welcome. For the link issue, take a look at how I set the WH link up...the article actually has a completely different name, so you do it as a two-part link within the double brackets. First part is the title name, seperated by a "|", and then the text you want to show in the article. Whenever you move an article, the "old" name is automatically changed to a redirect to the new one. Yeah, the contents box automatically shows up if you've got more than 3 headers. Have a great Thanksgiving...and feel free to ask anytime you need assistance! <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 06:31, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Happy Thanksgiving to you too, Alan. I just removed all but one of the external links on the <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Letter_Bible_ea77.html" title="Blue Letter Bible">Blue Letter Bible</a> article. I feel that I had previously violated the guideline for external links, and have documented my reasoning in the BLB talk page (I am a developer of BLB, and I was linking to a website I helped develop). Would it be appropriate to ask you to consider adding the external links back in, which would be in accordance with the <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">guideline</a> for a 'neutral and independent' editor? No worries!
<dl>
<dd>Done! I did remove the financial statment link, though, as it relates to the non-profit organization rather than the actual subject of the article. If an article is created for Sowing Circle (articles for such non-profits certainly is not unheard-of), then it would be appropriate here. Any chance of BLBi getting accredited? If it did, it would merit its own article there, as well (and I'd certainly consider taking a few courses and fininshing the degree I started at MBI 25 years ago!). <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 16:36, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Looks great! I sure appreciate your critical eye cleaning things up, and adding the categories. Two questions - one completely off the wall:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>1) I'm concerned that the BLB article doesn't have a 'sources' headline. The Sowing Circle financials actually had some activities listed at the back (page 17 of 31), such as courses on BLBi, 100,000 tapes distributed gratis through Firefighters for Christ (has a wiki article), page views stats, etc. It is old (2004). I'm glad the link is gone, really, since it has a lot of private info, names, $$, etc. Should I add a source section? For instance, I interviewed the BLB IT manager, who works for our CEO, and followed up with an email exchange to confirm the interview, which is the verifiable source of the data in the article (100,000 CDs dist'd, 375,000 page views, 28,000 registered users). Based on discussions in my personal talk page with Dlohcierekim (read it backwards), he thinks it might go to WP:AFD, and I'm wondering whether BLB would be attacked for lacking sources for the data in the article?</li>
<li>2) Some day I'd like to add an article on my hobby - I collection Missionary Collection Boxes. The little wooden boxes that sat on a church or store counter to collect money for missionaries and missions. I have one from 1897 for Livingstonia, a mission founded in 1874 in honor of the good Dr. Many others. To me, they serve as a reminder of Paul's exhortation in Rom 10:15, and the body of donors supporting the early missionaries. I have stock certificates from the 1860s which were given to the kids at Sunday school as they contributed their dimes, to support the children's missionary ships such as the Morning Star and John Williams (no wikipedia article on either line, of ship! There were several of each. They'd rot away after 20 years, and build another). Anyway, each little wooden box tells an illustrated story of those times, and the missionaries they sent.</li>

<dd>Now that I'm sitting here with a belly full of turkey and stuffing, I have a moment to get back to you.... I've asked a friend, David Haslam to also review the article. First, a "sources" or "references" header would be fine, and move the "external links" references up to it, as long as they were what provided the info for the article. Unfortunately, an email exchange isn't considered a "verifiable" source, as Joe Reader can't go look it up for himself. However, never fear...the links you've provided, and the reviews especially, are more than sufficient to keep this article out of danger should it be taken to AfD. What really helps, too, is that on the talk page you've described in excellent detail how the article meets WP guideline criteria.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, it was interesting to read about your collection box collection. I'll have to take a picture of the one we're using right now...an old printer ink cartridge box with a slot cut in the top! Actually, I'm one of a team of people from our church raising support to go to Siberia next summer to build a church, and we're doing bake sales and stuff like that to raise the funds. Our old box is just as functional, but not nearly as stylish as yours, I'm sure! <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 01:21, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>3 a.m. and I'm starting to gnaw at the tofurkey (fauxturkey?) in the fridge. I eat most everything, but two of my teens are moral Veget, and so we bought a Vegan bird this year, and took it to our friends house, where they had a real bird. Frankly, the tofu one was best! I've seen old collection boxes made out of shell casings, but not ink cartridges! I get an excitement of finding old collection boxes that must be like an historian discovering an important document. They thrill me. They often come with layers of 'collection receipts' on the bottom. On some, I've steamed off 4-5 layers, putting it on the scanner each time, and melting away years, until the original pristine label appears! But I need to write about the missionary ships first. They deserve their due. And a Livingstonia article - there's only a stub for the village. I have 20+ books on the subject, most published before 1900. Very intimidating for me to think about pulling it off. Hope your work in Siberia goes well. Sowing Circle helped another ministry start an outreach coffee shop there. --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrank_at_blb_36c3.html" title="User:Frank at blb">Frank Rabinovitch</a> 11:54, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Another question...do you think technical photos, such as engine w/ cowling open, rotor head, instrument panel, etc, would be helpful? I can easily shoot these types of pics for both the 222 and the 412, as I work on them daily. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 04:28, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I can see using a couple of them in each article, if they are interesting enough (esp like a bird resting in an inlet or something unusual). But I would think you put a lot more on the Commons, and allow others to put them were they might be relevant, like a pic of the engine in an article on the manufacturer or the engine itself. As far as the Commons goes, it seems the more pics, the merrier.</p>
<p>Shots I think we could use:</p>
<ol>
<li>A good aerial shot of a 222 with gear retacted.</li>
<li>A shot of a 230 or 430, if available, for compariso.</li>
<li>One or 2 good shots of a 412, preferably a different angle than the ones on that page.</li>
<li>As mentioned above, anything unusual, like a cat sitting/sleeping on a 222's sponson, whatever, would be interesting to me personally, even if we don't post them in the article. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 05:16, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Sounds good, I'll dig through my stuff. All our 222s are Us, so I don't have any without skids. There was a gorgeous 430 that came in to the test pilot school next door, and I think I got a good shot of it taking off...can't remember if gear are retracted.

<p>As fas as the 230/430 go, I don't mind if the gear is up or down; just wanted one of a 222B with gear up for comparison. But hey, if the aircraft (or the shot/background, etc.) is gorgeous, it really doesn't matter. If you're not a leg man, and a gorgeous woman walks into the room, are you really going to complain that you can see her legs 'cause she's wearing a very short skirt?

<dd>After this total fiasco, you can count on my unconditional oppose at that RfA you're want coaching for. You actually managed to <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> me despite actual efforts taken by me to prevent this. Now I am going to have to bring this up to DYK level, just to spite you. For the record, the article as posted was in an impartial tone (meets G11), and made at least two distinct and strong assertions of notability (meets A7). Everything else - WP:CORP, WP:V, or whatever else - is an issue for prod/AfD, not CSD. <b>If you do not understand this, you should not be doing NPP patrol</b>.

<dd>First, it's certainly your prerogative to oppose an RfA, if I choose to go that route. However, you're clearly trying to spite me (your words), which borders on a personal attack, which is quite inappropriate for an admin. Second, I'm not sure how I could <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> you since you're certainly not a newcomer. Third, WP's guidelines on notability reads, "A topic can fail to satisfy the criteria because there are few or no reliable published sources independent of the subject. Without such sources, a proper encyclopedia article cannot be built at all. Such articles are usually nominated for deletion, via Proposed Deletion, Articles for Deletion, or (for articles about a non-notable person, group, band, company, club, or website that does not even assert the notability of the topic) Speedy Deletion." As the article <i>did not</i> assert WP-recognized notability (at the time I added the tag), my adding a CSD tag was completely appropriate. As you're an admin, you should have known to add verifiable sources <i>when you wrote it</i>. Further, <i>policy</i> states: "The burden of evidence lies with the editor who adds or restores material. Any material that is challenged or likely to be challenged needs a reliable source, which should be cited in the article. If an article topic has no reliable, third-party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on it." As you did not list any 3rd party sources, <i>policy</i> says that we shouldn't have an article on the subject, and again, nominating such an article for deletion is consistent with both policy and guidelines. (And remember, it's <i>your</i> responsiblity to provide sourcing info, not my responsiblity to go find it before I tag the article.) Don't forget Brad Patrick's admonition in fighting spam: "shoot on sight". Have you actually read the CSD tag? It says: "This page <i>may</i> meet Wikipedia’s criteria for speedy deletion." (emphasis added). In other words, by adding the tag, I'm suggesting that the page be deleted. It is for an admin to make the final decision. If you disagree with me, fine, as an admin you can <i>politely</i> remove that tag and simply state something like "subject is notable"...Nawlin and others do it this way, and it keeps things civil. Lastly, I'm quite disappointed in your tone and how offended you've become simply because I added a CSD tag to an article that, at the time, appeared to be spam. Further, your attitude of wanting to spite an experienced editor who happens to have a legitimate disagreement with you is definitely behavior not appropriate to an admin (neither is a talk page heading "WTF?"). You're taking this way too personal. Take a step back, take a deep breath, and lets get on with the business of making this - and keeping it - a great encyclopedia. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 19:23, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I looked into it. You did the wrong thing by speedy tagging it. Crz's edit summary, and his status as an experienced user (evidenced by a brief look at his userpage) should have led you to posting on <a href="../../../b/%26/h/B%26H_Photo_Video_bb40.html" title="B&amp;H Photo Video">B&amp;H Photo Video</a>'s talk page if you had concerns about spam or sources. If there was still disagreement you could take it to AfD. That point aside, I think Crz was less than civil, and WP:BITE certainly doesn't hold for admins. You were more "in your face" than you had to be too. In the future you should take a more "let's talk this over" sort of attitude.. that should alleviate some of the "wtf?" sort of reactions.

<p>The reason I'm removing the "serves" category on AFBs is because the infobox template is ostensibly set up for civilian airfields which provide passenger service to the nearest town. For example, it is not logical to have the infobox for Seymour Johnson AFB, SC serving Goldsboro; there is no passenger service in an F-15. I'm not debating whether or not Edwards is considered a town, just that saying an AFB serves the nearest town is not appropriate. I hope you understand my motivation. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConn%2C_Kit_8215.html" title="User:Conn, Kit">Conn, Kit</a> 15:25, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>But is that the real intent of the blank? Is it limited to only commercial flights? For instance, Edwards, the town, is an Air Force town, on an Air Force Base. There are regular MAC or MATS or whatever they call themselves this week, into and out of the Base. If you're military personnel, living on base, you can travel these flights. Bases serve towns in many other ways than just scheduled air carrier flights. Many airport serve towns by providing other flying services, such as aircraft rental, instruction, etc. That's available at EDW as well. That's my motivation for leaving it in. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 20:08, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

One of the pages, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_de_Secondat%2C_baron_de_Montesquieu_fafa.html" title="Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu">Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu</a> is especially a vandalism magnet from IP addresses. Watching the patterns, it seems that this is a page that is referred to by many, many high schoolers in the course of having to do reports on U.S. history. It'll go for a while with little problem, then there'll be a rash of vandalism over a period of a couple of weeks. Because of the persistence of such activity at times, and the fact that the vandalism comes almost exclusively from IP addresses, I've asked for sprotection a couple of times, each time it gets turned down for "not enough vandalism, just watchlist and revert". So what's the threshold for "too much" vandalism that warrants sprotection? Once a day, every day? Three times a day? Is there a hard and fast limit? It seems to me that on a page where rarely a legitimate edit comes from an IP address, and there's daily vandalism from IP addresses, that to save the valuable time of editors, sprotection would be a good thing. One of the reasons I'm asking is that if/when I get admin tools, I want to focus on areas where there's a backlog of work, and my experiences have demonstrated that protection request page often has quite a backlog, so knowing when to and when not to protect or sprotect woudl be a valuable piece of knowledge. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 21:56, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi... as soon as Guinnog and I have a chance to huddle about this a bit, I'm hoping to set up a skeleton (as a subpage of your user space) to carry this out.

<p>I would semi-protect it only if repair isn't able to keep pace with ongoing vandalism. Frustrating though it is to repeatedly fix vandalism, it is a sad corollary of the core principle of "anyone can edit".

<p>We never called the original plane a Berkut 360, it was just Berkut. The 540 we called a Berkut 540</p>
<p>Why was the reference to the origin of the name Berkut removed from the article? I was there, it came from the book (other competing names were "Tallon" "Raptor" and "Nighthawk".) And what is your source for the "Griffon" variant?. Richard Riley, owner, Renaissance Composites.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi, the names come from the website...that's how it is currently presented. For articles, the preferred name is the current or most common. As for the book, it may have come from there, but by listing the book reference, you are stating that that reference <i>says</i> the name came from there. As for Griffon, I'm out on a limb there, as it is based on the call-sign placard in the cockpit of N360MG. If this is incorrect, I'm happy to remove it. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 19:10, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Griffon name may be correct, I just haven't heard it before and I try to keep tabs on things Berkut related.</p>
<p>The Berkut name was suggested by a relative of Don Murphy's, he was reading the book at the time. Later we bought a couple of cases of the book and gave one to each owner. I'd like to reflect that fact in the article and give a link to the book, simply to acnowledge that it was the inspiration for the name. One of the most common questions we got was what Berkut meant and where we got it. If you have a syntaxt to do that, I'd be happy to use it. Richard Riley</p>

<dd>That's stretching the OR rules a bit, but I'll see if I can't come up with some verbage that will suffice. Thanks for the safety record info. A curious question, though: Is the N91DR that Dick Rutan was flying and that's involved in the Voyager Aerospace/UAV Battlelab evaluations the same aircraft that crashed, or is it a recycled N number? <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 20:24, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>A little of both. Dick Rutan flew the original 91DR for a Discovery Channel air-to-air video shoot in the early 90's. When it crashed there was very little left, certainly not enough to rebuild. It disintegrated back to the firewall. The 91DR flying now is a recycled N number. It has a unique engine - a left turning IO-540 parallel valve engine, 260 hp nominal but with high compression pistons, probably making about 300 hp. Use of the left turning engne allowed the use of an AeroComposites constant speed prop made for a tractor configured airplane. It's rate of climb is very high, but it is slower (in top speed) than other 540's with fixed pitch props.</p>
<p>Can you tell me more about N360MG? Is it a 360 or 540 engine? Is it fixed main gear?</p>
<p>How do I get the name and datestamp thingie at the end of my text? Richard Riley</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi Richard, to get the name and date stamp, just type four tildas (~~~~) at the end of the message and the software inserts it automatically. I can't tell you much about 360MG's engine, other than it's running a two-bladded prop. It was in our hangar overnight at KMHV a few days ago, and at the time, I was more fascinated looking at the front office. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 17:35, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I saw the CATBird image on its page and notice it is in the Wiki Commons. The links for wikipedia and commons are quite different. So how do I make a link for an image from the commons. I also notice that the CATbird image is uploaded into Wikipedia and not linked from its commons page.</p>

<dd>Are you talking about making a link from an outside page? If so, you might be better linking to the image that's on my blog. Because Wikipedia and Commons share the same wiki software, the links from one to another work a bit different than normal html links. If you wanted to link directly to the commons image, click on the thumbnail, then when you're in the commons area, right click on the image and get the direct link from the properties selection. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 17:32, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No not from an outside page but within wiki. Like the CATBird image is in the commons, but here at wiki it is not pointing at the commons page, but the wiki page.

<dd>Ok, I think I understand what you're asking. You don't download it from commons and upload it to wikipedia. In fact, image submitters are encouraged to upload to commons <i>instead</i> of wikipedia, because that way other wiki sources - including other language wikipedias - can use the same image. When you click on the small image in the article, it comes up looking like it's in Wikipedia, but that's an automatic function that the software does...the image is actually in Commons all the time. So, the way to do it is to upload to commons, but create the link in the article just like you would for an image that had been uploaded to Wikipedia. The software will do the rest in going and finding the image in Commons and bringing it into the article. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 17:33, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Thanks for adding the Bell 207 and 209 to the templates. I actually trying to decide if it's best to leave the 207 on the AH-1 page. Options would be placing most of the info on the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell_47.html" title="Bell 47">Bell 47</a> page, of which the 207 is derived, or giving it its own page (not really enough content at the moment tho). I wasn't quite sure what to do with the 309, but since I found the pic for it at the same time as that for the YAH-63, and they were bth follow-ons to the AH-1, I decided to place them on the same page for the moment. The AH-1 page is long enough as it is, and even then, there isn't enough coverage to some models, esp the late Army models.

<p>On 201/207, yes, I do, especially if you have pics of 201, and a better one of 207. I hadn't thought of doing that, which is why I asked! What would you name it?

<p>P.S. What would you think of renaming the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell_222.html" title="Bell 222">Bell 222</a> page as Belll 222/430? I don't really like using slashes in titles unless I have to, but in some cases (like the ones above) they are needed. I think Belll 222/230/430 would be much too drawn out/complicated. The 222 is the original, and the 430 is the current model, so I think it covers the main points. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 19:02, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>YF-113G is mentioned in all three articles. Pete has been an extremely reliable source in the past (much better than average, considering the topic). His source for the information on the YF-113G is an USAF officer's biography, which is also mentioned in this old usenet posting:</p>

<dd>Actually, I have no clue...I was doing some vandalism patrolling and this one came up. Typically when a person changes text like that, especially when a link to another wikipedia article is involved, and doesn't provide a reason or a reference for the change, it is assumed that the prior version is correct. May I suggest that you first post a discussion of this on the article's talk page and see if you can get a response. If not, make sure that the linked article doesn't suffice as a reference, then go ahead and make the change, but note in your edit summary that you are changing an unreferenced, unverified statement in accordance with a talk page proposal. That way, it won't appear as vandalism. Thanks, and happy editing. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 14:54, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I think he really does desire to make this a better place, so he probably means well (trying to assume good faith, here), but I think he needs to realize that he's lecturing some veterans, and getting stuff wrong in the process. Oh, well. I guess we can look at it this way...what KP did spurred the 3 of us to get down and really produce a much better article.

<p>Saw your question on EagleWSO's talk page. The USAF has two types of wing, 'Air Force Controlled', or AFCON wings which are one, two, or three digit wings and have <i>continuous</i> histories and lineages. Eg 1st Fighter Wing, 305th Strategic Wing. There were also for a long time, not sure of their exact status now, MAJCOM or Major Command (eg TAC, SAC, MAC) wings with four digits. These were <i>temporary</i> wings and do not continue their history when deactivated. TAC had some in the 4400 range, like the long established 4404th(?) Wing in Saudi Arabia, Electronic Systems Command had a higher number range - 8000/9000 etc. SAC used a series of 1700 numbered wings during the Gulf War - you've probably heard of the 1701st, 1702nd etc etc. <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strategic_Wings_ee73.html" title="Strategic Wings">Strategic Wings</a> explains some of the system. I think EagleWSO deleted your listing because all the other wings on that page are AFCON, not MAJCOM. We need a good listing of MAJCOM wings though and don't have it yet.

<dd>Sounds like a good idea to have a MAJCOM section. The thing is, off-wiki I'm now hectically busy and have less time available to do a good job on a MAJCOM wings section that is very large and under researched. Maybe you could lend a hand, maybe by doing a simple listing of the four digit units from the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strategic_Wings_ee73.html" title="Strategic Wings">Strategic Wings</a> article, plus the few that are in the four digit wings category, and any else you find?

<p>Hi, Mr. Radecki.</p>
<p>Thank you for your edit and comment to the Beechcraft 1900 page. I appreciate the explanation along with the edit.</p>
<p>I have some questions how to improve the page further, if you are willing to take the time to answer.</p>
<p>I linked to a picture taken from the wiki "Flight Simulator" page, since the picture was of a Beechcraft 1900 simulator, and no other cockpit photo is readily available. Is this practice acceptable?</p>
<p>Furthermore, the article failed "good article" criteria. I am a pilot/instructor in the 1900 for one of the listed airlines, and while I am responsible for only about 50% of the content, almost all of what I know comes from the Raytheon Aircraft Flight Manual and other similar resources which cannot easily be linked. Factually, almost everything in the article is pretty solid, but I am not sure how to better source things. Can you advise?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your courtesy and response. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Mikepurves (<a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikepurves_9086.html" title="User talk:Mikepurves">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mikepurves_91f7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mikepurves">contribs</a>) 01:44, 22 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>Thank you, Alan, for your photo contribution to the 1900! I got your comment on my talk page; here is a copy of it and my reply. Thanks again. Mikepurves 21:15, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Don't know if this is worth mentioning, but the USAF has more than the UD serialed C models. They operate at least one earlier, UB-42, which wears completely civie colors and has civie reg N20RA. It taxied past me this morning at Mojave, I grabbed a pic thinking it was N-G's corporate bird, but checking the registration shows it's owned by the Department of the Air Force. I've uploaded the pic to commons, Image:Airforce-b1900-N20RA-070201-01cr.jpg if you want to see it. Akradecki 05:46, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks! I know that the military has other 1900s, including some -Ds. Didn't know about the UB, tho. I will work the pic. in, and find a place to comment on that. Interesting that although there was a designated UD series, many of the military 1900s are basically converted civilian a/c. Mikepurves 07:02, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks. Congrats on your term at Ameriflight. I hope you remember it fondly.</p>
<p>Re. the picture, I will do that. I have to get something better than my camera phone, but I will be at FlightSafety Orlando, using that exact simulator, this time tomorrow.</p>
<p>I will have to look up the citation process. Frankly, when I get away from aircraft specs, some of my knowledge just comes from flying the plane for 5+ years and poring over manuals. If there is an AFM reference, I can make it. Some things (such as airlines flying the plane) simply come from doing an Airliners.net photo search and cross-referencing the airlines' wiki pages. A few things (history of the 1900 models, e.g.) come from internal company training PowerPoint programs and I cannot get back to original sources. Other contributors later added details consistent with the information I posted, so I believe it is factually sound, but I cannot provide original source materials for every statement. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Mikepurves (<a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikepurves_9086.html" title="User talk:Mikepurves">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mikepurves_91f7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mikepurves">contribs</a>) 02:29, 22 January 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>Thanks.

<dd>Yeah, I went and reviewed all that. I know it's hard dealing with situations like that, but don't allow him to get you into a situation where <i>you</i> could get blocked for 3RR yourself. It just isn't worth it. I know I'm losing the consensus discussion on the J85 page, but I still firmly believe in the concept, so I'd suggest revising what you put on the P-51's talk page, and ask for other's input about which image should be the lead (and, I know you're frustrated, but no matter how bad it gets, don't allow yourself to get into the personal attack mode...it isn't worth it, either!). You could even put two or three of the top images on the talk page and ask other editors to comment. Once that is done, then if someone like Signaleer or anyone else changes it, it's simply a matter of dealing with vandalism. Just some thoughts....</dd>

<p>Hi Akradecki. I saw that you had some conversation with User:Calktm3 a while back (<a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalktm3_3867.html" title="User talk:Calktm3">his talk page</a>). He created a musical group article and their albums. The group article (Chi Rho Wake Forest Christian Male A Cappella Ensemble) was deleted as an uncontested prod (on the basis of non-notability), so I went ahead and prod'd all the group's album articles. Do you have any input on this? I am guessing that the group is indeed non-notable, but if that's not the case, I'll happily remove the prod tags and take another look at the group article.

<p>Using yourself as a point of reference "I personally know no one, but she's not notable enough to be added" and the judge of who is added and who isn't isn't within the Wiki guidelines either.
