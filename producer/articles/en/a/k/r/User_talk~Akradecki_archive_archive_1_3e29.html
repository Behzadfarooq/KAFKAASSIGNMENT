<p>Thanks for note, good point about "Tayleur", I have amended that para -- I thought it worth keeping that information in (I just like interesting cross references!).

<dd>I am not actively writing on ships at the moment, so feel free, it's a good project. I would just advise that you should think carefully before moving an article name. <a href="../../../r/m/s/RMS_Republic_eb53.html" title="RMS Republic">RMS Republic</a> is the tricky one here -- seems nice to have everything consistent, but there is a case for using the name most commonly encountered, even if it doesn't fit in with other naming conventions. But I leave it up to you. (As an aside, I personally dislike the usage "The RMS Republic" in an intro -- the "the" is not really needed to my mind! -- good luck! --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMervyn_42ba.html" title="User:Mervyn">mervyn</a> 08:18, 25 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Thanks. And, I agree with the use of "the". I also am not all that comfortable automatically using the "RMS" designation. It's one thing with the Cunnard liners, as they had the official contract, but it's my understanding that unless there was mail onboard, the ship is properly an "SS", so in a general sense, this seems to be the proper way of referring to them. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 20:41, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks much for the addition of that anecdote on the Ironside page! Since you're connected, do you have further info on the background of the honorary degree? Generally, there's reasons given during the presentation, and maybe a quote from that would be a nice addition. Akradecki 20:52, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Good idea, Akradecki, but unfortunately BJU's records about such things are abysmal.

<dd>Sad...kinda takes away the honor, if it doesn't mean that much to the U. to preserve the memory of why; after all, as Ironside is but one of countless examples, honorary degrees - and the honor they convey - can last many years past the life of the person so honored.

<p>I'd recommend added the year launched but keeping the RMS prefix, basically changing the name to <a href="../../../r/m/s/RMS_Republic_%281903%29_74e0.html" title="RMS Republic (1903)">RMS Republic (1903)</a>.

<p>Okay, I've started some minor edits on your pages, adding wiki links and rewording things and the like. Many of those articles should have the WP:Air infoboxes and other templates added as well. I might add those later, although, they would require some information that is not on the pages currently (aircraft specs and preformance information, and some pictures wouldn't hurt). Anyways, for now I'll just stick with the minor edits, and do more when I have more time on my hands. --<a href="../../../k/p/w/User%7EKPWM_Spotter_8d1b.html" title="User:KPWM Spotter">KPWM_Spotter</a> 15:41, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry about taking so long to respond...I had a bunch of stuff to do last night. Anyways, I know that the specs might be hard to get, but I think I will still put in the standard Air Infobox, with the most basic of information. For that box though, it would be nice to have at least one picture of each aircraft for the article. You said you've shot pictures of Rutan's planes yourself, you wouldn't happen to have any shots of these aircraft lying around that you could upload, would you?</dd>

<p>And, yeah, I'm from Maine. It's quite hot here as well (well, but Maine standards at least)...80s and 90s, but I feel glad that I'm not out west right now.

<p>Thank you for all of the help you have given me today! I really appreciate it. I had one other question though, when you search for that article it does not come up. Is this due to the fact that it was created today and needs time to adjust in the Wikipedia server, or is it an optimization issue?</p>

<p>Sorry for leaving so many messages. I tried to create a page like the Keith Green page for the album (i put a link on the Chi Rho page) but I cant get it to look like the keith green one for the life of me... what coding did they use that im not?</p>
<p>HAHAH got it. wow, i hate stupid mistakes like that. lol</p>
<p>this might sound like a stupid question, but how do you create a page? The Chi Rho page and the See through the rhetoric articles were created because they didnt exist yet in Wikipedia, so it gave me an option of creating them. But, for example, for the album, the promise, many things already exist, so how would i go about adding that article?</p>
<p>Well here is a problem.... there already exists an album called the promise by some metal band, now what do i do? BTW, where in the world did you learn so much about Wikipedia?</p>
<p>Ha! Thats great. On <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Promise_bf1c.html" title="The Promise">the Promise</a> actually its part of the bonus track (at the end of benediction), its more of an informal recording but it is good. If you're looking for a good Cd, that one is a great one. A more traditional sounding CD is <i>All That I Have</i>. Thanks for all of your help tonight! We actually have toured California twice, this year we are going to England, but we probably will come back out there.</p>
<p>Sorry, one more question. How do you create a disambiguity page? (Cause i need to create one for <i>Free</i> as well. Also, it looks like the disambiguity page you made for Chi Rho deleted itself... I dont know why it would do that.... Also, have you considered being a Wikipedia Trustee?</p>

<p>you deleted it before i could even tell you why she deserves to be there.</p>
<p>how can something that is true not deserve to be on wikipedia? she is everything i said she was and the article wasnt even done yet. she has an album recorded but not released into the mainstream. shes done many public performances and competed in competitions and came out on top such as in Music Madness.</p>
<p>how does she not deserve a spot on wikipedia?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry you think I'm mean...I'm really not, I'm just a stickler for having a professional-level encyclopedia. I'm actually quite willing to help new users. Given how you feel about me, you may not be open to constructive input, but I'll try to share some with you, anyway. Please keep in mind, this is first and foremost an <i>encyclopedia</i>. If you haven't done so yet, please take a look at <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>. Keep in mind we're not a complete listing of everyone who's ever done anything. As an encyclopedia, there has to be a level of notability, of significant achievements to be listed. You wouldn't expect Diana to be listed in Encyclopedia Britannica or Colliers Encyclopedia, would you? Is she really that famous? Both my daughter and I are accomplished guitarists and songwriters (and I've written a book, even), and my son is the lead singer in a popular local band, but you won't find articles on us, because we just haven't achieved that high level of notability yet. Wikipedia isn't a free, add anything place. We have standards at Wikipedia, which is why I sent you to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Wikipedia:Notability (music)</a>. You asked me why she shouldn't be included. Wrong question. It's on you to demonstrate why she <i>should</i> be included. Sounds like Diana is a gifted musician, and it actually sounds like she plays the kind of music I like to listen to. I tend to buy self-released CDs from underground guitarists and street musicians, because that's where so much raw talent and great song writing can be found. But, until Diana achieves a greatness that qualifies her per the Wikipedia standards, she'll just have to consider inclusion here a goal to strive for.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for technical stuff, I'd like to share a few pointers. If you're building a page, and don't want it deleted until you're done, here's what you do. On your user page, create link that looks like this \sandbox except put it inside two [[ ]] square brackets. That'll create a red link. You then click on it, and start building your page, and it won't show up as a new encyc. page, so won't be a candidate for review. Once you get it built, have someone who's familiar with WP style to review it for you (yeah, I know you think I'm mean, but I'd actually be more than willing to help you with this) and give you any pointers. Once it's ready, you create the name for the real page, cut and paste (from the edit mode screen) the text from your sandbox, and voila, you have a ready-to-go, professional-looking encyclopedia entry that will contribute meaningfully to the project. Also, make sure that you include a couple of things: 1) links to other pages. An article without links gets unfavorable attention. 2)Make sure you have and list references. Wikipedia has a policy <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> which basically says that you need to be reporting information that's written elsewhere. So, for instance, if Diana has reviews, list them, and quote from them (but don't cut-and-paste them wholesale, as that's a copyright violation).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Lastly, a point of ediquitte...when you leave a message on a talk page or a user's talk page, make sure you sign it with four tildas (the ~) symbol...that will automatically add your sig and date.</dd>

<dd>How can I suggest how to improve it when it's not at all clear what you were trying to write? You wrote Hezbollah twice, misspelling it, I might add, then "ole"...were you mocking them? Cheering for them? Neither is appropriate for an encyclopedia. A serious article on Hezbollah already exists. If you have something meaningful to add, add it there. It has nothing to do with a clique...it has everything to do with trying to maintain a professional-level publication. Would you expect to find what you wrote in a paper copy of Encyclopedia Britannica? No! So not here, either.</dd>

There are <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_d4d2.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion">other methods of deletion</a> available, so if you still believe The club beverly hills shouldn't be on Wikipedia, you can consider <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a> or <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">WP:AfD</a> instead.

<dd>No problem. I've seen this reason used before and accepted by some Admins. Seems silly that blantant advertising has to waste the time it takes to do the slower processes. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 21:05, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree! But because 90% of users (and, it seems, 90% of admins) <i>believe</i> this is a criterion, no-one is campaigning to make it one!

<dd>Hmm. I'm wondering if A7, non-remarkable people/groups and vanity is the source. In this case, the company that created the page is also the subject, so it's clearly vanity. So, what does it take to change the CSD criterion? With the influx of articles ever-accellerating, seems like the tools to deal with it should be made more efficient. Is this something that an editor and an admin or two can get a ball rolling? By the way, thanks for the note. You're the first Admin that's dropped me a line like that, and thanks for the polite tone, and not being pissed off that I nominated something that shouldn't have been. I don't mean to come across as an deletionist, but I've written a fair number of articles, now, and I try to write them at a professional level, so I guess I feel a bit pride and ownership in the project, and hate seeing the truly non-encyclopedic stuff that is flooding in, and how it diminishes the overall quality of the project. And, thanks for listening to me rant!<a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 22:21, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the note! I feel bad that I haven't been able to do much in the last week or so...work has been real busy this week. A friend of mine was almost killed on Tuesday when he crashed while he was practicing a low-level aerobatics routine. "My" helicopter (I'm the crew chief on a medivac helo) was first on-scene, and we were able to get him to a trauma center in time to keep him from dying. The rest of the week was busy trying to get inspections done on the helo between flying a lot of patients. The first part of this week will be a bit busy, but later in the week I should be able to dive back into it. BAE systems just announced the first flight on yet another UAV model - the Skylynx II - so I've got to right something up on it. Hey, how knowledgable are you as an admin on the subject of photo copyrights? <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 21:34, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your friend is very fortunate to have someone like you in his life. I hope he feels well soon, and has a fast recovery. Your post reminded me of one of my best friends - he likes to build RC planes. As for photo copyrights? Tricky stuff, but I've done this before. What do you have in mind? I'll take a look. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 02:13, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>FWIW, my friend, Chuck Coleman, is one of the pilots of Proteus, and also flew chase in his Extra300 for the SpaceShipOne flights. It was the Extra300 that crashed. Anyway, the copyright issue involves a photo I have on the <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scaled_Composites_Proteus_d27f.html" title="Scaled Composites Proteus">Scaled Composites Proteus</a> page (the next-to-bottom one). It is a NG press release image, and there's been a conversation going back and forth with a guy (who's been de-sysopped, I might add) who's challenging my fair use assertion. I feel like I've made a fairly detailed justification, but it doesn't seem to be enough for him. His standards are, at least as he's written them, higher that the stated WP policies. I've talked with the NG press office, and they acted like I was some amateur who didn't know that newsrelease images are <i>intended</i> to be reproduced, and carry an implicit license. Anyway, I'm still trying to get something in writing from them, and owe them a call, as they last called me while I was on a medevac flight Friday. I guess what I'd appreciate from you is an unbiased look at what I've written and advice as to whether I've actually made a good fair use justification or not.

<dd>I took a careful look - I've seen similar situations on Wikipedia for other images, and very often, they were ultimately deleted. Having said that, I think I would have approached the problem differently on that page. Since you noted that you were in communication with NG, it's best to wait and see what they say. In your communications with them, one thing you could emphasize is that even though you understand how press release images are to be used, Wikipedia itself is an international project, and to ensure its success, it is essential that image media could be unambiguously released more freely than fair use. You could elaborate and say you have on your mind the educational benefits of such an image, and it would be great if you had the support of NG towards that endeavour.</dd>

<dd>One reason why there is a bit of a conservative approach towards these images on Wikipedia at the moment, is that there is a lack of resources to properly address all the nuances involved. Sometimes, there is a bit of a disconnect between what is written as guidelines, and what is implemented as policy. See what NG says, bring it up again, and if there is still resistance, I suggest moving on. From my point of view, it may not be worth the effort to reason everthing out at the expense of other more interesting things to do on Wikipedia. I hope this helps. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 19:40, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks much for the input...will do. On the BAE Systems site, they have a statement regarding their news release images that says, "The photos on this site are the property of BAE Systems (Copyright© 2002 BAE SYSTEMS. All rights reserved) and are made available for publishing and personal use." Since it specifically says for publishing, do you think it would be acceptable to use a "used with permission" tag? I'm doing an article on their newest UAV right now, and <a href="http://www.eis.na.baesystems.com/platform_solutions/images/SkylynxFlightAugust06.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eis.na.baesystems.com/platform_solutions/images/SkylynxFlightAugust06.jpg" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> image would be helpful. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 19:52, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>From a cursory glance, probably not - but I hope this doesn't sound too discouraging. We have some material regarding similar situations <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequesting_copyright_permission_5781.html" title="Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission">here</a>. There might be some useful material for you at the bottom of the page. The main concern with "used with permission" is that the issuer needs to state unambiguously that the material they give to Wikipedia can be used by anyone else - commercial entity or not. It's not possible to house content that is released only to Wikipedia, because Wikipedia's content is propagated all over the internet, and anybody can use it for whatever purpose. However, I've seen cases where people simply asked nicely, and a free license of an alternative image was given :-) --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 20:04, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did take two seconds reading the article...it is all of one sentence long, and just says that she's a soprano. So's my wife, but there's no article about her.... An article needs to clearly <i>state</i> notability. This one doesn't. It's just a name and a couple of links. If you're in the process of writing it, tag it with inuse inside two { brackets.

<dd>If you believe a page is a mistaken userpage and the author's userpage is a redlink, just move it to the main userpage. If the page just reads like a self-promotional vanity bio and is by a user with no other contributions, just tag it {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-bio_ac6d.html" title="Template:Db-bio">db-bio</a>}} - we don't need lots of userpages for people with no other contributions.

<p>Alan,</p>
<p>Thanks for your question. The short answer is that their Wikipedia-specific license is <i>not</i> sufficient, and only the Wikipedia Foundation can sign a license agreement on behalf of Wikipedia (and they won't do so). But here's a longer, and hopefully more satisfactory, answer.</p>
<p>If Wikipedia receives permission to use an image, then we can legally use it without fear of a lawsuit. But Wikipedia chooses not to use such images, since we endeavor to provide a "free" encyclopedia which is <i>entirely</i> licensed under the GFDL. The fact that Wikipedia is licensed under the GFDL means that a reuser (like <a href="../../../m/i/r/Wikipedia%7EMirrors_and_forks_fe2e.html" title="Wikipedia:Mirrors and forks">these sites</a>) can copy any or all of Wikipedia's content and repost it on their own web site. So long as their site is licensed under the GFDL, they don't have to ask for Wikipedia's or anyone else's permission. If Wikipedia used images that are <i>only</i> licensed to Wikipedia, then the reusers couldn't use those images, and Wikipedia couldn't call itself "completely free". (For the same reason, Wikipedia won't use images that are free for only non-commercial or educational websites to use, even though Wikipedia is non-commercial and educational. Some reusers may not be, after all.)</p>
<p><b>But</b> (and here's the silver lining), the English-language Wikipedia <i>does</i> allow images used under a <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a> rationalle. The fact that N-G has offered to license its images to Wikipedia for free can be used as supportive statements in the rationalle. So you could upload these images, use a {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EPromo_e870.html" title="Template:Promo">promo</a>}} tag, and include a rationalle that says something like the following:</p>
<pre>
The use of this image on Wikipedia is held to be a fair use of the image, since:
* The image is promotional in nature. (Its value is based on its dissemination, not its scarcity.)
* The use of the image is not expected to decrease the value of the copyright.
* Wikipedia is not competing with the copyright holder.
* The copyright holder has expressly offered to allow Wikipedia to use the image at no charge.
* The image is being used in an educational, not-for-profit encyclopedia.
</pre>
<p>And remember to include the source. I would think that would be fine.

<dd>Hi HC! These folks are one of dozens of airline support companies, and really aren't notable. They provide a number of computerized flight planning services. I can expand the article, if you think it should be kept, but in reality, it doesn't meet WP:CORP at all.
