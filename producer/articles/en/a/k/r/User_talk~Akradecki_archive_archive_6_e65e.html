<p>Hello Akradecki! I quite agree with your recent revert on the article, which makes me again think that the best way to proceed, at least for the intro, is too keep to factual description of the process, without entering rhetorics and politico-ideological debates. I wonder what you thought about the draft I submitted, of if you saw any problems in it. We should really keep debates and commentaries, such as calling the term "torture by proxy", in a subsection (which could be divised into "supporters" and "critics"). However, I really think, although it is sometimes difficult to do, that first dividing facts &amp; commentaries is a very important thing to do here, and that, at the end, the importance of facts largely precede commentaries (although clearly justifications of ER as well as critics are also historical facts which must be inserted, but maybe not in the intro).

<dd>Thanks for warning me...I've reported myself to an admin. However, I would caution you back that the proper procedure is to not readd material until consensus is reached. It doesn't matter that you added it in 2005. The <i>current</i> text was achieved by consensus, and it is wrong of you to change it while discussion is underway. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 18:08, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It appears that the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> violation was inadvertant. I cant see blocking for something done on accident, and being the 1st reversion was so far back in the 24 hour period, it seems like a plausible mistake. I reccomend working out or I will kindly protect the page until it gets works out. (Unfortunatly, that is sometimes the only way to stop edit warring and force discourse). <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 18:16, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>He does have a valid point here. As a gesture of good faith here I would reccomend reverting the last revert you made. (Just a friendly reccomendation). <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">-- Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 18:30, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>...Yes, I understand consensus changes, and it's perfectly valid to bring an issue back up. But when you're informed that the current state of things was based on a lot of work to build a consensus, I would expect that you would respect that, especially as an admin, and follow the correct path of discussing first before repeatedly insisting on your way.

<dd>When do you think this consensus was built and reachd? --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 22:15, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well you might want to read <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7EConsensus_8a50.html" title="WP:Consensus">WP:Consensus</a> for that answer. The way it worked last time the lead paragraph was hashed out, a proposal was made, discussed, changes suggested, and eventually it got to the point that everyone involved, while they might not have been perfectly happy, could say "I can live with that". It certainly <i>isn't</i> reached when an editor comes along, ignores Wikipedia guidelines on the subject, insists that his wording is the only acceptable version, won't discuss, won't accept compromise, and continually tries to re-add material in violation of the guideline, which clearly says it should be discussed <i>first</i>. Read through the earlier consensus-building thread, and you will find that it worked smoothly, because everyone involved expressed respect, though not always agreement. The main problem here is that by so tenaciously insisting on re-adding <i>your</i> material, you show bad faith and a distinct lack of respect for the other editors. It is, unfortunately, very difficult then to build consensus in that respect-lacking environment. But, as an admin, I would have expected you to know that. (Oh, and to answer your actual question more specifically, there was extensive discussion which resulted in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Extraordinary_rendition&amp;diff=110409239&amp;oldid=110113881" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Extraordinary_rendition&amp;diff=110409239&amp;oldid=110113881" rel="nofollow">this dif</a> which was agreed upon at the time by all actively involved, and as evidenced by the stability the lead paragraph enjoyed in the immediate thereafter).<a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 23:03, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>With regards to the "extensive discussion" you mention that took place on and around the 22 February "which was agreed upon at the time by all actively involved". I am a little confused how you thought that there was a consensus as I made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Extraordinary_rendition&amp;diff=110049499&amp;oldid=109830651" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Extraordinary_rendition&amp;diff=110049499&amp;oldid=109830651" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> to the article and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AExtraordinary_rendition&amp;diff=110049711&amp;oldid=109933442" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AExtraordinary_rendition&amp;diff=110049711&amp;oldid=109933442" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> to the talk page both on the the 22 February, (that was between the first (Tazmaniacs 23:11, 21 February) and the second (Kaisershatner 17:02, 22 February 2007) proposed drafts). BTW the term "torture by proxy" has been discussed several times before (see the talk archives) and I had specifically mentioned the issue in this section <a href="../../../e/x/t/Talk%7EExtraordinary_rendition_archive1_c423.html#POV_intro" title="Talk:Extraordinary rendition/archive1">Talk:Extraordinary_rendition/archive1#POV intro</a>, so it is not as if this term was sprung on you by surprise. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 09:54, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can you take a look at the <a href="../../../p/o/w/Powered_lift.html" title="Powered lift">Powered lift</a> article. I'm about to taks an axe to it, especially the summaries on the Harrier, V-22, and BA-609 (they are summaries now!). We don't list descriptions of every type on the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helicopter.html" title="Helicopter">Helicopter</a> page, so I don't think this is needed here. However, I don't know much about the FAA category (Born2flie confirmed to me that this category does exist), so I'm really not sure what should be here. Thanks!

<p>Thanks for helping out on the <a href="../../../t/-/6/T-6_Texan_II_d180.html" title="T-6 Texan II">T-6 Texan II</a> merge. I found the CT-156 page from a link on the Canadian Forces Air Commamnd navbox. It's amazing the orphaned pages that are Wiki. I did alot of work on the T-6 II several weeks ago, and had no clue the CT-156 page even existed! Sounds a lot like the RC-12 situation we ran into a few weeks back. Maybe we should suggest something on WP:AIR to find orphaned and neglected articles. I'm not sure the best way to find them, but we could use a list somewhere of the ones that are found, so the project members can know where they are, and give them some attention.</p>
<p>On another subject, I've tagged the Air FOrce One article for a split to make a Boeing VC-15 page for the aircraft themselves. the Navy one and Marine one pages both deal with the name and its usage only, with coverage of the aircraft on other pages. (Marine Onne does cover the helicopters in some detail, but not AF1 on the VC-25.) I have a test page for the VC-25 up at <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_Test_Article_3_96da.html" title="User:BillCJ/Test Article 3">User:BillCJ/Test Article 3</a>, but not for the AF1 as yet. I plan to keep the history of all the planes as they are for now on AF1, but take out those details relating specifically to the VC-25s, like the Infobox, specs, etc.</p>
<p>On the test page, the Intro needs alot of work, as right now its basically the Intro from the AF1 stuck under the Intro from the <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_C-32_4b51.html" title="Boeing C-32">Boeing C-32</a>. I don't foresee any major ojections to the split, but so far have gotten no comments either way.

<p>Sigh. I don't really have the time or inclination to get involved in administrator action, but I'm definately frustrated by this too. Including the infobox isn't consistent with the discussion on <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astronaut.html" title="Astronaut">Astronaut</a> like Rillian claims, but it is consistent with the Astronaut article itself, as Rillian has it worded currently. Personally, I've never thought of people who haven't flown in space and aren't trained by a government space flight program to be astronauts, and I don't think most people do either, but I can't find a good source to back that up. It just seems to be common sense that this guy isn't an astronaut – but Rillian can be tough to convince. My editing philosophy is usually to cede disputes about things that aren't terribly important, and put my time to use on other articles. — <a href="../../../s/w/p/User%7ESwpb_9c6b.html" title="User:Swpb">Swpb</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/w/p/User_talk%7ESwpb_ffe5.html" title="User talk:Swpb">talk</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swpb_aa66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swpb">contribs</a></sup> 22:04, 3 March 2007 (CST)</p>

<dd>You're taking his comment out of context. He also said, "An astronaut is a space-traveler. (So is a cosmonaut). Unless there is some Astronauts Union that claims some legal status that one can't be called "astronaut" unless one is a professional astronaut." In context, he was talking about professional verses passengers in terms of who gets called an astronaut. Doug Shane didn't even fly SS1! He's a great test pilot and a classy, honorable man.

<p>Hi Mr. Akradecki, Thanks for your help on all the aircraft projects to which I have submitted my pittance of knowledge. BTW, I wonder if you could take a look at the Avro <a href="../../../c/f/-/CF-105_Arrow_983c.html" title="CF-105 Arrow">CF-105 Arrow</a> discussion page. It seems to have degraded into a discussion over the relative merits of the decision to cancel the Arrow. However, there is an editor that has been compelled to take the discussion into a bizarre turn. He actually backs up his own opinion with comments from an unknown IP address that can be traced back to... him? I don't need anyone to intercede except for maybe an administrator but take a look and give me your opinion. <a href="../../../b/z/u/User%7EBzuk_3248.html" title="User:Bzuk">Bzuk</a> 04:39 4 March 2007 (UTC).</p>

<dd>Alan, that you for your note. Yes, I am extremely reluctant to actually quote from my own books. The one article where that has been an issue on Wikipedia is the <a href="../../../a/v/r/Avrocar_%28aircraft%29.html" title="Avrocar (aircraft)">Avrocar (aircraft)</a> article where there are very few authoritatitive references sources on an obsure topic. I have done my best to support the article from other sources but since the majority of the original edit came from another editor, it was difficult at times not to refer to the material that was found in my books. BTW, thanks for your support in the awkward situation I have encountered in the Avro <a href="../../../c/f/-/CF-105_8702.html" title="CF-105">CF-105</a> article. <a href="../../../b/z/u/User%7EBzuk_3248.html" title="User:Bzuk">Bzuk</a> 10:38 4 March 2007 (UTC).</dd>

<p>Hi Alan:</p>
<p>If a rewrite of the CF 105 article is done,the thesis <a href="http://scaa.usask.ca/gallery/arrow/thesis/thesis9.htm" class="external free" title="http://scaa.usask.ca/gallery/arrow/thesis/thesis9.htm" rel="nofollow">http://scaa.usask.ca/gallery/arrow/thesis/thesis9.htm</a></p>
<p>Gives original sourcing,&amp; is "accurate"as a guide.</p>
<p>If we do not rewrite,I would suggest that we cut the "Political &amp; Black Friday" sections right out of the Article. These two sections are embarrassing to wikipedia. Mr. Campania , as a source, is "special" at best.</p>
<p>Heck, Arthur Haileys' "in High Places" Novel, fictionalizing the Arrow cancellation, is a 'published work,' too. }:-')</p>
<p>I believe Bill &amp; I have "truced".</p>

I've been observing this guy for a few weeks, and he edits mostly Vietnam-era US warplane articiles. He has been inserting a lot of info lately, primarily from a book by Hobson (what he inserted that you thought was vandalism) on US activities in the war.</p>
<p>His major problem is that he seems to have no interest in learning how to use Wiki's proceedures to cite his additions properly. I do believe he has registered (I forget what name), but has gone back to his IP for the last few days. Other editors have posted links on how to cite on his IP userpage, but he has eitehr not bothered to read them, or otherwise ignored them. Since diplomacy is not my strong suit, I haven't directly approached him on the issue beyond my usual edit-summary mini-lectures.

<p>Two thoughts - there were two Sublette families bumping around the USAF when my Dad was in - we ran into them, usually responding at the base pharmacy for "prescriptions for Sublette"! The last time I remember encountering them was circa 1971-72 at the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norton_Air_Force_Base_ec73.html" title="Norton Air Force Base">Norton Air Force Base</a> dispensary in San Bernardino, California... That may be the Sublette you encountered...</p>
<p>Also - in regard to roundels - the Hercules has been used in both civil and military operation - I am using flagicons for the civilian registered aircraft, and roundels for the military.</p>

<p>There seems to have some confusion regarding the EC-18B ARIA. It was origianlly part of the "ARIA" page, but most of the page dealt with the EC-135N/E aircraft used for that mission. We merged the ARIA page into the EC-135 article, and and now the links in the <a href="../../../c/-/1/C-137_Stratoliner_5bcd.html" title="C-137 Stratoliner">C-137 Stratoliner</a> for the EC-18B end up in the EC-135 article. Some changed the EC-18 link today to <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_707.html" title="Boeing 707">Boeing 707</a>. Since there is no text in the EC-135 page describing the EC-18, I think maybe we should find a blurb on it (and the C-18 too), and put thatg in the C-137 article for now, with the C-18/EC-18 links redirecting there.

<dd>Ah, I knew there was a link I'd missed a while back. I've redirected it to <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_707.html#Military" title="Boeing 707">Boeing_707#Military</a>, where all the C-18 variants are currently listed. I did this mainly to make them all consistent; I have no objection to putting the info on the C-137 page and make that one the central repository for the military 707 variants. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 19:07, 12 March 2007 (CST)</dd>

<p>By civilian, I mean non-military. I think we could include former military models in civilian service in the article, at least a brief text mention, at least enough to justify a few pretty pics. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 11:38, 15 March 2007 (CST)</p>

<dd>Sounds good. It is definitely a pretty helicopter! Helitack 408 was, afterall, rebuilt to 205 standards. Also, you might want to consider including the B210 in the article. If you're not familiar with it, it's the current "production" civilian version. Essentially, Bell is taking old H-model airframes, completely disassemblying them and rebuilding them as "new" FAA-certificated aircraft. The main difference between the 205 and 210 is that the 210 uses the 212 rotor system. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 12:22, 15 March 2007 (CST)</dd>

<p>OK, good. I've heard of the 210 briefly; it looks odd being mentioned on the UH-1 page, so I think this will be a better fit, esp as we want to cover civilian use/conversion of former military models.

I was going to put it in the 204/205 test page, but I noticed the link to the fire page, so I checked it out.

<p>On the UH-1N: when you state "since it's a popular aircraft under this name in the civilian world)", do you mean that the Ns are often called 212s in the civilian world? We do have the 212 page for the civilain variant, so I just want to be sure I undersatnd what you mean. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 19:00, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Dang, I'd forgotten about the 212 page. Yes, Ns brought into the civilian world sometimes are referred to as 212s. For example, the one that lives 2 hangars down, a retired Canadian CUH-1N/CH-135, operated by <a href="../../../n/t/p/NTPS_ce40.html" title="NTPS">NTPS</a>, is <a href="http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNumSQL.asp?NNumbertxt=212TP" class="external text" title="http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNumSQL.asp?NNumbertxt=212TP" rel="nofollow">FAA-registered</a> as a 212. If we're gonna have separate articles (which I certainly don't object to!), maybe to avoid confusion, in the N article, the designation "212" shouldn't be generally used in the text (as it is in the opening paragraph), to avoid confusion.<a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 19:15, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I thought you might have forgotten, but was giving you the benefit of the doubt. THe text is from the 212 page, so it still needs tweaking in that regard. THe development part of the text is the same on both pages too, but different when it starts referring to models. I'll be trying to work on adding some text to both pages, but I have printed sources, so it may take awhile. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 19:23, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>On the UH-1Y, I had read somewhere, back when they were going to do rebuilds of the N, that they had decided to keep the old N/212 nose. THe pics I've seen of the UH-1Y look like the old nose to me. Now that most Y's will be rebuilds, things may have changed tho. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 19:00, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You may be right on the nose. The 412's is a little longer, to accomodate more avionics. Can't really tell from the pics. FWIW, the Y also has a number of other differences from the 212/412 that I've noticed: The landing gear crosstubes are different, obviously it has a different T/R (and on the opposite side), and the elevators have been moved quite a bit. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 19:15, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Found out I was wrong about the nose difference. Our 412s have an extended nose to accomodate radar, but it's not standard. The standard 212 and 412 noses are the same. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 15:30, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, thanks. I've got the split completed, but the Intro/Lead still needs some rewriting. Also, the operators section in both articles still covers both KA and SKA. I might contact Piotr, the resident Operators guru, and see if he can help sort them out. Copy throught the text may still need tweaking to refer to the right modles, and the part on production covers both.

<p>I found two fairly nice pics on other language Wikis. The Japanese site has a nice pic of a C90 at <a href="../../../../ja/j/m/s/%E7%94%BB%E5%83%8F%7EJMSDF_LC90_YokotaAB.jpg_a3f2.html" class="extiw" title="ja:画像:JMSDF_LC90_YokotaAB.jpg">ja:画像:JMSDF LC90 YokotaAB.jpg</a>. The Polish version has a striking B200 at <a href="../../../../pl/b/e/e/Grafika%7EBeechcraft_Super_King_Air_B200_vr.jpg_49f0.html" class="extiw" title="pl:Grafika:Beechcraft_Super_King_Air_B200_vr.jpg">pl:Grafika:Beechcraft Super King Air B200 vr.jpg</a>. One is PD, and the other is GNU. See what you think. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 06:54, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I definitely like the 200, and I think the 90 is a dramatic angle and striking in its own way, but what turns me off about it is the lack of view of the cabin windows. Might be a great one for the PT6A page, and I can see it being used on the KA page until a better one is found. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 13:55, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, the majority of your sentence had just been stated, and in this country (as reflected in the preceding sentence), they're called "hurricanes". If you say "tropical cyclone", most American's won't have a clue as to what you're talking about. If your point was that it's inland and that's what protects the city, just add a phrase to the existing sentence to that effect. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 03:06, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As far as the term "tropical cyclone" goes, when referring to <i>my</i> edits, I chose "tropical cyclones" over "hurricanes" because a hurricane is a type of tropical cyclone, along with tropical storms and tropical depressions. (This is the definition by the <b>US</b> National Hurricane Center (<a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutgloss.shtml#HURRICANE" class="external text" title="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutgloss.shtml#HURRICANE" rel="nofollow">see here</a>).

<p>Akradecki, why make these images smaller? The detail shown at the level I intentionally put them at allows for detail not otherwise visible (i.e. the two in formation, you cannot now see the back one's windows at all. Nothing in Extended image syntax explicitly states that it MUST be in the THUMB format. If it <i>must</i> be, then all of the aircraft pages need to be redone since almost all use the <i>Infobox Aircraft</i> layout and those pictures are too large.

<dd>I have the max resolution available, so size is the issue here. While the picture size can be controlled by adjusting your preferences, the default is 180px.
