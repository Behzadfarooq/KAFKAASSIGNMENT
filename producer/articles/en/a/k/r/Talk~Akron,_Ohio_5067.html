<p>i think you should add more to akron ohio iyt had a lot more to offer now that the downtown area is looking alot better like the civic theatre university of akron, akron aeros stadium etc...</p>
<dl>
<dd>As a resident of Akron, I was sort of dissapointed that there was no reference to any local sports at all. The Akron Aeros (Cleveland Indians AA farm team) are perrennial division champs. some other sports include the Racers (Pro Softball), International Basketball, (I forget the name, but there IS a team), University of Akron sports like Football (conference champs), Mens Soccer (ranked #1 in nation for most of last year, #7 this year), Mens Basketball (Post season NIT), Womens Track (Conf. Champs in indoor, outdoor and Cross Country last year) LeBron's "King James Tournament" and that TV show on MTV2. Also, the PGA Firestone Invitational. I think sports could be its own section. If it is possible, please do this. Sports are paramount in this this part of the world. Believe me.</dd>

<p>I don’t think it was necessary to remove Fairlawn’s Summit Mall. I realize it is not in Akron, but it is quite close and serves a large part of Akron’s population. The only rational I had for leaving it in was the picture of Summit Mall, which I had a particular liking for. Sorry about all the spelling errors, I didn’t bother to proofread it. Other possible points of expansion: breakdown of neighbourhoods, dining, and entertainment.</p>

<p>I thought about it when I removed the wording describing Summit Mall as part of Akron. While it is obviously part of the Akron area, the article is titled "Akron, Ohio". The picture was nice and the content was otherwise good, but someone reading the article who isn't from the area would assume that Summit Mall is in the Akron city limits, just like Chapel Hill and Rolling Acres. The article should be able to stand on its own without prior knowledge required so that is why I made that change.</p>
<p>UltraSkuzzi, you are adding a lot of good content. I feel sort of bad going through and correcting things but I want to keep things accurate so that is why I'm making changes here and there.</p>

<p>Hi. it's me, twitch. i think you should emphasize the fact that lebron was born here. put it in the main article, not tucked away at the end. other than that and a handful of punctuation and spelling errors, none of which are really important, it's amazing!</p>

<p>I agree Bernie, the metro is exaggerated. However, it depends on what the metro area is said to be. I based Akron’s on what the Cleveland article said. I'm not sure how that number came about. I think they added up Summit, Portage, Medina, Cuyahoga, and Stark Counties to form that number. Since there is no defined metropolitan area, at least in censes terms, what should it be defined as? I would like to reach a conclusion on this since this would affect articles on other cities as well... - UltraSkuzzi</p>
<dl>
<dd>I took the definition of the metropolitan area from the Census Bureau <a href="http://www.census.gov/population/estimates/metro-city/03mfips.txt" class="external text" title="http://www.census.gov/population/estimates/metro-city/03mfips.txt" rel="nofollow">metropolitan area list</a>, where it listed Summit and Portage counties. I realize that defining a metropolitan area includes a lot of judgment and some politics, but I figured the 2-county Census Bureau definition provides a standard measure. --<a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeirne_2721.html" title="User:Beirne">Beirne</a> 12:39, Mar 15, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Metro area of Cleveland-Akron is 2,945,000 and does not include Stark County (Canton). It includes Lorain, Cuyahoga, Lake, Geauga, Portage and Summit Counties. Stark county is its own MSA. If Canton's MSA is included, the popoulation is more like 3.5 million.</p>

<p>I noticed that the article is up to 33K, 1K over the preferred maximum size. The limit isn't critical anymore but it helps keep articles manageable and easy to read. Should we split it up? If we do I'd suggest putting the neighborhood section in its own article since it is the largest section and can stand well on its own. --<a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeirne_2721.html" title="User:Beirne">Beirne</a> 00:54, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>That sounds fine...just make sure that the Akron properly refers to it.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if the neighborhood section is properly referenced, it took me about a minute just to find it buried in the article, perhaps it could be placed in a more prominent location?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I placed it the way the Related topic links are done in the Cleveland article, which seemed fairly standard. I'm not sure where else it could go but post any ideas that you have. I did notice that the Cleveland article lists the neighborhoods in the article with links to some of the neighborhoods. That is a possibility, although some of the articles will be short on their own.</dd>

<p>Can TWC position 23 really be considered 'public access', doesn't position 15 serve that purpose. I've never seen anything on 23 that wasn't TWC sanctioned.

<p>A little bird told me (okay, I got interviewed) that the Akron Beacon-Journal is planning to run an article about Wikipedia, with a possible sidebar of some Akron-related articles that are redlinks or stubs, to encourage people from Akron to get involved.

<ul>
<li>its not an "official" nickname. It is a nickname used by citizens. The reason for listing nicknames is for when somebody says, "yeah my friend lives in krackron", they go to wikipedia type in krackron and see akron.

<p>A reliable resource to prove that citizens of akron refer to it as krackron would be records of akron citizens using it, which can be found scattered within myspace and other popular chat sites, but not all bundled together on one site. This is just one of thoes things that work differently from other info put on wikipedia.</p>

<p>The publications section of the Akron article recently had Rager Media added as well as 4 of their titles. Rager Media appears to be in Medina, and the books are not about Akron, although the authors appear to be from the city. Prior to Rager being added, the publications list included publishers in Akron or books about Akron. Should Rager and their books be on this page? Their inclusion here is close to commercial promotion. --<a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeirne_2721.html" title="User:Beirne">Beirne</a> 20:10, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
