<dd>I don't think you will find it possible to write a verifiable article on 2 Dickinson that satisfies notability requirements. You are welcome to try, but I think the effort doomed. It has no significance I can think of outside of Princeton, and frankly, it isn't that significant even on campus. Of course, I am doubtful about whether the eating clubs should have their own articles. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 21:27, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>One can do it either way. If I respond on your page and you respond on mine, we each get notified, but it is harder for others to follow the argument, assuming they care. If we keep the thread on one page, then one of us has to watch the other's page, but third parties can view the conversation as a whole.</dd>

<dd>Procedurally, a speedy deletion differs from a proposed deletion. {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}} is a request for unanimous consent for deletion without discussion, so a single objection is decisive. {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-group_fcf7.html" title="Template:Db-group">db-group</a>}} is an request for an administrator to make a ruling that the article is out of bounds, while {{<a href="../../../h/o/l/Template%7EHoldon_e375.html" title="Template:Holdon">holdon</a>}} is a request to the administrator to wait, which he/she is not obliged to honor. In this case, the rule is that the article must make a reasonable case for notability. Wikipedia gets so many people trying to boost their organization (we call them vanity articles) that we need to be pretty strict about them.</dd>

<dd>There is an appeal process, called <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a>. It resembles a legal appeal in that the merits of the underlying deletion are not relevant, only the procedural question of how. In the case of a speedy deletion, that's not much of a distinction, since only specific reasons qualify.</dd>

<dd>I don't find the "X has an article so why not Y" argument very persuasive. Others do. My reasoning is that if X shouldn't have an article, we don't generally improve Wikipedia by also having an article on Y. Generally, we would be better off deleting X. BTW, any registered Wikipedian may nominate for deletion, so if you honestly feel those articles should go, you have a remedy.</dd>

<dd>Some thoughts that may be helpful. I'm not sure if A Princeton Companion would pass muster as a reliable source or not, but that might be a place to start. Are you near campus? You might also try looking in the archives to see if Freddie Fox has something on the subject. Showing influence beyond campus will probably be vital. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 21:51, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks -- I am not near campus and haven't been there for a long time. In the deleted talk pgae for the entry, there were references to off-campus publications. I believe there was a contentious history of the creation of 2D in the 1970's that would be covered in the entry. 2D also played an important part in the Princeton Living Wage campaign that was in the national news. I do think there are arguments for preserving the entry beyond its equivalence in importance to the <a href="../../../e/a/t/Eating_clubs.html" title="Eating clubs">Eating clubs</a> that are covered, but I would like to request at least a few days to build up the entry. I had a {{<a href="../../../h/o/l/Template%7EHoldon_e375.html" title="Template:Holdon">holdon</a>}} request on the earlier revision, which was marked for speedy deletion, but an administrator removed <b>both</b> the holdon tag <b>and</b> the speedy deletion tag, noting that it was not an appropriate candidate for speedy deletion.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/j/k/User%7EAjkessel_f2c5.html" title="User:Ajkessel">Ajkessel</a> (<strong class="selflink">talk</strong> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ajkessel_e123.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ajkessel">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd>It is polite and helpful to always sign, even on your own talk page. You have three options I can see, depending on your tolerance for procedure.
<ol>
<li>Request deletion review at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">Wikipedia:Deletion review</a>. The problem with this is that all the sources were Princeton-related sources, which look to an outside like self-promotion. Neither the Daily Princetonian nor PAW look like third-party independent sources -- remember that most campus newspapers and alumni rags are mere house organs.</li>
<li>Request undeletion to user space at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_undeletion_17bc.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for undeletion">Wikipedia:Requests for undeletion</a>. State your belief that you can make a policy-conforming article in time. The article will be named something like User:Ajkessel/Two Dickinson. Once you have improved it, note clearly on the talk page that this is new and improved content, not the same content previously deleted, then move it back to the title you want.</li>
<li>Start from scratch.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>I hope this helps. Good luck. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 22:15, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Any editor, including someone who worked on the article, is more than welcome to comment on AFD. While only administrators can delete, any editor, can nominate to delete and offer an opinion on any open debate. (We don't call them votes, because the closing admin is supposed to judge the relative merits of arguments as well as looking at the numbers.) While your position should be obvious, you should (once and once only) indicate your position in <b>boldface</b>. Options include, <b>keep</b>, <b>delete</b>, <b>merge</b> (meaning "keep, rewrite as part of another article and change the article to a redirect"), and "userfy" (meaning "move to user space and then delete the resulting redirect"). <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 00:50, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
