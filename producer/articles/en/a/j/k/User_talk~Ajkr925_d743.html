I notice the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you have not created this file yourself, then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use it on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you did not create the file yourself, then you need to specify where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the file also doesn't have a copyright tag, then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} tag can be used to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media meets the criteria at <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a>, use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>.

<li>The project has a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Military_history_Outreach_1b23.html#Newsletter" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history/Outreach">monthly newsletter</a>; it will normally be delivered as a link, but <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Military_history_Outreach_1b23.html#Delivery_options" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history/Outreach">several other formats</a> are available.</li>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Gwf logo.gif</b>. The image description page currently specifies that the image is non-free and may only be used on Wikipedia under a <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">claim of fair use</a>. However, the image is currently <a href="../../../o/_/_/WP%7EO_c91c.html" title="WP:O">orphaned</a>, meaning that it is not used in any articles on Wikipedia. If the image was previously in an article, please go to the article and see why it was removed. <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">You may add it back</a> if you think that that will be useful. However, please note that images for which a replacement could be created are not acceptable under fair use (see <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html#Policy" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">our fair use policy</a>).</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other unlicensed media, please check whether they're used in any articles or not.

Note that any fair use images not used in any <b>articles</b> will be deleted after seven days, as described on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#Images.2FMedia" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">criteria for speedy deletion</a>.
