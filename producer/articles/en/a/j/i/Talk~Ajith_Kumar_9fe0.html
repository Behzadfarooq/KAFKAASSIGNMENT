<dd>If only Ajith knew his own BO pull... Ullasam was dubbed into Telugu as well. Nobody dubs a flop movie. Maheswari was cast again in Ullasam after Nesam. Nobody casts a heroine from a dud for second time. Btw, the link you gave says Vaali was a bigger hit than Padayappa. Do you accept that? LOL Btw, both links you have given are interviews by Shoba Warrier. Its most likely her POV.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Tabloid will write anything for dramatic effect. But fanclubs keep attendance records of each show in each screen everyday. I have seen the 50th day posters for Nesam, Raasi, Ullasam and Rettai Jadai Vayasu. In Pagaivan, Ajith did guest role only.</dd>

<p>Yes Mr. Ganesh, see i was the one who expanded this stub article of Thala Ajith by adding pictures and details...but see some other fan overglorified it...and even i feel bad about the article...I have even mailed in the yahoogroups that u dont need to exaggerate events about Thala to make it fascinating..bcoz it naturally is fascinating...the beauty of Ajiths story is his come back...when he is written down and out...he bounces back with full energy...Fan who is editing this article shud understand that im Ajith fanatic... Even Ajith wont like the article...BE HONEST.</p>

<dd>Dude, you are the one who is vandalising Ajith's page. I am a Ajith fan. Stop removing links to songs, trailers, whole paragraphs, Telugu filmography and white spaces.

<p>The users <a href="../../../a/n/w/User%7EAnwar_saadat_808d.html" title="User:Anwar saadat">Anwar saadat</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrin_f3e4.html" title="User:Prin">Prin</a>, including some suspected sockpuppets, have recently been involved in a reversion war in the <a href="../../../a/j/i/Ajith.html" title="Ajith">Ajith</a> article. This is distracting and confusing for other editors trying to edit the page, so I'm going to ask the involved parties to stop reverting until they can agree on a suitable version. Please note that both of you have already violated the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">three-revert rule</a>.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, the only major difference between the two versions that each of you advocate is the format of the filmography. Anwar prefers a bulleted list with external links to raaga.com and indiaglitz.com, while Prin prefers the {{<a href="../../../a/c/t/Template%7EActingFilmography_4e57.html" title="Template:ActingFilmography">ActingFilmography</a>}} templates. Neither version is incorrect, and neither version is vandalism. They are two different ways of presenting practically the same information. Personally, I don't see the point in using a complicated set of templates when a list works just fine and is more flexible. Then again, the templates do add aesthetic pleasure to the article.</p>
<p>If there are any other significant differences between your respective verions, please explain them <b>specifically</b> so that I can understand exactly what the problem is.</p>
<p>Once again, if either of you revert the article before reaching an agreement (especially within 24 hours), you will be cited for violation of the three-revert rule. And even more importantly, <b>do not</b> change or remove other users' signed comments on this talk page or any other pages.

<p>While you're fighting over the filmography hasn't anyone noticed the rather bad way in which this article is written? What's up with all those exclamation marks? If someone were to try and edit this article to do something about the very bad style all their changes would be lost once it gets reverted again.

<dd>Almost every paragraph in the Film Career section ends with an exclamation mark - it reads more like a fansite than an article.

<dd>Its not POV. Editors who negate this article as such have their own POVs that are anti-Ajith and pro-Vijay. For instance, if they give evidence as to the box office status of a film, we can accept it. But they don't and simply brand it as a flop on the basis of tabloid. However fanclubs have access to trade books and know exactly the worth of their icon. This article is as brutally honest as it gets unlike the page on <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajinikanth.html" title="Rajinikanth">Rajinikanth</a> which is sheer idoatry!

<p>The article was full of extraneous material. I pruned it ruthlessly, and also the external links. We're down to the IMDB site and the official site. The filmography needs to be re-organized -- usually the recent films go on the top. I'm not sure about leaving the links to the songs. This is probably copyright infringement and might get WP in trouble.</p>
<p>Anwar, if you want to set a fansite for Ajith, you'll have to get your own site. WP is supposed to be an encyclopedia, not a shrine to a beloved actor. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 07:45, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Anwar, we do not have to include all "facts" about a subject. There are such things as balance, proportion, readability. Your version is hagiographic, POV, original research in many cases, and just not up to encyclopedia standards. I am not the only person saying that. I came here because other editors in the Indian cinema project complained that you would not allow anyone to edit "your" article. Do consider that if you want people to know and love Ajith, the article must entice them to read all of it. It must sound balanced and trustworthy. Then they're likely to want to rent some of his films. If you want to make new fans, let us edit the article. You are not doing Ajith any favors. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 16:30, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What you think as POV is common knowledge in Kollywood. Again I ask "Do you know anything about Kollywood mechanics at all?" There is <b>NO</b> original research involved in this article. Don't throw out words randomly. It's clear you didn't bother to check through the links provided. The article, as it stands now, is very well balanced and supported by hard facts. It's the best-written piece of all actors in Kollywood. Several editors are asking me to improve the writeups on other actors like Surya, Vijay and Vikram too...</dd>

<dd>Srikeit, that's being too kind. Anwar is right, I don't know that much about Kollywood in particular. I just know something about Bollywood and about the Indian film industry in general. However, I can tell when an aricle is not neutral, after working on Indian actor/actress articles for two years. Anwar's version is not neutral. As I told him on his talk page, this article should be written so that if someone who despised Ajith were to read it, that person would say, "Well, at least it's accurate." That means if any judgments are to be made, they should be quotes, not declarations. We don't say "Ajith is a super-star". We can say, "Critic X declared that "Ajith is THE super-star of Tamil cinema, in his article in XXX." We don't use a lot of bold, we don't use exclamation points. It's also rather boring to have a long list of "He appeared in this film, he appeared in that film" when all the information should be in the filmography or in articles on the movies.</dd>

</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It would help a lot if Anwar were to join the Wikiproject, to socialize and debate with the other editors. If actors, directors, etc., can work in several industries, then it's up to us as fans to be similarly inclusive. And cooperative.</dd>

<dd>I'll try yet another edit in a few days. Some friends are getting married on Saturday and I've got to finish sewing a fancy salwar kameez (made from a sari) in time for the wedding. But Anwar could also help by turning judgements into quotes, and perhaps pruning some of the fan language. Some one else could try melding my version and Anwar's. If we work from both sides, perhaps we can meet in the middle. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 06:15, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You have fiddled with salary figures changing them from 35 million to 3.5 million (35 lacs). What's up? Are you a Vijay fan? The nickname <b>Thala</b> is neither POV nor hagiographic. Its <i>de facto</i> now. Surely you must be aware o fit now.

<dd>It is wrong for you to revert my edits. I removed the salary since the template shows annual salary while you are reporting per movie salary. I have already explained on your talk page the reasoning behind removing 'Thala'. I am a fan of no actor. You have put back all the link spam in. Please stop reverting edits done by others.

<dd>Salary field is automatically converted by Wiki as <i>annual salary</i>. Can't help it. Anyway this info is qualified by the suffix <i>per film (2003)</i>. That solves the problem. <b>Thala</b> means Ajith in Kollywood. All tabloid unanimously use this nick when addressing him. See the half-a-dozen links provided already in the article. Period. See article on Vijay, Rajini, Kamal and Vikram for their titles. 2nd warning.

<p>I don't want to do anything without discussion but I have neutrified everything. Please may Mr saadat not change this.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>His journey so far is testimony to what resilience can achieve. It is also an indicator of the possible pitfalls. Born into a multiethnic family, his mother is a Sindhi and father Malayalee, Ajith dropped out of school early and took to fixing up automobiles. It was there that he picked up the penchant for roaring engines. He became a keen bike racer. He dabbled in small businesses before trying out modeling to make good use of his handsome looks.</p>
<p>His first film was in 1992 in Telugu titled <b>Prema Pustagam</b> which was a runaway hit. In Tamil, he made his debut in <b>Amaravathi</b>, for which he was paid a paltry Rs. 390! His next film was <b>Pavitra</b> which came after a gap of 17 months as he was recuperating from a racing injury. With these two films, Ajith came to be recognized as the romantic hero of the next generation. In an industry where a celebrity father or producer would mean an easy passport to stardom, Ajith built up his reputation single-handedly from scratch. That is also the reason why he is loved despite some forgettable snipes in the media.</p>
<p><br />
In 1995 came <b>Aasai</b> and it changed his destiny. The film which was directed by <a href="../../../v/a/s/Vasanth.html" title="Vasanth">Vasanth</a> also had mind-blowing performance by <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prakash_Raj_ba2a.html" title="Prakash Raj">Prakash Raj</a>. With Aasai, Ajith became established as the pining lover who could rough up the baddies. The film ran for 210 days and offers began to pour. He followed it up in 1996 with <b>Kadhal Kottai</b>. Directed by Agathiyan, this gentle romance became a runaway hit and fetched a National award for direction. Ajith had surely arrived. Between 1996 and 1998, came a string of films like <b><a href="../../../a/m/a/Amarkalam.html" title="Amarkalam">Amarkalam</a></b>, <b>Uyirodu Uyiraga</b>, <b>Ullasam</b>, <b>Kadhal Mannan</b>, <b>Rettai Jadai Vayasu</b> and <b>Aval Varuvala</b>. <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simran_%28actress%29.html" title="Simran (actress)">Simran</a> was his pair in Aval Varuvala. All these films did well and brought him a good name. But he was also hounded by constant media attention about his health problems and his on and off affair with actress Heera. When she walked out on him, he went into a depression.</p>
<p><br />
He strode out with <b>Unnai Thedi</b> and <b><a href="../../../v/a/a/Vaali.html" title="Vaali">Vaali</a></b>. Vaali, which marked the directorial debut of <a href="../../../s/2E/j/S.J._Suryah_158e.html" title="S.J. Suryah">S.J. Suryah</a> was the unconventional story of a man lusting for his unsuspecting younger sibling’s wife, played by <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simran_%28actress%29.html" title="Simran (actress)">Simran</a>. Ajith did wonderfully as the two brothers. The film ran for packed houses for 270 days! Anandha Poongatrey, Mugavari and Poovellam Un Vasam were all creditable films.</p>
<p>Ajith moved on to being the action hero with <b>Dheena</b>, <b>Citizen</b>, <b><a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_%28tamil_film%29.html" title="Red (tamil film)">Red</a></b> and <b><a href="../../../v/i/l/Villain_%28tamil_film%29.html" title="Villain (tamil film)">Villain</a></b>. The fact that these films were being released in more and more theatres especially in rural areas and that the distributors were happy that they could recover a major portion in the opening week, brought him the nickname, <b>King of Opening</b>. He has worked in guest roles in many films mainly to help out young directors. The audio rights of one of his films, <b>Kandukondein Kandukondein</b>, were sold for 2.5 crores – an unbeaten record so far!</p>
<p><br />
Yet there were some flip instances to what fame and fortune could do to a perfectly simple man. He started a long running war of words with another young hero and in the process antagonized several seniors in the industry. Many felt that Ajith had probably acquired a bloated ego to make up for professional failures like <i><a href="../../../j/a/n/Jana_%28film%29.html" title="Jana (film)">Jana</a>'</i>. He also refused to do films and instead decided to take up <a href="../../../f/o/r/Formula_3.html" title="Formula 3">Formula 3</a> racing. After finding reasonable success on the track, he quit when he met with a near-fatal accident. He came back with <b>Anjaneya</b> and <b>Ji</b>, but both failed.</p>
<p>He then set about with the task of making up for lost time and regaining his place in the industry. His first comeback film, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paramasivan.html" title="Paramasivan">Paramasivan</a>, released for Pongal this year has been declared a hit. His other release, Thirupathi, has been doing moderately well. He has shed a lot of weight and looks much more dashing than ever.</p>

<p>Hello, everyone, instead of reverting it again, let's talk about it: *no* biography of any actor or actress includes the box office fact - if you want to mention how long a movie stayed in cinemas, write it into the movie`s article and not on the actor's page. The same things applies for cast &amp; crew members - this information also belongs on the page of the movie. I think it's more important to note the role, so non-Tollywood viewers learn who Ajith is and what role he played. Believe it or not, there are plenty of people out there who don't know about him (yet.) --<a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlumcouch_6211.html" title="User:Plumcouch">Plumcouch</a> 18:49, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have a problem with the Tamil box office info expressed as number of cinemas in which film was shown, and number of days it stayed. That doesn't BEGIN to touch on income, and profits. It strikes me as a mystification adopted by film distributors, to avoid saying anything that might be used against them in terms of taxes. But if we want to understand what films succeeded, and which gave the cast and crew some industry clout, we need the real figures. I agree that all of this info (if info it is) should be in the movie articles. We can however say that "the film did well at the box office" or "the film was not a box office success" or such mild statements, in the actor/actress's bio. Use of terms like megahit and flop sounds hysterical and should be avoided. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 20:46, 15 May 2006 (UTC) (being stuffy)</dd>

<p>Dear fellow editors, I have removed the "Challenging roles"-section, because I feel that it is not up to us to judge which role is challening. If you can cite a well-known critic, such a section might be appropriate, but just noting Ajith's most popular movies and describe them as challenging simply will not do: That's not neutral and not POV.

<dd>You asked for a third opinion on <a href="../../../3/o/_/WP%7E3O_1830.html" title="WP:3O">WP:3O</a>. I agree, the "Challenging roles" list is redundant with the table. I have also removed some lists that were in two places in the article, the information doesn't need to be repeated verbatim twice.

<p>I trimmed the article of all fangush and unnecessary detail. The career section should not just repeat the filmography. There are a great many unreferenced statements, and the awards section needs a lot of work. We need the names of the awards he won, and links or references. I may have left some utterly trivial awards.</p>
<p>I <i>beg</i> the Ajith fans to refrain from reverting or adding more fan-worship. A dignified article is a better tribute to Ajith than a long, meandering, unreadable article full of over-the-top praise for the actor. If anyone who is not already an Ajith fan visits the article, a good article might induce that reader to look up some of his films. A bad article will send the reader away with a bad taste in his/her mouth, and no desire to see any Ajith films at all. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 09:32, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The awards section still needs work. We need to say exactly WHAT awards he won. Best actor? Supporting actor? Villain? New face? I'm not sure what awards are given by some of the organizations; I'm most familiar with Filmfare. A number of the awards need references. Also, if it's a major award ceremony, I think even nominations should noted. There must be some -- a bevy of awards usually means some noms as well. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 08:06, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

The article should reference <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, which does not include other wikipedia articles. Several wikipedia articles are listed in the references section. Please also review <a href="../../../r/e/f/WP%7EREF_ecd4.html" title="WP:REF">WP:REF</a> for guidelines on how to format references; full citation information (author, title, publication, date of publication, date of retrieval) should be included, instead of just a URL. Also, please change the 'notes' to 'references' section header.</p>
<p>I have a problem with this sentence in the LEAD: "He is currently <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_India_4a4b.html" title="South India">South India</a>'s most popular actor, with fan bases worldwide beating the number of fans for <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajinikanth.html" title="Rajinikanth">Rajinikanth</a>." It is unsourced, and appears to be largely hearsay and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. Please check the article for other sentences and statements such as this.</p>
<p>The references to <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_rupees.html" title="Indian rupees">Indian rupees</a> should probably have some reference to the indian rupee article to assist non-Indian readers in identifying the currency. "Rs 500 million" is hard for a non-Indian to identify; but "<a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_rupee.html" title="Indian rupee">Rs</a> 500 million" at least has the link so we know what currency is being referred to.</p>
<p>Most of these are minor, but I also don't think it's quite ready for GA status based on the heated debate tag (lacks article stability). It looks like things are calming down, but I think it would be good to wait a little while to make sure the edit wars have cooled off before moving forward to GA status. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek.cashman_b6d7.html" title="User:Derek.cashman">Dr. Cash</a> 21:18, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
