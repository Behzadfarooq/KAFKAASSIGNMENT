<table style="border:solid 1px #ccc; border-collapse:collapse;" border="1" width="100%">

<th></th>
<th>AJAX</th>
<th>Flex</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Advantages</b></td>
<td>Pre-built frameworks can be leveraged, familiar to those who know HTML, JavaScript, etc. no need for additional software past an up-to-date browser, open standard.</td>
<td>The Flash Platform provides a true application platform as a virtual machine that’s browser / platform independent, including a JIT compiler and strong typing.
<p>The very intention for the Flash Player was to provide a container to perform operations like rendering complex animations and filter thousands of data sets at the same time, thus providing a desktop-like experience with comparable performance on the internet.</p>
<p>Very capable IDE, Images are part of a flash movie and can't be downloaded directly, supported by Adobe, XML based language, ability to leverage flash components into the application, great speed increase over previous versions of flash (if that was even possible).</p>
<p>Moreover the code only needs to be written once instead of several times for each browser as is the case with JavaScript/AJAX.</p>
<p>Flex Builder has design mode for those non-programmers interested in building Flex applications</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Disadvantages</b></td>
<td>No IDE, no browser standards (slight alterations per browser), hard to build components outside of frameworks (in general), images and other data open and available.
<p>JavaScript support might be disabled on end-user browser because of the security reasons.</p>
<p>Ajax / DHTML applications are subject to each browser’s implementation of the DOM and often require developers to provide workarounds for each variation thereof; this inherently creates additional, unnecessary code and ultimately adds to the development timeline. Large Ajax applications with rich user experience = large development effort.</p>
<p>AJAX applications leverage the browser as the application platform something it was never intended to be used for. The browser is nothing more than a text-based rendering engine, and was never conceived as a container for client-side applications.</p>
</td>
<td>Needs the flash player, Need to learn and XML-based language and possibly ActionScript to build real applications.
<p>Rare issue, but Flash 9 could be disabled or not installed {There are some solutions for software deployment, like MS SMS.}</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Development Models</b></td>
<td>AJAX is the mesh of several, common client-side technologies, overcoming the browser compatibility issues often requires expert knowledge of each browsers interpretation of the DOM, and usually leads to hack-like workarounds. Even if you’re using an Ajax / DHTML toolkit, you’re still subject to the pains of cross browser issues.
<p>Ajax often entangles both HTML and JavaScript to create rich user interfaces where the end result is a tightly coupled client application that’s often difficult to maintain and extend.</p>
</td>
<td>The Flex workflow and programming model follow a more traditional approach familiar to application developers. Flex applications are implemented using a combination of declarative tags (MXML) for the user interface / presentation and a scripting language (ActionScript) for complex business / application logic.
<ul>
<li>MXML is an XML based, declarative language that’s similar to HTML and is used for layout.</li>
<li>ActionScript is a strongly typed, classed based OO language analogous to Java, but with the flexibility of a scripting language.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the MXML and AS aren’t native to most traditional app developers, the development paradigm is a similar model to that of JSP and Java development, making it an easy transition for seasoned developers.</p>
<p>Flex Builder offers a professional IDE based on Eclipse, with the usual myriad of tools an application developer expects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Debugging is built on top of the Eclipse Debugging Framework and provides common tools like setting breakpoints and watching variables</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Cost</b></td>
<td>Some of them free, but AJAX frameworks that more or less can be considered as compete ones with Flex are quite expensive, the cheapest one is Backbase with price starts from $2,000 per CPU.</td>
<td>Free
<p>Flex 2 includes a number of free features, such as the Flex SDK (software development kit). The real changes, though, are in pricing, where Adobe is looking to reduce the cost of simple Flex deployments.</p>
<p>With Flex 2, Adobe is permitting free single CPU deployments of Flex applications using the Flex Data Services 2 Express or XML and Web Services. Previously, Flex users paid $15,000 per CPU to get started with the Flex SDK, which was part of the Flex Presentation Server.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Bandwidth</b></td>
<td>Sometimes requires transmitting application bits and pieces as well with actual data.</td>
<td>Less bandwidth for data, since it passing just data, with no need to pass application bits and pieces</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Performance</b></td>
<td>Slow, bad code can affect performance of whole application and even freeze browser.</td>
<td>Flash is much faster than JavaScript and Flash will improve in the future as the flash player gets faster. JavaScript however will not increase in speed much in the future as it is an interpreted language.
<p>The performance implications of running a complex Ajax application are subject to the browser’s ability to interpret JavaScript and determine the type at runtime is it a string, a number, an object? Whereas ActionScript 3 (AS3) eliminates type look-up because its strongly typed and compiled into bytecode rendered by the Flash Player VM this facilitates better responsiveness in your application.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Expandability</b></td>
<td>Hard to create custom components. Third-party components might not work with existed ones, browse incompatibility issues.</td>
<td>Easy to create own custom components and re-use them within application.
<p>The Flex Framework provides a rich, robust, and extensible set of UI components that facilitate rapid UI development with MXML, the declarative presentation layer. Furthermore, MXML is simply an abstraction to ActionScript (MXML is compiled to it’s complimentary AS objects under the covers — it’s analogous to what JSTL is for Java), enabling developers to create complex, custom components with a blend of MXML and AS.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Data</b></td>
<td>Ajax support XML. With Ajax, and XML in Flex, you are creating and parsing xml on the client and server. In general xml parsing is slow, you'll never notice it will small records. But a grid with a couple of hundred or more records and you will notice it. This is when AMF shines.
<p>AJAX typically requires some type of data transformation in the middle layer and client side, adding an unnecessary performance overhead on both sides of the wire, eg:</p>
<ul>
<li>Client makes an asynchronous HTTP request for data</li>
<li>Request is mapped to a servlet / JSP that uses JDBC to query your database</li>
<li>Data is transformed into an XML doc (or JSON) and sent as an HTTP response</li>
<li>Client receives the XML and must parse it into useable data</li>
</ul>
<p>Flex can make calls directly to the back-end by invoking methods on Java objects, like POJOs or EJBs. These objects are transparently serialized and deserialized by the FDS application, mapping your client-side ActionScript objects to your back-end Java VOs, DTOs, or whatever other pattern(s) your architecture enlists; the developer is just left to expose the java objects to the flex client via a couple thin lines of xml in remoting-config.xml.</p>
</td>
<td>Flex supports XML (http or web services), AMF (a lot smaller and faster), RTMP (push), data services, native data type support, Value Objects.
<p>FDS (<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/dataservices/" class="external text" title="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/dataservices/" rel="nofollow">Flex Data Services</a>) provides the ability to perform data push from the server in the form of pub / sub messaging; there’s a Java adapter that allows Flex clients to subscribe to JMS topics and additional adapters can be written to subscribe to legacy / other messaging systems. In addition, FDS provides data synchronization, an API that abstracts the action of capturing all the data deltas on the client and persisting them to the server, thus enabling developers to focus more on the application and business logic. FDS allows provides data paging for large data sets and handles temporary disconnects transparently to the developer.</p>

<td><b>Data pushing</b></td>
<td>Not supports. AJAX is browser based, and therefore limited by the “request/response” paradigm.
<p>Somewhat functionality could be achieved with Adobe Spry Framework for example, that does let you hook up an XML feed to your front end and automatically refresh it at a certain interval.</p>

<tr>
<td><b>Security Vulnerableness</b></td>
<td>Security researchers have found what they say is an entirely new kind of web-based attack, and it only targets the Ajax applications so beloved of the “Web 2.0” movement.
<p>According to <a href="http://www.fortifysoftware.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.fortifysoftware.com/" rel="nofollow">Fortify</a>, 11 of the 12 Ajax frameworks it tested did not have safeguards in place against such attacks. The company did not, however, test the attack against any live applications.</p>
<p>Vulnerable frameworks include: Microsoft ASP.NET AJAX (aka. Atlas), XAJAX and Google Web Toolkit, Prototype, Script.aculo.us, Dojo, Moo.fx, jQuery, Yahoo! UI, Rico, and MochiKit.</p>
