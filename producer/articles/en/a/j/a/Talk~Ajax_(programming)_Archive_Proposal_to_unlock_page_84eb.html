<p>Isn't it possible to just prevent <a href="../../../s/l/e/User%7ESleepnomore_fb9f.html" title="User:Sleepnomore">User:sleepnomore</a> from editing the page and allow all others to do so? Technology like Ajax is rapidly changing, and locking this page is absurd.</p>
<p>Sleepnomore, I hate the term Ajax too but just deal with it or leave Wikipedia.</p>
<dl>
<dd>No. Unless the ArbCom has made a ruling, Sleepnomore is allowed to edit any Wikipedia page. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 22:26, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What sort of evidence would ArbCom need to consider? Can wikipedia determine all IP addresses he has used when he has been logged on? And then determine if he stays behind a proxy, or uses an IP that is readily identifiable with being from his area, which he freely divulges on his user page? Or, if some combination of proxied/non-proxied, whether there is a pattern, such as being behind a proxy at times when massive reverts have appeared on this and other pages he has been instrumental in having restricted? <a href="../../../j/e/m/User%7EJemptymethod_788b.html" title="User:Jemptymethod">Jemptymethod</a> 22:59, 15 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Once again, I'm forced to ask why I would be the one blocked from editing in the first place. Wikipedia admins blocked THIS page because of the vandalism from an anonymous IP. They blocked it because he was removing a criticism section that existed before I even joined wikipedia. I did in fact start a JAXASS article. I did, in fact, add a criticism section to Mr Garrett's article. I do in fact have a problem with Mr Garrett's renaming existing technology. But that doesn't negate the fact that this article is locked do to "Michael" aka "Catmistake" aka anonymous IP's continued vandalism and refusal to follow rules or listen to reason. I've made all attempts to bring this matter to a smooth close and all he seems to be doing is stir the pot. - <a href="../../../s/l/e/User%7ESleepnomore_fb9f.html" title="User:Sleepnomore">Sleepnomore</a> 16:55, August 17, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You have nobody but yourself to blame for having become a "person of interest". You yourself have previously "stirred the pot", to use your own phrase, through your characterization of your JAXASS article as a "direct antagonist" to AJAX, your link to your own blog with the caption "AJAX=FRAUD", and your prolonged conflicts with other users you have come into contact with from the AJAX article. You didn't seem to have much interest with the AJAX page for several days after JAXASS was deleted, but then when you did subsequently have a lot of involvement, it involved a revert war that resulted in the page being locked down. It seems like 95-98% of your involvement on Wikipedia has been with AJAX, user pages of contributors to AJAX, plus other pages those users have contributed to, and JAXASS. As you can easily find out I'm not AJAX' biggest fan, with a blog with two articles that are anything but pro-AJAX. So I think I can be impartial. But I also think your activity on Wikipedia needs to be investigated. If you have done nothing then you have nothing to fear. However at this point I don't think there is anything you can say to convince people not to consider you for this. <a href="../../../j/e/m/User%7EJemptymethod_788b.html" title="User:Jemptymethod">Jemptymethod</a> 20:14, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm actually rather proud of my work. I don't care to "blaim" myself for anything but providing insight that I felt relevant. Obviously, I choose to create a farcical technology called JAXASS and place this in its seperate article. When this failed, I did provide my own insight into Ajax and Jesse James Garrett articles. Criticism already existed for this article so I appologize for nothing in reverting it back after vandalism. Yes, a great deal of my time has unfortunately be involved in edits, reverts, and user talks concerning this technology. Its something I'm very involved in and obviously took the initiative to make sure that the other side of the Ajax argument was heard. Obviously, folks such as yourself are not interested in seeing all sides of an argument. You simply want your voice heard and anyone else should be damned for having a say. That's not the way this works here. I have, several times, welcomed an RfC. I question its legitimacy, but welcome the investigation. I have no fears with being the subject of an RfC so trying to convince anyone otherwise is not something I intend to waste time on. What I do intend to invest my time on is making sure that this situation isn't manipulated into a "lets bash the opposing opinion" rant as it already has. From what I've heard, the person who started Wikipedia left the project to its own vices for this very reason. It became a sesspool of elitist jerks who wouldn't let articles work in an NPOV. Take,for instance, the actions and threats against the administrators who simply locked the page after the anonymous vandal kept deleting portions of this page. He was simply trying to get to the bottom of the error while others continued to bash him and anyone else that expressed a different point of view. In fact, I saw several instances where the others who agreed with my side (even if only slightly) were accused of being my sockpuppets. It couldn't have <i>possibly</i> been that the opinion I was expressing does have a following, even if they don't all edit on Wikipedia. In any case, I don't intend to keep dragging this out. If you want to keep fighting a dead issue, you are more than welcome to and I'm up for the challenge. Otherwise, I suggest you get back to some real work now that the article is unlocked. - <a href="../../../s/l/e/User%7ESleepnomore_fb9f.html" title="User:Sleepnomore">Sleepnomore</a> 20:57, August 17, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You yourself couldn't make my argument any better, e.g. "People like yourself", "Elitist jerks", "my side", "up for the challenge" etc. Plainly judgemental and POV, yet then you yourself cite NPOV. Why so defensive? Again, if you had no involvement, you have nothing to worry about. You don't have to "up for the challenge"; you should be able to sit back knowing that nothing will come of it. 139.76.128.71 21:04, 17 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So when you state "my argument" you don't add your own POV? Strictly speaking, articles need to be POV, talks in articles do not. I say I'm up for the challenge because I am. If you have a problem with my comfort on this matter, perhaps you should be looking at your own relevance to this argument. - <a href="../../../s/l/e/User%7ESleepnomore_fb9f.html" title="User:Sleepnomore">Sleepnomore</a> 21:09, August 17, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
