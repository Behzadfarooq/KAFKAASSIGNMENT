<p>Should there be something in disadvantages that discusses the difficulty of maintaing session keep alives/ timeouts with AJAX?</p>

<dd>I believe that Ajax is here to remove timeouts, but perhaps I am wrong... Seriously, I don't know! <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooles_a5c7.html" title="User:Booles">Booles</a> 09:52, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I don't think so as session timeout is a general client/server issue and not specifically Ajax-related. Using Ajax will actually in many cases minimise the case of a session timeout as requests are sent more often to the server from the client. --<a href="../../../s/l/e/User%7ESleepyhead81_fac2.html" title="User:Sleepyhead81">Sleepyhead</a> 10:16, 2 August 2006 (UTC) sdf sf sdf sd sd sd</dd>

It further enables visitors to geo-browse Wikipedia articles on a map. I think a link to Pediax would be really interesting for the readers of the "Ajax (programming)" article, since it exhibits Wikipedia with AJAX support. soeren 21:11, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think any formal review is necessary for the external links we have now. They have survived peer review for months. Sugarskane initiated this review after things <a href="../../../s/u/g/User_talk%7ESugarskane_b6f7.html#Nomination_of_a_new_tutorial_entry" title="User talk:Sugarskane">didn't go his way</a>, but it's nothing personal. We have been over this time and time again: if we start listing Ajax libraries it quickly degenerates into a spamming match. It has happened many times before, until we just started deleting them all outright. Personally I quite like the idea of Feather Ajax, but a link directly from the article is not the right place to put it. <a href="../../../r/u/f/User%7ERufous_d1c1.html" title="User:Rufous">Rufous</a> 15:11, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just because something's been listed for months doesn't mean that it complies with the general policy for the article. Currently there is an external link to the Open Directory project -- I think this should stay. As for the other links, however, I think we DO need to bring some scrutiny. An argument of "That's how it's always been" is not valid -- if it was, we'd still have slavery and women wouldn't be voting. Please use your best judgment, rather than historical presidence, in deciding whether a link should stay. The following is my humble opinion of what's currently posted:
<ul>
<li>Reference links 1-4 are extremely good sources/references -- they aren't personal pages, and are exactly the type of source that one would expect in an encyclopedia</li>
<li>Reference link #5 (Remote Scripting with AJAX, Part 2) has no practical purpose for being listed as a reference. This should be removed.</li>
<li>Reference link #6 (Listen kids, AJAX is not cool) has NO business being listed as a reference. It doesn't comply with the typical criteria for being a reference. This should be removed.</li>
<li>External link #1 (Open Directory) - This is a great way to send people off to a series of links related to Ajax without cluttering up the page. Keep this!</li>
<li>Articles - Any of the articles, with the exception of the first two by Jesse James Garrett (creator of Ajax), should be removed. Articles by Garrett have historical value. The other articles are more like external links, and are no different than the hundreds of external links that have been removed from the article in the past.</li>
<li>Tutorials - The Mozilla should stay because it's a tutorial from the horse's mouth. If this were an article on ASP.NET, for example, I would say that anything by Microsoft should be added. Although Mozilla didn't come up with Ajax, it programmed it into its web browser. I would also add that any articles from Opera or Microsoft should be added, if applicable. Other than that, however, it is unfair to keep the two other tutorial articles. Either you add all the tutorials people want to add, or you stick to your guns and only add direct links to pages/companies that have programmed the infrastructure for Ajax.</li>

<dd>I agree that links should be always under scrutiny. The relevant guideline for external links is <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> and according to my reading:
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_Directory_Project_505b.html" title="Open Directory Project">Open Directory Project</a> listing should be <b>kept</b> as an appropriate web directory to this article. Its being open is a plus.</li>
<li>The Garrett articles should also be <b>kept</b>, not merely as external link but as references to be cited at appropriate places in the article's main body, to back up his original point of view.</li>
<li>This article: <i>http://www.ajaxinfo.com/default~viewart~8.htm Weighing the Alternatives - How Ajax stacks up against competing RIA approaches</i> is the textbook example of what "does not provide a unique resource beyond what the article here would have once it becomes an example of <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">brilliant prose</a>", and should be <b>removed</b>.</li>
<li>These two: <i>http://www.softwaresecretweapons.com/jspwiki/Wiki.jsp?page=JavascriptRefactoringForSaferFasterBetterAJAX JavaScript refactoring for safer, faster, better Ajax</i> and <i>http://www.sitepoint.com/article/ajax-screenreaders-work Techniques to allow screen readers to read off dynamically added content</i> are how-tos, which <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a>. I see no reason to keep them, so I'll <b>remove</b> them unless someone is going to convince us otherwise.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>As for the Tutorials, I would take an even bolder position: it's not Wikipedia's job to recommend any tutorial to the reader. It appears a bit too far-stretched to me to establish that Mozilla should make a better reference than everyone else as they do not hold exclusivity to this technology umbrella. As there does not exist any guideline for us to judge which tutorial to include and which not to (even though if Mozilla would win clearly if judged solely on fame, as fame is not the right measurement here), I would suggest to <b>remove all</b>. But I am open to all other editors' comment on this as well.</dd>
<dd>As for the cited references, they are not covered by <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> but instead <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, which is less clear-cut a guideline than the former. As I see it, link [5] (http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2005/08/22/ajax.html) is not a direct reference on the point of clear feedback to user as it only covers this topic tangentially. However in the absence of a better one this seems the best we can cite for this particular point, so that makes a <b>marginal keep</b> for me unless and until we find a better source as support. Link [6] (http://www.lastcraft.com/blog/index.php?p=19) is a self-published sources and does not fall within <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> as an acceptable source, so I'm going to remove that. The rest are all reliable sources and should be <b>kept</b>. --<a href="../../../p/k/c/User%7EPkchan_0b01.html" title="User:Pkchan">Pkchan</a> 14:47, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why to replace?</dd>
<dd>Because, those two tutorials force people to believe that they have to write the bunch of low-level script with direct access to the XMLHttpRequest in order to have an Ajax functionality in their own web applications. However, it is not true. It is even not close to truth today. It sounds sooooo 2005ish. Think about it! One and a half year brought the valuable solutions that make life much easy and allows to concentrate on the real business problems, but not on the low-level Javascript programming.</dd>
<dd>The nominated resource is a completely independent from any particular vender web site exclusively dedicated to the theme of ajax tutorials and presents the wide spectrum of helpful tutorials (no room for blah, blah, blah articles). Currently, ajax-tutorials.com contains more them 130 links to the existing tutorials and updated on the daily bases.</dd>
<dd>I believe, the readers need to have an access to such up-to-date information.</dd>

<dd>Links restored (save the first Garrett article, which is now referenced at the References section) pending further discussion here. I am more than happy to allow the links stay at the article for a couple of days to allow a more elaborated discussion, though I'd expect that a resolution would have been made by then.</dd>
<dd>I would like to note, however, that any discussion here should revolve around <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.

In particular, I do not find the argument that the links are "users need them" is convincing enough to keep them: you may find one link useful but another user may find it rubbish. The guideline we should follow is <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, according to which a link should be added if it adds something that it is difficult for the present article to include.</dd>

<dd>Our Ajax article, as it stands, is a very strong article describing what Ajax is, its history, pros and cons. What it does <i>not</i> include (nor <i>should</i> it include) is a description of how to implement Ajax. This is exactly why we should link to a few strong tutorials at the end of the article. This falls under <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>, “Sites with other meaningful, relevant content that is not suitable for inclusion in an article, such as textbooks.” — i.e. implementation instructions.</dd>
<dd>The dmoz link is peppered with links to Ajax frameworks, with little or no educational value, which we've tried and succeeded — over the course of many months and <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~daniel/WikiSense/Contributors.php?wikilang=en&amp;wikifam=.wikipedia.org&amp;page=Ajax+%28programming%29&amp;since=&amp;until=&amp;grouped=on&amp;order=-rev_timestamp&amp;max=100&amp;format=html" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~daniel/WikiSense/Contributors.php?wikilang=en&amp;wikifam=.wikipedia.org&amp;page=Ajax+%28programming%29&amp;since=&amp;until=&amp;grouped=on&amp;order=-rev_timestamp&amp;max=100&amp;format=html" rel="nofollow">hundreds</a> of edits — to keep out of the article. It is a useful inclusion to resolve disputes, but not nearly as useful as directly including good tutorials ourselves. I've been actively editing this page for a long time, and the tutorial collection we have come to agreement on has taken a long time to be decided on.

<dd>I don't think the Sarissa library link should be kept due to the total volume of Ajax libraries available. It does not seem right to add one link, but refuse "hudreds" of others -- it's a slippery slope either way. If Sarissa is kept, then you should allow the addition of additional libraries -- which would be far too numerous, and would make the article a collection of links. Conversely, if Sarissa is removed, then no users will be able to access Ajax libraries from the Ajax page. Would anyone consider a stub on Ajax libraries? Because Wikipedia is a repository of content, not links, and the Sarissa link shows favoritism toward one single library, I don't think the Sarissa link should be kept. As for the 'Building an Ajax Page', I still see this as a tutorial that is no different than the hundreds of other tutorials on the internet. Why is this one so special that it receives the sole spot on the article? Again, Wikipedia isn't a place to store links, and while it may be helpful, I think it is silly of the editors of the article to 'outlaw' any other tutorial links aside from this one. I still argue that they both should be removed. --Sugarskane 15:54, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The point of the link discussing the use of Sarissa is not to recommend Sarissa over any other libraries, so please do not characterise it as such. Each of the libraries available have their benefits and issues. It is not favouritism, as other leading libraries are listed in the tutorial. The mention of Sarissa in the link description was not in the spirit of the article though, so I have amended it to say it is discussing a generic “JavaScript library.” We need a tutorial that discusses the use of a library to create cross-browser Ajax without the user writing the code branching code themselves, and this tutorial runs through the design and implementation of a form submission script that does just that. Also, cf. <a href="../../../a/j/a/Ajax_framework.html" title="Ajax framework">Ajax framework</a>. <a href="../../../r/u/f/User%7ERufous_d1c1.html" title="User:Rufous">Rufous</a> 16:31, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd agree that this article can do with a few tutorial links. The problem is, what are the criteria for including a link and excluding others (because for obvious reason we can't include all relevant tutorials here). This is not only an editorial issue but also an issue of fairness and transparency, as Wikipedia is a high-traffic website and any link on this article is bound to generate quite an amount of traffic, and we have the responsibility to act fairly to the Ajax tutorials all over the world.</dd>
<dd>Would you please point to us those previous discussions which lead the Tutorial section to its current state? (I skimmed through the talk archives but didn't find much relevant discussion) Perhaps we can summarise the past criteria applied so that we can use such criteria to judge whether to include a tutorial link or not in the future and make this more transparent (by inserting in at the relevant section of the article as hidden text). --<a href="../../../p/k/c/User%7EPkchan_0b01.html" title="User:Pkchan">Pkchan</a> 18:46, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What other leading libraries are listed? Within the article, ARSCIF is listed -- but I can find no other libraries. The Sarissa/Javascript link should be moved to the Ajax Framework article -- it doesn't belong here if you are so insistent about removing 'hundreds' of other links. Judging by the history of the edits, it seems that when a tutorial or library is added, it is promptly removed (usually) without much discussion. Just because you want a short list of external links doesn't mean that any of the removed links shouldn't be listed, and just because you've been editing the article for so long doesn't mean you have ownership of the external links section, or the article itself. Can you point to the relevant discussion that Pkchan is asking for? The Mozilla link is just as informative as the <a href="http://www.xul.fr/en-xml-ajax.html" class="external free" title="http://www.xul.fr/en-xml-ajax.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.xul.fr/en-xml-ajax.html</a> link -- why are we including both? The "Sarissa" link isn't even the official Sarissa website! Sarissa belong in the Ajax Framework article -- you aren't learning Ajax if you are using a library -- you'd be learning how to use a prebuilt library. I still vote to remove all but Mozilla. --Sugarskane 17:47, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Rufous, I now understand why you've been holding onto the external links section with such fervor. Upon closer examination of your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Rufous" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Rufous" rel="nofollow">User page</a>, it appears that your name is 'Ross Shannon'.

I bet that's really giving you a lot of traffic. Due to neutrality concerns via WP:EL ("A website that you own or maintain, even if the guidelines above imply that it should be linked to."), I'm removing your link. You're more than welcome to look at my long discussion with this, as I too added an external link to my page. There are clearly more notable and significant articles on Ajax (the Mozilla link). I suggest you either release your vulcan death grip from the Ajax external links section, or you follow the rules you've been enforcing and leave your page off the EL section. --Sugarskane 17:56, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please see my comments earlier in this thread, I feel they are cogent. I sincerely believe that we need good instructional tutorials on implementing Ajax in a practical manner — which means using a library to abstract away the browser compatibility problems.

I have continually edited my tutorial so that it is — I feel — the best of its kind. It goes through the creation of a form submission script from scratch (one which works when JavaScript is disabled too).

<p>Should this section just be entirely removed? I buy the samy worm as an example of a worm that happens to use AJAX, but that seems to be all it is - Samy seems more like an exploit of secutrity flaws in MySpace and in browser handling of Javascript that an AJAX specific worm.</p>

<dd>The cited comment about the "surface" of attack that AJAX enables is interesting, but I've no idea where that citation comes from. As for the rest of it, I think it's bunk and misguided. AJAX hasn't given hackers anything new that they didn't have before: given JavaScript and HTTP GET you could do everything that the Samy worm did, years ago. It just gives hackers some new ways of doing old things. I mean, the only innovation (and it's not a small one, don't get me wrong) that AJAX brings is the ability to have server interaction without page reloads. That's it. Saying AJAX causes new security holes in sites is like saying a new brand-name of crowbars causes new security holes in cars. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 00:40, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The trouble with that Yahoo article is that it doesn't talk about security holes in AJAX, just that "AJAX can be used to do bad things". This isn't really an exceptional statement, as many things can and have been used to do "bad things". Looking up the two worms cited in the article, it appears the security problems were actually in Yahoo Mail and MySpace, and AJAX was just the tool used to exploit those holes. Like I said about, that's like saying HTTP GET has security issues because it has been used to exploit bugs in Yahoo Mail, or that a browser has security holes because it can be used to exploit security holes in broken web services. Certainly there are people who <i>think</i> AJAX presents new problems, but the article doesn't actually show that their beliefs are true. The only "security holes" in AJAX are the ones it inherets from JavaScript, the browser's implementation thereof, and the website in question. If they didn't have holes, neither would AJAX have "holes". — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 00:36, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now that end-user machines are becoming more powerful and bandwidth is becoming more plentiful, a web application server will have a more difficult task time-sharing between a large number of clients. To save resource costs, it may behoove web service operators to use Ajax to export much of the workload directly to the clients themselves. Workload performed by one client fails to distract the service provider from answering the queries of other clients, and also helps bring to bear computing resources that the client may otherwise be underutilizing.</dd>

<p>I've passed this article as a good article - nice work! A couple of things, though:</p>
<ul>
<li>I had a little bit of trouble relating some of the info in the History section to the Ajax concept, particularly "Remote Scripting Frameworks such as ARSCIF[5] surfaced in 2003 not long before Microsoft introduced Callbacks in ASP.NET[6]." A couple more sentences in this section wouldn't go amiss.</li>
<li>The pros and (especially) cons sections are missing references. I know there's not a lot of stuff to reference, but something like "This is possible because many browsers allow JavaScript to update the fragment identifier of the URL dynamically" would be easy enough to find a source for.</li>
<li>It's a little weird to say that Ajax means "Asynchronous Javascript and XML" and then say that XML is <i>optional</i>. I'd probably prefer it if it was mentioned in the same list as XHTML, DOM and XMLHttpRequest; but I'm not overly bothered by it.</li>

<p>An annoying trend that seems to have built a momentum of its own is the belief that Ajax is an acronym for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. It's not even a shorthand for that. Those technologies are used in Ajax, but it is a misnomer to equate them to Ajax. Jesse James Garrett himself has defined Ajax applications as meeting two criteria:<br />
1) Uses an asynchronous interaction model<br />
2) Utilizes native browser technologies<br />
Ajax is a TERM, not an acronym or even a shorthand - it's more like a classification or categorization of a way of approaching web application implementations. Someone please revise the text on the page to alleviate the confusion, and remove the reference to "Asynchronous JavaScript and XML". It was disturbing to hear many presenters at the 2006 AjaxWorld conference making reference to this pseudo-acronym, as it made me question whether they really knew what they were talking about.<br />

<dl>
<dd>I would say that if "many presenters at the 2006 AjaxWorld conference [made] reference to this pseudo-acronym", then that, in itself gives it a notable, and public-domain existence.

<dd>However, since Jesse James Garrett is the one who coined the term and he, himself, has mentioned in his presentations that Ajax is not an acronym, it just seems like perpetuating an inaccuracy does not make it valid (or a fact), just because so many people make references to it. Sounds like religion to me. -- 198.144.206.109 20:41, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm confused. You say he has mentioned it is not an acronym, but it's his very own paper that says "The name is shorthand for 'Asynchronous JavaScript and XML'". That pretty much makes any claim to the contrary pretty bogus.

<dl>
<dd>Exactly. I think this is splitting hairs. The A, J and X in "Ajax" refer to Asynchrony, JavaScript and XML. He didn't just pluck the word out of the air. I think the whole "not an acronym" problem stems from the fact that Garrett doesn't want the A to mean "and". In his original paper he used a plus. To argue over this is a waste of time. Whether it's an acronym or not is largely irrelevant—it <em>is</em> a shorthand. <a href="../../../r/u/f/User%7ERufous_d1c1.html" title="User:Rufous">Rufous</a> 15:38, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I removed the following, added by 87.203.160.112. While s/he may have the germ of an idea here, it does repeat information in the article and is not yet ready for the lead section. S/he also wrecked the References section, so it needed reverting pretty quick.</p>

<p><b>DHTML + XMLHttpRequest + ServerFiles = Ajax</b></p>
<ul>
<li>DHTML:Filters data for display on the page</li>
<li>XMLHttpRequest:Transfers data between the server and the page</li>
<li>Server Files:Provides data that is either static or dynamically generated</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
<i>How the classic Web user experience works</i>: Although someone can use DHTML, to make changes to the content being displayed on the screen, all of the data used to create the content(displayed or not) of a Web page must be contained within the code that was initially sent. If the user interacts with the page and new data is required to respond to what they have done, a new Web page must be sent from the server and loaded in the browser.</p>
<p><i>How the Ajax Web user experience works</i>: Ajax changes the classic Web experience by allowing the browser to go back to rhe server incrementally to make changes to the content, turning the Web page into a filter that processes data coming from the server. Instead of having to wait as data is sent to the server, the data is sent and received in the background while the visitor continues to work.</p>

<p>The articles explains how Ajax can save bandwidth with an example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With Ajax, the HTML of the page, e.g., a table structure with related TD and TR tags can be produced locally in the browser and not brought down with the first page of the document.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That seems like a poor example. Any data that's to be displayed in a table structure will be downloaded in XML format, which means that data is going to be marked up with some set of tags that organize it into multiple sets (i.e., rows) of related data values (i.e., columns). "TR" and "TD" at least have the benefit of being only two characters each. —<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELargoplazo_3f48.html" title="User:Largoplazo">Largo Plazo</a> 13:33, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
