<p>Dude- it is defintely bad information. Why do you want to include it? ( I am ignoring the possibility that yo uare just trying to cause trouble by posting negative information)</p>
<p>Pressman is not a good source of fatual data. Just because somebody wrote abook does not mean their facts are accurate. I consider this to be AT BEST third-hand information about Landmark that doesn't belong in an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>Now, unless this MEtro article you quote- but I can't find- references financial documents that actually support the spurious "50%" of pre-tax revenue it is ridiculous. The license thing I think was true until Landmark bought out the licenses.</p>
<p>Can you email me a copy or an image or something of this metro article?</p>
<p>Thanks, Alex</p>

<p>I am reviewing the reversal of edits that he did to my recent edits on the Financial Ties page where he said he did so after getting your agreement. Did you agree to him reversing my edits? I am trying to take out all the irrelevant BS that he is committed to having in this supposed "encyclopedia" and he seems to think that since you are a SL for LE, you have some sort of override on others editing the article for accuracy.</p>

<p>Hi AJackl, User:71.246.200.170 starting 4:25 11 Jan posted 6 edits to LE page, User:Smeelgova removed all? of them in 4 edits ending 4:52. Checking on the talk page of 71.246.200.170 I find Smeelgova has welcomed them and shortly after placed a vandalism warning on the page. 71.246.200.170 has no prior posts on any subject. The content of their edits appeared, to this outsider, of medium-low to medium-high quality with no content indicating vandalism. I have posted to Smeelgova asking for an explanation and expressing my concerns at their actions. Will wait for reply - hopefully Smeelgova will make this all clear. Do yo have any thoughts/insights on the events? <a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmithBlue_06f3.html" title="User:SmithBlue">SmithBlue</a> 06:40, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would rather not commment on this too much(content not contributor right?) except to say that I wholeheartedly agree with your position. I also agree the changes were reasonable and of decent quality. I do have an admitted bias against people who don't sign in and fllow fair protocol, but I also agree that we should give newbies a lot of space in the interest of engendering as much participation as possible in Wikipedia.

<p>Thanks for all of your improvements to Wikipedia. I noticed you have created the new article <a href="../../../l/e/a/Learning_Standards_b2fe.html" title="Learning Standards">Learning_Standards</a>. I am somewhat concerned that the links you have supplied all violate <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> since you appear to be involved with all of the organizations/websites. I encourage you to also take a look at <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> - the guidelines for external linking. At the moment, there is a strong movement against edits that appear to be aimed at search engine optimization (see <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Spam_bdee.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Spam">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Spam</a>). Your actions, although they may be well intentioned, may fall under suspicion. In cases of <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> where you feel compelled to contribute, one course of action is to offer the links or edits on the talk page of the article and let other editors decide if they are appropriate. Good luck with your future contributions. <a href="../../../n/p/o/User%7ENposs_32e4.html" title="User:Nposs">Nposs</a> 21:36, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your that. While I appreciate what you said I think you may be taking a too literal stance on that policy. I may BTW be off on this and am willing to consider that. The "Learning Standards" article is a good example of that- the organizations that most of those links point to are the standards organizations that hold the standard for containing the learning standards. I am a national expert on this which is why I am writng an article and it and therefore I belong to a lot of the standards bodies. The one organization that isn't is an aggregation site and I don't have personal knowledge of who "owns" that resource - it could be a government project or a private organization. I don't know - it just acts as a content agrregator. It makes the article a stronger article, because it allows someone interested in learning standards to actually get at some of them. BTW: I will be enhancing that article as I go on but decided to be bold, start it and see if I could get some others to start fleshing it out.</dd>

I myself am gearing up to participate in the anti-vandalism project, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Vandalism_studies_700b.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Vandalism studies">Wikipedia:WikiProject Vandalism studies</a>. I am committed that vandalism, spam, and bad faith POV edits be combatted at all fronts because I believe Wikipedia may become one of the most awesome source of shared knowledge on the planet. It is why I am spending so much time here- it is importnat to remember to not assume anything and don't believ ewhat you are told. The fact that Smee actually spoke about my edits as "LinkSpamming" is a clear indication of POV. I am committed that we not use rules to hide attempts to control rather than inform. I look forward to dialoging with you on this... <a href="../../../a/j/a/User%7EAJackl_fc2f.html" title="User:AJackl">Alex Jackl</a> 02:51, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Great article written to user AB I could not agree more. Don't pay any attention to AB he is inactive. This is all fake and he hasn't done the proper research to make any choices and he is not up to date on wikipedia he has been offline since Nov. Please disregard!</p>

<p>I am telling you this was not intended as vandalism. It is following on from <a href="../../../a/s/p/Talk%7EAsperger_syndrome_c0a4.html#Assburger_issue" title="Talk:Asperger syndrome">my earler query as well over Assburger</a>. Whilst i have never heard it pronounced like that until i came here, i just wanted to check. How have you heard it pronounced? I have posted something similar to this on the talk page. <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimply_south_c93c.html" title="User:Simply south">Simply south</a> 15:18, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Nice work on editing this page. It is in pretty sad shape and I do not know enough about E-learning to re-write it. I simply try to keep all the linkspam off of there since it seems to be a magnet for such. Feel free to make any changes, sweeping or otherwise, if you find sources and such! cheers -- <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick_Berry_38b7.html" title="User:Patrick Berry">Patrick Berry</a> 13:44, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Vandalism_studies_700b.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Vandalism studies">WikiProject on Vandalism studies</a> recently finished its first study and has published its conclusions (a full and detailed copy of the conclusions can be found <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Vandalism_studies_Study1_34ba.html#Official_conclusions" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Vandalism studies/Study1">here</a>).</p>
<p>The first study analyzed a randomly sampled pool of 100 random articles. Within these 100 articles there were a total of 668 edits during the months of November 2004, 2005, and 2006. Of those 668 edits, 31 (or 4.64%) were a vandalism of some type. <b>The study's salient findings suggest that in a given month approximately 5% of edits are vandalism and 97% of that vandalism is done by anonymous editors. Obvious vandalism is the vast majority of vandalism used.</b> <i>From the data gathered within this study it is also found that roughly 25% of vandalism reverting is done by anonymous editors and roughly 75% is done by wikipedians with user accounts. The mean average time vandalism reverting is 758.35 minutes (12.63 hours), a figure that may be skewed by outliers. The median time vandalism reverting is 14 minutes.</i></p>
<p>Currently the project is working on a related study, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Vandalism_studies_Obama_article_study_5562.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Vandalism studies/Obama article study">Wikipedia:WikiProject Vandalism studies/Obama article study</a>, and is also beginning to draft up the parameters of our second major study (see <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Vandalism_studies_Study2_bd23.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Vandalism studies/Study2">Study 2</a>). If you are still interested in our work (your name is on the participant's list), please participate in our efforts to help create a solid understanding of vandalism and information on wikipedia by contributing to discussions of past studies or by helping plan up and coming ones.

<dd>Sure can! Go over to Study 1's talk page and give your thoughts on the data, any other ways we can interpret it, any other ways to look at it, critiques of Study 1's procedure and findings, etc. You can also go over to Study 2's talk page and start talking about the next study (it is pretty up in the air right now, we're trying to amass lessons learned from the last study currently so share your iedas)! <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeSmack_29f9.html" title="User:JoeSmack">JoeSmack</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoeSmack_db43.html" title="User talk:JoeSmack">Talk</a></sup> 05:47, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
