<h2><span class="mw-headline">Concrete Example?</span></h2>
<p>Doesn't this example just describe using javascript to re-order a table? There's nothing asynchronous about this example, there's no XML being used. At best this example is really only an example of Javascript. Short of deleting it, maybe it could be re-written to show how client side javascript functionality (as described) could be extended using AJAX to actually change the content being displayed in the table, rather than just reordering the table.</p>
<p>--<a href="../../../s/l/e/User%7ESleepyhead81_fac2.html" title="User:Sleepyhead81">Sleepyhead81</a> 10:51, 20 July 2005 (UTC): The example could very well use XMLHTTPRequest to get an XML document from the server. But if the result is just to change the order then client-side javascript would do the trick as well - there wouldn't be a need to get a new list from the server and use the DOM to manipulate the table displayed. A better example is probably instant editing - clicking save and the changes are saved without refreshing the page.</p>
<p>--- I agree that the potential use of all client-side Javascript made that example a bit muddy for beginners; I replaced it with a new example, based on how <a href="http://www.flickr.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.flickr.com/" rel="nofollow">Flickr</a> allows caption editing. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelfuego_7a53.html" title="User:Delfuego">Jason</a> 02:46, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Patent threathens Ajax?</span></h2>
<p>I just learned today that there is a US patent granted today that (might?) threaten Ajax:</p>
<p>See: <a href="http://www.ADSSee" class="external text" title="http://www.ADSSee" rel="nofollow">also: [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/srchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=7,000,180.WKU.&amp;OS=PN/7,000,180&amp;RS=PN/7,000,180 United States Patent 7,000,180 Balthaser February 14, 2006</a></p>
<p>In short:</p>
<p>"The patent--issued on Valentine's Day--covers all rich-media technology implementations, including Flash, Flex, Java, Ajax, and XAML, when the rich-media application is accessed on any device over the Internet, including desktops, mobile devices, set-top boxes, and video game consoles."</p>
<p>"It's kind of unbelievable that (the patent) has such a wide ranging use because it covers so many technologies," says Bola Rotibi, a senior analyst at Ovum, an IT advisory firm in London. If the patent is enforced broadly, she says, "anybody who does anything with rich applications will have to pay royalties to the company."</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Is latency a pro or con?</span></h2>
<p>I'm confused here. In "Pros and cons", it is said that the main advantage is the speed at which an AJAX application runs and responds to user interaction; due to the client-side scripting taking place which reduces the amount of per-interaction network traffic. Later on in "Criticism", "critics focus on the technical issues AJAX raises, beginning with network latency" (with this <a href="http://www.lastcraft.com/blog/index.php?p=19" class="external text" title="http://www.lastcraft.com/blog/index.php?p=19" rel="nofollow">link to someone's blog</a> that goes on about how AJAX is no good because of latency). Wha...art??? -- <a href="../../../j/i/n/User%7EJin_9a70.html" title="User:Jin">Jin</a> 23:06, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That post talks about usability problems with Ajax. I have updated the critisicm section. --<a href="../../../s/l/e/User%7ESleepyhead81_fac2.html" title="User:Sleepyhead81">Sleepyhead</a> 13:20, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>In terms of latency itself, it's a con -- as in, the fact that things that used to be instant are now dependent on the speed of the network might be confusing to users. (The advantage that's discussed in the article isn't related to latency per se, but rather, to the slowness of a browser needing to render an entire page when updating a small section of the page would do just fine.) The latency issue DID highlight a confusing part of this article, though, namely that the distinction between what is a "con" (in the pro/con sense) and what is a "criticism" is a little muddy. Thus, I combined the two sections into "Pros, cons, and criticism", and then clarified the latency issue a bit. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelfuego_7a53.html" title="User:Delfuego">Jason</a> 16:38, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Even now I think the criticism paragraph on latency is a bit on the negative side. I've been <a href="http://richui.blogspot.com/2005/09/ajax-latency-problems-myth-or-reality.html" class="external text" title="http://richui.blogspot.com/2005/09/ajax-latency-problems-myth-or-reality.html" rel="nofollow">doing some research</a>, and it seems that network latency is just something you need to consider carefully during AJAX development. If make a proper interaction and technical design, web applications will be <i>more</i> responsive. If you make mistakes, usability and responsiveness will suffer. Is it OK if I try a small rewrite of the latency paragraph? <a href="../../../j/e/p/User%7EJepc_bce5.html" title="User:Jepc">Jep</a> 18:35, 4 September 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Have at it! (That being said, there's not a lot in the paragraph to lend a ton of credence to the argument, but rather, it exists just to give a nod to the argument.) <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelfuego_7a53.html" title="User:Delfuego">Jason</a> <small><a href="../../../d/e/l/User_talk%7EDelfuego_f845.html" title="User talk:Delfuego">t</a> [[Special:Contributions/Delfuego|c</small></dd>

<p>Jason, could you please state some examples of "things that used to be instant are now dependent on the speed of the network"? --<a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirils_0ca2.html" title="User:Kirils">Kirils</a> 14:48, 27 February 2006 (UTC).</p>
<p>I'm not Jason, but here you go.</p>
<p>There are two forms of latency. The first latency is the request to response latency when you perform a post/get operation (page load). The second latency is when you use a control on the page (control latency).</p>
<p>AJAX, overall, has more latency -- there is more overhead, because you have more requests and each request carries the overhead. However, AJAX, typically, has lower perceived latency -- and the perceived latency is what actually matters.</p>
<p>If you have two controls side by side, and the value of the second control is dependent on the first control, a non-AJAX DHTML page will update the value of the second control immediately. It will have a high page load latency, but a low latency while you are working with the page. An AJAX DHTML page will have to issue a web request when you change the first control in order to populate the second control, and so the second control will have a higher perceived latency than the non-AJAX version.</p>
<p>The principal of "user distraction" states that the perceived latency of a change in an application's state is driven by the proximity of the parent field (the field that the user changed) and the child field (the field that the program is changing), as much as by the actual latency. If you have a process that takes 20 seconds, but you have 20 fields the user has to update while it is going on, the user is unlikely to notice the pause.</p>
<p>If you look at Google search results, for example -- if you used AJAX on Goggle search results for the various result pages, the user experience would be improved. The user just keeps reloading the same page over and over again, with different results. If you can spool the results in the background, while the user is scrolling, the user perceives no latency when they go to the 150th search result by scrolling through the list in order, because you've already retrieved that data in the background.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Search Engine Accessibility</span></h2>
<p>The entire Search Engine Accessibility section seems to be an ad for Backbase, something I realized after I removed the spammy Backbase link that ended the section. I'm deleting the entire section for now, as the entire rest of the Ajax article makes the point the section is making, and doesn't do so as a pretense for laying the foundation of a "problem" that's solved by the good folks at Backbase. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelfuego_7a53.html" title="User:Delfuego">Jason</a> <small><a href="../../../d/e/l/User_talk%7EDelfuego_f845.html" title="User talk:Delfuego">t</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Delfuego_af3c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Delfuego">c</a></small> 00:58, August 30, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Jason, I think Search Engine Accessibility is a very relevant topic for AJAX applications. I have added the link to provide more indepth information on the topic (the article is not a plug, but a contribution to a generic AJAX problem). If you know otehr articles about this topic as well, please include them. Let's be open, and cooperative instead of just deleting contributions. If you like you can contact me at info at backbase dot com. August 31, Jouk.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm happy to be open and cooperative, but Wikipedia isn't a manual, it's an encyclopedia. In other words, saying that Ajax provides challenges for search engine accessibility is appropriate, but providing detailed information about how to overcome the challenge is better left for a computer manual (perhaps the Wikibooks contribution that's linked at the bottom of the entry). <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelfuego_7a53.html" title="User:Delfuego">Jason</a> <small><a href="../../../d/e/l/User_talk%7EDelfuego_f845.html" title="User talk:Delfuego">t</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Delfuego_af3c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Delfuego">c</a></small> 12:53, August 31, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>OK, I just read over the addition about search engine accessibility, and it really seems like it's trying to be a manual. It would be just as easy to flesh out the pros/cons section so that the line that talks about bookmarking problems extends this to be a search-engine problem as well (since they're the same problem); it doesn't feel like WP's the place to go into this much detail on proposed solutions, though. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelfuego_7a53.html" title="User:Delfuego">Jason</a> <small><a href="../../../d/e/l/User_talk%7EDelfuego_f845.html" title="User talk:Delfuego">t</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Delfuego_af3c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Delfuego">c</a></small> 13:51, August 31, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The "Search Engine / Deeplinking" section makes absolutely no sense in the context of the rest of this article. It is not a general piece of relevant information about Ajax. At best, it's a tip for Ajax developers (which doesn't belong in an encyclopedia article); at worst, it's a self-serving advertisement from an unscrupulous company, which surely qualifies as graffiti. This section should most definitely be deleted (though I'm not doing so at this time). --<a href="../../../i/q/p/User%7EIQpierce_edb9.html" title="User:IQpierce">IQpierce</a>, 16:52 (Central Standard Time), November 3, 2005</p>
<p>I agree completely that this section should go. I read this article for the first time today, and it stands out as so obviously inappropriate that I went straight to the discussion page to determine why it's even there. It's been over a month since the two comments above this one were made, with no show of support in the meantime. How about we delete it in 24 hours from now? <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHoadley_9d5e.html" title="User:PaulHoadley">PaulHoadley</a> 01:48, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>1st: Free, no sign-in.</li>
<li>2nd: Free, sign-in required.</li>

<dd>It _is_ using ajax. Personally, I don't care if the digg link stays on this page or not, but please, check the facts before assuming anything. Check the javascript sources of the website if you're still skeptical. Anderiv 04:33, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I think singling out Digg over the handful of other more-blatantly-spammy links is a bit unfair. But I think Sleepyhead has an important point. The reason for the <b>Free to use</b> and <b>Sign-up required</b> sections was to filter and contain the linkspam. Personally, I'd really like the links to simply show off Ajax techniques discussed in the article without any kind of signin. But this article was flagged as a "hot-spot for user in-fighting" so I've been reluctant to boldly prune the spammy links (and I'm thinking of others—not Digg). -<a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamol_f759.html" title="User:Gamol">Gamol</a></dd>

<li>I came to read the article and added a link last night. After reviewing the rules this morning, I realize that the link should be considered by the community. I linked to <a href="http://wordlwideworlds.com" class="external free" title="http://wordlwideworlds.com" rel="nofollow">http://wordlwideworlds.com</a> in the first paragraph of the section on History of Ajax. I referenced a site called Valley of the Nile which was built in 1997 as an example of a very early implementation of Ajax compatable with Netscape 4.0 and completed prior to the devlopment Microsoft Remote Scripting. I added it primarily to verify that Ajax techniques preceded Microsoft Remote Scripting and that they are well-tested and stable. jlbeezer 18:07, 4 March 2006 (GMT)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The addition mentioned in the previous entry was removed with the comment "unable to verify. probably spamlink". It's unclear which part of the addition was considered unverifiable. You can view source to see that Valley of the Nile works with Netscape 4.0 and the layer specification (<a href="http://worldwideworlds.com/main/mainframe.html" class="external free" title="http://worldwideworlds.com/main/mainframe.html" rel="nofollow">http://worldwideworlds.com/main/mainframe.html</a>). The site was built in 1997 for Netscape 4 and updated in 1998 to work with both 4.0 browsers available at the time. The earliest documentation was by Project Cool in August of 1999 (<a href="http://archive.devx.com/projectcool/sightings/auto_prev.asp?imonth=8&amp;iyear=1999" class="external free" title="http://archive.devx.com/projectcool/sightings/auto_prev.asp?imonth=8&amp;iyear=1999" rel="nofollow">http://archive.devx.com/projectcool/sightings/auto_prev.asp?imonth=8&amp;iyear=1999</a>). This site is important to the history of Ajax because it verifies that Ajax techniques were in use, stable, and practical for the development of web applications much earlier than commonly stated. I will replace the line pending a more detailed counter-argument or a better suggestion about how to inlcude the information. jlbeezer 02:07, 6 March 2006 (GMT)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">New Criticism: Fragility of Model</span></h2>
<p>I actually think the biggest weakness of Ajax is that the entire developmental model is quite fragile. Consider that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The fundamental technology, HTML, was never intended to be used for pixel-precise layout, and has been "forced" to do this via browser hacks and odd CSS enhancements</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Ajax doesn't require pixel-precise layout.
<dl>
<dd>No, but most AJAX applications *do* require enough pixel-specific space to support any images or content inside of them. This is contrary to the nature of HTML, which is supposed to be a markup language. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobbyslaughter_1525.html" title="User:Robbyslaughter">Robbyslaughter</a> 03:48, 17 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's beside the point. It's not Ajax that has this requirement. You are mistaking correlation with causation. It might or might not be true that "most" Ajax application require pixel-specific layouts (I don't believe you've cited any evidence for this claim), but they don't require these layouts because they use Ajax, and if Ajax wasn't present, they'd still have the same problems. <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogtha_806a.html" title="User:Bogtha">Bogtha</a> 20:33, 3 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's a good point. I concur that you don't <i>necessarily</i> need pixel-precise layout to make an Ajax application, nor do you need it to make any web page. What I'm really trying to say is that HTML wasn't designed for this purpose, so using it is a fragile technique. That's dangerous enough on static web pages, which will probably at least render something even if they look ugly, but Ajax applications have the potential <i>not to work at all</i>. So, does this commentary go anywhere in Wikipedia?<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobbyslaughter_1525.html" title="User:Robbyslaughter">Robbyslaughter</a> 16:08, 9 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Why do you claim that the effects of pixel-specific layouts are worse in Ajax-using pages than static pages? I see no basis for thinking so; the bad effects are a layout issue caused by layout code. How the information arrived in the browser in the first place is irrelevant to this. --<a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogtha_806a.html" title="User:Bogtha">Bogtha</a> 18:12, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Indeed. Unfortunately Robby, you are wrong. You are continually conflating generally designer-caused problems with weaknesses in Ajax, when it is simply not the case. "Pixel-perfect" layout for example, would be a problem with CSS, and nothing to do with this article. I know that you mean well, which is great. But please read up on these topics some more, put them into practice, and you will see it <i>is</i> possible to create usable, fast, solid Ajax applications that still work in browsers that don't support <a href="../../../x/m/l/XMLHTTP_7322.html" title="XMLHTTP">XMLHTTP</a>, if you know what you're doing.

<dl>
<dd>To respond to Bogtha: Effects caused by pixel-specific layouts for interactive pages seem generally worse than static pages. Obviously I can't argue that they will <i>always</i> be worse, but it seems that in general, if you futz up your static page design, people will still be able to read the content. But, with an AJAX application, the user may not be able to interact with it at all. That seems worse.
<dl>
<dd>Why are you giving static pages a free pass? There's no reason to assume that if you screw up your page design, it will remain readable for either static pages or pages using Ajax. This is entirely a layout issue. In addition, a Wikipedia article should have established fact, not "it seems that in general..." opinions. --<a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogtha_806a.html" title="User:Bogtha">Bogtha</a> 16:19, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To respond to Rufous. Your example is <i>great</i>. If all AJAX applications worked as well, I would not have brought up this point. I have been going over it in my head and am not really sure if you *could* build Google Suggest as robustly as your example. But, that doesn't necessarily invalidate your counter argument.</dd>
<dd>I work extensively in web development, and (believe) I am very familar with all the issues. I appreciate the recent comments as constructive. I'm now convinced that the pixel-specific layout issues that some designers unwisely force upon users with poor HTML/CSS are not necessarily a problem with AJAX, since they can be avoided. I rescind this particular critique. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobbyslaughter_1525.html" title="User:Robbyslaughter">Robbyslaughter</a> 22:55, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Much of the code for Ajax depends on browser detection, and behaves differently</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>This is not true. You seem to be looking at a few bad examples and assuming that it's caused by Ajax instead of developer ignorance.
<dl>
<dd>Many AJAX applications use XMLHttpRequest, which is not available in all browsers. Furthermore, it's possible to create a variety of "single page applications" using other JavaScript hacks with, say, IFRAMEs, which loosely fall under this category. These generally require browser detection, making this a fragile model.<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobbyslaughter_1525.html" title="User:Robbyslaughter">Robbyslaughter</a> 03:48, 17 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>XMLHttpRequest not being available in all browsers has nothing to do with browser detection. Competent Javascript developers use object detection, not browser detection.</dd>
<dd>Single-page applications are a specialised subset of Ajax with their own page, and the iframe technique you mention is a workaround for a specific bug in a specific browser - something that is extremely common in non-Ajax websites also. If you feel this is a legitimate complaint of SPAs, then by all means put it on that page, but it's not something general to Ajax. <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogtha_806a.html" title="User:Bogtha">Bogtha</a> 20:33, 3 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In general, though, Ajax applications are limited to a subset of web browsers and are based upon specific rendering behavior. This is contrasted with say, semantic recommendations like XHTML that ensure all content is rendered assuming the spec is enforced.
<dl>
<dd>When you say "in general", are you talking about a specific quality of Ajax, or merely common mistakes web developers make all the time? I believe the latter may be true, but that is not relevant to this article. I see no reason to believe the former.
<dl>
<dd>I'm talking about both. Ajax applications are very sensitive to the user browser, the configuration of that browser, the size of the window, etc. It's also easy to make mistakes in web development that still "render". The analogue---it doesn't compile---isn't really an issue for more rigorous technology stacks.<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobbyslaughter_1525.html" title="User:Robbyslaughter">Robbyslaughter</a> 22:55, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Static pages are very sensitive to the user browser, the configuration of that browser, the size of the window, etc. Again, you are pointing to a problem in page design in general as if it were unique to Ajax, while ignoring the fact that such problems apply to a page regardless of whether it is static or uses Ajax. --<a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogtha_806a.html" title="User:Bogtha">Bogtha</a> 16:19, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All programming requires precise code. The difference is, leave off a semicolon in your C source and it won't compile, but leave off a tag closure in HTML or use poor CSS that specifies pixel sizes and something still gets to the user. However, they might not be able to use it. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobbyslaughter_1525.html" title="User:Robbyslaughter">Robbyslaughter</a> 22:55, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, Ajax and static pages are equivalent here as well. Leave off a closing tag and your entire page could be unreadable in static pages. Use poor CSS that specifies pixels sizes, and "something" gets to the user in the same way "something" gets to the user if you do it with Ajax pages. Whether that "something" screws up the layout is entirely a factor of the layout in question, and not whether the page talks to a server or not. --<a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogtha_806a.html" title="User:Bogtha">Bogtha</a> 16:19, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Many of the browser paradigms break under AJAX (font resizing, printing, bookmarks, forward-backward navigation, images are optional, hiearchical markup, semantic adaption to non-visual devices)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Simply not true. Ajax has nothing to do with font resizing; that's CSS. Ajax has nothing to do with printing, optional images, hierarchical markup, or semantics. It touches on bookmarks and forward/backward, but there are solutions to that, so it's not true to say that Ajax "breaks" them.
<dl>
<dd>Go to Google Suggest with Firefox. Increase your font size a bit, and you'll see it doesn't work. AJAX apps depend on the underlying technologies (CSS, HTML, etc), whose paradigms are not necessarily preserved with AJAX applications.<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobbyslaughter_1525.html" title="User:Robbyslaughter">Robbyslaughter</a> 03:48, 17 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But that has nothing whatsoever to do with Ajax. If that design was used for a completely non-Ajax website, it would still break. That is somebody making the mistake of specifying a fixed height in CSS, not a problem caused by Ajax. There's nothing about Ajax that requires mistakes like that, and those mistakes happen just as often when Ajax is not used. The effect you are talking about is purely an artifact of the CSS in use. <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogtha_806a.html" title="User:Bogtha">Bogtha</a> 20:33, 3 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I believe you are incorrect. This is not a CSS issue---instead the box that Google Suggest renders to contain the search entries is not *aware* of the changing font size. I don't think there's any way for an Ajax application to *know* you have resized the font size and render differently. I am not saying that all Ajax applications guess the font size to make rendering decisions, but that there are aspects of the browser paradigm that Ajax applications can't account for. This makes the underlying model fragile, and I think that should be added to the article.<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobbyslaughter_1525.html" title="User:Robbyslaughter">Robbyslaughter</a> 16:08, 9 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's definitely a CSS issue. The height of each line is specified in pixels, when the user is using a larger font size than Google expected, it doesn't work right. This is extremely basic CSS. Thinking that Ajax needs to know about font resizing is another thing making you sound like a completely mixed up newbie. Ajax doesn't have to know about font resizing. You write the *CSS* to be flexible regarding font sizes, and when you update the page structure with Ajax, you don't have to give a damn about the font size because the layout is done by the CSS. You are *still* taking two completely different ideas and mixing them up. Ajax doesn't have to care about font sizes because Ajax isn't the bit that's doing the layout. --<a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogtha_806a.html" title="User:Bogtha">Bogtha</a> 18:12, 9 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hmm. What you write is true, yet still, Google Suggest doesn't work as I described above. Try it in Firefox, where there is no problem, and you can see the difference. Now, I'll go back on what I said before---it's certainly related to CSS. But this is an AJAX application, and it has a problem which I don't see as reconcilable due to issues with the underlying technologies, which is the source of my concern. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobbyslaughter_1525.html" title="User:Robbyslaughter">Robbyslaughter</a> 22:55, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please read what I wrote again. Just because something is wrong with a website that uses Ajax, it doesn't mean that Ajax caused the problem. If Google misspelt a word on the page, would it be caused by Ajax? No. If Google put a link to a non-existent site on the page, would it be caused by Ajax? No. If Google create a layout that relies on particular font sizes to display properly, is it caused by Ajax? No. This is a display problem caused entirely by CSS. It's not "related to CSS", it *is* CSS. Write a static page that displays a list of items with a pixel-based height. It will break in exactly the same way. Now add Ajax to get the list of items from the server. Does the problem become magically caused by Ajax just by association? Of course not! --<a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogtha_806a.html" title="User:Bogtha">Bogtha</a> 16:19, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
I agree with Robbyslaughter for the most part. Ajax is a conglomeration of standards hacks and browser extensions to turn the web into something it wasn't designed for, and as such it is fragile and breaks on a lot of browsers. HTML renderers that can handle the rest of the web just fine often break on Ajax pages, and Ajax pages that work some places don't work in others (ie: Google maps, Google mail, etc. didn't work in Konqueror until the 3.5 release, even though they worked in Safari from the same code base, and other Ajax sites worked in older Konquerors.) It's a good solution and browser support is fairly solid now, but fragility is certainly a valid criticism. <a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKundor_08ba.html" title="User:Kundor">Kundor</a> 03:48, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Support. By they way - to check is Ajax responsible for breaking "Google Suggest" or whatever carry out this little experiment - turn javascript off (thus disabling Ajax), go to the page you want to test, to your font resizing or whatever the problem seems to be. If it breaks, Ajax is not the problemstart, if it works perfectly - ajax breaks it. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirils_0ca2.html" title="User:Kirils">Kirils</a> 19:44, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Kirils, that's not a test that works. Consider a page that has a spelling mistake in some of the text, but that text is only shown by using Ajax. Does Ajax cause the spelling mistake? Of course not. In a similar way, the layout issue that the drop-down box has cannot be seen until Ajax is used. If the drop-down box used static data, and Ajax wasn't used to retrieve the data, it would still have exactly the same layout problem. It's simply nothing to do with Ajax, in the same way a spelling error is nothing to do with Ajax. It's directly caused by a stupid fixed-pixel height on the lAutoComplete class that is not necessary and is unrelated to Ajax. By all means use a user stylesheet of .lAutoComplete { height: auto&#160;!important; } and see the problem disappear if you don't believe me. --<a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogtha_806a.html" title="User:Bogtha">Bogtha</a> 15:05, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I knew I could well be giving offense but I decided I had to be vehement because these two technologies are diametrically opposed: AJAX relies on server interaction, SPA is entirely client side. I understand it can be difficult to fathom all this "technology soup", at least that is the impression I get especially now that you bring up RIA's (Rich Internet Apps). Actually of the 3 acronyms, SPA is probably the best defined, the other two are to a large extent either hype or misnomers. I agree that the SPA article could probably be improved, but I don't see the need to differentiate it from AJAX, if you understand that AJAX relies on a server side request it is apparent that the two technologies are significantly different, and to cast SPA versus AJAX seems to me another step on the slippery slope where EVERYTHING needs to get redefined in terms of AJAX, to the point that plain old server side programming is being called "degradable AJAX". <a href="../../../j/e/m/User%7EJemptymethod_788b.html" title="User:Jemptymethod">Jemptymethod</a> 07:36, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That isn't a Jakob Nielsen article. It's a poor parody of a frames article that he wrote, with a few terms switched. A lot of the criticisms of frames simply don't apply to Ajax, it's naive to take it as meaningful criticism. I'm removing the link. Feel free to link to *worthwhile* criticisms of Ajax, but blindly linking to anything negative makes it look like you have an axe to grind.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Server-Independent and Server-Centric" section</span></h2>
<p>As far as I can see, this section appeared as the result of an anonymous edit on 8 December 2005. After reading the article several times, this section strikes me as very poorly integrated with the rest of the article. It exhibits at least the following problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>The section title is borderline nonsensical: to what do these two adjectives apply?</li>
<li>What are the "couple of frameworks" in the opening sentence? As far as I can see, only one is mentioned.</li>
<li>This section introduces yet another "pro and con" list into the article. <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EPro_%26_con_lists_a531.html" title="Wikipedia:Pro &amp; con lists">Pro and con lists are considered harmful</a>.</li>
<li>The entries in that list are mostly nonsensical sentence fragments. e.g., "No AJAX and JavaScript prerequisites of programming skills"—in fact, this one isn't even a fragment. It just doesn't make sense at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my opinion, this section adds close to nothing to the article and should be removed entirely. Would the original author care to argue in support of keeping it? If anyone else wants to argue in support, would you care to re-write it? I propose that it is deleted entirely. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHoadley_9d5e.html" title="User:PaulHoadley">PaulHoadley</a> 02:29, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I see that <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamyem_d8bf.html" title="User:Samyem">Samyem</a> has just added another "framework" example. While this certainly addresses the issue of the plurailty of the word "couple", it wasn't really what I had in mind for salvaging this section. The first paragraph remains barely comprehensible. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamyem_d8bf.html" title="User:Samyem">Samyem</a>—are you offering to completely re-write this section, or at least argue for its retention?

<p>I, Tomyeh, wrote this section originally. I might not describe it clearly, but the difference of these two approaches is dramatically. By server centric I mean applications process interactivity at the server, instead of at client (or mix). The synchronization between client and server is done by the framework that takes the server centric approach. The technology is AJAX-based, but the meaning to application developers is quite different.</p>
<p>Hi Tom—firstly, sorry for stomping on your work. I guess the one-line summary of my original criticism is this: the section just didn't fit in with the remainder of the article. Of course, there are other parts which are similarly rough, but the combination of the points I outlined above, the fact that it certainly seemed to be an anonymous contribution, and that no one came to its defense made it a prime candidate for deletion. Obviously, you're welcome to revert the deletion, but I still think the section would need some work. Does anyone else have an opinion on this? <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHoadley_9d5e.html" title="User:PaulHoadley">PaulHoadley</a> 22:04, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it is better to address this issue in this article, because developers who are new to Ajax might be confused. The question, I think, is how to fit it into, rather than whether to bring it at all. Maybe it could be a sub-section of the Server-side Approaches. -- User:Tomyeh</p>
<p>Go for it. My original criticism was that it was difficult to understand and out of place. By all means, re-write it and incorporate it into an existing section. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHoadley_9d5e.html" title="User:PaulHoadley">PaulHoadley</a> 09:49, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Article is vandalised by subjective, narrow-minded people</span></h2>
<p>I have tried to bring some more information into the article, based on real-world proven facts and experiences. Yet people who do not (want) to understand the concept and are obviously restricted to glorifying few less important players freely and without any regard to actual facts, believing that what they know is the only and absolute truth beyond which there is none.</p>
<p>Just one of the worse examples is removing note on performance implicated by number and volume of network communication. Simpler or poorly written apps will not get any benefits. On the other hand, I have witnessed significant improvements I described in prior edits, possible due to proper and full architecture. I guess that's not important as the "authorities" do not approve. This is ridicilous.</p>
<p>Well then. Forget Ajax then, as it is apparently not what most people think of it. Go and use some other technology. For example, visit <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desktop.com.html" title="Desktop.com">desktop.com</a> or Hummingbird DM Webtop when and if they become available.</p>

<dd>Its not like I had any chance as most of my "Wikipedia" time went into this talk page. I can also add that I had all the wrong assumptions about collaboration on this site - at least this article. I remember desktop.com, for example, because I looked at the product and even at the code - as I was interested in learning how they did stuff. I was hoping that others, more involved (such as former desktop.com <b>employees</b> - developers) would shed light on details. I myself spend significant time trying to find desktop.com references, and I was only able to find some. Would anyone help? No. If something does not some<b>one</b>s expected style or desires it is easier and apparently better to remove the entire section rather than fixing/improving it further. What a shining example of collaborative work! And I was under assumption that "British writers" actually write, not remove text.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for Hummingbird it is both easy and hard. I am not doing this as a part of my job and have yet to talk to Hummingbird about releasing some material to the public. I originally assumed that it would already be available but I was proven wrong. "Proof", so much more required here than elsewhere, however does exist - many Hummingbird partners and customers do have the "DM Webtop Customization Guide" which talks about the architecture at length - and how to extend it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Then there are those sections that are (sorry: <b>were</b>) self-explanatory. For example:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"<b>Load distribution and performance</b>" and "<b>Network utilization</b>". I am not to blame for someone being "trigger happy" on HTTP requests. What Ajax (again, I'm sorry, apparently not Ajax but something better) allows is that we have smarter clients - much like the difference between dumb terminal with mainframes versus client-server or n-tier architectures. Can one make smart clients slower than dumb ones? Absolutely - I've seen all sorts of poorly designed apps. But with proper approach you get to squeeze many benefits out. Want real world examples? Here are some - navigation tree does not need to be regenerated on every click nor needs entire data to be sent. Data already received can be cached at the client, therefore reducing the need for subsequent requests. Client can also ask for some data ahead of time, combining it with other requests, further optimizing the performance. Need more? OK. Search results. When desktop apps handle them they get result data and show them as users scroll the list (for example). If users scroll back they don't need to refetch those results - they have them. Can Ajax do it? If we look at text that has been removed, apparently not. Well, I say that it is already happening, at least since 2001.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Comment "<i>restored "lightweight mini-applications" - no one is writing Office in Javascript)</i>" is based on what? I provided the link to applications that are a) not lightweight and b) not mini. Can I say that Hummingbird rewrote <b>Microsoft</b> Office? Of course not. But the product is of equal importance, very large and very high complexity, as can be seen by following the links I provided. Did anyone bother actually checking this before the above statment is made and its corresponding edit? I guess not.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

DHTML spec must have grown quite a bit since yesterday, as it is capable now of doing advanced features previously only available on <a href="../../../f/a/t/Fat_client.html" title="Fat client">desktop apps</a>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Comment "<i>Browsers that support Ajax - Changed to indicate XMLHttp support. Idf we start inclusing support for iframe hacks and the like on this list then it becomes meaningless</i>" is very interesting. Is IFRAME hack or just a tool for the hack? What if the browser does not support other features needed for Ajax? Is XMLHttp really the only thing needed? Maybe we should rename Ajax to AjaXMLHttp and remove references to everything else. BTW, in this case and strictly speaking IE does not support Ajax.</li>

<dd>Aleksandar - theres nothing to stop you working on the article to address any of the deficiencies you point out, and adding some text on the effect oif AJAX on sever load does seem like a good idea, and you certainly seem like you know what you're talking about. However in a collaborative process there is always the possibility that people will disagree with you. I'm afraid it seems pretty unlikely that anyone is going to agree with you on the importance of Hummingbird for instance (and, yes, if you try to introduce Hummingbird links it will always look suspect) but that's no reason to take your toys and go home.</dd>

<dd>I had some time and invested it it what I believe was a good effort. But I don't have enough of it to fight wars. Basically all my edits were reverted and unless there's someone to back up what I started I am not going to get involved any more. I learned to like Wikipedia and spent enough time working on it that I neglected by other duties and life. Without any help there will be no point in me trying to do anything. As for "suspicion", I don't see where is the problem. I pointed out some facts that can be checked out, albeit maybe not online... and I got burned for it before I started. Hummingbird will not gain or lose any business dependent on this article and neither I will not see any benefit from it. In fact, I must be very careful as to what I say to avoid saying too much, as I am under <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-disclosure_agreement.html" title="Non-disclosure agreement">non-disclosure agreement</a> and I haven't talked with my employer about how much can be published. Further, as it seems, Microsoft-Macromedia-Google consortium on Ajax is the all-important for very little actual involvement. I've seen many people trying to post <b>GOOD</b> information about their (or not) companies providing <b>good stuff</b> re Ajax - all of their edits got reverted. Yet, at present, those links is exactly what I personally would have liked to see in the article - they would have helped me learn more. So, if someone wants to cool off the triggers and turn on the brains for some time - help and get involved.</dd>

<dd>Aleksandar, I recommend that you continue with your separate article on the Hummingbird product and then find an appropriate place to reference it here when the topic settles. It sounds as though it's a compelling work and worthy of attention. As someone who has spent a lot of time over the years with my ear to the ground on anything to do with the various techniques and implementations of browser-based Javascript RPC before the Ajax name arrived, the fact that I had never heard of Hummingbird's product until seeing this discussion last week leads me to opine that the History section is perhaps not the place for this item to be referenced from this topic. While your contention that it has been around since 2000/2001 is not in dispute, its absense from the radar of the community which was collaborating during that time to define and refine the techniques would not lead me to include its contribution as "historical". Once this Ajax (Programming) topic has settled somewhat, it might be time to reinstate the Libraries and Frameworks section where a reference would make a better fit.</dd>

<dd>Yes, I accept that it's inaccurate to give the impression that there was one cohesive community. I can only speak from my own experience - during those years I actively sought out any discussions from far and wide on the topic and there were a few people whose contributions stood out for me. Of course, your mileage may vary.</dd>

<p>Here we go again... logically challenged <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtw_80b7.html" title="User:Artw">British writer and web developer currently based in Seattle.</a> has done it again: <i>Reverted to web applications - Rich Internet Applications has Flash connotations, also AJAX doesn't necessarily have to be used to create something so grandiose</i>. If he read <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rich_Internet_Application_a052.html" title="Rich Internet Application">Rich Internet Application</a> article he would have learned that it is not tied to Flash at all and includes description of JavaScript approach. Second, RIA is not a subset of AJAX but vice versa. So even if he does not think that AJAX does not <i>have to be used to create something so grandiose</i>, a) it is not even mentioned anywhere and b) even he says "<i>does not have to be</i>" which means that it still can.</p>
<p>Since <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtw_80b7.html" title="User:Artw">User:Artw</a> seems to be an absolute authority I hereby reiterate proposal to rename AJAX to AjaXMLHTTP and change "A" to stand for "Artw" instead of "Asynchronous".</p>
<p>Can it get any more ridiculous than this?</p>

<dd>Wll I thought you might throw a fit about it, so I didn't like doing it, but you made a change to an established portion of the article which again subtley shifts the term. Web applications fits better in the sentence and has a broader, more encompasing meaning.</dd>

<dd>BTW - "The term "<a href="../../../r/i/c/Rich_Internet_Application_a052.html" title="Rich Internet Application">Rich Internet Application</a>" was introduced in a Macromedia whitepaper in March 2002" - that's where your Flash connotations come in.

<dd>Is that a good description of Google Suggest? Because I happen to think that Google Suggest is a very good example of Ajax usage. It's no Dektop.com, but it extends the usability of a website using javasacript and XMLhttp, and in a very stable reliable way, not hidden away in an intranet or limited by browser types.</dd>

<ul>
<li>To begin with personal attacks: You reverted every single edit I made without proper reasons to do so, as already shown above.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Ajax concept came much later, by another company and it does not imply any products of that company. You should read about the concept and not stop at the point of reading who invented the term. It is a good term, much better than Ajax in many regards.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Ajax apps do, whether you like it or not, transfer some processing to the client end. If you disagree with this, go learn about <a href="../../../j/a/v/JavaScript_6861.html" title="JavaScript">JavaScript</a>. The "cross" between web and desktop is in that transfer.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Google is one of the examples of Ajax and, therefore of RIA (as Ajax is RIA done some very specific way - JavaScript and XML). However, it is not the only or defining example of what Ajax is. I can show you much more done, not limited by browser types and also reliable. Intranet does not come into picture anywhere. Noone requires that Ajax is used only for public <a href="../../../a/p/p/Application_Service_Provider_0323.html" title="Application Service Provider">Application Service Provider</a> approach. Also, if you're referring to <a href="../../../h/u/m/Hummingbird_Ltd_f164.html" title="Hummingbird Ltd">Hummingbird Ltd</a> its products have been exposed to public by customers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>OK... So I am <i>damaging</i> the article with my <i>peculiar</i> interpretation of Ajax. And revert this based on <i>public</i> opinion since you are elected representative of 'public'? That has yet to be seen. My edits applied to Ajax even by your interpretation (as shown above) - yet you blatantly reverted them. How's that about vandalism and personal attack? If you don't have personal experince with something (as in many cases here) it does not mean that the edits need to be reverted immediatelly.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">AJAX acronym</span></h2>
<p>If you look for AJAX on the web you will find people using two acronyms, "Asynchronous Javascript and XML" and "Advanced Javascript and XML." A few editors to this page do not agree with the second acronym. Should we exclude it despite its current use? Is there a formal AJAX specification that defines this? Some example sites that use the second acronym include:</p>

<p>Hello. No, please! I'm by no means in charge aournd here!&#160;:) Nigelj insisted on removing pronunciation specification (A-JAX) from the article, so I wanted him to clarify his point in the talk page so that others can discuss it. In my opinion, pronunciation needs to stay in the article. It's not like we are MAKING everyone who reads the article to pronounce ajax that way (if you feel that's a wrong way to pronounce it).

<p>Ajax, as a word, first appears in written form ('Αἴᾱς') in Homer's <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illiad.html" title="Illiad">Illiad</a>, written in probably about the 8th century BCE. It is a famous hero's name, widely believed to be in spoken use in perhaps the 13th or 12th century BCE, during the Trojan Wars, when the Illiad is set<a href="http://projectsx.dartmouth.edu/history/bronze_age/lessons/les/27.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://projectsx.dartmouth.edu/history/bronze_age/lessons/les/27.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. The word has therefore been in widespread use all over Europe for up to 3000 years. It is familiar to speakers of most European languages. It is the name of several European sports teams, including a famous football team in Amsterdam <a href="http://www.amsterdam.info/sports/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amsterdam.info/sports/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. It is also the name of a range of cleaning chemicals manufactured in the UK and sold globally<a href="http://www.pharmaceutical-business-review.com/companyprofile.asp?guid=8F29C49C-AF39-411A-AF1B-930E67BFA795" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pharmaceutical-business-review.com/companyprofile.asp?guid=8F29C49C-AF39-411A-AF1B-930E67BFA795" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. See the <a href="../../../a/j/a/Ajax.html" title="Ajax">Ajax</a> disambiguation page for many more examples of its use - check them for pronunciation guides if you like.</p>
<p>As an acronym for a programming technique, there is no reason why those referring to the technique should not pronounce the word however it normally pronounced - and has probably been pronounced for millenia - in their own country. With reference to programming, this is not a trademark or a word 'owned' by any person, group, organisation or company. There is no worldwide "authority" on the pronunciation of this word in this context<a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2006/02/10/ajaxlocalhost/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2006/02/10/ajaxlocalhost/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. I cannot even find any evidence that the multi-national Colgate-Palmolive is trying to tie down the pronunciation of the trademark when it refers to their cleaning products.</p>
<p>Even if we wanted to specify the "approved", "Wikipedia" pronunciation of the word with regard to programming practice, simply repeating the word in block capitals, and separating the two symbols ('A-JAX') would serve no purpose: people would still pronounce a, j and x how they like and would still stress whichever syllable they prefer.</p>
<p>I see that the developers and maintainers of this article proudly proclaim at the top of the talk page that "It has become a hot-spot for user in-fighting." and warn us to tread carefully or we'll be eaten alive. I don't know who's responsible for this approach here, but, jeeez, if you make such a meal of one simple, well-justified deletion of two words <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ajax_%28programming%29&amp;diff=41350773&amp;oldid=41346477" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ajax_%28programming%29&amp;diff=41350773&amp;oldid=41346477" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, I can't help feeling you are doing Wikipedia's development a mis-service. --<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENigelj_f250.html" title="User:Nigelj">Nigelj</a> 21:46, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Even if this is contraversial, its information thats really useful. An agreed pronounciation (or at least a selection) would be really handy becasue then when I go into a meeting, people will know what I am talking about. 62.232.6.254 17:13, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

I noticed the discussion on frameworks above; that mention of them invites link spamming and perhaps I'd be labeled as one. Fair enough.

This seriously needs fixing.

<p>The "Auction Demo" was the first application to combine DHTML, Javascript and XMLHTTPRequest in the Ajax-style. The "Auction Demo" showed live bid updates for an auction on a web page. The "Auction Demo" was written in either 1997 or 1998 by Adam Bosworth at Microsoft and was shown to many outside Microsoft. XMLHTTPRequest was created by Bosworth's team for the explicit purpose of creating what we now call Ajax applications. For reasons I don't understand, people did not pick up on the vision shown in the "auction demo" for a couple of years.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ajax for ASP.NET</span></h2>
<p>I wonder if this link is really relevant in the "tutorial" section.<br />
I believe this section is for teaching Ajax, not application of Ajax in any environnments. Similar to Ruby on rail.<br />
This is just my opinion...<br />
The title is ASP.NET spiced. I have read the article, this is really not that I need to learn Ajax!</p>

<dd>I agree. I thik the following links should be removed:</dd>
</dl>
<p>- Cross-browser Ajax Tutorial using the Sarissa library.</p>
<p>- JavaScript refactoring for safer, faster, better Ajax.</p>
<p>- ASP.NET Spiced: AJAX from MSDN.</p>
<p><br />
The other articles from Apple, Mozilla and IBM gives a good introduction in how to use Ajax and should be listed. There is no need for additional tutorials.</p>
<p>I also think the 'Weighing the Alternatives How Ajax stacks up against competing RIA approaches.' link in the article section should be removed.</p>
<p>This article has a linkspam problem and we must be careful with adding links. Only relevant links from credible sources should be listed. --<a href="../../../s/l/e/User%7ESleepyhead81_fac2.html" title="User:Sleepyhead81">Sleepyhead</a> 12:28, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The external links section has finally come to rest in a state of sanity. Apart from the MSDN one, the links that are there now have survived peer review for months, and should be kept. I've removed the ASP.NET link, and added a comment to the code for users who wish to add new links. This same strategy was used in the <a href="../../../h/t/m/HTML_4c4a.html" title="HTML">HTML</a> article, and has worked well. <a href="../../../r/u/f/User%7ERufous_d1c1.html" title="User:Rufous">Rufous</a> 14:08, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I removed two other links because I do not think they add any extra value. If we keep the Sarissa article then there is a bunch of similar articles using other frameworks that can be added. The Apple article already explains how to implement a cross-browser XHR solution. --<a href="../../../s/l/e/User%7ESleepyhead81_fac2.html" title="User:Sleepyhead81">Sleepyhead</a> 15:18, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do not support adding an explanation of the use of multiple frameworks, but I must argue the point that showing the use of a <i>single</i> framework does indeed add value. The code in the tutorial that uses Sarissa is significantly less complex than the code in the older Apple tutorial. Realistically, nobody should be writing their own code branching for creating the XMLHttpRequest object when that code can be abstracted cleanly through a framework. Furthermore, the article demonstrates the use of POST with Ajax, when many others incorrectly use GET requests to change data on the server. <a href="../../../r/u/f/User%7ERufous_d1c1.html" title="User:Rufous">Rufous</a> 16:02, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't agree with Sleepyhead81 that is not a real contributor actually.<br />
I believe there is need for several tutorials according to level of experience of many users.<br />
There is nothing in the guideline about limiting the number of tutorials.<br />
About IBM/Alphawork, their tutor is just the specification of XMLHttpRequest with lot of screenshoots. The screens display alerts, that if not of great interest. And the article is not readable.<br />
Alphaworks also is known to be an agressive spammer and in the past they have removed links from others contributors to make room for several links to their article (part 1, part 2, etc...) Please, Sleepyhead81, don't remove links for yours reasons and not reasons from the guidelines. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooles_a5c7.html" title="User:Booles">Booles</a> 06:43, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proposal for a new page</span></h2>
<p>This is just an idea, I have no special interest in that, I have not written any Ajax framework, what I propose is another page dedicated to Ajax libraries, wrapper, framework, and so one... This will include Sajax, and any open source similar program. It is not normal to link a library, and even create a page for it (I am speaking of Sajax) and refuse other ones. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooles_a5c7.html" title="User:Booles">Booles</a> 14:41, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Having edited this article for months, a separate page for this is probably not a good idea. We have had numerous attempts to set up a Frameworks section as part of the external links, and they have quickly degenerated into link farms and had to be deleted outright. The problem is, there are dozens of frameworks being developed, and it becomes very difficult for anyone to differentiate which ones are actually notable, which ones are redundant, and which ones are actually being used. <a href="../../../r/u/f/User%7ERufous_d1c1.html" title="User:Rufous">Rufous</a> 15:27, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proposal for a book section</span></h2>
<p>I am never short of ideas&#160;:) On another page of the wiki, I would have created it directly, but this page is very hot! I prefer to take advices before to change anything. I propose to add a section beside tutorials, for documents that are more a reference than a tutorial. It may be entitled "Online books" or "Reference manuals". Tutorials are intended for teaching, and manuals to be consulted when we need an answer to a question. The links to Apple and IBM should enter this new category, even if the former is very short. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooles_a5c7.html" title="User:Booles">Booles</a> 19:03, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">About spam</span></h2>
<p>Several links to a website on the same page is spam.<br />
A link to a website on several pages at Wikipedia is also spam. I suspect that the one that spams the wiki with lots of links anywhere to its webpage that is not even really useful, is also the one that removes links to other websites (and I have good reasons). I wonder also why a big company with billions dollars of cash needs for spamming this wiki.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ajax without JavaScript</span></h2>
<p>A link to a such article comes back from time to time. Without JavaScript, this is just XMLHttpRequest and maybe it has to be linked from the XMLHttpRequest page, but not from the Ajax page that is here to explain what is Ajax: XMLHttpRequest + JavaScript.<br />
In my mind they have put Ajax in the title just to link from the Ajax page. For me it is a joke.</p>
<p>And so is "example of Ajax website". On the page about Computer, one can link to a page because this page run on a computer. It is a joke, isn't? On the page about HTML, one can link to a page because it is written in HTML. It is a joke, isn't? Linking to a page because it is built using Ajax is a joke also. <a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlcalazar_5e78.html" title="User:Alcalazar">Alcalazar</a> 11:10, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
