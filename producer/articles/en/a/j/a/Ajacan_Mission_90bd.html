<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/j/a/Ajacan_Mission_90bd.html" title="Edit section: Spanish exploration">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Spanish exploration</span></h2>
<p>Early in the <a href="../../../1/6/t/16th_century.html" title="16th century">16th century</a>, Spanish explorers discovered the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chesapeake_Bay_70ed.html" title="Chesapeake Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a> while in search of the fabled (and non-existent) <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northwest_Passage_1e69.html" title="Northwest Passage">Northwest Passage</a> to <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>. They gave the land now known as <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia.html" title="Virginia">Virginia</a> the name "Ajacan."</p>
<p>After several failed attempts at colonization of the portion of the New World now known as the United States, the Spanish succeeded in 1565 with the establishment of <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Augustine%2C_Florida_ac4e.html" title="St. Augustine, Florida">St. Augustine</a>, the first city in the United States. Small settlements spread northward along the eastern coast into Georgia and the Carolinas. The northern-most post was Santa Elena (today <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Royal%2C_South_Carolina_75da.html" title="Port Royal, South Carolina">Port Royal, South Carolina</a>).</p>
<p>Spanish exploration northward in the area of the Chesapeake Bay continued into the late 16th century. During one such trip in <a href="../../../1/5/6/1560.html" title="1560">1560</a>, the 17-year old son of an <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algonquian.html" title="Algonquian">Algonquian</a> chief of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_Americans_of_the_United_States_f5ac.html" title="Native Americans of the United States">Native Americans</a> in Ajacan (Virginia) agreed to join the group and was brought to <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>. He was instructed in the Catholic religion and baptized <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Luis_0787.html" title="Don Luis">Don Luis</a>, in honor of <a href="../../../l/u/i/Luis_de_Velasco_544f.html" title="Luis de Velasco">Luis de Velasco</a>, his sponsor, who was the Viceroy of New Spain. The youth was transported to <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madrid%2C_Spain_e66d.html" title="Madrid, Spain">Madrid, Spain</a>, and had an audience with the Emperor. He received a thorough <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesuit.html" title="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> education. Don Luis later returned to the New World.</p>
<p><a name="Mission_sited" id="Mission_sited"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/j/a/Ajacan_Mission_90bd.html" title="Edit section: Mission sited">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mission sited</span></h2>
<p>In 1570, Father Juan Bautista de Segura, Jesuit vice provincial of <a href="../../../h/a/v/Havana%2C_Cuba_18bc.html" title="Havana, Cuba">Havana</a>, wanted to establish a mission in Ajacan without a military garrison, which was unusual. One of the chief stumbling blocks to converting the Natives to Christianity at other locations had been the often deplorable conduct of the colonial soldiers. On garrison duty, not challenged by the prospect of fighting, they were apt to seek an outlet for their boredom in drunkenness, thievery, bullying and sexual license. Despite concerns about the plan's feasibility, Father Segura eventually obtained permission from his superiors for the founding of the new St. Mary's Mission.</p>
<p>In August 1570, Father Segura, Father Luis de Quiros, former head of the Jesuit college among the Moors in Spain, and six Jesuit brothers set forth from their base in Havana on their Ajacan Mission, seeking to establish a new outpost to be called St. Mary's Mission. A young Spanish boy, Alonso Olmos, called Aloncito, also accompanied the priests to serve Mass. They were also accompanied by Don Luis as their guide and translator. On September 10, the party of 10 landed in Ajacan.</p>
<p><a name="Exact_location" id="Exact_location"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/j/a/Ajacan_Mission_90bd.html" title="Edit section: Exact location">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Exact location</span></h2>
<p>It is possible the location they chose was at Queen's Creek on the north side of the <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia_Peninsula_8b17.html" title="Virginia Peninsula">Lower Peninsula</a>, near the <a href="../../../y/o/r/York_River_%28Virginia%29_bcf3.html" title="York River (Virginia)">York River</a>. More recent findings suggest that St. Mary's Mission may have been in the village of Axacam on the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Kent_County%2C_Virginia_044a.html" title="New Kent County, Virginia">New Kent</a> side of Diascund Creek near its confluence with the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chickahominy_River_d11b.html" title="Chickahominy River">Chickahominy River</a>.</p>
<p>In either case, Don Luis soon set about attempting to locate his native village of <a href="../../../k/i/s/Kiskiack.html" title="Kiskiack">Kiskiack</a> which he had not seen in ten years. In the same general area, the Spaniards constructed a small wooden hut with an adjoining room where Mass could be celebrated. Soon after the ship bringing them had departed, Don Luis left the Jesuits, supposedly to seek his uncle and supplies. However, rather than returning, he rejoined his tribe, where his brother had become the <a href="../../../w/e/r/Weroance.html" title="Weroance">weroance</a>, and took several wives, as was the custom.</p>
<p><a name="Abandonment" id="Abandonment"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/j/a/Ajacan_Mission_90bd.html" title="Edit section: Abandonment">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Abandonment</span></h2>
<p>As time went by, first days, and then months, the small band of Jesuits realized that they had been abandoned by Don Luis. To their added misfortune, it was a time when the mid-Atlantic region was enduring a long period of famine due to drought conditions. The food they brought with them was in short supply. Immediately there was a dependence on the Indians for food.</p>
<p>They successfully traded with some natives for food, but it was increasingly in short supply as the winter months set in. Around February of 1571, Don Luis returned with other natives and stole all their clothing and supplies. The natives killed both of the priests and all six brothers. Only the young servant boy was spared, perhaps because he was not a Jesuit. Escaping the carnage, the young boy made his way to a rival native chief who lived close to the main coast on the Chesapeake Bay. There he waited until the relief expedition arrived in 1572.</p>
<p><a name="Aftermath" id="Aftermath"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/j/a/Ajacan_Mission_90bd.html" title="Edit section: Aftermath">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Aftermath</span></h2>
<p>More than a year after the massacre, a Spanish supply ship found and rescued Alonso, upon which he gave the only survivor's account. Subsequently, Florida's Governor, <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedro_Menendez_de_Aviles_f994.html" title="Pedro Menendez de Aviles">Pedro Menendez de Aviles</a>, traveled to Ajacan to punish the culprits. The native-convert Don Luis proved ever elusive and was never discovered. However, eight other Indians accused of murdering the missionaries were promptly hanged by the Spaniards.</p>
<p>The disastrous attempt at establishing a mission in Virginia spelled the end of Spanish ventures to colonize the area. Following the death of Father Segura and his companions in the Ajacan Mission venture, the Jesuits were recalled from St. Augustine and sent on to Mexico where the harvest, temporal and spiritual, seemed much more promising.</p>
<p><a name="Opechancanough" id="Opechancanough"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/j/a/Ajacan_Mission_90bd.html" title="Edit section: Opechancanough">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Opechancanough</span></h2>
<p>At the time of the first permanent English settlement at <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamestown%2C_Virginia_0455.html" title="Jamestown, Virginia">Jamestown</a> in 1607, a fierce Native American warrior named <a href="../../../o/p/e/Opechancanough.html" title="Opechancanough">Opechancanough</a> was the half-brother of <a href="../../../w/a/h/Wahunsonacock.html" title="Wahunsonacock">Wahunsonacock</a>, the Chief of the <a href="../../../p/o/w/Powhatan_Confederacy_ec2d.html" title="Powhatan Confederacy">Powhatan Confederacy</a>, The name Opechancanough meant "He whose Soul is White" in the <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algonquin.html" title="Algonquin">Algonquin</a> language.</p>
<p>It is speculated by some historians that Opechancanough was the same individual who had also been known as "<a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Luis_0787.html" title="Don Luis">Don Luis</a>". What is known with certainty is that Opechancanough was violently opposed to the European settlers who arrived at Jamestown beginning in 1607. It was he who led the party that captured <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Smith_of_Jamestown_acaa.html" title="John Smith of Jamestown">Captain John Smith</a> in late 1607 and brought him before <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_Powhatan_bd30.html" title="Chief Powhatan">Chief Powhatan</a> at <a href="../../../w/e/r/Werowocomoco.html" title="Werowocomoco">Werowocomoco</a>. (This was the same incident later recounted by Smith in one of his books when the Chief's daughter <a href="../../../p/o/c/Pocahontas.html" title="Pocahontas">Pocahontas</a> allegedly intervened on Smith's behalf, saving his life).</p>
<p>A period of relative peace between the Powhatans and the settlers ended not long after the death of <a href="../../../w/a/h/Wahunsonacock.html" title="Wahunsonacock">Wahunsonacock</a> in 1618, when Opechancanough became the new chief. Beginning with the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_massacre_of_1622.html" title="Indian massacre of 1622">Indian massacre of 1622</a>, Chief Opechancanough gave up on <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diplomacy.html" title="Diplomacy">diplomacy</a> with the <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">English</a> <a href="../../../s/e/t/Settler.html" title="Settler">settlers</a> of the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colony_and_Dominion_of_Virginia_f400.html" title="Colony and Dominion of Virginia">Colony and Dominion of Virginia</a> and tried to force them to abandon the region both then and again in <a href="../../../1/6/4/1644.html" title="1644">1644</a>, when he was captured. Opechancanough was later killed by a soldier assigned to guard him.</p>
<p>At the time he was killed in 1644, Opechancanough was estimated to be between 90 and 100 years old. The timing makes the possibility that he and the Don Luis who sabotaged the Jesuit Ajacan Mission in 1571 were one and the same at least feasible.</p>
