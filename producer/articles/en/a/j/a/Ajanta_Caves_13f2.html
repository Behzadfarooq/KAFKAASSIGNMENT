<p>The caves are in a wooded and rugged horseshoe-shaped ravine about 3½ km from the village of Ajintha. It is situated in the Aurangābād district of Maharashtra State in India (106 kilometers away from the city of <a href="../../../a/u/r/Aurangabad%2C_Maharashtra_a243.html" title="Aurangabad, Maharashtra">Aurangabad</a>). The nearest towns are <a href="../../../j/a/l/Jalgaon.html" title="Jalgaon">Jalgaon</a> (60 kilometers away) and <a href="../../../b/h/u/Bhusawal.html" title="Bhusawal">Bhusawal</a> (70 kilometers away). Along the bottom of the ravine runs the river Waghur a mountain stream. There are 29 caves (officially numbered by the Archaeological Survey of India), excavated in the south side of the precipitous scarp made by the cutting of the ravine, and they vary from 35 to 110 ft. in elevation above the bed of the torrent.</p>

Ajanta Caves - view from ticket office</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The monastic complex of Ajanta consists of several <a href="../../../v/i/h/Vihara_%28monastery%29.html" title="Vihara (monastery)">viharas</a> (monastic halls of residence) and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaitya.html" title="Chaitya">chaitya</a>-grihas (<a href="../../../s/t/u/Stupa.html" title="Stupa">stupa</a> monument halls) cut into the mountain scarp in two phases. The first phase is mistakenly called the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinayana.html" title="Hinayana">Hinayana</a> phase (referring to the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinayana_Buddhism_4a1b.html" title="Hinayana Buddhism">Lesser Vehicle</a> tradition of <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, when the <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddha.html" title="Buddha">Buddha</a> was revered symbolically). Actually, Hinayana – a derogative term for <a href="../../../s/t/h/Sthaviravada.html" title="Sthaviravada">Sthaviravada</a> – does not object to Buddha statues. At Ajanta, cave numbers 9, 10, 12, 13, and 15A (the last one was re-discovered in 1956, and is still not officially numbered) were excavated during this phase. These excavations have enshrined the Buddha in the form of the stupa, or mound. The second phase of excavation started on the site after a lull of over three centuries. This phase is often inappropriately called the <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahayana.html" title="Mahayana">Mahayana</a> phase (referring to the Greater Vehicle tradition of Buddhism, which is less strict and encourages direct cow depiction of the Buddha through paintings and carvings). Some prefer to call this phase the <a href="../../../v/a/k/Vakataka.html" title="Vakataka">Vakataka</a> phase after the ruling dynasty of the house of the Vakatakas of the Vatsagulma branch. The dating of the second phase has been debated among scholars. In recent years a consensus seems to be converging on 5th-century dates for all the Mahayana phase caves. According to Walter M. Spink, a leading Ajantologist, all the Mahayana excavations were carried out from 462 to 480 CE. The caves created during the Mahayana phase are the ones numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29. Cave 8 was long thought to be a Hinayāna cave, however current research shows that it is in fact a Mahayana cave.</p>
<p>There were two chaitya-grihas excavated in the Hinayana phase that are caves 9 and 10. Caves 12, 13, and 15A of this phase are vihāras. There were three chaitya-grihas excavated in the Vakataka or Mahayana phase that are caves 19, 26, and 29. The last cave was abandoned soon after its beginning. The rest of the excavations are viharas: caves 1-3, 5-8, 11, 14-18, 20-25, and 27-28.</p>
<p>The viharas are of various sizes the maximum being about 52 feet. They are often square-shaped. Their excavation exhibits a great variety, some with simple facade, others ornate; some have a porch and others do not. The hall was an essential element of a viharas. In the Vakataka phase, early viharas were not intended to have shrines because they were purely meant to be halls of residence and congregation. Later, shrines were introduced in them in the back walls, which became a norm. The shrines were made to house the central object of reverence that is the image of the Buddha often seated in the <i>dharmachakrapravartana mudra</i> (the gesture of teaching). In the caves with latest features, we find subsidiary shrines added on the side walls, porch or the front-court. The facades of many vihāras are decorated with carvings, and walls and ceilings were often covered with paintings.</p>
<p>Changes in Buddhist thought in the 1st century BCE had made it possible for the Buddha to be deified and consequently the image of the Buddha as a focus of worship became popular marking the arrival of the Mahāyāna (the Greater Vehicle) sect.</p>
<p>In the past, scholars divided the caves in three groups, but this is now discredited in light of fresh evidence and research. This theory of dating believed that the oldest group of caves dated from <a href="../../../2/n/d/2nd_century_BC_e028.html" title="2nd century BC">200 BCE</a> to <a href="../../../3/r/d/3rd_century.html" title="3rd century">CE 200</a>, the second group belonged, approximately, to the <a href="../../../6/t/h/6th_century.html" title="6th century">6th</a>, and the third group to the <a href="../../../7/t/h/7th_century.html" title="7th century">7th century</a>.</p>
<p>The expression <i>Cave Temples</i> used by <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Indians_00d3.html" title="Anglo-Indians">Anglo-Indians</a> for viharas without the shrine is inaccurate. Ajanta was a kind of college monastery. <a href="../../../h/s/u/Hsuan_Tsang_1f10.html" title="Hsuan Tsang">Hsuan Tsang</a> informs us that Dinnaga, the celebrated Buddhist philosopher and controversialist, author of well-known books on logic, resided there. This, however, remains to be corroborated by further evidence. In their prime the vihāras were intended to afford accommodation for several hundreds, teachers and pupils combined. It is tragic that none of the caves in the Vakataka phase were ever fully completed. This was because the ruling Vakataka dynasty suddenly fell out of power leaving the dominion in a likely crisis, which forced all activities to a sudden halt at the time of Ajanta's last years of activities. This idea first pronounced by Walter M. Spink is increasingly gaining acceptance based on the archaeological evidence visible on site.</p>
<p>Most of the subjects have been identified by the leading Ajantologist from Germany, Dieter Schlingloff.</p>

<p>It is first approach and has no relation to the chronological sequence of the caves. It is the first cave on the eastern end of the horse-shoe shaped scarp. According to Spink, it is one of the latest caves to have begun on site and brought to near-completion in the Vākāţaka phase. Although there is no epigraphic evidence, it has been proposed that the Vākāţaka king Harisena may have been the benefactor of this better-preserved cave. A dominant reason for this is that King Harisena was not involved initially in patronizing Ajanta, but could not have remained aloof for long, as the site was burgeoning with activity under his rule, and the Buddhist laity would have loved to see the Hindu king participating in the pious act of patronage. Besides, most of the themes depicted are royal.</p>
<p>This cave has one of the most elaborate carvings on the facade with relief sculptures on entablature and fridges. There are scenes carved from the life of the Buddha as well as a number of decorative motifs. There was once a two pillared portico visible in the 19th-century photographs, which has since been perished. The cave has a front-court with cells fronted by pillared-vestibules on either side. These have high plinth level. The cave has a porch with simple cells on either end. The absence of pillared vestibules on ends suggest that the porch was not excavated in the latest phase of Ajanta when pillared vestibules had became a necessity and norm. Most areas of the porch was once covered with murals of which notably high degree of fragments remain. There are three doorways: a central doorway and two side-doorways. Between the main and the side-doorways, two square windows have been carved that lit the interiors.</p>
<p>Each wall of the hall inside is nearly 40 feet long and 20 feet high. Twelve pillars make a square colonnade inside supporting the ceiling, and creating spacious aisles along the walls. There is a shrine carved on the rear wall, which houses an impressive seated image of the Buddha, his hands being in the <i>dharmachakrapravartana mudra.</i> There are four cells each on the left, rear, and the right wall. The walls are covered with paintings suggesting a fair state of preservation from decay. The scenes depicted are mostly didactic, devotional, and ornamental. The themes are from the Jataka stories (the stories of the Buddha's former existences as Boddhisattva), life of the Gautam Buddha, and those of his veneration.</p>

Ajanta Caves</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Cave 2 is next to Cave 1. It looks similar to Cave 1 in many respects. Like Cave 1, it is relatively in a better state of preservation. It is known specially for the paintings preserved on its walls, ceilings, and pillars.</p>
<p>Facade: The cave's facade has a porch visibly different from Cave 1. Even the facade does not have carvings as in Cave 1. What we see here is a cave supported by robust pillars that are ornamented with designs. The size and general ground plan, however, shares many things in common with Cave 1.</p>
<p>Porch: As first suggested by Walter M. Spink, the porch has cells fronted by pillared vestibules (hereinafter CPV in this article) on either ends. This architectural element is not found in the porch of Cave 1. That cave has simple cells on porch-ends. The reason is, as evidences indicate, similar porch-end cells once existed not only in Cave 2 but most other caves began early in the Vakataka phase and transformed later as CPVs in later years. In fact, all the porch-ends in various caves as wells as on the facade's side-walls were originally blank without even a cell in the earliest, the inaugural plans that were based on the prototype of a typical Hinayana vihara. The need of the cells on the previously "wasted areas" arose as a solution to greater housing requirements in later years. It became a norm subsequently to add porch-end cells in the planning of later Vakataka excavations. Still later, these simple single cells on porch-ends were converted into CPVs or were being planned as such in order to create accommodate more room, symmetry, and beauty.</p>
<p>The paintings on the ceilings and walls of this porch are widely published. They depict the <a href="../../../j/a/t/Jataka.html" title="Jataka">Jataka</a> tales that are stories of the Buddha's life in former existences as <a href="../../../b/o/d/Bodhisattva.html" title="Bodhisattva">Bodhisattva</a>. The porch's rear wall has a doorway in the center, which allows entrance to the hall. On either side of the door is a square-shaped window carved to lit the interiors.</p>
<p>Hall: The hall has four colonnade making a square in the center of the hall. They support the ceiling. Each arm or colonnade of the square is parallel to each of the respective wall of the hall making an aisle in between. The colonnades have rock-beams above and below them. The capitals are carved and painted with various decorative motifs that include ornamental, human, animal, vegetative, and semi-divine forms. Monika Zin's research on the decorative and devotional themes of Ajanta paintings should be consulted by readers wanting to learn in detail.</p>
<p>Paintings: Paintings are everywhere except the floor or they were intended as such. At many places they have been damaged by the process of decay or human interference. Therefore, many areas of the painted walls, ceilings, and pillars are fragmentary. The painted narratives of the Jataka tales are depicted only on the walls, which demanded special attention of the devotee. They are didactic in nature meant to inform the community about the Buddha's teachings and life through successive births. Their placement on the walls required the devotee to walk through the aisles and 'read' the narratives depicted in various episodes. (Alas, to prevent vandalism, the entry in the aisles is restricted by site-authorities). The narrative episodes are depicted one after another although not in a linear order. Their identification has been a core area of research on the subject since the time of the site's rediscovery in 1819 CE. Deiter Schlingloff's identifications have updated our knowledge on the subject.</p>
<p>For long the paintings were erroneously referred to as frescoes. However, we know now that it is best to call them murals because the typically known process and technique of 'fresco' painting is not found in these murals. At Ajanta, the technique used, the medium, materials, and process is unlike the examples found in the art history of other civilizations. In fact, these murals have a certain uniqueness about them that is rarely found elsewhere, even within the history of South Asian art. The process of painting involved several stages. First of all the rock surface was chiseled rough so that it can hold the plaster. The plaster was prepared of clay, hay, dung, lime, etc. Variations are found in ingredients and their proportions from cave to cave, and in various places in the same cave. While the plaster was still wet, the drawings were done, and the colors applied. The wet plaster has the capacity to soak the color so that the color becomes a part of the surface and would not peel off or decay easily. As regards the color, they were the so called 'earth color' or the 'vegetable color.' Various kinds of stones, minerals, and plants were used in combinations to prepare different colors. Sculptures were often covered with stucco to give them a fine finish and lustrous polish. The stucco had the ingredients of lime and powdered sea-shell or conch. The latter afforded peculiar shine and smoothness. In cave upper six, some of it is extant. The smoothness resembles the surface of a glass, which astonishes the visitor today.</p>
<p>The brush for painting was made of animal hairs and twigs of certain plants.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/j/a/Ajanta_Caves_13f2.html" title="Edit section: Period of Caves">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Period of Caves</span></h2>
<p>The period during which Ajanta Caves were excavated stretches over eighty-nine hundred years from the third-second century B. C. to fifth-sixth century A. D. As regards excavation work, these Caves reveal two distinct phases, the early and the late. Six of the Caves, namely, Caves numbering 9, 10, 8, 12, 13, and 15-A, belong to the early period. Caves 9 and 10, with elements of early <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shunga.html" title="Shunga">Shunga</a> art, appear to have been excavated during the second half of the third or the first half of the second century B. C., while the other four, during the first century B. C. Cave 10 is, however, the earliest. It precedes even the Cave 9 by at least fifty years.</p>
<p>It was the period when Dakshinapath was ruled by <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satavahana.html" title="Satavahana">Satavahana</a> dynasty and Buddhism pursued Hinayana doctrine, which initially prohibited making of Buddha's anthropomorphic images and their worship. Cave 9 and 10, the Chaitya-grahas - homes of the Sacred, broadly prayer-halls, do not have Buddha's anthropomorphic images, though on the façade of Cave No. 9 such images were subsequently added. Around the first century B. C. Hinayana allowed making of Buddha's personal images. This shift from non-image to image characterises other Caves of this early phase. This phase is, hence, known as the Hinayana-Satavahana phase.</p>
<p>Caves numbering 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20 to 24, 26 and 29 belong to the later phase, broadly the period from the fifth to the sixth century A. D. It was a period when Buddhism had largely shifted to Mahayana doctrine and the region was ruled by <a href="../../../v/a/k/Vakatakas.html" title="Vakatakas">Vakatakas</a> who were also the patrons of these Caves. This phase is, hence, usually known as Mahayana-Vakataka phase. As suggest epigraphic records, Caves No. 16 and 17 were commissioned by Vakataka ruler Harishena (475-500 A. D.) through one of his ministers Varahadeva posted at the site for supervising the progress and a subordinate vassal of the area respectively. Ajanta was the centre of the monastic and religious activities since the second-first century B. C. itself and embellishing facades and wall spaces with paintings and sculptures continued all through, but excavation of caves seems to have remained suspended till it re-commenced with the excavation of Caves 16 and 17. Both, Satavahanas and Vakatakas, were followers of <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmanism.html" title="Brahmanism">Brahmanism</a> in their personal lives, but despite that, they not only generated a liberal climate where all religions could grow and a tolerant mind which had equal reverence for them all but also patronised their shrines, Buddhism being the main. India has approximately 1200 rock-cut cave temples of which as many as 800 are located in her western part, obviously, born of the liberal climate and tolerant mind of which these early ruling dynasties set examples.</p>
<p>Except a mention of a rock-cut monastery as the abode of the Buddhist monk Achala and the mountain range where it was located, the monastery being for certain Cave No. 26 and Ajanta ridge, the mountain range, in the travel account of the known Chinese pilgrim <a href="../../../h/i/u/Hiuen_Tsang_4963.html" title="Hiuen Tsang">Hiuen Tsang</a>, who visited India in the seventh century A. D. and stayed here for fifteen years, nothing of Ajanta was known before 1819 when some British officers of the Madras Army made a chance discovery of this magnificent site. They named it Ajanta after the name of the nearest village. The things, however, did not move any farther. After a gap of twenty-five years, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Fergusson_3602.html" title="James Fergusson">James Fergusson</a> presented a paper at the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Asiatic_Society_b8fb.html" title="Royal Asiatic Society">Royal Asiatic Society</a> of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> and <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> in 1843. This ever first scholarly study of the site drew global attention. Now Madras Army deputed its officer R. Gill to prepare copies of Ajanta murals. He worked from 1849 to 1855 and prepared 30 paintings, but unfortunately they were destroyed in a fire in 1866. Now efforts to discover Ajanta progressed into two directions, one preparing copies of murals, and other, researching its other aspects. Mr Griffiths, the Superintendent and Principal of Sir Jamshedji Jijibhai School of Art, <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombay.html" title="Bombay">Bombay</a>, was deputed to prepare copies of murals, who with a team of his students, was at Ajanta from 1872 to 1885 and prepared copies of its murals, but again the misfortune prevailed and most of them were destroyed in a fire. Finally, Lady Haringham and a team of artists comprising Syed Ahmad and Mohammad Fazlud-din of <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hyderabad.html" title="Hyderabad">Hyderabad</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nandalal_Bose_de88.html" title="Nandalal Bose">Nandalal Bose</a>, Asit Kumar Haldar and Samarendranath Gupta of the Calcutta School camped at Ajanta from 1910 to 1912 and copied its murals. It was, however, in 1956-57 that A.S.I. (<a href="../../../a/r/c/Archeological_Survey_of_India_9302.html" title="Archeological Survey of India">Archeological Survey of India</a>) took up a project and under it authentic copies of these murals were prepared.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
