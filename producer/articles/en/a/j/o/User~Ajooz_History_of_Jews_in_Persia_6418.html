	    <p>The beginnings of Jewish history in Iran date back to late biblical times. The books of Isaiah, Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, Chronicles, and Esther contain references to the life and experiences of Jews in Persia. In the book of Ezra, the Persian kings are credited with permitting and enabling the Jews to to return to Jerusalem and rebuilt their Temple; its reconstruction was affected "according to the decree of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia" (Ezra 6:14). This great event in Jewish history took place in the late sixth century B.C.E., by which time there was a well-established and influential Jewish community in Persia.</p>
<p>Persian Jews have lived in the territories of today's <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a> for over 2,700 years, since the first <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_diaspora.html" title="Jewish diaspora">Jewish diaspora</a> when <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shalmaneser_V_37f5.html" title="Shalmaneser V">Shalmaneser V</a> conquered the (Northern) Kingdom of Israel (<a href="../../../7/2/2/722_BCE_305e.html" title="722 BCE">722 BCE</a>) and sent the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israelites.html" title="Israelites">Israelites</a> into captivity at <a href="../../../k/h/o/Khorasan.html" title="Khorasan">Khorasan</a>. In <a href="../../../5/8/0/580s_BC_b145.html" title="580s BC">586 BCE</a>, the <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylonian.html" title="Babylonian">Babylonians</a> expelled large populations of Jews from <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judea.html" title="Judea">Judea</a> to the <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylonian_captivity.html" title="Babylonian captivity">Babylonian captivity</a>.</p>
<p>Jews who migrated to ancient Persia mostly lived in their own communities. The Persian Jewish communities include the ancient (and until the mid-<a href="../../../t/w/e/Twentieth_century.html" title="Twentieth century">20th century</a> still extant) communities not only of Iran, but of parts of what is now <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghanistan.html" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijan.html" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>, northwestern <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirgizstan.html" title="Kirgizstan">Kirgizstan</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/j/Tajikistan.html" title="Tajikistan">Tajikistan</a>, <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkmenistan.html" title="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a>, and <a href="../../../u/z/b/Uzbekistan.html" title="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the communities have been isolated from other Jewish communities, to the extent that their classification as "Persian Jews" is a matter of <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linguistics.html" title="Linguistics">linguistic</a> or <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geography.html" title="Geography">geographical</a> convenience rather than actual historical relationship with one another. During the peak of the Persian Empire, Jews are thought to have comprised as much as 20% of the population. <a href="http://www.dangoor.com/74034.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dangoor.com/74034.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>According to <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_ecd4.html" title="Encyclopædia Britannica">Encyclopædia Britannica</a>: "<i>The Jews trace their heritage in Iran to the <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylonian_Exile_dd7a.html" title="Babylonian Exile">Babylonian Exile</a> of the 6th century BC and, like the Armenians, have retained their ethnic, linguistic, and religious identity.</i>"<a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-230041/Iran" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-230041/Iran" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> But <a href="../../../l/i/b/Library_of_Congress_f2f1.html" title="Library of Congress">Library of Congress</a>'s country study on Iran states that "<i>Over the centuries the Jews of Iran became physically, culturally, and linguistically indistinguishable from the non-Jewish population.

<p>Three times during the 6th century BCE, the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jews</a> (Hebrews) of the ancient <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Judah_501d.html" title="Kingdom of Judah">Kingdom of Judah</a> were exiled to <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylon.html" title="Babylon">Babylon</a> by <a href="../../../n/e/b/Nebuchadnezzar_II_of_Babylon_281e.html" title="Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon">Nebuchadnezzar</a>. These three separate occasions are mentioned in <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Jeremiah_74cb.html" title="Book of Jeremiah">Jeremiah</a> (52:28-30). The first exile was in the time of <a href="../../../j/e/h/Jehoiachin.html" title="Jehoiachin">Jehoiachin</a> in <a href="../../../5/9/7/597_BC_5dc5.html" title="597 BC">597 BCE</a>, when the <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple_of_Jerusalem_2f96.html" title="Temple of Jerusalem">Temple of Jerusalem</a> was partially despoiled and a <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylonian_captivity.html" title="Babylonian captivity">number of the leading citizens removed</a>. After eleven years (in the reign of <a href="../../../z/e/d/Zedekiah.html" title="Zedekiah">Zedekiah</a>) a fresh rising of the Judaeans occurred; the city was razed to the ground, and a further deportation ensued. Finally, five years later, Jeremiah records a third captivity. After the overthrow of Babylonia by the <a href="../../../a/c/h/Achaemenid_Empire_8fe1.html" title="Achaemenid Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a>, <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyrus_the_Great_bb5e.html" title="Cyrus the Great">Cyrus the Great</a> gave the Jews permission to return to their native land (<a href="../../../5/3/7/537_BC_7bf2.html" title="537 BC">537 BCE</a>), and more than forty thousand are said to have availed themselves of the privilege, (See <a href="../../../j/e/h/Jehoiakim.html" title="Jehoiakim">Jehoiakim</a>; <a href="../../../e/z/r/Ezra.html" title="Ezra">Ezra</a>; <a href="../../../n/e/h/Nehemiah.html" title="Nehemiah">Nehemiah</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jews</a>). Cyrus also allowed them to practice their religion freely (See <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyrus_Cylinder_33a6.html" title="Cyrus Cylinder">Cyrus Cylinder</a>) unlike the previous Assyrian and Babylonian rulers.</p>

<p>Jewish sources contain no mention of the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parthia.html" title="Parthia">Parthian</a> influence; the very name "Parthia" does not occur. The <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenia.html" title="Armenia">Armenian</a> prince Sanatroces, of the royal house of the Arsacides, is mentioned in the "Small Chronicle" as one of the successors (diadochoi) of <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander.html" title="Alexander">Alexander</a>. Among other Asiatic princes, the Roman rescript in favor of the Jews reached <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arsaces.html" title="Arsaces">Arsaces</a> as well (I Macc. xv. 22); it is not, however, specified which Arsaces. Not long after this, the Partho-Babylonian country was trodden by the army of a Jewish prince; the <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syrian.html" title="Syrian">Syrian</a> king, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antiochus.html" title="Antiochus">Antiochus</a> Sidetes, marched, in company with Hyrcanus I., against the Parthians; and when the allied armies defeated the Parthians (<a href="../../../1/2/9/129_BC_1717.html" title="129 BC">129 BC</a>) at the River Zab (Lycus), the king ordered a halt of two days on account of the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Sabbath_9ef5.html" title="Jewish Sabbath">Jewish Sabbath</a> and <a href="../../../f/e/a/Feast_of_Weeks_5a36.html" title="Feast of Weeks">Feast of Weeks</a>. In <a href="../../../4/0/_/40_BC_e283.html" title="40 BC">40 BC</a> the Jewish puppet-king, <a href="../../../h/y/r/Hyrcanus.html" title="Hyrcanus">Hyrcanus</a> II., fell into the hands of the Parthians, who, according to their custom, cut off his ears in order to render him unfit for rulership. The Jews of Babylonia, it seems, had the intention of founding a high-priesthood for the exiled <a href="../../../h/y/r/Hyrcanus.html" title="Hyrcanus">Hyrcanus</a>, which they would have made quite independent of the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Land_of_Israel_af97.html" title="Land of Israel">Land of Israel</a>. But the reverse was to come about: the Judeans received a Babylonian, Ananel by name, as their high priest which indicates the importance enjoyed by the Jews of Babylonia. Still in religious matters the <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylonians.html" title="Babylonians">Babylonians</a>, as indeed the whole diaspora, were in many regards dependent upon the Land of Israel. They went on pilgrimages to <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> for the festivals.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parthian_Empire_6a8f.html" title="Parthian Empire">Parthian Empire</a> was an enduring empire that was based on a loosely configured system of vassal kings. Certainly this lack of a rigidly centralized rule over the empire had its draw backs, such as the rise of a Jewish robber-state in Nehardea (see <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anilai_and_Asinai_0b6b.html" title="Anilai and Asinai">Anilai and Asinai</a>). Yet, the tolerance of the <a href="../../../a/r/s/Arsacid.html" title="Arsacid">Arsacid</a> dynasty was as legendry as the first Persian dynasty, the <a href="../../../a/c/h/Achaemenids.html" title="Achaemenids">Achaemenids</a>. There is even an account that indicates the conversion of a small number of Parthian <a href="../../../v/a/s/Vassal.html" title="Vassal">vassal</a> <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kings.html" title="Kings">kings</a> of <a href="../../../a/d/i/Adiabene.html" title="Adiabene">Adiabene</a> to <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>. These instances and others show not only the tolerance of Parthian kings, but is also a testament to the extent at which the Parthians saw themselves as the heir to the preceding empire of <a href="../../../c/y/r/Cyrus_the_Great_bb5e.html" title="Cyrus the Great">Cyrus the Great</a>. So protective were the Parthians of the minority over whom they ruled, that an old <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish.html" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> saying indicates, <i>“When you see a Parthian charger tied up to a tomb-stone in the Land of Israel, the hour of the Messiah will be near”</i><a href="http://www.cais-soas.com/CAIS/History/ashkanian/parthian.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cais-soas.com/CAIS/History/ashkanian/parthian.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. The <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylonian.html" title="Babylonian">Babylonian</a> <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jews.html" title="Jews">Jews</a> wanted to fight in common cause with their <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judea.html" title="Judea">Judean</a> brethren against <a href="../../../v/e/s/Vespasian.html" title="Vespasian">Vespasian</a>; but it was not until the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Romans</a> waged war under <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trajan.html" title="Trajan">Trajan</a> against <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parthia.html" title="Parthia">Parthia</a> that they made their hatred felt; so, that it was in a great measure owing to the revolt of the Babylonian Jews that the Romans did not become masters of Babylonia too. <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philo.html" title="Philo">Philo</a> speaks of the large number of Jews resident in that country, a population which was no doubt considerably swelled by new immigrants after the destruction of Jerusalem. Accustomed in Jerusalem from early times to look to the east for help, and aware, as the Roman procurator Petronius was, that the Jews of Babylon could render effectual assistance, <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylonia.html" title="Babylonia">Babylonia</a> became with the fall of Jerusalem the very bulwark of Judaism. The collapse of the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bar_Kochba_revolt_bba8.html" title="Bar Kochba revolt">Bar Kochba revolt</a> no doubt added to the number of Jewish refugees in Babylon.</p>
<p>In the continuous struggles between the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parthians.html" title="Parthians">Parthians</a> and the Romans, the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jews.html" title="Jews">Jews</a> had every reason to hate the Romans, the destroyers of their sanctuary, and to side with the Parthians: their protectors. Possibly it was recognition of services thus rendered by the Jews of Babylonia, and by the Davidic house especially, that induced the Parthian kings to elevate the princes of the Exile, who till then had been little more than mere collectors of revenue, to the dignity of real princes, called <i><a href="../../../r/e/s/Resh_Galuta_0a51.html" title="Resh Galuta">Resh Galuta</a></i>. Thus, then, the numerous <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish.html" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> subjects were provided with a central authority which assured an undisturbed development of their own internal affairs.</p>

<p>In 1255, Mongols led by <a href="../../../h/u/l/Hulagu_Khan_1062.html" title="Hulagu Khan">Hulagu Khan</a> began a charge on Persia, and in 1257 they captured <a href="../../../b/a/g/Baghdad.html" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> putting an end to the <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbasid.html" title="Abbasid">Abbasid</a> caliphate. In Persia and surrounding areas, the Mongols established a division of the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mongol_Empire_05c7.html" title="Mongol Empire">Mongol Empire</a> known as <a href="../../../i/l/k/Ilkhanate.html" title="Ilkhanate">Ilkhanate</a>. Because in Ilkhanate all religions were considered equal, Mongol rulers abolished the inequality of dhimmis. One of the Ilkhanate rulers, <a href="../../../a/r/g/Arghun.html" title="Arghun">Arghun</a> Khan, even preferred Jews and Christians for the administrative positions and appointed Sa'd al-Daula, a Jew, as his <a href="../../../v/i/z/Vizier.html" title="Vizier">vizier</a>. The appointed, however, provoked resentment from the <a href="../../../u/l/e/Ulema.html" title="Ulema">Muslim clergy</a>, and after Arghun's death in 1291, al-Daula was murdered and Persian Jews suffered a period of violent persecutions from the Muslim populace instigated by the clergy. The contemporary Christian historian <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bar_Hebraeus_2664.html" title="Bar Hebraeus">Bar Hebraeus</a> wrote that the violence committed against the Jews during that period "neither tongue can utter, nor the pen write down".<sup id="_ref-littman2_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-littman2" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahmud_Ghazan_93fe.html" title="Mahmud Ghazan">Ghazan Khan</a>'s conversion to Islam in 1295 heralded for Persian Jews a pronounced turn for the worse, as they were once again relegated to the status of dhimmis. <a href="../../../%C3%B6/l/j/%C3%96ljeit%C3%BC.html" title="Öljeitü">Öljeitü</a>, Ghazan Khan's successor, destroyed many synagogues and decreed that Jews had to wear a distinctive mark on their heads; Christians endured similar persecutions. Under pressure, some Jews converted to Islam. The most famous such convert was <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashid_al-Din_d135.html" title="Rashid al-Din">Rashid al-Din</a>, a physician, historian and statesman, who adopted Islam in order to advance his career at Öljeitü's court. However, in 1318 he was executed on fake charges of poisoning Öljeitü and for several days crowds had been carrying his head around his native city of <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabriz.html" title="Tabriz">Tabriz</a>, chanting "This is the head of the Jew who abused the name of God; may God's curse be upon him!" About 100 years later, <a href="../../../m/i/r/Miranshah.html" title="Miranshah">Miranshah</a> destroyed Rashid al-Din's tomb, and his remains were reburied at the Jewish cemetery. Rashid al-Din's case illustrates a pattern that differentiated the treatment of Jewish converts in Persia from their treatment in other Muslim lands, except North Africa. In most Muslim countries, converts were welcomed and easily assimilated into the Muslim population. In Persia, however, Jewish converts were usually stigmatized on the account of their Jewish ancestry for many generations.<sup id="_ref-littman2_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-littman2" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>

<p>Further deterioration in the treatment of Persian Jews occurred during the reign of the Safavids who proclaimed <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27a_Islam_4b8a.html" title="Shi'a Islam">Shi'a Islam</a> the state religion. Shi'ism assigns great importance to the issues of ritual purity ― <a href="../../../p/a/a/Paak.html" title="Paak">tahara</a>, and non-Muslims, including Jews, are deemed to be ritually unclean ― <a href="../../../n/a/j/Najis.html" title="Najis">najis</a> ― so that physical contact with them would require Shi'as to undertake ritual purification before doing regular prayers. Thus, Persian rulers, and to an even larger extent, the populace, sought to limit physical contact between Muslims and Jews. Jews were not allowed to attend public baths with Muslims or even to go outside in rain or snow, ostensibly because some impurity could be washed from them upon a Muslim.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>The reign of Shah <a href="../../../a/b/b/Abbas_I_8091.html" title="Abbas I">Abbas I</a> (1588–1629) was initially benign; Jews prospered throughout Persia and were even encouraged to settle in <a href="../../../i/s/f/Isfahan_%28city%29.html" title="Isfahan (city)">Isfahan</a>, which was made a new capital. However, toward the end of his rule, the treatment of Jews became harsher; upon advice from a Jewish convert and Shi'a clergy, the shah forced Jews to wear a distinctive badge on clothing and headgear. In 1656, all Jews were expelled from Isfahan because of the common belief of their impurity and forced to convert to Islam. However, as it became known that the converts continued to practice <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> in secret and because the treasury suffered from the loss of <i>jizya</i> collected from the Jews, in 1661 they were allowed to revert to Judaism, but were still required to wear a distinctive patch upon their clothings.<sup id="_ref-littman2_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-littman2" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>

Yet, the advent of a Shi'a <a href="../../../q/a/j/Qajar.html" title="Qajar">Qajar</a> dynasty in 1794 brought back the earlier persecutions. In the middle of the 19th century, a European traveller wrote about the life of Persian Jews: "…they are obliged to live in a separate part of town…; for they are considered as unclean creatures… Under the pretext of their being unclean, they are treated with the greatest severity and should they enter a street, inhabited by Mussulmans, they are pelted by the boys and mobs with stones and dirt… For the same reason, they are prohibited to go out when it rains; for it is said the rain would wash dirt off them, which would sully the feet of the Mussulmans… If a Jew is recognized as such in the streets, he is subjected to the greatest insults. The passers-by spit in his face, and sometimes beat him… unmercifully… If a Jew enters a shop for anything, he is forbidden to inspect the goods… Should his hand incautiously touch the goods, he must take them at any price the seller chooses to ask for them... Sometimes the Persians intrude into the dwellings of the Jews and take possession of whatever please them. Should the owner make the least opposition in defense of his property, he incurs the danger of atoning for it with his life... If... a Jew shows himself in the street during the three days of the Katel (Muharram)…, he is sure to be murdered."<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>

<p>Another European traveller reported a degrading ritual to which Jews were subjected for public amusement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At every public festival — even at the royal salaam [salute], before the King’s face — the Jews are collected, and a number of them are flung into the hauz or tank, that King and mob may be amused by seeing them crawl out half-drowned and covered with mud.

<p>In the 19th century there were many instances of forced conversions and massacres, usually inspired by the Shi'a clergy. A representative of the <i><a href="../../../a/l/l/Alliance_Isra%C3%A9lite_Universelle_f24f.html" title="Alliance Israélite Universelle">Alliance Israélite Universelle</a></i>, a Jewish humanitarian and educational organization, wrote from <a href="../../../t/e/h/Tehran.html" title="Tehran">Tehran</a> in 1894: "…every time that a priest wishes to emerge from obscurity and win a reputation for piety, he preaches war against the Jews".<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[14]</a></sup> In 1830, the Jews of <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabriz.html" title="Tabriz">Tabriz</a> were massacred; the same year saw a forcible conversion of the Jews of <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiraz.html" title="Shiraz">Shiraz</a>. In 1839, many Jews were massacred in Mashhad and survivors were forcibly converted. However, European travellers later reported that the Jews of Tabriz and Shiraz continued to practice Judaism in secret despite a fear of further persecutions. Jews of <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babol.html" title="Babol">Barforush</a> were forcibly converted in 1866; when they were allowed to revert to Judaism thanks to an intervention by the <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">French</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> ambassadors, a mob killed 18 Jews of Barforush, burning two of them alive.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[15]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[16]</a></sup> In 1910, the Jews of Shiraz were accused of <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_libel.html" title="Blood libel">ritual murder</a> of a Muslim girl.

<p>According to Charles Recknagel and Azam Gorgin of <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_Free_Europe_8fc2.html" title="Radio Free Europe">Radio Free Europe</a>, during the reign of Reza Shah "the political and social conditions of the Jews changed fundamentally.

<p>A spike in anti-Jewish sentiment occurred after the establishment of the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">State of Israel</a> in 1948 and continued until 1953 due to the weakening of the central government and strengthening of the clergy in the course of political struggles between the shah and prime minister <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohammad_Mossadegh_d3f1.html" title="Mohammad Mossadegh">Mohammad Mossadegh</a>.

Although Jews accounted for only a small percentage of Iran's population, in 1979 two of the 18 members of the Iranian Academy of Sciences, 80 of the 4,000 university lecturers, and 600 of the 10,000 physicians in Iran were Jews.<sup id="_ref-sanasarian1_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-sanasarian1" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>
