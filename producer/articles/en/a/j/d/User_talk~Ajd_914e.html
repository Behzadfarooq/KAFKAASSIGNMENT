<p>Hi again -- I don't think that you follwed the links I added. They did not go back to the Villages of Barnstable article. Go back to this version [[ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Villages_of_Barnstable%2C_Massachusetts&amp;oldid=1967626" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Villages_of_Barnstable%2C_Massachusetts&amp;oldid=1967626" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Villages_of_Barnstable%2C_Massachusetts&amp;oldid=1967626</a>]] and you'll see that.

I take it back -- I didn't realize that you had made redirects -- I'll do some more figuring out -- I had only checked Centerville, and I guess I just lucked out... -- <a href="../../../b/c/o/User%7EBcorr_b5f0.html" title="User:Bcorr">BCorr ? Брайен</a> 21:03, 15 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
OK, here's what I'm thinking for the future: rather than redirecting all of the villages to an article that talks about the villages collectively, it would be much better to leave them uncreated, so that people will add information to them, rather than having redirects. People like to create those links to encourage articles to be written, and generally that won't even happen if a redirect is already living there (a lot of people don't know how to edit the redirect, since even that redirects you to the page that's pointed to.) Also, Hyannis, for example, will probably get it's own article sooner or later if there isn't a redirect. Also, you should visit <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Cities_0174.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Cities">WikiProject Cities</a> for more info, as well as <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERambot_08b0.html" title="User:Rambot">User:Rambot</a>.

<p>Regarding your edit to <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Massachusetts_d688.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston, Massachusetts</a>: a close study of the maps proved instructive. There is no question that Newbury Street, the defining locale of the Back Bay, is west of Tremont Street, although it forms an acute angle to Columbus Ave. The dividing line can be taken to be Huntington Ave. these days, which runs roughly northeast-southwest. Evidently you consider the north-south axis to be more significant. From my perspective, the South End <i>having largely been filled prior to the filling of the Back Bay</i>, its important north-south relationships are with the original Boston landmass (relative to which it is named) and Roxbury (from which parts of the South End were annexed before the rest of the town). The Back Bay fill properly includes the land west of the Southwest Corridor (ex-Boston &amp; Providence RR) and north of the Boston &amp; Albany. East of the B&amp;P and south of the B&amp;A is the South End.</p>

<p>In general, I appriciate the work linking the CDP and town articles. But, I have a question about <a href="../../../a/m/e/Amesbury%2C_Massachusetts_3e76.html" title="Amesbury, Massachusetts">Amesbury, Massachusetts</a>. Why did you change 'town' to 'city' in the article. AFIK Amesbury is a town, and Amesbury (CDP) is the central villlage in the town. Thanks .... <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELouI_01b3.html" title="User:LouI">Lou I</a> 17:55, 4 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>It's a city (though its official style is "the Town of Amesbury", much as Massachusetts is a state officially styled "the Commonwealth of..."). See e.g. <a href="http://www.state.ma.us/sec/cis/cispdf/ma_city_town.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.state.ma.us/sec/cis/cispdf/ma_city_town.pdf" rel="nofollow">the Mass. city-and-town map</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks. I've updated the article with some details. I've also changed the description of your links to the (CDP) page, and shifted article titles. I've got a list of CDP articles that I plan to shift the same way, but I'd appreciate it if you would look at my changes to see if you agree before I adjust any other articles. Thanks, <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELouI_01b3.html" title="User:LouI">Lou I</a> 09:04, 6 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm a little leery about "central urban area"; "urban" doesn't seem the right word to apply to Amesbury or most of these CDPs. Maybe "central developed area"? Or "original center of population"? Other than that, your description seems fine, though I don't know how easily it will carry over to other corresponding articles: is it the case, in all towns with a CDP of the same name, that the CDP contains the central developed area, such as it is, of the town? The only thing I can think of is Barnstable, where the central developed area is Hyannis, not the village of Barnstable; but I think the village of Barnstable isn't a CDP so we're okay on that particular case.</li>
</ul>
<p>I chose 'urban' as the description since Amesbury had become a 'city'. The coupole of these entrires I've handled before I used 'village', or sometimes 'neighborhood'. Essex County is clean, I'll put further discussion of that subject on the talk page for CDP's. Thank's for looking. I'll shift the rest of Essex County articles before I go back to history. (FYI, I got here in the first place while researching Josiah Bartlett).

<p>When the rambot first created those articles, it labeled the CDPs as towns, even though they were not necessarily towns. Because in many states the term "town" has a specific legal meaning, it could not be used as a generic term. So we had no choice after many complaints to have the rambot change every article that SHOULD have said <a href="../../../c/d/p/CDP_cab4.html" title="CDP">CDP</a>. That meant replacing "town" with "CDP". In the case of <a href="../../../w/a/k/Wakefield%2C_Massachusetts_f1cf.html" title="Wakefield, Massachusetts">Wakefield, Massachusetts</a>, you were incorrect to change it back to town, at least in part. The demographic census data refers to the CDP of Wakefield, even if such a town really does exist in its legal form as a town. Because of this, it is factually incorrect to use the term "town" within the statistics, <i>unless</i> one can first prove that the CDP that the census bureau uses and the legal town limits are exactly the same thing, however, this is often <b>not</b> the case. I don't know if in Massachusetts the term "town" has a specific legal meaning and whether or not it can be applied to this particular CDP. We must be very careful not to reintroduce the same factual errors in the articles that were there before just because someone doesn't like the term CDP out of personal preference. Maintaining the integrity of the articles is far more important. Since you apparently know more about Massachusetts than I do, maybe you specifically know the answers to some of my questions above, but it is only fair that you know exactly why the CDP term has been restored to some 5,500 articles. If you changed it back to "town" in error, please restore the "CDP" term. Also the term "community" has been proposed as a better generic term than "town", although it is possible that "community" also has a specific legal meaning in some states. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">Ram-Man</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Ram-Man&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Ram-Man&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">comment</a>| <a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERam-Man_6a13.html" title="User talk:Ram-Man">talk)</a> 13:27, Dec 6, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, sorry to butt in here, but I had noticed Ajd's edits and the comment on Ram-Man's talk page. I've just been reading up about CDPs (and have updated the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Census-designated_place.html" title="Census-designated place">census-designated place</a> article. Anyhow, I've learned some interesting tidbits (well, maybe only interesting to census geeks). First, the Census Bureau considers New England Towns to be <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_civil_division.html" title="Minor civil division">minor civil divisions</a> (MCDs), even though they are incorporated municipalities with strong government. Many of these NE towns (and most MCDs elsewhere) encompass both rural and urban areas (and historically they all were simply a means of providing a default government to geographic subdivisions of a county). However, many such MCDs are now heavily urbanized and have strong municipal governments, thus resembling cities, villages and other incorporated places. However, the data for MCDs appear in a separate category from places. So for MCDs which consist largely of urban area and have a strong form of government, the Census Bureau has defined CDPs that are coterminous with the MCD. This is to allow users of Census data to find the locality in either category. So Ram-man is correct, that these places are BOTH Towns and CDPs (and with a uniquely New England wrinkle, some Towns that have adopted city forms of government are still considered MCDs by the Census Bureau and so are also defined as CDPs). In such cases, I think it would be appropriate to simply note in the demographics section that the town (or city) has also been defined as a CDP. Any other references to the place can use the town (or city) as appropriate. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a><font color="blue"><b>≠</b></font><a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 17:46, Dec 6, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>This is exactly the solution I would take, with the slight exception that in the demographics section I would make clear that the statistics are for the CDP, not merely that it has also been defined as a CDP. Of course this is a minor change in semantics. It is unfortunate that the rambot had to change all of the valid town entries back into CDP, but it had no way of knowing which "town" references were correct and which ones were wrong. They all had to be changed and thus we'd have to clean up the mess afterwards, but at least we'd have validity and data integrity at the (temporary) expense of article usability and clarity. The reason more Massachusetts cities have not been labeled as CDPs is because the census bureau does not consider those other places to be CDPs. In the case of <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashby%2C_Massachusetts_2d58.html" title="Ashby, Massachusetts">Ashby, Massachusetts</a>, the census bureau has labelled it as a town. The rambot knew which towns should have orginally been labeled as towns and which should have been labeled as CDPs (based on what the census bureau thinks they were), so that it only modified the potentially incorrect entries. Its probably a pain, but verifying the town status is the best solution to maintain accuracy. -- <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERam-Man_eba5.html" title="User:Ram-Man">Ram-Man</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Ram-Man&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Ram-Man&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">comment</a>| <a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERam-Man_6a13.html" title="User talk:Ram-Man">talk)</a> 18:11, Dec 6, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I might add, that I think in MA, even though some Towns have adopted city-forms of government, they may still be considered as Towns by the Census (or also by MA state government). For example, <a href="../../../w/e/y/Weymouth%2C_Massachusetts_65d9.html" title="Weymouth, Massachusetts">Weymouth, Massachusetts</a> is a town that has adopted a city form of government, but it still called a town, is listed by MA government as a town <a href="http://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/eleclk/clkidx.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/eleclk/clkidx.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, and considered by the Census Bureau as a town. And there is also a CDP that is equivalent to the Town. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a><font color="blue"><b>≠</b></font><a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 19:25, Dec 6, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Another note concerning using CDP to describe the statistics: actually in these specific cases there were (or should have been) articles for both the town and CDP with identical statistics. So in these specific cases, I would simply note that the Census Bureau has also defined the town as a CDP, but leave all the references as town. In cases where the CDP is not equivalent to the town, these should remain in separate articles and the CDP data identified as being the CDP (and not "community" as that may be understood somewhat different in local usage). <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a><font color="blue"><b>≠</b></font><a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 21:17, Dec 6, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree about not using "community"; apparently in Mass. municipal government jargon, "community" is equivalent to "city or town", and so using it for 'CDP' would be counterproductive. Also, the Mass. government seems to be unsure about how to regard towns that have adopted city status with "Town of" names. The page you cite lists them as towns, but the official pdf map <a href="http://www.mass.gov/sec/cis/cispdf/ma_city_town.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mass.gov/sec/cis/cispdf/ma_city_town.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> marks them as cities; and mass.gov refers passim to the state as having 301 towns and 50 cities, which count includes the "Town of" cities as cities. I think nothing is gained by referring to the towns with equivalent CDPs as CDPs. The joint town-CDP status is essentially a Census Bureau–internal bookkeeping trick for making the data easier to sort; and whether or not a town is categorized by the Census Bureau as a CDP has no relevance to anyone who lives there, or to anyone who is trying to interpret the statistics. Of course it makes sense to refer to regular CDPs as CDPs, since that's the only way the boundaries of the area are defined. But we have no need to be echoing one of the Census Bureau's errors (i.e., failing to categorize Massachusetts cities and Massachusetts towns as equivalent levels of organization) just because that's the way the Census Bureau did it. Oh, and it might be worth checking in with someone who knows something about towns in Connecticut and other states whose incorporated towns the Census Bureau treats incorrectly, to make sure rambot didn't mislabel any of those around the same time.</dd>

<dd>No, it doesn't. One, <i>Schmuck</i> is German for 'jewel', but not Yiddish. Two, if an English word had come from a Yiddish equivalent of the German word <i>Schmuck</i>, it would have been spelled and pronounced <i>shmook</i> in English, not <i>shmuck</i> (compare the English word <i>shnook</i>).

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I don't understand what the problem with using the name "Commonwealth of Massachusetts" is. On this page, and <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston.html" title="Boston">Boston</a> article people keep changing the name from the full and common name to just Massachusetts. As one born and bred here, I find shorting the name distasteful and uncalled for. This was the Commonwealth of Massachusetts before there was an United States of America.</p>

<p>thanks for negotiating with the balts on IE languages. Your statement</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>It is an unquestioned fact that Baltic is the most archaic of the living Indo-European families</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>is a bit strong though. It's "unquestioned" among Baltic students of Baltic, maybe, but that's as far as it goes. It is also undisputed that Baltic has <i>a few</i> very archaic <i>features</i>, certainly surprising for a language attested as late as the 2nd millennium AD, but that doesn't make the entire language "unquestionedly archaic". The Tacitus attestation may be debatable, but only if there is an unquestionably Baltic word (of which I haven't heard), not just because he mentions a Baltic tribe. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 13:22, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I was trying to give his as much of the benefit of the doubt as I could. And anyway, those two or three archaic features are rather more than other typical living IE languages have. I'm only a grad student and by no means an expert; but several of my professors have described Lithuanian to me as the most archaic living IE language, so it's not an out-of-the-mainstream claim. <a href="../../../a/j/d/User%7EAjd_013d.html" title="User:Ajd">AJD</a> 14:18, 15 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>by all means, some features are incredibly archaic, especially if you only consider living languages. Other features aren't archaic at all, otoh. I have no problem with celebrating the archaic ones, as long as we don't imply the language is "practically PIE", or more archaic than (admittedly extinct as first languages, although there are fluent speakers) Ancient Greek or Sanskrit). <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 14:35, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>At least I'm not the only one to have noticed it and commented about it. I was thinking the complaints had something to do with "original research", which I take to mean that if I am the only one in the history of the universe that has observed something and/or it has not been published <i>by someone else</i>, then it "doesn't count". The original research concept is good, mostly for protection... if I cite a source that ultimately proves inaccurate, I have someone to blame ("I was led on by the treachery of others!" -- Alex, in "A Clockwork Orange"). However, according to the blurb you see when you edit the movie article, the article is overly long anyway. Maybe the article should be confined to the bare bones of the plot and there should be a separate page for much of the minutia that appears in the current article? <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 2 July 2005 09:04 (UTC)</p>
<p>Revelation: The Red Brick Road <i>is</i> "referred to" <b>by inference</b>. Why does Glinda say "Follow the <b>Yellow</b> Brick Road"? So that Dorothy <i>won't</i> follow the <b>Red</b> Brick Road! If there was only one brick road, she wouldn't have to say "Follow the Yellow Brick Roard", but just "Follow the Brick Road", or maybe even just "Follow the Road". Yes??? That would change the song, of course. They wouldn't be singing "Follow the Yellow Brick Road". Maybe just, "Ease on down, ease on down the Road"! <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 2 July 2005 09:15 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm the guy who wrote the sections on Yiddish genders and case endings, which you fixed up. I now have a username. I must admit that you know English <i>and</i> Yiddish better than I do. However, I think we should add genitive to the case endings chart. In some sentences it is very clear that genitive is the same as dative. For example: Dos iz di Hoyz fun der froy. Because the word froy preceded by a prepostion, just like (most) dative phrases. However in the following sentance, on might use nominative by mistake: Der man's hoyz is veyt. because hoyz is the subject (nominative), and "Der Man" is part of the complete subject, one might say "der Man" instead of "Dem Man". Please write to me what you think. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliezerke_fb4e.html" title="User:Eliezerke">Eliezerke</a> 05:07, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>P.S. Thanks for fixing up what I wrote. p.p.s. I hope you can read the Yiddish words I wrote. I am not used to transliterating Yiddish&#160;;</p>

<dd>Are you referring to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Harvard_Yard&amp;diff=70348601&amp;oldid=70342356" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Harvard_Yard&amp;diff=70348601&amp;oldid=70342356" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>? Basically my objection was to drawing some kind of distinction between "pahk the cah in hahvud yahd" and "pak the caa in havid yad"—this kind of ad-hoc pronunciation spelling is basically meaningless, in that it doesn't indicate in a way that can be clearly understood what pronunciations you're actually referring to. Moreover, pronunciation spellings like "pak" are actively misleading—no one with a Boston accent pronounces the word "park" the same as "pack", which is what the spelling "pak" seems to suggest; at least "pahk" is correct <i>within</i> the accent. (That is, someone with a non-rhotic Boston accent <i>would</i> pronounce "park" the same as the hypothetical word "pahk".) No one, to my knowledge, has ever documented geographic dialect variation within a large city <i>un</i>connected with social class and ethnicity—e.g., there's no "South Boston accent" different from a "Charlestown accent". There <i>are</i> effects of socioeconomic class, of course, but in the cities in which they've been studied in detail, the different socioeconomic classes exhibit the same phonological variables and processes, merely carried out to a greater or lesser degree. <a href="../../../a/j/d/User%7EAjd_013d.html" title="User:Ajd">AJD</a> 06:03, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello.
