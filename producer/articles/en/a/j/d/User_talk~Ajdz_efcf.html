<dd>That doesn't make the dates notable.

<p>Correcting grammar is one thing, editing the meaning of my contribution I do not like. As to my misrepresenting the facts, please what does the following mean, and how is it different from the edit?</p>
<p><b>What critics say on his record:</b> <i>Alito's record reveals that he "has been extraordinarily deferential to the exercise of government power, especially executive branch power, except in cases involving alleged infringements on religious expression," according to the AFJ. His "judicial record strongly suggests that he will ... interpret the Constitution as giving the president greater authority to evade Congressional statutes and constitutional limitations whenever deemed essential to national security."</i><a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0601/S00068.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0601/S00068.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <i><b>He has supported the fringe "unitary executive" theory, which would give the president greater power to detain Americans and would throw off the checks and balances</b> built into the Constitution.</i><a href="http://www.truthout.org/docs_2006/012306D.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.truthout.org/docs_2006/012306D.shtml" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <i>Judge Alito backed away from one of his most extreme statements in this area - his assertion, in a 1985 job application, that he believed "very strongly" in "the supremacy of the elected branches of government." But <b>he left a disturbing impression that as a justice, he would undermine the Supreme Court's critical role in putting a check on presidential excesses.</b></i><a href="http://www.truthout.org/docs_2006/011206G.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.truthout.org/docs_2006/011206G.shtml" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p><b>Stance towards Presidential powers according to critics:</b> <i>However, Bush's recent actions make it clear that he interprets the coordinate construction approach extremely aggressively. <b>In his view, and the view of his Administration, that doctrine gives him license to overrule and bypass Congress or the courts, based on his own interpretations of the Constitution -- even where that violates long-established laws and treaties, counters recent legislation that he has himself signed,</b> ........</i><a href="http://writ.news.findlaw.com/commentary/20060109_bergen.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://writ.news.findlaw.com/commentary/20060109_bergen.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <i>“I have carefully read the writings, the speeches and the decisions of Samuel Alito in [the area of executive power], and they all point in one direction: a very troubling pattern of great deference to executive authority,” Chemerinsky said in his testimony.</i><a href="http://www.chronicle.duke.edu/vnews/display.v/ART/2006/01/18/43ce324778eac" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chronicle.duke.edu/vnews/display.v/ART/2006/01/18/43ce324778eac" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <i><b>Alito apparently believes that a president may decide by executive fiat what law is or is not constitutional, and whether he is bound by the rule of law. Alito's willingness to elevate the president to an exalted status above the law</b> is truly frightening to hear from a Supreme Court nominee. This view harkens back to the divine right of kings (the king is accountable to no one but God), which was forever rejected by our American Revolution. Alito is clearly signaling that if he serves on the Supreme Court, he will serve as a rubber stamp for the exercise of unchecked executive power.</i><a href="http://www.azstarnet.com/dailystar/dailystar/112283.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.azstarnet.com/dailystar/dailystar/112283.php" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> <i>Whatever else Alito may or may not have made clear about his views on such issues as abortion, federalism and religious freedom, he has certainly made clear that he has no interest in restraining the acts of this commander in chief.</i><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/chi-0601240222jan24,1,7806633.story?coll=chi-opinionfront-hed" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/chi-0601240222jan24,1,7806633.story?coll=chi-opinionfront-hed" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>

<dd>Ajdz, Nescio has raised a couple of points, and he seems to have found some critics who support them. We don't need to automatically accept what they say, but we shouldn't just dismiss them either, simply because they have a POV. We all have a POV on most things, the challenge for us all is to find a NPOV that we can all live with.</dd>
<dd>I'm not an expert on Alito or Unitary Excutive theory, but I think I'm able to judge competing claims on their merits. Would either of you mind if I asked each of you a few questions?

<p><b>Regarding <a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMicahmn_1f20.html#Your_overreaction" title="User talk:Micahmn">your comment</a></b></p>
<p>I apologize if you think that I was overreacting with my reversion, but there was good reason for what I did and what I said. As for your edit being marked as minor, I believe that it wasn't. <a href="../../../m/i/n/Wikipedia%7EMinor_edit_ba6d.html" title="Wikipedia:Minor edit">Minor edits</a> are making something a wikilink, changing the spelling of something or formatting something, not adding or removing content (many of your changes in that edit would be considered minor, except the part I took exception to).</p>
<p>And for the record, I don't think that I "angrily reverted it." This was something that had been removed in the past, there was no explanation as to why it was removed, and it was marked as a minor edit. I reverted that change with a note about marking edits as minor, and I'm sorry if it looked like I was being harsh (would an angry revert have a "please" in it?).</p>
<p>The reason why that statement was in the article is because a previously similar statement was replaced with Coleman simply calling himself "pro-life." While I'm not going to get into the argument over whether or not "pro-life" is an NPOV label, I - and others - believe that it should be clarified for people reading the article that might not be savvy to that euphemism or aren't from the United States. Coleman makes no exceptions in his opposition to abortion, that's a relevant fact, and should be clarified in the article. I would strongly encourage you to re-write it if you think that it is poorly worded, but unilaterally taking that out is removing useful information from the article.</p>
<p>Again, I apologize if you felt I was harsh; I'm just a little zealous sometimes about making this a quality article. -- <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMicahmn_743a.html" title="User:Micahmn">MicahMN</a> | <b><a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMicahmn_1f20.html" title="User talk:Micahmn">μ</a></b> 20:15, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the clarification. I do think the statement still looks redundant (which is the only reason I removed it in the first place), mostly because it remains vague, but I don't know enough about Coleman's positions to rewrite it. For example, does he oppose abortion to save the life of the mother? A source might be useful here. In fact, if sourced, your statement would work quite well: "Coleman makes no exceptions in his opposition to abortion"</dd>

<p>Just seeking your input on the Mike Ferguson bit. When we talk about a 'controversial contraceptive' are we talking about RU-486? This is another one of those examples where we get into Hill-Speak. The left calls it a contraceptive pill while the right calls it an abortion pill. In order to neutralize the piece, would it be better to just call it RU-486 with a link to the article on the pill? I am not sure if that one issue is going to be that important in the race, but I think we should try and make it acceptable to all. If RU-486 is not the 'contraceptive' in question, then forget everything I just said.<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontco_3514.html" title="User:Montco">Montco</a> 17:42, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know all the details because the source in his own article is an anti-Mike Ferguson blog. The last time I checked it looked like he might possibly oppose or be less than supportive of the morning after pill (which I believe is different than RU-486, but raising exactly the issue that you described). I've just been trying to prevent significant overgeneralization and wouldn't be surprised if someone who knows more about that specific race would say it isn't even worth including here.

<p>Mr Petro would dispute the "he is the front-runner" claim (although he probably is). Depending on the poll, the Republican primary is pretty close. It's silly for Wiki to include highly dynamic info such as who is the "front-runner". Since Wiki is based on volunteers, it does not have a reliable method to maintain accuracy for descriptions of political races. Newspapers discuss current events. If Wikipedia is truly an "encylopedia", it should focus on the know-able and focus on history. Recent history may be okay, e.g. Katrina. However, political races involve people's opinions, rather than event descriptions. Wikipedia, if it wants to be a tax-deductible 'free encyclopedia', should consider avoiding topics where Wiki itself can become a tool to shape opinions in political races. Is Wiki a newspaper and its articles just Op-Ed candidate endorsements or is Wiki an 'encyclopedia'? (Are some Wikipedians really just acting like their own 527 political interest group, with Wiki articles as their free method to distribute their campaign message? It can appear this way.)</p>
<p>Mr Strickland would also dispute the "he is the front-runner" claim (and local Ohio blogs would likely agree). Come November, the not-a-Republican vote -- which is currently polling to Strickland -- could easily go instead to Libertarian Mr Peirce. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.102.48.2 (<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User_talk%7E67.102.48.2.html" title="User talk:67.102.48.2">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.102.48.2_95c2.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.102.48.2">contribs</a>).</small></p>
