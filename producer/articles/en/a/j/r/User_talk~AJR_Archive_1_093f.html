<p>I just wanted to say that you did a good job creating those ICFTU regional organisation articles. I was the one to put them on the list (quite some time ago) and I've been meaning to do some research on them myself, but never got around to it. So I'm very happy to see the links finally turn blue. Thanks for that, and keep up the good work. / <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlarm_3336.html" title="User:Alarm">Alarm</a> 21:08, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm leaving you this message because you posted a reply on the Copyright Violation page. Please let me know if there is a different procedure to follow.</p>
<p>I posted a request for removal of a copyrighted image nearly 5 days ago, and it has not been responded to nor any action taken. I see that responses to other requests are generally posted within a day or so.</p>
<p>Would you please take a look at my request to remove the image "Wintu Women Circa 1900" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Request_for_immediate_removal_of_copyright_violation#Copyright_infringement_3" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Request_for_immediate_removal_of_copyright_violation#Copyright_infringement_3" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and let me know if there is some other method I should be following to achieve the removal of this copyrighted image.</p>
<p>The text of the request is below:</p>
<p>"Copyright infringement</p>
<p>"I have been contacted and informed that an image as to which I represent the copyright holders is posted in Wikipedia Commons without permission. Please remove the following image immediately: [Wintu_Women_circa_1900.jpg].</p>
<p>"The source of the image is listed as the website of the College of the Siskiyous, where the image appears with permission; the image on that website clearly contains the copyright statement: © 2001 Masson-Gomez Family.</p>
<p>"I have read the statement of the person who originally posted the image, and it appears that he was under the mistaken impression that the copyright had expired - that impression is incorrect. While the image was created some time ago, it remained privately held by the family, and was not published or registered for copyright until recently. Under the Copyright Act, this image is clearly currently copyright protected.</p>
<p>"Under 17 U.S.C. sec. 303, as a work created before 1978 but not theretofore in the public domain, which was then first published in 2001, the copyright remains active until December 31, 2047. There is a very useful chart published on the Cornell University website that sets out these complex rules in a simple way Copyright Protection Chart.</p>
<p>"If you have any questions please contact the administrator of the College of the Siskiyous website directly, and he will confirm the copyright status of the image.</p>

<p>Hi! Something as short as that entry was can be speedied as having a lack of content...it wasn't even a complete sentence. &#160;:) There wasn't enough there to be particularly useful, but she did something of note.

<p>I just got myself started in Wikipedia stuff; I was searching for other Quakers and found the "Quaker Wikipedians" category. Noticing it wasn't listed under "Wikipedians by Religion," I made it so.&#160;:) Anyway, I'm mostly just saying Hi.</p>

I do have permission from the Banner of Truth Trust to include some photos/pictures from their biography of George Whitefield by Arnold Dallimore, but this does not include the Victorian building. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeterR_b418.html" title="User:PeterR">PeterR</a> 22:11, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

I don't know if this is the place I am supposed to thank you for your reply to my query about a literary term. I had already loked at meta-reference and meta literature and I guess this would be an example of that as well. The book is Second Sight by Gary Blackwood. The characters do not break the "fourth wall" though I am glad to know about that term. The author does comment about the time lapse since the story took place, and other issues, but the characters seem unaware of the reader.</p>

<p>Um, AJR, are you aware of <b>this</b>. In my opinion, the correctness of his data is not the issue. The George Reeves vandal has not been banned and perhaps <i>cannot</i> be banned, but ought to have been banned long since, therefore all of his edits are prima facie unallowable. The person is demented, seriously, he cannot be treated like a normal sane person, and it is unfair and naive to pretend that this is a he-said-she-said situation. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 07:31, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Good evening, thanks for reverting the vandalism in the article about the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement.

<dd>I have left a note on <a href="../../../o/p/e/User_talk%7EOperagirldia_c6b3.html" title="User talk:Operagirldia">your user talk page</a> about what can happen next. Basically, is the appropriate permission exists Wikipedia can simply use the text you wrote for the GAMP website. If you want to use the new text instead, that's fine also.</dd>
<dd>In the first situation (using the text from the website) it's simply a case of reverting the article back to the text you supplied (and then tidying it up to fit the <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">Wikipedia style guidelines</a>, hopefully.) This needs either a statement on the the website saying that the text is available under the terms of the <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_Free_Documentation_License_9d01.html" title="GNU Free Documentation License">GNU Free Documentation License</a>, or confirmation by email, but with either of those is quite quick and simple to handle.</dd>
<dd>If your new text is used instead, it needs an administrator to delete the old version (I'm not an admin and can't do that myself) so that the temporary page can be moved into place - usually the "copyright problem" boilerplate is meant to stay up for a week (plus whatever the current backlog for dealing with them is) to allow time for mistakes to be spotted, but given the circumstances there are probably ways to dealing with it more quickly if you want. -- <a href="../../../a/j/r/User%7EAJR_ccb2.html" title="User:AJR">AJR</a> | <a href="../../../a/j/r/User_talk%7EAJR_a5b7.html" title="User talk:AJR">Talk</a> 01:30, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi AJR</p>
<p>Thank you for your message, though I couldn't work out how to reply. I too am all for balanced info and note that you have been pretty fair with your re-edit. However, DSEi is not an 'arms fair'. How can it be, when weapons and related systems make up less than 4% of the show? It is like calling the London Boat Show a windsurfing exhibition, or calling the Motor Show a gearbox show.</p>
<p>Also, it isn't too balanced to only have one photo, showing protests - how can I upload a photo of the show?</p>
<p>I appreciate the need to document the controversy and protests involved with the show for Wiki readers, but the stuff about regimes with immoral human rights records is wildly inaccurate, as is always the way with DSEi reporting - not sure we're ever going to change that though!!</p>
<p>One minor point and I don't know how to edit, but it is DSEi not Dsei as appears in the title. I deleted references to Spearhead Exhibitions because it no longer exists.</p>
<p>Apologies that I edited it so brutally yesterday, I am new to Wikipedia and therefore unaware of protocol/procedure - so your message was helpful and informative as well as fair, and is certainly something I will bear in mind.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>J</p>
