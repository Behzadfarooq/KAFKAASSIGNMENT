	    <p>HELP ME FIND MY COUNTRY A BIOGRAPHY OF A.J. GREA</p>
<p>www.ajgrea.com</p>
<p>Some would say its Country. Others would say its Delta Blues. Then, there are some would say that it is Pop. Regardless of the label, A.J. GREA has blended forms of music that no one would imagine could coexist.</p>
<p>It doesn’t take long sitting in the same room with A.J. to know that he will be a force to be dealt with in the music industry. His handsome face, charming personality, and inviting laugh let’s you know that this Knoxville, Tennessee native is “in it for the music.” You can tell without a doubt that he has paid his dues, learned his lessons, and come full circle as an artist. He is an expert songwriter, quick-witted comedian, and master storyteller.</p>
<p>He began his career in the Pop arena in the mid 90’s and achieved modest success with his first independent Pop release entitled Sane Inside Insanity in 1997. Regional touring dates and club appearances helped to promote the album, but something was missing. A.J. had began working on a new concept album called Funhouse, when he decided to step back and reevaluate himself as an artist.</p>
<p>“The music was fun,” A.J. states, “but lacked real feeling. Pop and Dance music was beginning to change and I wasn’t sure it was heading in a direction I wanted to follow. I mean, don’t get me wrong, any music that has a beat you can move to is music I like, but there also has to be meaning somewhere. With Pop or Dance music, it seems the audience is more excited to see what you are going to do, or how you will dance, rather that what you are going to say. ”</p>
<p>Though Funhouse was written and arranged it never went into production.</p>
<p>“I needed to learn and change,” he states. “I knew just enough at that time to be dangerous. Funhouse was an album I was proud of, but I couldn’t get excited about it or think about doing another tour because my heart simply wasn’t in it. There were so many messages and stories in the album and I felt, in the end, it was a little too ‘deep’ for the Pop world. So, I decided to step back and find my artistry before really expanding, seeking representation, or a label.”</p>
<p>A.J. began publicly backing away. He needed to fade before he could reemerge as the artist he would become. Therefore, he closed the book for a while and decided to rediscover the important parts of music that he loved.</p>
<p>“I went back to my roots,” A.J. said with the smile. “Or more truthfully, I went to my mother. My mother had eight of us, seven boys and one girl, and music, church, and family was always large part of our existence. All of my siblings either sang or played an instrument. Any family gathering always ended up with music of all genres being played, and it was this acoustic, this raw setting, that I missed and exactly what I needed in my music.”</p>
<p>A.J. began studying Country and Blues, as well as Folk music. He also dove deep into production and studio mixing. After three years and many studio tests, a destination was reached.</p>
<p>“I had a few test runs and a couple of songs I began to work on. Then, late one night it all just came together. I knew at that moment I had found it; I had come home. Country, Bluegrass, and Blues are the few genres where songs with messages or stories are not only widely accepted, but expected.”</p>
<p>And A.J. had indeed found something unique. He has now written, arranged, produced, and performed a grouping of songs for a demo compilation containing original tracks like the acoustic search for direction entitled “Help Me Find My Country” and the farmer’s struggle with “The Taxman Blues.”</p>
<p>In conclusion, you can see the sincerity in his words and humbleness in his eyes. There is no question that A.J. GREA will become one of the most respected artists in music today and will bring about change in the Country Music industry that will last for decades to come.</p>
