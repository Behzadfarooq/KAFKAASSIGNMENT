<dd>I see what you mean. He wants to depersonalize the whole thing (eliminating the names if the athletes) and otherwise get rid of anything he views as sympathetic towards Israel, which he clearly hates. Too bad. He is wrong to drastically alter waht was a balanced, factual article to fit his worldview.</dd>

<p>Hi A2Kafir. The version HistoryBuffEr tried to insert was his own; he does this with all articles he edits, creates his own POV version, and insists on inserting it without any kind of consensus or agreement in Talk:. Feel free to revert them whenever you see them, as his versions violate Wikipedia policy in several important ways. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 03:31, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I actually thought the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bat_bomb.html" title="Bat bomb">Bat bomb</a> edit you reverted was a good one; I looked up the two books and "Sunwing" does seem to be inspired, plot-wise, by the bat bomb project, whereas "Silverwing" isn't. Just a thought. I have a special affinity for this article, because it was my first one on Wikipedia (before I got a login)............ <a href="../../../a/2/k/User%7EA2Kafir_5330.html" title="User:A2Kafir">A2Kafir</a> 23:15, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I assumed that since the books were one series having the link to the one with an article would be best, not realising it needn't be referenced in all books from the series. My bad, restored.

<p>"Good lord. It's like arguing with a lump of depleted uranium." Hey, if it's me you're referring to, (a) smile when you say that, and (b) can't you upgrade my predepleted self to plutonium? Erm, that little matter aside, I was outside the Leaning Tower the year before last. Its leaningness lets too many people overlook what a lovely building it was supposed to be, and still is. Shortly after seeing it I saw a wonderful photo book devoted to it. Italian text only, and I didn't buy it because it was big and expensive and I'd already bought too many books, and I stupidly omitted to make a note of the photographer, title, ISBN. Extensive websearches have failed to turn up anything. D'you happen to know the book I'm talking about? -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 02:39, 7 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you for the reminder of separate-language capabilities of Bookfinder, O fellow infidel. I'll take a look later. Books, books -- yes, I have dozens of them; I don't know what to do. The most monstrous is the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>, 10th edition: the spines are crumbling and the effect on the, er, decor is profoundly depressing. As for Italian book-souvenirs, my prize is Salvini, <i>Il Duomo di Modena</i>. And as for irresistible bargains, if you don't already have <i>Get me a table without flies, Harry</i> (bemused American tourists in Ireland and all that), snap it up <a href="http://zippythepinhead.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&amp;Product_Code=gmtwf1&amp;Category_Code=bk&amp;Product_Count=6" class="external text" title="http://zippythepinhead.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&amp;Product_Code=gmtwf1&amp;Category_Code=bk&amp;Product_Count=6" rel="nofollow">at half price</a>.

<p>Hi, looking at your recent edits on <a href="../../../k/h/m/Khmer_Rouge_98c5.html" title="Khmer Rouge">Khmer Rouge</a> I see that you have reverted the page at least three times in the past twenty-four hours:</p>
<ul>
<li>17:50, 16 Dec 2004 reverting to 5:07, 16 Dec 2004</li>
<li>01:35, 17 Dec 2004 reverting to the same version</li>
<li>02:48, 17 Dec 2004 reverting to the same version</li>
</ul>
<p>This is usually a sign that you need to step back a bit and, if the page needs to be reverted, let someone else do it.</p>
<p>It's also a breach of the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">Three revert rule</a>, which makes three or more reversions by the same user in twenty-four hours an offence that can be dealt with by an administrator blocking you for twenty-four hours. Consider this a polite warning.</p>
<p>It's okay to go to another editor and ask him to look at a page and see if he thinks it should be reverted. That would not be breaking the rule.</p>
<p>I agree that the other user should go to the talk page and discuss his POV problems. Why not leave a message on his talk page asking him to do so? --[[User:Tony Sidaway|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html#Page_Footer" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a>]] 03:06, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi A2Kafir - I've just removed the image you put on the japan-geo-stub template. Images have been removed from many of the larger stub categories to help with server problems. There was already a perfectly good image for this category, which was removed in line with this policy - and then you put a new, different image back there. Please do not use an image on this or other templates which have had images removed until the "all-clear" has been given to use images - see [<a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image_server_overload_2005-03)" class="external autonumber" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image_server_overload_2005-03)" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] for more information. (In any case, the images used on stub categories are usually decided after some debate at <a href="../../../w/s/s/WP%7EWSS_7aa0.html" title="WP:WSS">WP:WSS</a> - a map of Japan was not used because there is disputed territory involved in the country, so to use a specific map might cause concern). <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>|<sup><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">hello?</a></sup> <a href="../../../g/r/u/Image%7EGrutness.jpg_adb1.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/c/c8/Grutness.jpg/25px-Grutness.jpg" alt="" width="25" height="10" longdesc="../../../g/r/u/Image%7EGrutness.jpg_adb1.html" /></a> 05:52, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, A2Kafir,</p>
<p>I noticed you undid my recent changes to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Krauthammer_0f21.html" title="Charles Krauthammer">Charles Krauthammer</a>, my notes on his being Jewish and a neoconservative. While I can understand how someone could perceive such changes as biased against either of those groups, I believe my edit was not "irrelevant" and clarifies some possible misconceptions that an uninformed reader could develop without my addition. Krauthammer is (correctly) noted in the article as a staunch supporter of the state of Israel, as well as the policies of George W. Bush. However, the there was no mention of his religion and the only mention of his broad political views was that he worked campaigns for Jimmy Carter and wrote speeches for Mondale. You may think, and not without reason, that an intelligent reader could reasonably assume the neoconservative conversion of Krauthammer, and I would not disagree with that. I would contend, however, that it is certainly worth noting in an encyclopedic article. Less prominent figures than he, such as <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Kagan_916d.html" title="Donald Kagan">Donald Kagan</a>, have such changes mentioned.</p>
<p>I would not be adverse to the idea of keeping mention of his being Jewish out of the article. Again, his last name implies a Jewish (or at least German) heritage to the intelligent reader. I would, however, be quick to point out that many other prominent Jewish people have such mentioned in their articles. It may not be directly relevant for them either, but it is a precedent which is followed, and I have not previously seen fuss of it. Of course, there may well be relevance in the fact that he is Jewish, given his staunch support of the Israeli state.</p>
<p>My edits were made to make sure no one perceived Krauthammer as a "Democrat" who has simply been largely supportive of George W. Bush, à la <a href="../../../z/e/l/Zell_Miller_62ab.html" title="Zell Miller">Zell Miller</a>. I hope that we can reach a reasonable compromise on this issue, and I am sure that we will be able to.

<p>With almost a month without any response from you, A2, I have decided to place my comment back into the article, based on what I believe is a precedent from the <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Colmes_8f4d.html" title="Alan Colmes">Alan Colmes</a> article, where the mention of his religion is far less relevant than in Krauthammer's. If you still oppose this, I am still happy to discuss it here. Additionally, I have mentioned the fact that he is Jewish in a very logical and practical place - the section "Defending Israel". And the last time I checked, <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoconservative.html" title="Neoconservative">neoconservative</a> was a political description rather than a pejorative, so I don't think there should be any problem with me describing him as such. --<a href="../../../b/d/d/User%7EBDD_7cba.html" title="User:BDD">BDD</a> 19:35, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello A2Kafir, can we get into communication regarding that article please? It is: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehabilitation_Project_Force" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehabilitation_Project_Force" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. The reason I am attempting to talk with you here is because you don't discuss it on the appropriate discussion page of the article. The article hardly has a citeable datum in it. All three links point to pages created by third persons, they are all opinions of persons outside of the organization which created, maintains and runs the RPF. Since even a rock must first be defined for what it is before controversy about said rock can be understood, I maintain that no context has been developed in that article which would then allow those cited links to make sense within. <a href="../../../i/n/t/Wikipedia%7EIntroductions_1512.html" title="Wikipedia:Introductions">Wikipedia:Introductions</a> states: Term, Topic, Context and then prepare the reader for what will follow. The term is almost defined there, but the topic is not. The RPF is not a punishment camp. It might take reading 1000 pages of the Church of Scientology dogma to clearly see how the RPF is a rehabilitation and not a punishment, but it is exactly what it says, A rehabilitation project. The CoS people mostly deal with ideas, with people, and with paper. They work long hours and it is a trying vocation. The RPF, counterwise, works with brooms, hoses, makes repairs, hammers nails and so on. One complements the other you see? And working with the hammers and brooms in the way they do, in those conditions, rehabilitates a Sea Org member so they may once again take up the more difficult mantle of paper and people. In any event, no matter what your understanding, the article needs to be accurate. It is not at this time accurate. I've no arguement with the linked informational sources, but with the accuracy of the article.

<p>You may be interested to read the theory found at User:Hillman/Dig/Kohs that purports you're my sockpuppet. Kind of funny, being that we seem to share ONE article edit (Jacobson Stores).

<dd>Hi, A2Kafir, fear not, if I had seriously suspected you of anything untoward, I would have eventually asked you here. In any case, I am disposed to believe you when you say that you and Kohs do not know each other, so you need have no worries on that score.</dd>

<dd>Unfortunately I neglected to add a standard user subpage header (just corrected) in which I ask others not to edit these notes directly but to express concerns on my user talk page. I have incorporated the information you provided. Please note that several of my pages of notes point out that X is <i>not</i> suspected of socking for Y. This is obviously valuable information for third parties.</dd>

<p>I've reverted your edits for readability and simplicity. Overstating the obvious - they were murdered - confuses the reader. HOW they were murdered makes it clearer. "Murdered by explosion" kind of rubs me, an English teacher, the wrong way.</p>

<dd>No, it's just an artifact of being tired and doing it semi-randomly. I just started on the first page of money-stubs and picked out obvious ones.
