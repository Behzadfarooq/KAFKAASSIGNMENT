	    <p>A pleasent page to read, Ayespy, and cheering&#160;:) I'm not sure how appriate it is to post here, but I find I can edit it and am doing so. I was taking courses and doing volenteer work at LA Org during the early 70s and did the purification rundown and an L/R at A.S.H.O. day. I've since moved to northern California and return to the LA complex when I can. I have registered an email address with wikipedia but I do not see an email from you and haven't used that feature. Nor do I know how to use that feature, perhaps you might enlighten me. I've many of the tech and admin materials though I lack some of the recently published lecture sets. I would hope to present the subjects I know about in a friendly readable manner, easy to understand and documented for people wishing to go farther. And additionally with controversy likewise accurate and documented. I'm confident that much of the controvesy in Scientology articles becomes rather nil when accurately stated and taken in context. One of my favorite things to do is appropriately capitalizing an article because it then presents significance in an appropriate manner. Have a good one, its too wet here Terryeo 06:25, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The left column has an "email this user" link. I tried it last nite to send and email to myself and it worked. I think you have to enable "allow email from other users" in your "my preferences" (top of page.) I was mistaken that you were who I thought you might be. I'm OT V, 12 years staff, minister, auditor trained, fully hatted 7 posts, etc. Did spend a half-day doing a 3P Inv in the Letter Reg unit of the LAO in 1975 as part of my Ethis&amp;Justice training if I recall, but that was 30 yr ago, now. Seems I would have bumped into you only in passing if at all. I grew up in NoCal (Placerville) thru 1967. Went to Elem school there &amp; part of Freshman year. Got into Scn in '68. My folks had been at it since '50. Sorry you're wet. We're too dry. Ayespy 16:35, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for enlightening me about how to E-mail. I checked my preferences and do/was accepting email. The feature should work but doesn't and I don't have your sent email yet this morning. I'm just smiling to be in communicating with you and that's an impressive set of credentials. But I've no idea what a 3P inventory would be. I haven't served on staff though my wife did for a few years. I grew up in Eureka, was in 'nam in '68 and have mostly worked electronics in one way or another. I got into Scientology in 1979, tracing a line, and was in the L.A. complex about 1980 to 1983 and then moved back to the Eureka area. By then I was married to a like minded woman, we bought some raw land and put a home on it. A fun adventure. I didn't know Ron personally but only by exchange of letters with his public comm line. Have a good one. Terryeo 18:50, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, I don't know that my "credentials" are all that impressive. I guess I do have more experience in the subject than the average bear, though. I must confess - I continue to be amazed at people who somehow know more about the subject than I, with 1/10th the experience or less, 1/100 the exposure to the written and spoken materials, and zero successful use of the materials in life. It's kind of like biological psychiatrists being "experts" on the mind, isn't it? I guess to be expert at something, you have to keep a safe distance. (I must remember this. My son-in-law is a pro quarterback. I have to remember to tell him that if he wishes to become expert at it, he should watch games rather than play in them. Note to self...)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As to "3P Inv," that would be a "Third Party Investigation" (see third party law in Introduction to Scientology Ethics) that is, resolving a conflict by finding the active but unnoticed party who is keeping both sided of the fight riled up. I know what you mean about the adventure of putting an abode on a plot of dirt. I took part in my first cabin-building exercise when I was 12, Built my own on vacant mountain land land 20 years after that, and in between worked 6 years on construction. Most recently, I added 1000 Sq feet to this place with these (tiring) hands. Took me 1.25 years but it's the nicest part of the house now. I don't recover from exertion and muscle/ligament trauma like I did when I was young.Ayespy 06:01, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
