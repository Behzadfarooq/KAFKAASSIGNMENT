	    <p>b) Although it may appear to the contrary, we do know that people have a life beyond what they do to get into college. Tell us about an experience you’ve had outside of your formal classroom and extracurricular activities that was just plain fun.</p>
<p>When most seventeen year olds decide that they want to have fun, they usually go to a movie, play shurig, or attend a party that will undoubtedly be broken up by the cops. However, I’d like to think that my friends and I reinvented the definition of “fun” on the evening of July 29th, 2006.</p>
<p>This defining moment in history began as any other summer night. We were all out to eat at a local Italian restaurant, affectionately called Nappy’s, and I was the only one eating, as is usually the case. My good friend William was particularly whiny this night, as he didn’t appreciate being the only male out to eat with two females. William’s cell phone rang about halfway through dinner, and being the gentleman that he is, he answered mid-conversation. He proceeded to accept an invitation from a fellow classmate to attend a large game of Capture the Flag later that night.</p>
<p>In order for the rest of this story to make sense, there are three very important facts that need to be taken into consideration. One: My other friend, Lindsay, and I had not been invited to this event. Two: The game was to take place at 8:30 that night, on the field of an elementary school’s playground (which was blatant trespassing, but this was a minor offense for many of the people participating.) Three: Capture the Flag requires that its participants wear all black, so as to blend in with the dark surroundings.</p>
<p>After Lindsay and I convinced William that him ditching us for them would undoubtedly be the worst decision of his life, the three of us devised The Plan (I capitalize these words in an attempt to do The Plan justice. I fear it may not be enough. Bolding, italicizing, underlining and placing it on a billboard would do it no justice either, so for now, capitalization will suffice.) For some reason that is still unbeknownst to us all, we thought it would be an excellent idea for Lindsay to wear all white and run through the field of people playing Capture the Flag, squawking like a crow. Our logic behind The Plan was that it would be funny, seeing as Lindsay was not invited and wearing white is taboo in a game of Capture the Flag. And crows make funny noises. Thus, The Plan was born.</p>
<p>Excited by our sheer brilliance, and acknowledging the fact that we were probably the funniest people to ever grace the planet, we hopped into our separate cars (conserving energy seemed irrelevant at the time) and drove to the park across the street from the elementary school. As we drove past the school, we noticed that while there were many cars in the parking lot, there were no humans to be found on the field. After ruling out the possibility of a mass alien abduction of the participants, we concluded that Capture the Flag was taking place within the (outside) hallways of the school, and no longer on the field.</p>
<p>For a hot minute (or in laymen’s terms, for a moment,) we feared that The Plan had unknowingly been thwarted. However, with a combined IQ of about 360, we quickly devised The New Plan. The New Plan consisted of us sneaking into the game, stealing one of the flags, and thus invalidating the entire point of the game, as a game of Capture the Flag cannot be played without one of the flags.</p>
<p>Convinced that The New Plan was even greater than The Plan, we managed to compose our genius selves and get into stealth mode. We crossed the street and found ourselves in enemy territory – the elementary school, the site of Capture the Flag, and ultimately, the grounds that would house the most absurd sequence of events known to my seventeen year old mind. We walked (but with the skill and slyness that is usually accompanied by James Bond music) to the backside of the building, ready for our plan to be put into action, and found ourselves staring directly into the headlights of a van exiting the parking lot. Fearing that our cover would be blown, the three of us hid behind a pole, knowing that within seconds, the van would be gone and our plan would go on. Five minutes later, the van had yet to move. Right as William was about to say “Fook it,” a line coined from Sacha Baron Cohen, perhaps the least quoted comedian of my time, the van moved and the way was clear.</p>
<p>We entered the school through an opened fence and heard the voice of the most obnoxious person known to mankind. This creature, who will be referred to only as Eric, stands at five feet tall and is infamous in Gainesville, Florida for being perhaps the most intolerable, loud, annoying and unpleasant person ever. This description may be unnecessary, but the point is, we knew we were in the right place, and that there was no turning back.</p>
<p>Crouching behind a vent by the bushes, the three of us huddled together and decided what our next move would be (The New Plan was not very detailed.) As we were ducked in our excellent hiding place, two young males, aged about seventeen, passed by our huddle and looked at us questioningly. I felt my muscles tense in fear that we had been ousted, and while I can’t say the same for William and Lindsay, I’m sure they knew the sensation. Ever the quick thinker, William put a finger to his lips, said “Sh! Just go!” and shooed them away with his hand. The two boys nodded, as if they knew exactly what was going on and continued on their way. The absurdity of this incident (aside from the fact that they tried to pretend they knew The New Plan) lies in the fact that had we really been playing Capture the Flag, they would have either a) asked us why we were hiding if we were on their team or b) slapped us and taken us away to “jail,” as is customary in Capture the Flag when encountering the other team. Instead, the two boys continued on, as if two girls and one boy huddling next to a vent was a common episode.</p>
<p>After that close brush with death, we decided it would be best for William to make an appearance (as he was the only one of us three actually invited,) and to convince one of the teams that he should guard the flag, alone. He stepped out from our hiding place and walked into plan sight of all the participants, as everyone happily shouted “William’s here!”</p>
<p>William announced to the closest team that it was probably in everyone’s best interest that he guard the flag, and him only, despite the fact that there were already two people guarding said flag. Since people usually do what William says, the two former guards immediately dispersed from their station. The New Plan was about to be the most successful plan known to all the universe, as William stepped closer and closer to the flag, prepared to grab it and run, when Eric, Supreme Obnoxious Being, pitched one of his infamous fits. “WILLIAM. YOU’RE TOO CLOSE TO THE FLAG. YOU’RE NOT ALLOWED TO BE WITHIN FIVE FEET OF THE FLAG IF YOU’RE THE GUARD. THAT’S NOT FAIR. YOU’RE CHEATING.” As most people either try to ignore Eric whenever he’s in the vicinity or get rid of him, William tagged him, which would undoubtedly send him to jail. However, Eric ignored the punch to his back, grabbed the flag and began to run towards his team, on the opposite side of the school. Despite many witnesses claiming that Eric had indeed been tagged and should technically be in jail, Eric declared that he was not, and since Eric is always right, he continued on his way.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Lindsay and I had found refuge in an unusually bright, plastic structure that slightly resembled a slide. People ran around us, slowing and pausing when they saw us, usually with a look of confusion. The fact that we were not invited and were randomly hiding in a slide probably contributed to their puzzlement, but we said nothing and continued life in our poor hiding spot.</p>
<p>William finally decided that his standing next to the space where the flag used to reside would be of absolutely no use. He found Lindsay and me in our pathetic excuse for a hiding spot, and told us to follow him. Following suit (because, remember, everyone does what William says,) we scrambled out of the slide and trailed behind him, receiving quizzical glances from all the real participants of the game.</p>
<p>As we began to traverse through the hallways, a young man by the name of Abimbola ran past us, flag in hand and several determined capturers in tow. William took advantage of this situation and chased after Abimbola, eventually pushing him into the bushes, sending everyone at the scene into flight. As everyone dispersed, the three of us breathed a sigh of relief. A crisis had been averted (what this crisis was is unknown to us, but at the time, it felt like we had successfully escaped from what could have potentially been a horrible, The New Plan-ruining situation.)</p>
<p>We continued our trek through the school, determined to make it to the other side, in an attempt to steal the other team’s flag. We were about to reach our destination, when we ran into a relatively calm and easy going girl, Renata.</p>
<p>“Whose team are you on?” she asked us, ever wary, in case we were the enemy. “Yours,” William responded, in his ever quick manner.</p>
<p>“How do I know you’re not lying?” Renata responded, ready with a slapping hand in case our response wasn’t valid.</p>
<p>“Nata. There is something far more important than Capture the Flag right now. Something greater is happening tonight. Don’t ask, you will soon find out.” And since everyone listens to what William says, Renata didn’t ask and let us continue our voyage to the other side.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for us, Renata was not the only obstacle we would have to face on our journey. Seconds after our encounter with Renata, we ran into the one and only Eric, who, like always, had something to say and had to say it loud and obnoxiously. As Lindsay and I tried to hide behind a wall the moment we heard this nasally voice, William took control of the situation.</p>
<p>“WILLIAM ISN’T ON OUR TEAM. HE’S CHEATING. HE WAS ON THE OTHER TEAM’S GUARD AND HE WAS TOO CLOSE TO THE FLAG. HE SHOULD BE IN JAIL,” Eric whined. He found Lindsay and I in our hiding spot, slapped us, and yelled “NOW GO TO JAIL.”</p>
<p>William averted the jail time by ignoring Eric, and telling me and Lindsay to follow him.</p>
