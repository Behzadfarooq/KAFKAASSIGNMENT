<p>The preceding novel, <i>She</i>, ended with the escape of Leo Vincey and his companion, Horace Holly, from the interior of Africa after witnessing the death of Ayesha. Ayesha, a beautiful and apparently <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immortality.html" title="Immortality">immortal</a> woman born centuries ago in <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Egypt_c49a.html" title="Ancient Egypt">ancient Egypt</a>, had waited thousands of years for the reincarnation of her lover Kallikrates, whom she believed she had found in the form of Leo. Attempting to persuade him to step into the strange volcanic flame that had granted her immortality, so that he too would live forever, she stepped into it herself; but the second time undid all the years that had been suspended for her and she grew old in an instant and died.</p>
<p><i>Ayesha: the Return of She</i> is set sixteen years later. Horace and Leo are in <a href="../../../t/i/b/Tibet.html" title="Tibet">Tibet</a>, having spent the intervening years traveling the world attempting to find Ayesha, whom Leo believes is still alive in some form. After many adventures including avalanche, glaciers and cliffs, they arrive in the isolated city of Kaloon. Here the ancient roles begin to play out again with the Khania of Kaloon, Atene, cast as Amenartas, while Holly is revealed to be the reincarnation of an ancient sage named Noot. They hear of a mysterious priestess and her retinue who inhabit the nearby mountain; Leo suspects this to be Ayesha though she is referred to as Hes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Atene, the queen of Kaloon, falls in love with Leo. Her insane husband looses the death hounds on their trail and they flee to the nearby mountain where they eventually find themselves in the presence of the heavily veiled Ayesha. Atene comes in force to the mountain and challenges Ayesha to unveil so that Leo may choose between the two of them. Ayesha does so and is revealed as the wizened ancient hag that they last saw in the fires in Africa. Leo (a gentleman to his core), chooses Ayesha, kissing the crone who regains all her beauty and enchantment. Ayesha also has new powers: she can <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clairvoyance.html" title="Clairvoyance">see things happening far off</a> and can turn iron into gold (using something very like irradiation). She talks to Holly of her plans, for example a proposed relocation to Asia:</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have chosen these Chinese because thou tellest me that their numbers are uncountable, that they are brave, subtle, and patient, and though now powerless because ill-ruled and untaught, able with their multitudes to flood the little western nations. Therefore among them we will begin our reign and for some few ages be at rest while they learn wisdom from us, and thou, my Holly, makest their armies unconquerable and givest their land good government, wealth, peace, and a new religion."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Leo is none too pleased with these plans and just wants to marry Ayesha. Ayesha is afraid to be with Leo since his mortal frame could not bear the radiance of her immortality (even trying to kiss her nearly causes him to lose consciousness), so there is tension between them as she puts him off again and again. She is even less human, both men sense, than she was in the Caves of Kor. But she is at the same time wiser, more philosophical: "She spoke of her searchings after truth; of how, aching for wisdom, she had explored the religions of her day and refused them one by one." She also recounts their original story, the battle between herself and Amenartas for Kallikrates: "the struggle between us which had begun of old and afar was for centuries and generations, and that until the end should declare itself neither of us could harm the other, who both had sinned to win thee, that wast appointed by fate to be the <a href="../../../l/o/d/Lodestone.html" title="Lodestone">lodestone</a> of our souls."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Atene and her people threaten to attack the mountain. Leo and Holly take a walk outside and Atene's soldiers kidnap Leo. Holly, Ayesha and her army march on Kaloon and when they reach the defending forces, Ayesha unleashes all her powers: thunder, lightning, windstorms, torrential rain. The opposing forces are scattered like dust. Ayesha and Holly find Leo just in time to save him from being murdered by a henchman of Atene, who has poisoned herself and lies dead on the floor. In her joy at finding him alive and unharmed, Ayesha rashly promises Leo anything he desires -- crowns, cities, knowledge, immortality, power. Leo, impatient and in love, asks only for herself, that she marry him and be his.</p>
<p>Holly acts as officiant and joins them. Ayesha in her love grows, if possible, even more beautiful and Leo seems to share some of her ethereal radiance; they embrace, at last they kiss, they have a few moments of bliss, and then all Ayesha's fears come true and Leo falls to the floor dead. Ayesha is initially distraught but comes to terms with his death, believing that "with him I have re-wed my wandering soul divorced by sin from me, and that of our marriage kiss which burned his life away there shall still be born to us children of Forgiveness and eternal Grace and all things that are pure and fair."</p>
<p>Ayesha takes Leo's body to the mountain where after a brief ceremony a winged flame descends on her and she vanishes. Holly returns to his native <a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumberland.html" title="Cumberland">Cumberland</a> and ponders what it all might mean, until at last one night he too disappears.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"She never dies. She changes, that is all. As the wind blows now hence, now hither, so she comes and goes, and who can tell at what spot upon the earth, or beyond it, for a while that wind lies sleeping? But at sunset or at dawn, at noon or at midnight, it will begin to blow again, and then woe to those who stand across its path."</dd>

<p>Haggard wove in themes of <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reincarnation.html" title="Reincarnation">reincarnation</a>, and various ancient goddess cults such as that of <a href="../../../i/s/i/Isis.html" title="Isis">Isis</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astarte.html" title="Astarte">Astarte</a>. Ayesha's repeated attempts to challenge Death and outwit Fate require <a href="../../../a/t/o/Atonement.html" title="Atonement">atonement</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penance.html" title="Penance">penance</a>, in the form of repeated failures to achieve her worldly goals. Ultimately, however, she achieves a form of <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redemption_%28religious%29.html" title="Redemption (religious)">redemption</a>; when Leo dies, she acknowledges that all her plots for power and wealth would have been repellent to him, and that together they may yet be forgiven in some eternal place of grace.</p>
<p><a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_sexuality.html" title="Human sexuality">Human sexuality</a>, particularly <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_female_sexuality.html" title="Human female sexuality">human female sexuality</a> underlies much of the book: the divine lust that every man feels upon beholding Ayesha, the more human love that Leo feels for her, the frustration of the two main characters denied sexual fulfillment. Perhaps due to his Victorian background, Haggard seems to equate female sexuality with danger.</p>
<p>The book of course also has the time-honored plot of the <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love_triangle.html" title="Love triangle">love triangle</a>, seen in tales from ancient Egypt to Arthurian legend to modern romantic comedies.</p>
<p>Ayesha can be seen as a variant of the <a href="../../../w/a/n/Wandering_Jew_82fb.html" title="Wandering Jew">Wandering Jew</a>, who must walk the earth without rest, pondering his wickedness. Haggard also admitted at one time that Ayesha was an attempt to personify nature as a living dynamic whole, an early forerunner perhaps of <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Lovelock_d6ef.html" title="James Lovelock">James Lovelock</a> and his <a href="../../../g/a/i/Gaia_Hypothesis_0a9b.html" title="Gaia Hypothesis">Gaia Hypothesis</a>.</p>

<p>A number of other books carry out the theme of the beautiful immortal queen. To mention only a few, there are <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edgar_Rice_Burroughs_5e8a.html" title="Edgar Rice Burroughs">Edgar Rice Burroughs</a>' <i>The Return of Tarzan</i> which introduced La, High Priestess of the lost city of Opar; <a href="../../../s/a/x/Sax_Rohmer_78c0.html" title="Sax Rohmer">Sax Rohmer</a>'s <i>She Who Sleeps</i> and <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Hilton_9fcd.html" title="James Hilton">James Hilton</a>'s <i><a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_Horizon_%28novel%29_1ab4.html" title="Lost Horizon (novel)">Lost Horizon</a></i>; and <a href="../../../a/2E/_/A._Merritt_742a.html" title="A.

<p>In <i>Ayesha, My Queendom Come</i> by John Brinckman, Nature is personifed as a deity named Ayesha. Stanford Cobb wrote <i>Ayesha of the Bosphorus: A romance of Constantinople</i> and Peter Tremayne wrote <i>The Vengeance of She: Ayesha</i>.</p>
