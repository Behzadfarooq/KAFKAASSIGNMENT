<p>I recently viewed a German-language documentary in which video of al-Zawahiri in Egypt during the 1980's was shown. He was shouting at the camera (in English) "Do not underestimate us!

<p>I gave my arguments already above which you simply ignored. What now is written in the article about imprisonment in Iran is nonsense. It is more likely he stays with bin Laden because of the video from September 2003. I suggest Waziristan because it is mentioned in the article about bin Laden and also in a television interview with president Musharraf from Pakistan when he visited the Netherlands last year. <a href="../../../o/t/e/User%7EOterhaar_22d1.html" title="User:Oterhaar">Otto ter Haar</a> 09:48, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Unfortunately, it's all about whether the collateral damage is worth killing the target. If this was a mid-level Al Qaeda figure, the strike might not have occurred, but since they believed the no.2 was there, they felt they had to take the chance. If Ayman Al-Zawahiri was killed, that would have been a huge blow to the terrorist group and saved countless lives in the future. As for troops going there and arresting him? That's completely unfeasible. US troops have no jurisdiction in Pakistan and it would be illegal for them to enter that area. Pakistani troops could have gone to the area, but they lack the intel and technology (and to be perfectly blunt, the training, organizational skills and the competence) we have, and by the time they mobilized around the village hours would have passed and Al-Zawahiri would have been gone anyway. This strike looks like the result of bad intel anyway, and it's a shame eighteen people died in vain.</dd>

In addition the article states "Incidentally, unidentified Pakistani officials have been quoted in news reports as saying that up to 11 extremists are believed to be among the dead." With that being said, I think it's premature to say that all of the people killed in the attack were innocent.</dd>

<dd>The WP article doesn't say that all the people killed in the CIA attack were innocent children and civilian villagers (although many were). Pakistan condemned the US attack and loss of innocent life. That's what the WP article says and it is accurate. --68.217.111.17 18:57, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see at the bottom about the recent bombing. If I am not mistaken "Maybe Pakistan will think twice before willingly harbouring terrorists" is not informational, but a spiteful message.</p>

<p>How do we actually know he's the #2. He's always been the spokesperson. Osama was the posterboy, but I think al-Zawahiri = al Qaida #1 operations officer. (In my opinion)</p>
<dl>
<dd>And that's exactly what's wrong with your rationale: It's your opinion. You have no evidence to support your theory that Al-Zawahiri is number 1, so I doubt that's going to appear on his Wikipedia page anytime soon. Al-Zawahiri is more out in the open than OBL, because it's important to the organization that OBL isn't killed (as videos may give away his location).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While you might think that he's #1 in Al Qaida, there's no denying that he's a piece of #2.</dd>
<dd>Would being #2 put him on par with <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dick_Cheney_58d2.html" title="Dick Cheney">Dick Cheney</a>?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>First off, to assert that either is true or not is arguing from ignorance. Neither of you actually know. It is reported in the media that OBL is the leader, but if Al-Queda is a secretive terrorist organization, no outsider can claim knowledge of its inner workings. Unfortunately, the only rational assertion is that we do not know whos in charge, but OBL is the <i>apparent</i> leader. Iconoplast 22:24, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the NY times today, US officials reported that it isn't known whether Al-Zawahiri is dead or alive. There has been none of the usual chatter following an attack like this. When Al Qaeda leaders have escaped strikes in the past it's usually followed by a proclamation by the group pointing to the operation's failure, but there has been no such statement this time. US officials also mantain that foreigners were killed in the attack, meaning that at least some Al Qaeda members might have been present at the time of the strike. I have edited a line into Ayman's entry pointing to the ambiguity of his fate, since it isn't confirmed that he's alive (or dead) at this stage.</p>

<p>AP is reporting that the provincial government has confirmed that militants were killed in the strike. This takes away Pakistan's defence that only civilians were killed. Have edited a couple lines to reflect these changes.</p>

<p>This is mainly directed at the poster who keeps on inserting this line into the article about the strike last week on al-Zawahiri. While some Pakistani officials said this was the make-up of the victims, this claim was also accompanied by a since disproven claim that all the victims were civilians and that no al-Qaeda members were present. This means that information is suspect at best and downright wrong as worst, so it has no place in the entry until it's actually CONFIRMED that there was eight men, five children and five women. Since most of the bodies were carried away and buried before authorities could move in that will probably never be proven.</p>
