<h2><span class="mw-headline">Use of Template:Infobox Hospital</span></h2>
<p>I see you have expanded the range of countries that <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_Hospital_46e7.html" title="Template:Infobox Hospital">Template:Infobox Hospital</a> recognises - thank you. I am currently proposing an upgrade to the template to make it less US-centruc and more applicable to use for hospitals in other countries (see <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template_talk%7EInfobox_Hospital_722d.html" title="Template talk:Infobox Hospital">Template talk:Infobox Hospital</a>). If any of my suggested new parameters could be better named, please let me know.</p>
<p>In particular 'Certification' is used on the US Hospitals to describe the level of Trauma &amp; Emergency care provision. The term is meaningless here in the UK, instead we would just indicate Yes/No as to whether the hospital has an Accident &amp; Emergency (Emergency Department). So I am curious, in for example <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Aga_Khan_Hospital_for_Women%2C_Karimabad_8611.html" title="The Aga Khan Hospital for Women, Karimabad">The Aga Khan Hospital for Women, Karimabad</a> what does "ISO 9001: 2000" mean under Classification - is this to do with emergency/trauma provision or a quality standard to the hospital as a whole? The upgraded Template will be replacinmg "Classification" for something along the lines of "Emerg.Dept." (see worked examples of teh upgrade in my subpage <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_Templates_Test1_3bcb.html" title="User talk:Davidruben/Templates/Test1">User talk:Davidruben/Templates/Test1</a>). So I need to know if we need to provide some additional "Quality Standard" parameter for the articles you have recently created...

<dd>Hi David. Thanks for your messages. I am new to wikipedia talk, so I hope that I'm replying correctly. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to post my reply on my talk page or yours, but it seems to make sense to post here since your comments are written above.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The ISO 9001:2000 certification is a quality management standard established by the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Organization_for_Standardization_b57e.html" title="International Organization for Standardization">International Organization for Standardization</a> (You can learn more about it at the <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/en/iso9000-14000/understand/selection_use/selection_use.html" class="external text" title="http://www.iso.org/iso/en/iso9000-14000/understand/selection_use/selection_use.html" rel="nofollow">ISO website</a>.) It would apply to the hospital as a whole. For a hospital in the developing world it is an important certification of quality, particularly given the general absence of credible quality standards or bodies in developing countries.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure what the best way is to fit the certification into the new version of your template, but I agree that it would be important to differentiate between country specific certifications and international ones. Also, perhaps the term <i>certification</i> is too general for the US trauma level?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Hope this helps. <a href="../../../a/y/l/User%7EAylahs_cb4e.html" title="User:Aylahs">Aylahs</a> 00:00, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks - Most wikipedians probably would reply on the other editors talk page, but keeping a thread together is probably more sensible (I have as a default that any page I edit is added to <i>my watchlist</i>, but leaving the brief note on my talk page is more assured of getting my attention).</dd>
<dd>Here is therefore a good place to have replied. I will though copy this over to <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template_talk%7EInfobox_Hospital_722d.html" title="Template talk:Infobox Hospital">Template_talk:Infobox_Hospital</a> (it will put a wider perspective on the use of this template from just UK vs US discussions).</dd>
<dd>I agree poor choice of term for US hospital trauma/emergency provision, although their hospitals are externally assessed for this provision and a certification awarded to the hospital. However too many US hospitals currently use this parameter in this fashion and so I will need to leave the item as a depreciated alternative to "Emergency" (or "Emerg.Dept."). What we need then is a new parameter of "QualityStandard" (can you think of a better name) that would take any such ISO certification of the hospital as a whole.<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 00:27, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Upgrade to Template:Infobox Hospital</span></h3>
<p>You managed to use <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_Hospital_46e7.html" title="Template:Infobox Hospital">Template:Infobox Hospital</a> before I upgraded it&#160;:-) As per our discussion, the 'Certification' parameter is now to be depreciated; it was intended to be used purely for assessing the trauma care provision for US hospitals - yes, the template was very US-centric. So instead I have moved the ISO standard to the better named (i.e. less likely for any Americans to misconstrue) Standards parameter. The various hospital websites were being included 3 times (in the template, linking of the first use of the hospital's name and in external links), I've reduced this just to inclusion in the Infobox, as per wikistyle with other hospitals &amp; articles generally. I liked though the way you used the break-html code to get the name parameter to look good - well done. I've tried to enter details for the other new parameters, I would be grateful if you could check these&#160;:-) Yours <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 03:11, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Perhaps an article on the Aga Khan Hospitalsn where all this info is merged, would be a good solution? I don't think every hospital needs an article, but I would not oppose one article about all the hospitals in the group, which would eliminate most redundant info. Every hospital can be described in one or two sentences (year, number of beds, specialty, location). <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 15:07, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your reply. I did not mean to imply that these institutions are in any way bad, just that they are, per Wiipedia policies and guidelines, not noted enough (i.e. discussed extensively in reputable third-party sources, per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>) to deserve their own article. I am equally opposed against hospitals, schools, ... in the Western world, I just noticed these during new page patrol, that's why I focused on them. I have not checked how many similar articles you have made (I have noticed since at least a third one), and I don't think it is any use to have a number of very similar articles on closely related, similar subjects when one bigger, thoroughly sourced article would give all the information in one page and give a better impression of not only the individual hospitals but of the grouping ofganization (Aga Khan Hospitals, I believe it was called?) as well. Per <a href="../../../m/e/r/WP%7EMERGE_94d1.html" title="WP:MERGE">WP:MERGE</a>, when two or more pages on related subjects have a large overlap, this is a good reason to merge them. I know I first proposed deletion, but for the momenbt I would prefer a merge as the best solution. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 15:36, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Allright, I'll remove the prod notices. I do hope that the articles will indeed grow to show that they deserve their own articles, and in the meantime I'll spend my energy on myspace bands, commercial spam, and other articles that definitely deserve more to be deleted than these, if perhaps not notable then at least noble and necessary hospitals. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 15:52, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Aga Khan hospitals - naming</span></h2>
<p>Whilst editing the various articles, it occured to me that they mostly started with the definite article "The". I wonder if this is in line with article naming conventions in wikipedia. See <a href="../../../n/a/m/WP%7EName_3aa5.html#Avoid_the_definite_article_.28.22the.22.29_and_the_indefinite_article_.28.22a.22.2F.22an.22.29_at_the_beginning_of_the_page_name" title="WP:Name">WP:Name#Avoid the definite article ("the") and the indefinite article ("a"/"an") at the beginning of the page name</a> which points to a fuller discussion at <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28definite_and_indefinite_articles_at_beginning_of_name%29_2c0c.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (definite and indefinite articles at beginning of name)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (definite and indefinite articles at beginning of name)</a>. Given that it suggests <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_House_2f44.html" title="White House">White House</a> rather than <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_White_House_e592.html" title="The White House">The White House</a> I suspect the articles need to be renamed - see <a href="http://www.agakhanhospitals.org/mombasa/" class="external free" title="http://www.agakhanhospitals.org/mombasa/" rel="nofollow">http://www.agakhanhospitals.org/mombasa/</a> where its description is <i>"Established in 1944, the Aga Khan Hospital, Mombasa is part of..."</i>, i.e. when not a the start of a sentance even the organisation uses a lower-case "the". If you have no objection, I can easily rename/move these for you - but any thoughts given you created these series of articles&#160;? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 03:23, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Whilst the "see also" links recently added to the various hospital articles are clearly relevent to teh subject matter, I'm not sure this is not a case of excessive wikilinks or at least of triplication. The hospital infoboxes and the article texts already link to the umbrella organisation of <a href="../../../a/g/a/Aga_Khan_Health_Services_928c.html" title="Aga Khan Health Services">Aga Khan Health Services</a> and the articles categorised as <a href="../../../a/g/a/Category%7EAga_Khan_Hospitals_ecce.html" title="Category:Aga Khan Hospitals">Category:Aga Khan Hospitals</a>. Similarly the text and the infobox link to <a href="../../../a/g/a/Aga_Khan_University_e5b5.html" title="Aga Khan University">Aga Khan University</a>. The 3rd occurance of these links in a "See also" section just seems excessive to me.</p>
<p>Wikilink of the 1st mention in the text is entirely appropriate and the infobox provides a quick summary of points and access to links. A "see also" should, by its very nature, give wikilinks to additional articles not already referred to. Whilst I considered reverting, given the care you have already taken over these articles, I'd be interested in your thoughts&#160;:-) Perhaps the list of <a href="../../../a/g/a/Aga_Khan_Hospital_6462.html" title="Aga Khan Hospital">Aga Khan Hospitals</a> could instead be incorporated into the infobox via the Wiki-Link parameter&#160;? Yours <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidruben_76a6.html" title="User:Davidruben">David Ruben</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidruben_2030.html" title="User talk:Davidruben">Talk</a></sup> 01:44, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>That is mark up of:</p>
