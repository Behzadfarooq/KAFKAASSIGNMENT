<dd>Ok, its not so much a matter of having each section cited back to her own website (although this brings up issues I note below in Copyvio section). Its more about statement like this which are not properly cited by reliable sources: "When the second room was announced that they were safe, Ayla was filled with excitment and relief."

<p>This article needs A LOT of work!! Remember that this needs to be encyclopedic, not a site "selling" Ayla Brown. To see Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Neutral Point of View</a> requirement for articles please start at <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.</p>
<p><b>Examples of NPOV in this article</b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Ayla’s debut album is packed with potential singles</i></li>
<li><i>This put her in the amazing stat of 6th place leading scorer in the US, male &amp; female!!!</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Other than NPOV, this article needs cleanup <b>badly</b>. Many grammatical mistakes, typos, redundancies, non-notable information, lack of references, and other errors need to be corrected.

<p>I am continuing to make changes. What do you see that still looks bad? User:andre1010</p>
<p><br />
This is Jim Mcgregor, Ayla Brown's producer, and manager from the record label... Everything on this site must be written in third person, as Ayla is not allowed to have anything to do with information or promotion that pertains to her Recording Career, NCAA bylaws forbid it. I've been reading through everything, and taking all of this in, as this is fairly new to us. We used several other sources on wikipedia as references,(will not name) and figured it was OK to enter in charts, successes, and what's happening currently, since that is what we saw on the other wiki sites. we will adhere to the neutral rule, and clean the information to the best of our ability. The previous information that was here, was from Ayla's official website. We wrote everything on there, and own the copyrights to everything on her site...are we not able to put this information here? and as far as putting in reviews, is that not acceptable? I saw reviews on other wiki site pages. if they are allowed we need to confirm the source, correct? if we can not put in the reviews, are we allowed to put the sources the reviews came from, as I see it, that is part of her biography, and discography, getting validation from respected sources. We do not even know who started this article, the information should never have been written in 1st person. It violates Ayla's NCAA by-laws. I tried to go through it and fix typo's that were entered in by other people not affiliated with the record label, and some from myself. i also edited the tag. I will pay close attention to all of this, as it has recently been brought to my attention.</p>
<p>I would appreciate your input on these matters....</p>
<p>thank-you</p>
<p>Jim Mcgrergor / Double Deal Records</p>
<p>so, um is it okay now? userandre1010</p>
