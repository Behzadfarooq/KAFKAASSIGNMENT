<p>As a pupil of the school I can confirm that "Big Steve" is frequently used to refer to the head. I'd appeal to people who didn't go to the school to stop trying to rewrite the article. Shall we get a vote going on here too? -3 July 2006</p>
<p>"Big Steve" is a commonly used soubriquet for the Headmaster and should be included in the entry.</p>

<dd>Seconded, as I did try to point out to the user(s) trying to get the information included in the article.

<p>Hmm. I am also a pupil at the school and have started a mini "AGS slang" section (Big Steve isn't the only moniker in use!). Is this acceptable to y'all?</p>

<p>What do you mean 'verifiable source'? As someone who has gone to the school for the last 3 years, aren't I in a position to confirm these?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>No, because for all we know you could be making it up (I'm not saying you are, just that we need to maintain certain standards). You can take a look at <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a>, but more or less, a verifiable source is a neutral, third party documented source.

<p>OK, thanks for explaining, I see what you mean. I can guarantee those nicknames personally, but I think finding an outside source for informal phrases would be a difficult thing to do.</p>
<p>Another AGS pupil here. How are we supposed to verify stuff like nicknames?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>For the most part, you don't. Nicknames, if not notable enough to be mentioned in verifiable sources, probably aren't notable enough for an encyclopedia. But if you can find a source, feel free to post it! --<a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPm_shef_cbd9.html" title="User:Pm shef">pm_shef</a> 20:46, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I sense a danger here of becoming too obsessed with the 'must be verified', 'must be encyclopedia-worthy' rules. Can't we just include "Big Steve" on the page and let people make their own minds about whether to pay attention to it: informing, not censoring or hiding, is what Wikipedia was and is deigned for and for the most part does it very well.</p>

<p>If it was to be included people could make up their own minds about whether to notice it. Wouldn't that be fairer on the people who might wish to note it?</p>
<p>Evening all. Have found that "Big Steve" is mentioned in the school's official end-of-year magazine, the Aylesburian. I trust this counts as a decent enough source, and so have added "Big Steve" into the article. Victor Greenstreet 21:44, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why don't you go and delete the whole of the Slang section in the Eton College article as that doesn't contain any references?

<li>I wasn't aware that Eton College's article also had a slang section, but be sure I'm going to it next to take a look. In terms of the above example, I think that is an appropriate way to word it... but I'm still reluctant to agree... - <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPm_shef_cbd9.html" title="User:Pm shef">pm_shef</a> 23:53, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>As am I, unless Francs2000 gets a hold of that book. You still have to verify it even if you word it like that, as it's still original research. And even then, I'd contest the fact that it was notable enough for inclusion. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBornhj_aa00.html" title="User:Bornhj"><font color="#336699">--<b>james</b></font></a> <sub><font color="green">// bornhj</font> <a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBornhj_2497.html" title="User talk:Bornhj">(talk)</a></sub> 01:21, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think the key point here is now notability. Whether or not Eton has a slang section is largely irrelevant - the two schools are not comparable when it comes to public knowledge (and therefore interest.) Arguably, Eton is a name known throughout the world, while AGS is - frankly - not. So a nickname of the current headmaster who has been there for a fraction of the time that the school has existed is not of interest. Those who comment here from anonymous IPs and alter the main article to include his name often do so from an IP registered to AGS which has been responsible for a lot of vandalism (other than adding 'Big Steve' - which has been interpreted by some as vandalism as some as simply an unverifiable reference.) Lastly I might add that the same IPs started a AGS article at Uncyclopedia which appears to have been deleted by the admin for breaking the vanity policies (it listed teachers by name, for example.) <small>The authors of that article had (without permission) uploaded a photo which they believed to be of myself in order to take 'revenge' for my reversion of their vandalism here - this is by-the-by but I thought I'd mention the immaturity of those responsible.</small> My point is that there are other places where these pupils can express themselves and record the nickname. Uncyclopedia was one of them but they broke the rules and their page was removed. I think it's time they found somewhere else to record the information they are interested in, as very few others are interested to have it here. <a href="../../../k/y/m/User%7EKymara_fb15.html" title="User:Kymara">Kymara</a> 11:58, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>As another former pupil, I can't see how the fact that the headmaster might have the nickname "Big Steve" has any relevance. Bit of a parochial fact and not the kind of thing you would want to find out in an encyclopaedia...? BTW does anyone have a picture of the school crest anywhere that could go in the box on the right?--Rbj2001 18:14, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>What about having a "Trivia" section?</p>

<dd>So anything that's not online is not verifiable. Right. That's ,most of Wikipedia's sources gone then.</dd>

<dd>You still don't seem to understand the No Original Research policy. The magazine isn't a well known source so another user wants to check it out. Even after it's been checked out, the inclusion of the nickname Big Steve in the article is highly dubious as it is unlikely to be notable or interesting - as other comments on this page have confirmed. Lastly your continued vandalism of Wikipedia pages means that you are lucky that your requests are even tolerated. Have some respect for Wikipedia and read through the pages people suggest to you and please stop vandalising.

<p>As another current pupil, I agree that "Big Steve" is a nickname that has been used from about a year onwards from his arrivial, known by many pupils within the school. And I have been there since the start of his tenure. I understand that I have no reference for this, but as previously stated it is mentioned within the school magazine. This is not avaliable via electronic copy, and can only be purchased through the school. Placing any form of the magazine online for reference would break copyright laws, and there is a line just underneath this text box that states "Content must not violate any copyright", which would be fairly stupid for me to post. I would also like to point out that a lot of you are deleting this whole thing, without a reference to prove that he is not given this nickname. Surely you must be able to find an article that states "the headmaster does not go by the nickname Big Steve", to be able to consider its removal. I think both sides should be given equal consideration, especially when evidence has been mention. I do no see why permission should be required to ring up the school an verify this- it is not illegal to do so. --172.188.207.54 01:29, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>why has this caused such an uprising. i am sure that "Big Steve" does not take offence to this nick name. i believe the only reason that it has caused such a comotion is because it may be considered slightly degrading. however, i propse a test. if we need internet varification. can somebody video suitable eveidence that this name does exist and upload it to YouTube.com? would this be considered significant verification?</p>
