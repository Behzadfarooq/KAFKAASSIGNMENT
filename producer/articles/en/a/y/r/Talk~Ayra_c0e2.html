<p>Ayra is my favorite Fire Emblem character, or ultimately my favorite Nintendo character ever. I started this article partly because of that. She caught my eye in late 2003. When I first played <i><a href="../../../s/e/i/Fire_Emblem%7E_Seisen_no_Keifu_9acc.html" title="Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu">Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu</a></i>, I viewed her as a dangerous enemy needing to be killed immediately. I later realized that it was my most terrible mistake I did in the game. Out of nowhere, she happened to overtake Marth as my favorite Nintendo character. Ayra is more than a great unit. She is also a great character. She is excellent as a unit (both promoted and unpromoted), as an emotional character, as an aunt (to Shanan), and as a woman (because she is good with men.) She is powerful even without the Yuusha Sword she receives from either Holyn or Lex. She is a combination of power, speed, skill, and beauty. Technically, she can hit up to 160 times, but that rarely occurs. <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedius_Zanarukando_3729.html" title="User:Tedius Zanarukando">Tedius Zanarukando</a> 3 May 2005 18:51 (EST).</p>

<p>For about one year, I have been campaigning to request to have Ayra to register to be a playable character in the <i><a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Smash_Bros._Brawl_101e.html" title="Super Smash Bros. Brawl">Super Smash Bros. Brawl</a></i>, eventhough she is a non-Lord. For one reason is the popularity of the <a href="../../../s/w/o/Swordmaster.html" title="Swordmaster">Swordmaster</a> class, which she started. Her story is quite intriguing enough to have her in Super Smash Bros., and other reason is partially owing to a great fanfic "Burning Behind." She is an extraordinary Swordmaster character, unlike those Nabarl clones. I have proven her to fit in well in <i>Super Smash Bros.</i> The second-generation cast of <i>Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu</i> do not fit in as well as the first-generation cast. I would love for you to support my request in this situation. Ayra would be a unique character, unlike Marth, Roy, and Link. An in-game reason to have her in <i>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</i> is last line of the Jugdral Chronology, where it says "Grandbell invades Isaac." Another reason for the idea is the use of Ryuuseiken, Ayra's trademark move, in <i>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</i>. The article also hints the reason why I recommend Ayra to appear in <i>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</i> as an unlockable playable character. As recruiting Ayra in <i>Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu</i> was worth all the effort, I find developing her as a playable character in <i>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</i> to be worth all the effort.</p>

<p>10:30, 23 February 2006 XXThunkXx m (moved Talk:Ayra (Fire Emblem) to Talk:Ira (Fire Emblem): <i>Sorry, but this is the *official* translation. "Ayra" is a fan translation made to make her sound more effeminate, and is not the one that should be used on Wikipedia.</i>)</p>
<p><br />
...XXThunkXx.</p>
<p>Consider: There is one person in the world who cares at all about whether Aira is 'feminine' or not.</p>
<p>Consider: There are far more people than one who use the spelling Ayra, regardless of how wrong it is.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>May I also direct you to <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28common_names%29_764d.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)</a>.</p>
<p>Ayra, inasmuch as it is a somewhat bad translation, <b>is</b> the name that should be used on Wikipedia according to Wikipedia policy.</p>

<p>First, the Ira/Ayra thing. As much as I don't agree with the spelling Ayra, and would vastly prefer the use of Aira which is the best of both worlds, Wikipedia Policy says to use the most common english name, which is undoubtedly Ayra. Some people seem to have missed that the last time I posted it, so I'll post it again in case they miss the one in the edit link too.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Historically, I have been using the name Ira in the message boards. <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedius_Zanarukando_3729.html" title="User:Tedius Zanarukando">Decimus Tedius Regio Zanarukando</a> 09:00, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I will also be moving this page back to Ayra (Fire Emblem) after finishing this.</p>
<p>Now, reasonings behind edits; if I don't mention something it will usually be because it was plainly irrelevant, for example, <i>(even though the name of <b>Ira</b> is an established male name, but it is sometimes a diminutive form of <b>Irina</b></i> . This is... somewhat a lot. There was also a few redundant areas (Ayra went to Verdane through Manster and Miletos. Ayra went to Verdane through Manster and Miletos. Ayra went to Verdane through Manster and Miletos...)</p>
<p>Onwards!</p>
<p><br />
<i>also the first female character to start a class that is also held by male characters.</i></p>
<p>Minerva. Dragon Knight. FE1.</p>
<p><br />
<i>A lot of Nabarl-related stuff</i></p>
<p>This is what the <a href="../../../n/a/b/Nabarl.html" title="Nabarl">Nabarl</a> article is for, not the Ayra article.</p>
<p><br />
<i>Ayra pairing stuff</i></p>
<p>This is an article about Ayra, not about vague lines on who is a good parent and who is not. Add a section devoted to Ayra and her children if you want it, but don't put it in the background information. And if you do add such a section, fill it with actual information, not <i>Some players also go for esoteric Ayra pairings like Ayra/Noish and Ayra/Levin</i>... list what skills and growth rates each pairing give, and so forth.</p>
<p><br />
<i>male gamers male gamers male gamers</i></p>
<p>No idea what the deal with this is; Ayra does not spontaneously lose what makes her good when a female/neuter takes the controls; Ayra also isn't especially good looking, so you can't have been coming from that angle either.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I personally consider Ayra good looking. <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedius_Zanarukando_3729.html" title="User:Tedius Zanarukando">Decimus Tedius Regio Zanarukando</a> 09:00, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Despite her strict exterior, she is really very nice. Therefore, behind her strict and tough exterior is a smooth, soft, and caring heart.</i></p>
<p>There is no evidence of this ingame.</p>
<p><br />
<i>She learned to be a swordfighter beside her older brother Mariccle since the age of three.</i></p>
<p>Nothing to this effect is ever said ingame; perhaps there was something along those lines in some of the manga, but there is no official manga and anything they say cannot be taken as valid. They have many things such as people surviving the Battle of Barhara when they should not have, for instance.</p>
<p><br />
<i>She can wield a sword just as well as any man.</i></p>
<p>More sexism...</p>
<p><br />
<i>In the Kingdom of Isaac, unlike other Jugdral countries, both men and women training beside each other is a common sight. Women are treated differently in the kingdom of Isaac than in other Jugdral countries.</i></p>
<p>Nothing to this effect ingame either... I asked you about something you had in the Nabarl article like this months back and you never replied, also.</p>
<p>Further, we see a grand total of 4 Isaacian women ingame- Ayra, is royalty and of course won't be treated the same. Lachesis can use a sword, does that mean every other Nodion woman learns swordfighting as well? Lakche, grew up in a war, standard conditions do not apply. Radnay, same as Lakche. Mana, is a priest. Such wonderful Isaacian swordfighting skills she has (and Mana is confirmed to be explicitly Isaacian, unlike most subs which are no-listed-country, yes).</p>
<p><br />
<i>Daughter-in-law, Son-in-law</i></p>
<p>Not only are the 'most likelies' irrelevant, but... Skasaha/Julia? Arthur is by far the most common pairing for Julia, not Skasaha. And Julia isn't commonly paired at ALL, so that says something about Skasaha's likelihood to be paired with her...</p>
<p><br />
<i>They were going to hide in Lenster, but Lenster nobility had a tie with Grandbell, more specifically the Chalphy district. (Lenster nobility also had a tie with Isaac.) If Ira and Shanan were to hide in Lenster, they would have quickly ended up in the custody of Barhara royalty.</i></p>
<p>Mananan and Lenster were on good terms with each other. I find it somewhat hard to believe that Lenster would have given Ayra and Shanan into custody... on the other hand, Lenster is likely to be one of the people most likely to listen to and believe the truth about the situation, about Rivough and all, and intervene on Isaac's behalf to Grandbell.</p>
<p>In any case, not mentioned ingame at all, so.</p>
<p><br />
<i>Chapter 1 Bio</i></p>
<p>It is not necessary to list every single little thing she does. 'Ayra said something to Kinbois. Kinbois said something to Ayra. Ayra said something to Kinbois. Shanan spoke to Ayra. Kinbois spoke to Ayra. Ayra threatened to put Kinbois' head on a stake. Ayra moved one square south. Ayra moved one square south...'</p>
<p><br />
<i>She knew Cuan before she knew Siglud.</i></p>
<p>Ayra didn't know Cuan at ALL.</p>
<pre>
<b>Cuan</b>: Hello, I'm Cuan of Lenster. Sigurd tells me that you're Princess Aira from Isaac.
<b>Ayra</b>: ...Nice to meet you.
</pre>
<p><br />
<i>Cuan's father King Lenster, who is ill due to the attached curse of the Gayborg</i></p>
<p>The Gae Bolg's curse related to Ethlin and Cuan being killed off by Trabant. Not to King Lenster. Further I don't believe there is any indication that he is sick, and even if he was, it is irrelevant.</p>
<p><br />
<i>In Chapter 2, Ira beats Holyn in the arena, and then he joins her and Sigurd's army.</i></p>
<p>... This really isn't worth saying anything about.</p>
<p><br />
<i>It is not recommended to lure Ira near Evans Castle (which is north of Genoa Castle where she stood before she starts moving)</i></p>
<p>Bah. This is as stupid as people standing Matthew in Guy's movement range. Further, Evans Castle is <b>more than half the map height north of Genoa</b>. You are not going to get her anywhere NEAR there unless you're specifically trying to. Alternatively, if you captured Genoa and then ran off, she will sack Genoa and then head north and sack Evans, but if you know to capture Genoa without killing her, then you know what to do next. Or you'd just kill her on the way.</p>
<p><br />
<i>retconning</i></p>
<p>To retcon means to introduce something 'now' and act as if it was always present in the 'past'. There are many examples at <a href="../../../r/e/t/Retcon.html" title="Retcon">Retcon</a>. People having vague, possibly imaginary similarities to people in previous games is completely unrelated.</p>
<p><br />
The Holyn section is even less suitable for Ayra pairing information than the introductory section.</p>
<p><br />
<i>Mareeta</i></p>
<p>Mareeta, 'retconned' from Lakche? You're stretching it a bit here. There are only so many character setups to go around. Some characters are meant to be similar to previous-game characters, yes, like FE6's opening of Lord-Paladin-Cavvy-Cavvy-Knight-Archer to FE1's opening of Lord-Paladin-Cavvy-Cavvy-Knight-Archer<s>-Pegasus Knight</s>, but not everything. One would have hoped that my efforts to point out the myriad errors in the archetype lists would have shown this, but apparently not (All armour knights are based on Doga! Despite Doga having pathetic defence growth and high defence growth being what most armour knights are known for! GO SCIENCE!)</p>
<p><br />
<i>and those who do so also pair up Lachesis with Fin</i></p>
<p>...WHAT THE HECK DO LACHESIS AND FIN HAVE TO DO WITH AYRA AND LEX.</p>
<p><br />
<i>Ira knew Cuan since she was young.</i></p>
<p>This is still wrong.</p>
<p><br />
<b>I think that's everything.</b></p>

<dd>Information provided in the book <i>Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu: Treasure</i> should be included in the article. So I put that back in with the rationale that <i>Treasure</i> is not third-party and that the Treasure-related information about Ayra was posted at FESS message board. Also, I put back some in-game information that Twilkitri deleted from the article. About Ayra threatening to impale Kinbois on a stick was said in-game. <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedius_Zanarukando_3729.html" title="User:Tedius Zanarukando">Decimus Tedius Regio Zanarukando</a> 02:45, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
