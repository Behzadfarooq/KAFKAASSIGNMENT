<p>i stole it from the Namie Amuro page, but i really like the layout. because you can get a lot of info without having a huge chart. what do you think? right now i put it in the HEAVEN and Bold &amp; Delicious/Pride pages, but I think i'm going to modify it a little more. I want to have a spot for 1st week sales and 1st week position, then do total sales and weeks on charts. or something lol</p>

<p>Added the articles and tracklists for every single up to Voyage, which has already been done, along with all singles after it. The articles only contain "blahblah is the ##th single released by Ayumi Hamasaki. It was released blahblah ##, ####." So, if you want to add any more information, you can. The articles don't have pictures, either, and I'm not going to upload them. Someone else can do that. Strangely enough, someone's done the SURREAL article already without doing any of the others. Also, there's actually a real article for her "vogue" single, not just a disambiguation page that doesn't even lead to an Ayu article anyway. -- Winterkill 10:15 pm, 15 December 2005 (EST)</p>

<p>Well, when I first saw her picture before plastic surgery she seemed like a completely different person at first, but you will realize that she still looks relatively similar after plastic surgery. And she was still pretty even before plastic surgery! I saw one of her pictures when she used to go to school which is like more than 10 yrs ago and she looked pretty good, although platic surgery did enhance her look. <a href="../../../i/l/o/User%7EIloveayu_aa53.html" title="User:Iloveayu">Iloveayu</a> 07:12, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ayu has <b>NOT</b> had plastic surgery!! the only stuff she probably has gotten done is her teeth, and that is dental work, not plastic surgery. Look: http://img389.imageshack.us/img389/1787/ayu21jx.jpg Ayu looks the same as she did as a little girl. The only thing different is that she matured and now wears a lot more makeup. Her eyes and face still looks the same. --Stzr3 04:55, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well actually it's never been confirmed if it has or not. Sorry i was rude earlier&#160;:-( But Ayu never said herself and neither has her company that she has ever had any work done. Though it is definetly possible, but i think it is just the makeup and how shes matured. --Stzr3 04:22, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>She obviously had dental work, and (based on her unusually round eyes - which is rare for an asian person) that she's undergone an <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_blepharoplasty.html" title="Asian blepharoplasty">asian blepharoplasty</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalicore_7f8b.html" title="User:Calicore">Calicore</a> 19:54, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree on the dental work. However, I disagree with the blepharoplasty comment. There are plenty of pictures of her youth floating around in which her eyes seem to be as round as they are now. Also, if she were to have had that kind of surgery, it would, at the very least, have been before her days as an actress under the pseudonym Kurumi Hamazaki which would make her kind of young for plastic surgery (around the age of 15/16/17). example of how she looked when she was working as an actress: <a href="http://www.ahsforum.com/forum/showpost.php?p=922901&amp;postcount=35" class="external free" title="http://www.ahsforum.com/forum/showpost.php?p=922901&amp;postcount=35" rel="nofollow">http://www.ahsforum.com/forum/showpost.php?p=922901&amp;postcount=35</a> 4nGeLuS 01:44, 30 October 2006 (GMT+1)</p>

<p>Guys. It doesn't matter how "OBVIOUS" it is unless it's been officially confirmed.

<p>Now, I suggest removing all sites with Alexa ranking over 300,000 or no data at all, unless they have been used in the article as references (in which case they should go in the <i>References</i> section). Also, I believe http://www.teamayu.com should be removed because, even though it is an official fan club, it requires Flash, something <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html#What_should_not_be_linked_to" title="Wikipedia:External links">it is not appreciated</a>.</p>

I think it's good you're removing some sites. There are way too many. But I have a question, what exactly is Alexa ranking? --Stzr3 05:33, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexa_Internet_43d9.html" title="Alexa Internet">Alexa</a> calculates a pseudo "ranking" for many sites. The more important the site (more visited, linked, etc), the highest the Alexa ranking is (1 being the highest). Wikipedia uses it as a way of determining if a web site is notable or not. Sites that are not notable (Alexa ranking over 10,000) don't usually have a Wikipedia article about them (unless they have probed themselves notables in other ways, in example, being used by notable sources as references, etc). Since external links don't work with Alexa to define if an external link is suitable or not, I must note that Wikipedia is not a web directory. Thus, the external link section should have only "enough" links, not just too many. And I would prefer to have those with a high ranking (that is, that are more likely to be visited by people than unknown ones). -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 16:47, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nobody did the cleaning, so I did it. People just add external links, sometimes with spam or to non notable sites that add nothing to the article. In the end, all fan sites except the official one were removed until someone would determine which were the best ones. Per <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">the guides</a>, a couple of fan sites are fine, but you get to listen to everyone shouting "Mine! Mine!". Unluckily, it is hard to make people understand only a couple should be included, and in the end it is easier to keep the area clean. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 01:13, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>It is not the case that Japanese law requires legal names to be written in kanji; there are a great many native Japanese with no kanji in their given names (a few in my own family). Also, gaijin becoming naturalized citizens indeed have the option of writing their name in katakana.</p>
<p>theres no need to get so serious about it sheesh.......</p>
<p>just a note- everywhere that I have seen her name (music videos, performances, tv shows, online text, oricon, magazines, commercials, and the list goes on) her name is given as&#160;: 浜崎 あゆみ, so I really don't see what the problem is... <a href="../../../y/a/j/User%7EYajimari21_fb15.html" title="User:Yajimari21">Yajimari21</a> 21:04, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's because her <b>stage name</b> is 浜崎あゆみ, her name in the industry.

<p>One more proof found in the japanese entry for this article: 本名は、濱崎歩（読みは同じ） which means&#160;: real name is 濱崎歩 (reading is the same (implied: as 浜崎あゆみ))</p>
<p>浜崎 - I think this is usually pronounced Hamazaki but she prefers it as Hamasaki. Should the pronunciation of her name should be the way she prefers it? <a href="../../../i/l/o/User%7EIloveayu_aa53.html" title="User:Iloveayu">mirageinred</a> 22:38, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello:</p>
<p>I recently read about this argument and this is what I can gather:</p>
<p>According to Ayu!love!ayu! (http://www.ayuloveayu.com/) fan site, the official profile released during the time of her debut listed her name as 浜崎歩. According to AYUMIHAMASAKIFAN (http://ayu.mints.ne.jp/profile.html) her name is 浜崎歩. According to AYU*SYSTEM (http://hp.kutikomi.net/ayusystem/?n=page1), her real name is 濱崎歩.</p>
<p>According to avex, her name is thus 浜崎歩。The reports of other names are not cited on the websites given. If someone would like to look around on Japanese fansites and gleen what information they are able, I suspect one could decide this once and for all. There is certainly possibility that she uses "浜" despite the fact that it is not the original kanji in her name. Nevertheless, the usage of "濱" is only found on her released goods in Chinese-speaking areas. So could it be a misunderstanding? I'm not certain. tsubasa Good luck to everyone: it's a bit of a mystery.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/y/u/Talk%7EAyumi_Hamasaki_ecd1.html" title="Edit section: Actually...">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Actually...</span></h3>
<p>Real information based on this: 浜崎歩 is her "legal" name, 浜崎あゆみ is her "stage" name. Since this article pertains to her as an artist and not as anything else, it should be written 浜崎あゆみ. Everything she's ever released has been under the name 浜崎あゆみ and no one knows her as 浜崎歩, so I believe it should be kept 浜崎あゆみ.

<li>AFAIK most templates have specific fields for "birth" name and the name artist/person is known in public. Even if a person changes his/her "legal" name, I do think "birth" name says the same (I know there is one exception but I don't think it is relevant with Ayumi Hamasaki). <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonni1995_fca8.html" title="User:Monni1995">Monni</a> 19:00, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, can you provide arguments on why should we break the convention? why not putting redirects in the all uppercase titles? The article text could use uppercase, but I don't see compelling arguments for changing the convention of the title. Also, for the "people wil lsearch for the upper case title", well, that's what the redirects solve. So far I haven't seen a discussion (perhaps you can point it to me) and since there's no consensus yet, I suggest not to change albums titles to uppercase (as in <a href="../../../a/r/o/AROUND_THE_WORLD_ac59.html" title="AROUND THE WORLD">AROUND THE WORLD</a> from the existing titles). -- <small>( <a href="../../../d/r/i/User%7EDrini_e6be.html" title="User:Drini"><span style="cursor:crosshair;">drini's page</span></a> <a href="../../../d/r/i/User_talk%7EDrini_c4b2.html" title="User talk:Drini"><big><span style="cursor:crosshair;">☎</span></big></a> )</small> 04:16, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Everyone responded before I could.&#160;;) I just read about Japanese beliefs about blood types and found it very interesting. I did not know asking or knowing one's blood type in Japan was common practice. As an American, I was at first alarmed to see this information in Miss Hamasaki's bio page but, I am glad I read it because I just learned something about Japan and her culture. I was going to delete my question but decided to leave it so others could learn as well.&#160;:)</dd>

<dd>Well, she chose not to accept any awards due to the scandal way back in 2004 when Max Matsuura was going to resign. Max Matsuura is pretty important to her since he helped her become a superstar she is today. So she said that she was going to move out of the record label along with him causing the Avex stocks to plummet resulting in a lot of chaos. <a href="../../../i/l/o/User%7EIloveayu_aa53.html" title="User:Iloveayu">mirageinred</a> 20:56, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I'm sorry, but I'm going to erase this "sama" thing. Sama is just a way to show respect, appliable to each and every adult Japanese, not only for a huge superstar like Hamasaki. If anyone lives in Japan and/or has a strong argument to rewrite this, please say it here and include the "Ayu-sama" in her "known as" line again.<a href="../../../g/i/h/User%7EGihad_1a25.html" title="User:Gihad">Gihad</a> 18:28, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Um, WHAT? The <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honorific.html" title="Honorific">honorific</a> <i>-sama</i> is NOT just "a way to show respect", and <i>certainly</i> not "appliable to each and every adult Japanese". Leaving aside the fact that I believe the word you're looking for is actually "applicable" in that sentence, you're wrong. Well, not completely wrong, but still wrong in a very important way - <i>-san</i> is the usual, normal level of respect to show "each and every adult Japanese". <i>-sama</i>, however, shows EXTREME respect. You do NOT call your co-workers "[name]-sama", you would use <i>-san</i>, which is the equivalent of <a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr..html" title="Mr.">Mr.</a>, <a href="../../../m/s/2E/Ms..html" title="Ms.">Ms.</a> or <a href="../../../m/r/s/Mrs..html" title="Mrs.">Mrs.</a> in English; <i>-sama</i>, in contrast, translates more (as a form of deferment more than actual dictionary definition, of course) as "Lord/Lady", the kind of thing you use to people you really REALLY respect/want to suck up to, such as the Emperor. So, they are NOT just "showing respect... [in the way you would] to each and every adult Japanese" if they use "Ayu-sama", they are literally calling her something more along the lines of "Lady Ayu", though of course, it does not directly translate as such per se (they have some more specific terms that are used for specific profressions or statures, such as <i>-hime</i> for "Princess", <i>-sempai</i> for one who has seniority, or <i>-sensei</i> for teachers and, I'm told, occasionally artists), but that is more the right context. You must not be as familiar with <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_honorifics.html" title="Japanese honorifics">Japanese honorifics</a> as you think, if you think "-sama" is used in the general, common way you describe. It's true that it has some "general" uses in Japanese culture, which tends to confuse the matter for some, but even then, it's supposed to be a sign of extreme respect - an example would be using it with a customer's name, this may seem like a general usage of simple respect, but it's really still a sign of <i>great</i> respect (the Japanese, suffice it to say, are well-known for having some of the best customer service in the world). To quote Wikipedia's own page on the matter:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Sama (様, Sama?) is the formal version of san. This honorific is <b>used primarily in addressing persons much higher in rank than oneself</b> and in commercial and business settings to address and refer to customers. It also appears in words used to address or speak of persons or objects for which the speaker <b>wishes to show respect or deference</b>, such as okyaku-sama (customer) or Tateishi-sama (a stone revered as a deity). Additionally, Japanese Christians will refer to God in prayer as Kami-sama. <b>People will also affix sama to the names of personages who have a special talent or are considered particularly attractive, though this usage can also be tongue-in-cheek, exaggerated, or even ironic. Examples include "Tanaka-sama" to refer to a young man named Tanaka who is considered rather handsome by his admirers and the "Leo-Sama" (or "Reo-sama") that has become the media's pet name for Leonardo DiCaprio.</b> Further, sama can be used to express arrogance (or self-effacing irony), such as in the arrogant male pronoun ore-sama ("my esteemed self") for "I". Referring to oneself with -sama is considered to be highly egotistical.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Bolding mine, of course. As you can see, the fact that she's called "Ayu-sama" by some is quite different from someone referring to her with the normal, everyday level of respect that you'd expect to be shown to a stranger in Japanese. I say there's no harm in letting it stay in, as it seems that that usage is common <i>when the person is considered attractive and respected and/or extremely popular and well-liked</i>, in Japanese; additionally, some of her American fans quite likely would use the -sama with her name because they interpret -sama as simply meaning "great respect/deferment" to a person. That would be a common type of thing that happens with American fans of Japanese pop culture, for instance, see <a href="../../../o/t/a/Otaku.html" title="Otaku">otaku</a> and how it's often used somewhat differently in the U.S. than it is in Japan...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>...however, that said, it would be nice if someone could point to a source that uses it first, just to be sure it's an actual nickname of hers.&#160;;) 63.21.6.27 09:17, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If I had to guess I'd say what he meant was the -sama prefix can be used with any person's name. It's not so much a nickname; rabid fanboys will do this with just about any name, and as far as grammar goes there's nothing wrong with it. 75.153.221.227 08:21, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I have contacted the site from where it was picked and the user who uploaded it to clarify its license.

<dd>Various sites say Ayu's father "walked out". Some sites say when she was three, some say five. This article says five. Fans suspect that certain songs, like Teddy bear and the Memorial address album (in a photo in the booklet, June 30 is written in lipstick in a mirror -- this is supposedly the day her father died, or walked out) were written for her father, but she's never actually confirmed it: there's no sources for all of this, just fansites. ― <a href="../../../w/h/y/User%7EWhy_sigh%2C_cutie_pie__6109.html" title="User:Why sigh, cutie pie?">Sturr ★彡</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/h/y/User_talk%7EWhy_sigh%2C_cutie_pie__0d16.html" title="User talk:Why sigh, cutie pie?">Refill</a><sup>/</sup><sup><a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricers.html" title="Ricers">lol</a> 17:31, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</sup></sup></dd>

<p>Wikipedia says trademarks don't have to be capitalized but should the titles be considered trademarks? They are the actual TITLEs of the songs colloquially and officially. Sony's logo is all in uppercase but on Wikipedia it is "Sony". This applies correctly because it is an actual trademark. Justin Timberlake's songs "SexyBack" or "FutureSex/LoveSound" has unique capitalization and it isn't spelled "Sexyback" or "Futuresex/lovesounds".

<dd>I think they should stay as the proper capitalization. It pisses me off when it's capitalized wrong. The songs are capitalized the way they are obviously for a REASON, and to change them is a little anal. If someone changes them, I DO intend to change them back, or at least put a capitalization notice at the top of the page.

<p>If I recall correctly, you aren't allowed to take photos of Ayu in concert, and if you try to, a security guard will ask you to turn off the camera (Or phone) or they will take it off you. <a href="../../../x/2/r/User%7EX2RADialbomber_95f2.html" title="User:X2RADialbomber">X2RADialbomber</a> 05:11, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>What do you think the ranking should be based on? I think it should be weekly. Personnally, I think people want it to be daily so it can seem like all Ayu's albums have ranked #1. A BEST 2 ~BLACK~ only ranked #1 on ONE day and the difference in sales on that day with A BEST 2 ~WHITE~ was very small. Any opinions? Icaazn614 23:10, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think it should be daily. i mean, technically, it DID rank number 1, did it not? (<a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImpracticable_de64.html" title="User:Impracticable">Impracticable</a> 23:34, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It was for one day and it was only by a few hundreds. Personally, I think having #1 gives a false impression that Ayu's had all #1 albums, not daily but weekly. Right now, we know the facts, but what about five years later. The fact that A BEST 2 ~BLACK~ was #1 for daily vs weekly might get fuzzier in the future. People might start thinking that daily #1 = weekly #1. Plus, most charts seem to care more about weekly ranking than daily ranking.Icaazn614 20:02, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I guess people have very different opions which one of the charts is more important, so I think it would be best to put up rankings for both. It makes it a little more crowded but pretty much ends this constant reverting. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonni1995_fca8.html" title="User:Monni1995">Monni</a> 20:56, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
