<p>I have removed the reference to Hinduism from Ayurveda. Ayurveda has nothing to do with it. It was developed under the patronge of Emperor Kanishka who was a Buddhist ruler. The comments I have added regarding the development and the death of Ayurveda are taken from the introduction of the book "Preventive and Social Medicine" by Dr Parekh. It is a standard syllabus book for those Doctors pursuing Post Graduate studies in Medicine in India.</p>

<p>I am reverting back to ayurveda's development and death. Pranathi in his/her zeal to usurp medicine and make it a part of the Hindu religion forgets that Emperor Kanishka and his doctor Charaka belonged to the Kushan dynasty. There is no relation of the Kushans with any vedic people. Please remember that the word 'Hindu' did not exist at that time. You cannot find the word 'Hindu' in any indian literature before the Mughal invasion.</p>
<p>Moreover, you cannot dispute that Ayurveda system in India died before its revival by Govt of India. One dosent have to be a student of history to understand the reasons for the Death of medicine.

<p>How does one expand the article, with new sections, pages etc?</p>
<p>The article have many lacunie and many important contents have been left and not included honestly. Misunderstanding and question of the scientificity of the AYURVED is arosed by the sincere persons are obvious. "AYURVED is a complete science" and this fact should be accepted. I am practicing Ayurved since 40 years with great success. My patients are Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikkha and others, taking regular treatment without any hesitation. The fact is that Ayurved have its own "AETIOLOGICAL" consideration, which is actually, known as TRIDOSHA,which are three in numbers. The equivalent and exact term of the TRIDOSHA is difficult to translate in English language. Tridosha are mainly three and in total combination makes seven, which is for the DIAGNOSIS and treatment purposes, according to the philosophy of Ayurved.Again Each Dosha have five kinds, which is total makes Fifteen. These Fifteen kinds makes "PHYSIOLOGICAL BASIS OF DISEASES" of Human Body. Again SAPTA DHATU is considered. Sapta Dhatu are seven in numbers. The Concept of Sapta Dhatu is considered equivalentto "PATHOLOGICAL BASIS OF DISEASES".Again Three MALAS are taken into consideration, which is considered eqvivalent to "KETABOLIC PRODUCTS". Consideration of Agni [Digestive fire], Prakrati, Oaj, Sampoorna Oaj [Vital Force or Vital Power] etc taken for help in diagnosis and treatment of the disease.Few years back, a High-technology come in existence to Quantify the Status of TRIDOSHA,TRIDOSHA-BHED,SAPTA DHATU, OAJ, AGNI etc, known "ELECTRO-TRIDOSHA-GRAM/GRAPH", Ayurvedic whole body scan and which is prooved the ultimate Ayurvedic Diagnosis solutions in evidence based medicine form with diagnosis of the disease conditions.This technology have prooved the scientificity of Ayurved. It provides Diagnosis of the existence of TRIDOSHA, TRIDOSHA-BHED, SAPTA DHATU, MAL, AGNI, OAJ report in Data form, Graphically presentation, Original Trace records taken by ETG machine, Modern western diagnosis and summery of the case etc.</p>

<p>One should keep in mind that Ayurvedic tridosha is very differ to the concept of humor. Unfortunatly tridosha is understood and translated as humor. Let us see the exact meaning of the humor in <i>Stedman's electronic medical dictionary</i>:</p>
<p>""humor; 1- any clear fluid or semifluid hyaline anatomic substances 2- one of the elemental body fluids that were the basis of the physiologic and pathologic teachings of the Hippocratic school, blood, yellow bile, black bile and phlegm</p>
<p>Humoral Doctrine: the ancient Greek theory of the four body humors [blood, yellow and black bile and phlegm] that determined health and diseases. The humors were associated with the four elements [air , fire, earth and water] which in tern paired with one of the qualities [hot, cold,dry and moist]. A proper and evenly balanced mixture of the humors charecterized health of body and mind, and an imperfect balance resulted in disease,Temperament of body and mind also was supported to be determined e.g. sanguine [blood], choleric [yellow bile] melancholic [black bile] or phlagmatic [phlegm]"".</p>
<p>From above dictionary statement clears about the misconception of humor and tridosha.Humor is concept of the Europeans, while Tridosha is the concept of the Indians.Hippocrates first introduced the philosophy of humor in Europe. Now the concept is only alive in Unani system of medicine, which consider humor in the same way as Hippocrates percieved.</p>
<p>The concept of Tridosha is concieved by the sages hundred thousands of years ago, when the knowledge was transferred by brain to brain and no written language was in existence.The philosophy of tridosha and the philosophy of Humor is very diffrent entirely and there is no co-relation because the basic approach is differ from the start.</p>

<p>There is substantial evidence that the Greek medicine is an evolute of Ayurveda or perhaps that both are children of a "mother" system." Regardless, the use of the term "humor" is to elucidate these concepts within the "humoral" theory, to differentiate it from for e.g. the "biomedical" theory of modern medicine. What actually comprises a "humor" is best understood by those who practice this medicine, rather than quoting stedman's dictionary. I am sure there are better sources to understand what the term "curry" means than the Joy of Cooking. In Ayurveda rakta (blood) is sometimes considered to be a fourth dosha (humor), and therein lies the relationship between greek/unani and ayurveda. Lastly, one cannot understand what is meant by humor without understanding samkhya. But this article isn't about samkhya and so we are stuck with using a poorly defined english term.</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all correct your knowledge about Tridosha. You have wrong concept of humor in your brain. You have not used your branial capacity to understand the Ayurvedic tridosha. It is the <b>Unani medical system,</b> which considers <b>fourth concept of Rakta (Blood).</b> Perhaps <b>Unani</b> have penetrated in your brain. In Ayurveda, only and only three doshas are considered. The Rakta (Blood)is a part of the SAPTA DHATUS (Seven Vital elements), which is related to the Ayurvedic Pathology and makes a concept of the Pathological basis of diseases. To undestand Ayurveda, one have to go for serious study of Ayurvedic Maulik Siddhanta, (Ayurvedic philosophy), then they will be able to understand and capable to compare, what is Tridosha and what is humor.</li>

<p>Can someone please write an article about Abhyangam (its an ayurvedic massage) - it would be useful to the ayurveda category (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Ayurveda" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Ayurveda" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Ayurveda</a>).</p>
<p><b>Abhyang / Maalish / Massage</b></p>
<p>A disciplinary pressurised movemental rubbing of the body parts by hand is known abhyang. Abhyang is done by the plain hand with or without oil / fat / alcohol / medicated oil or by any other means. Almost the oil is used due to its easeness in movement by hand smoothly.</p>
<p>By use of massage, the blood circulation is increases. Thus the process of oxidation is increases in the tissue and cells of the body or body parts. The main effects of the massage especially is in the muscles, joints, circulatory nerves and arteries and autonomic nervous system. Massage reflects the strongness of muscles, increases skin texture, happyness in mood, increases Vata-nadi strength. Abhyanga is a sort of physical exercise, by which the benefit of exercise is obtained.</p>
<p><i>Use of Abhyang in diseases</i></p>
<p>There is several disease conditions where abhyang is very beneficial. Some of the disease conditions can be well managed for total cure by use of abhyanga.</p>
<p>In loss of blood / aneamia, whole body massage or part of the body or visceral massage is very beneficial. By massaging in these disease condition, Heamoglobin increases. Those who are suffering from muscular pain, aching, coldness of the extremeties, loss of flesh , emaciation abhyanga is beneficial to lessen the problems.</p>
<p>Those who are suffering from digestive disorders or digestive problems, like Mucous colitis, looseness of diaphragm, looseness of abdominal muscles, after abdominal surgery, after pregnancy, can be benefited by massage.</p>
<p>It is observed that in Emphysema, asthma, chronic bronchitis like disease conditions massage is helpful if it is done by the specially trained massage practitioner.</p>
<p>In Vatik Vikar massage is very beneficial. In Paralysis, infantile paralysis,neuritis, arthritis, fibrositis, any painful condition can be managed to get towards cure by massage therapy. But the massage should be done by the expert and tactful massage practitioner.</p>
<p><i>Prohibition of Abhyanga</i></p>
<p>Abhyanga is prohibited in some disease conditions. So massage should be avoided for the treatment or management purposes. In acute fever, nausea, vomiting, after enema, acute inflammatory conditons, acute emaciative disorders, severe skin disorders, phlebitis, lymphangitis, bonemarrow inflammation, gastri and dueodenal ulcers, nephritis, swelling of kidney, acute intestinal problems, these conditions should be not treated by the massage therapy.</p>
<p><b>Methods of Abhyanga</b></p>
<p>In olden time only oil is used prominently for massage. The practical approach and tactics of the massage therapy is transfered by family tradition passing one to others. However the description and details are not much available in Ayurvedic literature, except the direction of the uses of Ayurveda Oil. Abhyang is a subject based on the practical practice, in which the movement of the hand, posture of the patient, specific and individual technique of massage by the pressure of hand, which is individualised and changed from person to person experiences.Olden time the family tradition makes them experts for the massage therapy and therefore it seems that there is no need to tell the technique of massage, much depending upon the practice and experience.</p>
<p>Now today the condition is changed. Every subjects are seems to be evaluated on the logic and scientific backgrounds. Today the massage is directed by a difinite framed rules and technique, but it is very difficult to write the experiences in words. However a few techniques is as below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Effleurage: Palm surface of the hand is used. By this frequent and fast movement of the hands in up and down / rounded movements are used. In one minute, 15 to 20 shakes should be given.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Petrissage: Griping up the muscles by the fingers, pressure them, tighten them and expand the muscles.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Friction: By palm surface is done. It is an easy way for massage which is used by the ordinary persons. But the massage therapist used this technoque in most effective way. Fingers, thumb is uses.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Percussion: Clapping, Tapping, Cupping, Hactking technique are used</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Vibrations: vibration is produced from the use of shoulder of the therapist. Now electric vibrators can be used.</li>
</ul>
<p>The massage should be started slowly and gradually, then speed of the massage gradually increses and similarly when finishes finally, gradually reduces. Sudden reduction may cause harm to patient. The body should be in the relax position and there should be no mental and physical tension.</p>
<p><b>Ayurvedic Oils</b></p>
<p>Ayurveda provides so many oils for the curing ailments of the body by use of massage. These oils are made from the best quality of the Black Til Oil, with the selected herbs according to the classical formula, written by the master mind of Ayurveda.</p>
<p>The followings are the famous oil, which are using in the treatment of the various ailments</p>
<ul>
<li>Maha Narayana Tail: uses in all kinds of muscular problems, paralysis, joints pain, spondylitis and all nature of pain and painful conditions</li>

<p>Abyangha means to massage.</p>
<p><br />
It’s an ancient Indian art used for healing, relaxation and for treatment of various diseases Abyangha is a full body massage, which is usually done by medicated sesame oil.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In Ayurveda the word for oil is taila. Taila is originated from the formal word tila. Tila means sesam. This base of hebal (or medicated oils) which are used in Abhyanga is sesam oil.</p>
<p>Why Ayurvedic massage is so unique? It’s based on the five elements (pancha mahabuthas) Biological humors (tridosha) Concept of agni and pitta Marma therapy Status of toxins or ama in the body Substances used for Ayurvedic massage: Plain oil (preferbally sesamoil) Medicated oil Some facts about Abhyanga: Always use unrefined oils, this because refined oils have been processed so heavily that they loose their potency. (refined oil -&gt; an oil that is virtually colorless, odorless, and tasteless – that can last for years in a bottle with no danger of spoilage. On the other hand, it has virtually no connection with the beneficial oil that was originally contained in the seed or coconut. It is now a “plastic fat” that offers no benefits to the human body and the potential for much harm.) Also in vitro, sesame seed oil has inhibited replication of human colon cancer cells (Anti cancer research 11: 209-216, 1992. In vitro, sesame seed oil has inhibited the growth of malignant melanoma (a skin cancer): (prostaglandin leukatrines and essential fatty acids 46: 145-150, 1992) Research shows that sesame seed oil is a potent antioxidant. In the tissues beneath the skin, this oil will neutralize oxygen radicals. It penetrates into the skin quickly and enters the blood stream through the capillaries. Molecules of sesame seed oil maintain good cholesterol (HDL) and lower bad cholesterol (LDL). On the skin, oil soluble toxins are attracted to sesame seed oil molecules which can then be washed away with hot water and a mild soap. Internally, the oil molecules attract oil soluble toxins and carry them into the blood stream and then out of the body as waste. Sesame seed oil absorbs quickly and penetrates through the tissues to the very marrow of the bone. It enters into the blood stream through the capillaries and circulates. The liver does not sweep sesame seed oil molecules from the blood, accepting those molecules as friendly. Sesame seed oil helps joints keep their flexibility. It keeps the skin supple and soft. It heals and protects areas of mild scrapes, cuts and abrasions. It helps tighten facial skin, particularly around the nose, controlling the usual enlargement of pores as skin ages chronologically.</p>

<p>The classical Panchakarma is described by some writers. It is not easy as it is understood.

It is advised that Snehapaan should be done early in the morning before rising of Sun. This process is repeated upto seven days maximum. The selection of the Sneh is dependent upon the patient likings. But it is indicated according to disease and Tridosha conditions.Sneh is also used for massage, pouring in ears, in eyes, as Nasya, for Gargles.</p>
<p>Those who are not able or interested in this type of Snehapaan, they can take the Sneh [fat] mixing in the food articles. After snehpaan, swedan is done. These are known as Poorvakarma. Snehan is termed Oleation in english and swedan is Sudation.</p>
<p><b>PANCHAKARAMA</b></p>
<p>Five karmas are in total is done for Panchakarma.</p>
<ul>
<li>Vaman</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Virechan</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Anuvasan</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Niruhana</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Navan</li>
</ul>
<p><i>[1] Vaman</i></p>
<p>It is indicative that the expert Ayurvedic Physician should perform the Vaman in Winter season.Those who are having strong body built, suffering from Kaphha dosha, nausea, patience personal,they should be selected for the Vaman and Virechana. Vaman should be performed in the Vish Vikar, dugdha vikar,mandagni, shleepad, arbud, hradaya roga, kustha, visarpa, prameha, ajeerna, bhram, vidari rog, apachi roga, kaas, shwas, braddhi, apasmaar, jwar, unmaad, raktatisar, nasapaak, taalupaak, osthapaak,karnashrav, adhijvihak roga, galshundi roga, atisaar, pittaroga,kaphha roga, medoroga, aruchi etc. After Vaman, the proper treatment of the diseases should be given.</p>
<p>The followings are not considered for the vaman procedure and these should be avoided for Vaman. Timir Netra roga, Gulma, udar roga,very old person, pregnent woman, very obese, Tuberculer, alcohol addicted, childrens, have not properly fed personals, weak, those who have lossed their blood by bleeding, heptic patiebts, wormicular poatients, etc.</p>
<p>Some medicines are indicative for the use of Vaman according to the Doshas. Some precautions are essential to follow after the Vaman karma.</p>
<p><i>[2] Virechana</i></p>
<p>When Snehan, swedan and Vaman karma have done, after that Virechan karma is performed.</p>
<p>Some of the patient are not selected for the Virechn karma. They are childrens, old man, fatty persons, tuberculars, psychofears,very tired, thirsty, obese,pregnent, acute fever, alcoholics etc.</p>
<p>For Virechna karma, sevral medications are used. The medicines are categorised according to the weather conditions.The doses are fixed according to the strength of the patient. Some food intake is specially indicated.</p>
<p>Adverse effects may happen, if the instructions will not followed accordingly.</p>
<p><i>[3]Anuwasana</i></p>
<p>This is also known Enema therapy. In Anuwasana, oil enema is given. Those who are Old maniacals, thirsty,edematous, epileptic, hyteric subjects, comatic patient,fearful, loss of taste, asthamatics, chronic bronchial affections, tubercular, emaciated subjects etc. should not be selected for the Anuwasana treatment.</p>
<p>Those who are suffering from Vata doshas, have teekshagni digestive fire and rough skin subjects, they should be selected for the treatment.</p>
<p>In anuwasana basti, castor oil is used for enema and the quantity of the oil is varied according to the doshas, age and nature of problems, which is decided by the Ayurvedicians.</p>
<p>A Basti yantra is used by which the Oil or medicated oil is introduced through anorectal, urethral or vaginal route.</p>
<p><i>[4] Niruhana</i></p>
<p>Niruhana is also known as Asthapana Basti. In Niruhana/Asthapana basti, the decoction of the herbs are used as enema material and herbs are selected according to the nature of the patient and his complaints.</p>
<p>Niruhana Basti is restricted to those who are not constipated, doshas which can be easily removed by purging, pulmonary tubercular subjects, emaciated, weak,flatulent, edematous, diarrheal subjects, cholera affected, leprotics, dropsy, anasarca subjects, dibetics,pregnent women etc. These subjects should be avoided for Niruhana treatment.</p>
<p><i>[5] Nasya</i></p>
<p>The medicines are used through nasal route. The same precautions are taken in selection of patients for treatment and what should be avoided, as mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>This is the Ayurvedic Panchakarma methods, which are narrated in the classical book <b>Bhav Prakash</b>.</p>
<p><i><b>KERALA STYLE PANCHAKARMA</b></i></p>
<p>Kerala style panchakarma is somehow differ from classical panchakarma of the Ayurveda. This is a speciality of the panchakarma of South India. In Kerala Panchakarma the followings are done:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pindasweda</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Pichchil</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Shirobasti</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Shirodhara</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Shirolepana</li>
</ul>
<p><i><b>Precautions:</b></i></p>
<p>Panchakarma is a very sophisticated mode of treatment. It requires a good and practical experienced hand. Suppose if a patient of duedenal ulcer is treated by Vaman therapy, what will happen of his ulcer&#160;? Is it not possible that by purging his ulcer may open again&#160;? If anybody is suffering from sigmoid colon tumour or cancer or intestinal ulcer , what will happen when virechan and basti will be given to him&#160;?</p>
<p>Therefore the Ayurvedicians warns several times, to whom the physician should select for the treatment and to whom the physician should rejects for treatment.</p>
<p>Those who have gone for bypass heart surgery, implanted pacemaker, kidney transplant, joint replacements etc they should not take the any Panchakarma treatment without the consent of the atleast two expert Panchakarma practitioners. However these patients can take the Ayurvedic treatment and medicines without any harm with or without modern western medicines [ Allopathy drugs].</p>

<p>Is ayurveda really supposed to placed as part of hinduism? I mean its portrayed as part of hinduism. Its more a form of medicine. Sure its from the vedas, but I think you should change the overall topic and the picture. Change the picture to some ayurvedic treatment thing. Its to know that that people will come to this site. Not mainly to know all the crap written here.</p>
<p>Ofcourse, AyurVEDA is a part od VEDIC religion--<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHoly_Ganga_0eb4.html" title="User:Holy Ganga">Holy Ganga</a> 15:36, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Of Course not, ayurveda is the science/the knowledge of life and much broader than a religion like Hinduism. There is no dogmatism in it like any religion has dogma.</p>
<p>It is misconcieved that Ayurved is a part of Hinduism. Being a Hindu, I read HOLY BIBLE, HOLY QURAN, NITNEM SAHAB and GEETA. These are the holy religious books, which I keep in my Clinic with great honour and respect. I read these books, when I have time and try to understand the contents. A Hindu respects all religion because it is said in Hindu Religion that there is Crores of incarnation by God himself. May be Holy Sprits , which have been mentioned in these Holy books. That is the reason, every Hindu respects all incarnation given by the God himself to the Humans.</p>
<p>VEDAS are four in numbers RIGVEDA, SAAMVEDA,ATHARVAVEDA and YAJURVEDA. All Vedas have mentioned the natural qualities of the earth and around the earth i.e. AIR,WATER,FIRE,EATHER,EARTH,TREES,VEGETABLES,CREATERS, ANIMALS, MOON,SUN and other celestials. Every religion considers these mentioned matters. Can you say, these are the contents of HINDUS&#160;? So is about the Ayurved. A science or therapy or technology is for the use of the every individual of this globe without consideration of Caste, creed , Religion , Part or Nation&#160;? In fact, the AYURVED is developed by the Hindus for the sake of helping sick humanity of this world, with the moto "VASUDHAIVA KUTUMBAKAM" philosophy, which means " those who are living on this earth, they are our Families." How this could be blamed that AYURVED is a part of Hinduism&#160;?</p>

<p>This article seems to me to be unbalanced as it lacks any criticism of ayurvedic medicine.</p>
<p>Indeed, so why not delete all the content and write a balanced article. -good idea. It's an alternative medicine and the article is totally biased.</p>
<p>I agree - this whole article is almost an unsubstantiated ramble.</p>
<p>I agree - this article is really quite poor and definitely not *balanced*, ahem, the restoration of which is the goal of Ayurveda. It relates nicely to systems theory that way.</p>
<p>Tridosha= vata/pitta/kapha</p>
<p>vata=movement in and out of system pitta=transformation or processing inside of system kapha=storage in the system</p>
<p>These roughly correspond to the "humours" of phlegm/bile/wind, but the Ayurved system is very well documented, also in English:</p>

<p>Also see David Frawley.</p>
<p>This holistic approach is the future of medicine as it is fundamentally linked to diet and lifestyle empowers people to take charge of their own health. It is is also integrated with Samkhya philosophy which is a most useful toolbox for exploring the mind/body continuum.</p>

<p>I would like to discuss and add the following non-commercial external link about the holistic way in which Ayurveda treats erectile dysfunction: <a href="http://content.msn.co.in/Contribute/Sports/UCStory811.htm" class="external free" title="http://content.msn.co.in/Contribute/Sports/UCStory811.htm" rel="nofollow">http://content.msn.co.in/Contribute/Sports/UCStory811.htm</a> This article, titled 'NPT - The Unknown Side of Erectile Dysfunction', is about a scientific but not much highlighted link between the absence of Nocturnal Penile Tumescence (NPT) and development of physiological Erectile Dysfunction. The necessity of having frequent erections for maintaining erectile function is discussed. It also highlights the link between testosterone levels and NPT, and how a low testosterone level thus indirectly contributes to ED. Also discussed is the connection between ejaculation frequency and testosterone levels, as well as holistic, non-proprietary, and non-commercial methods from Ayurveda to restore testosterone levels and thus restore NPT and erectile function. Each of these aspects are independently verifiable from research studies published at PubMed. Healthbuff 04:56, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the feedback. Though this external article appears to be only tangentially related to Ayurveda, it is not so. In fact, it is one of the innovative articles available on the web that shows the prowess of Ayurveda in a specific context. For example, no other treatment methodology stresses the importance of NPT, testosterone levels, ejaculation frequency, erection frequency etc in treating erectile dysfunction (ED), as Ayurveda does. In fact, this holistic approach is what sets apart Ayurveda. On the other hand, each and every scientific statement made in this article is independently verifiable from modern research studies, as can be found by browsing authentic sources like PubMed. Besides, the article is totally non-commercial, and non-proprietary. Lastly, with ED affecting a significant percentage of adult male population, this link that explains Ayurveda's holistic approach to ED, is relevant. Healthbuff 07:14, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It sounds like a fine article - but it isn't directly related. This is a general article about Ayurveda and should links to websites on the general topic of Ayurveda. The article is about the treatment of <a href="../../../e/r/e/Erectile_dysfunction.html" title="Erectile dysfunction">Erectile dysfunction</a> and belongs on the <a href="../../../e/r/e/Erectile_dysfunction.html" title="Erectile dysfunction">Erectile dysfunction</a> article - probably used as a reference rather than an external link. I notice that you have already posted the article on that article - so there is no need to post it here where it doesn't belong. I will also say that the page will not load for me which suggests there is a problem with the link - another reason not to add it. <a href="../../../n/p/o/User%7ENposs_32e4.html" title="User:Nposs">Nposs</a> 10:41, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One should use his brainial capacity to understand the Ayurveda page. The information and contents are as true as it can be and there is no any fantasy in the provided matters.It is as correct as it should be. Who is Deepak Chopra, I do not know and why the gentleman is particularly want to include his name in the Ayurveda page? In India, here is a very large number of the master mind's Ayurvedic practitioners and scientist. If the Ayurveda page will be used for the inclusion of these so called personalities numbers, what will be of the policy of Wikipedia. I am totally against for inclusion of any personal name in the page. Only Historical facts and Ayurveda related material should be included.</p>

<p>I would like to clear to all concerned that every Indian is taking the benefit of the Ayurveda as much as possible in his daily life and routine from centuties and even today and the process will be continue in future in innumerable comming centuries. As it is said earlier that Ayurveda is related with the life style to gain the full age of 100 years. Ayurveda teaches, how a person can achieve the target of 100 years life.

<dd>Which is the sort of statement I am willing to accept at face value. Saying that "every Indian" uses Ayurveda all the time is an obvious falsehood, though.--<a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolitas_bfff.html" title="User:Politas">Myk</a> 22:56, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Everyday use of Ayurveda and the herbs&#160;: Ayurveda is divided in two parts. First it teaches you the way of being healthy throghout your life time, every year's season, change of weather, what you have to do daily that is Dinacharya, provides you the rule to keep youself fit and healthy, tells you what you have to eat according to the seasons and your lifestyle to maintain the health, so that the man should prevet himself from diseases. Ayurveda teaches what you have to eat for proper nourishments to human body. For that in Ayurvedic materia medica there is lot of information based on the time based experiences of the food articles and crude food material qualities and charecteristic of the cooked and non-cooked food.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The second part of the ayurveda teaches , when you becomes sick, you should take the appropriate medicine for cure. Every Indian is daily taking Ayurvedic medicines with his food. What is Turmeric, what is jeera, what is asafoetida, what is dalchini, what is lavang, what is tejapatta, what is dhaniya, what is capsicum,what is garlic, what is pyaj, what is kala namak, what is sandhav namak, what is ginger, what is tulasi, what is kalimircha, what is peepal, what is methi, what is ajawayan, what is lemon juice&#160;? Are they not Ayurvedic medicaments&#160;?</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually one should first go through seriously to study the Ayurvedic classical literature and try to understand them.Merely seeing superficial study will always creat controversy. My advice is first to those who are willing to know about the Ayurveda, they should study seriously classical literature of Ayurveda, because this is complete medical science, which is traditionally, psychologicallly, knowingly or unknowingly is adopted by the every Indian. Ayurveda developed in India, so it have the Indian value. Those who are not Indian, they can not understand the soul of Ayurveda.</p>

<p>So you are saying that people are using Ayurvedic "medications" without even being aware of it? That is a ridiculous claim and robs Ayruvedic medications of any useful properties. Saying that "&lt;This new medicine&gt; claims people should eat lots of rice to stay healthy." Does not mean that most people in Asia are using &lt;this new medicine&gt;.</p>
<p>Is every Indian eating garlic, capsicum, turmeric, etc in the exact proportions and preparations sepcified by an Ayurvedaic practitioner? No, they're just making <b>food</b>.--<a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolitas_bfff.html" title="User:Politas">Myk</a> 22:57, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, to understand the philosophy of Ayurveda, which is hidden in between "Prakruti" and "Purush", one should be gone with the philosophical background of Indians.<b>This is the soul of Ayurveda</b>. But in case of treatment purposes, philosophy have some role in the treatment related to severe Psychological or severe mental disorders. Otherwise, for bodily or mild psychological treatment this is not applicable and Ayurveda is beneficial universally and globally.<a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDebbe_53e3.html" title="User:Debbe">user:debbe</a>, 28 January 2007, 05:30 UTC</dd>

<li>Siddha, Yoga and Unani system of medicine have separate identity as medical sciences. They have no direct relation to Ayurveda because their fundamental principals are very differ to eachother.

<dd>So do they come under "Indian traditional medicine"&#160;?

<li>Ayurveda is the only Indian traditional medical system. While Yoga [correct word is Yog] is a part of Yog Darshan or Yog Philosophy. Yog philosophy is developed in India. It have eight folds in philosophy, which are known 1-Yam 2- Niyam 3- Asan 4- Pranayam 5-Pratyahar 6- Dhyam 7- Dharana 8-Samadhi. Unfortunately the philosophy of Yog is known worldwide by Yoga as a means of exercises and postures of body and breathing exercises. This is wrong and absolute wrong concept about yog.Actual yog is something else. Unani system of medicine is developed by the Hippocrates and came to India by Mughals. Though Unanani medical practice is almost ended in the land of Hippocrates but it developed in India during Mughals period. Its philosophy and theory is more away from the concept of Ayurveda.</li>

<p>- likewise, I don't have a broad knowledge of Indian Traditional Medicine. The Indian Government, though, seems to see things like Siddha (<a href="http://indianmedicine.nic.in/html/siddha/siddha.htm#intro" class="external free" title="http://indianmedicine.nic.in/html/siddha/siddha.htm#intro" rel="nofollow">http://indianmedicine.nic.in/html/siddha/siddha.htm#intro</a>) and yoga (<a href="http://indianmedicine.nic.in/html/yoga/yoga.htm#con" class="external free" title="http://indianmedicine.nic.in/html/yoga/yoga.htm#con" rel="nofollow">http://indianmedicine.nic.in/html/yoga/yoga.htm#con</a>) as traditional Indian medicine. I think this means that there is at least enough dispute as to what 'traditional indian medicine' is that this should not just forward to Ayurveda. jon_m</p>

<p>The part of the history section detailing different paths of students seems pretty irrelevant to me</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hinduism attributes the genesis of Ayurveda to several theories in which the knowledge is believed to have been passed on from person to person . According to Charaka Samhita, the Hindu God Brahma transferred the Ayurvedic teachings and knowledge to Jatukarna, Bhel, Parashar, Hareeta and Ksharpani, via the following chronological order: Brahma → Daksha Prajapati → Ashwani kumar → Indra → Bhardwaj → Atreya Punarvasu → Agnivesh → Bhel, Parashar, Hareeta and Ksharpani. However, according to Sushruta Samhita Bramha transferred the knowledge via the following chronological order: Brahma → Daksha Prajapati → Ashwani Kumar → Indra → Dhanvantari → Aupdhenav, Vaitaran, Aurabhra , Pushklavata, Karveerya, Gopur Rakshit and Sushruta. In another view, accroding to Kashyap Samhita, Brahma transferred the knowledge to via Ashwini Kumara to Indra, thereby to Vashishta via Kashyapa and Atri, Bhrigu etc; lastly among them Atri transferred the knowledge to his son and his pupils subsequently.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Is there any point to these histories? Some indication of how Ayurveda's historic development is affected by the different paths?</p>
<p>If there is no good reason for including them, I think they should be deleted, since they seem to be largely repeated sequences of irrelevant names. --<a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolitas_bfff.html" title="User:Politas">Myk</a> 16:59, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>INCLUDE THEM</b></p>
<p>The question raised by the editors of the Ayurveda section about the genesis of the Ayurveda, is thought to be wrong. The fact is that the author or compilers of the Ayurveda classics, say <i>Charak Samhita, Sushruta samhita , Ashtanga Sangraha</i> are written in the different and remote parts of the country and hundred thousand years before, at that time no means of communication was possible due to demographic conditions. So the writers have written the genesis of the Ayurveda according to their knowledge, which they have got from the Guru or teacher in Gurukul, as was the tradition of that time. The soul of the genesis is to understand the development of the Ayurveda teachings and transfer of the knowledge from one generation to another generation and further. The writers of these classics had mentioned the genesis according to the data, whatever they have, at that period.</p>

<p>Ok, I understand that you feel there is some value to this data. As it is, it doesn't seem to actually impart any useful information to someone not highly knowledgeable in the field of Ayurveda. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and the information in it is supposed to be accessible by everyone. I will try to rewrite what you have said in a way that makes sense, and remove the long, mostly meaningless sequences.--<a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolitas_bfff.html" title="User:Politas">Myk</a> 22:57, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Question of whether the names of those who may have transmitted information over many years have value is not, in my opinion, up to the compilers of the information. That the information is valuable to those who are/were involved in the actual practice is the important thing. If wikipedia is to be unbiased then the cultural opinion that ancestors are irrelevant cannot be part of the spirit of wikipedia. All or any information pretaining to the development of a subject may have usefulness at some future date to someone who has more respect for their ancestors. If they were irrelevant then what would be the point of geneology or history for that matter? Just because you do not recognise the format of the information does not mean it is invalid..</p>

<p>"Ayurveda was practiced during the time of the time of the Buddha (around 520 BC) , and in this period the Ayurvedic practitioners were commonly using Mercuric-sulphur combination based medicines.[3]"</p>
<p>This citation isn't valid. Let's have a citation from the extant literature, not commentaries. There is NO mention of bhasmas in Charaka, Sushruta, Vagbhata etc., and its it is not until Nagarjuna, (NOT the mahayanist buddhist scholar Acharya Nagarjuna), born in the 10th century CE/AD, that toxic metals like mercury are given any prominence in Ayurveda. As a result, the image of Acharya Nagarjuna is WRONG!! and needs to be removed.</p>
<p>Even the much vaunted antiquity of bhasmas in the Siddha tradition appears to be relatively recent, according to "A History of the Tamil Siddha Cult" (1990) by R. Venkatraman. In this text Venkatraman suggests with much certainty that alchemy was incorporated into during the 12th by the nathasiddhas of present day Madhya Pradesh.</p>
<p>All of this supports the contention that (1) bhasma use in India is not as venerable as is claimed, and (2) that its use was originally not as widespread as claimed.</p>
<p>I will give the author a couple weeks to clear this up and then I will do it myself and delete that section.</p>
<p><b>MENTION OF BHASMA AND MERCURY SULPHUR COMBINATION IN CHARAK SAMHITA</b></p>
<p>Take the reference of Charak Samhita's Chikitsatsthanam, Saptamoadhyay verse -70 says that " Mercury Bhasma prepared in combination with Sulphur or Swarnmakshik should be taken by the person suffering from Leprosy. The Mercury [Parad] Bhasma cures all disease conditions."</p>
<p>In the same section, verse 69 says for use of Sulphur and Verse 71 says use of Vajra [Heera, Diamond] Bhasma. Verse 167 says for the use of Mainsil and Kashish.</p>
<p>In Khodashoadhyay verse-69 instruct for use of Loha [Lauh] Bhasma for Hepatic/ Liver ailments. Verse 69 and 70 says formula of Navayas Lauh, which is a combination of Lauh Bhasma and herbs.Verse 72 to 76 mentions Mandoor Vatak, which is another combination of Lauh Bhasma with herbs. In Saptadashoadhyay verse 124 mentions the formula of Muktadyam Churnam which is including Moti Bhasam, Prawal Bhasam, Vaidurya Bhasam, Shankha Bhasam, Sphatika Bhasam, Anjan Bhasam,Kach Bhasam,Tamra Bhasam, Lauha Bhasam, Rajat Bhasam, Padmarag Bhasam with herbs.</p>
<p><b>IN SUSRUT SAMHITA</b></p>
<p>In Chikitsasthanam, Navamoadhyaya verse-6 mentions Swarnmakshik with other herbs. In Dashamoadhyaya,verse 11 and 12 tells the way of preparing Lauh Bhasam.Ekadashoadhyaya verse 10 recommends Lauh Rasayana, which is prepared by mixing Lauh Bhasam in herbs. In Dwadashoadhyay verse 11 formula of Navayas Lauh is given.In trayodasho adhyaya verse 17 and 18 tells about Swarnmakshi and Raupya makshik bhasama. In ashtavinshatitamoadhyaya verse 10 to 12 tells to take Suvarn Bhasamwih other herbs.</p>
<p>In Susrut samhita, Tutiya, Hartal, Mainsil, Kashish and other metals uses are mentioned.</p>
<p>'<i><b>IN VAGBHATTA'</b></i> Vagbhatta Astang Sangrah have many formulea in which Bhasma have used. In Raktapitta chikitsa tratiyodhyaya verse 38 mentions Shankha Bhasam, Shambook Bhasam,Surma bhasam. Verse 76 tells for Shankha Bhasam with other herbs. In chapter Shwashidhma chikitsa, khastoadhyaya verse 42 and 43 instruct to use Mukta bhasam, praval bhasam, vaidurya bhasam, shamnkha bhasam, surma bhasam, marakat bhasam, sphatik bhasam, tamra bhasam, loha bhasam, rajat bhasam with other herbs.</p>
<p>In prameharoga chikitsa, chaturdasho adhyaya verse 67 mentions Loha Bhasam and Tamra Bhasam. In chapter Panduroga chikitsa, ashtadasho adhyaya verse 13 tells Swarn makshik bhasam, rajat mal bhasam, mandoor bhasam, verse 48 swarn makshik bhasam. In chapter Kustha rog chikitsa, ekvinshoadhyaya verse 31 mentions rajat,loh, kantloh, abhrak bhasmas.</p>

<p><b>REGARDING NAGARJUNA</b> By the name of Nagarjuna, several Nagarjunas names are comes up and are taken into consideration. If careful studies of Sansakrit Language Literature, Pali Language literature, Tibbatian Language literature and translated literature of Chinese Language are done, several Nagarjunas names comes up.Among these names, <b>"Ras siddha Nagarjuna Third"</b> seems fit for innovation of Ayurveda in total of followings eights:</p>

<p>1- Nagarjuna First- The description of the Nagarjuna is seen in Brihat Katha, Kathashloka sangraha, katha sarita sar. He is understood to be amshawatar of Bodhi satwa.Bodhi satwa is known as minister. He is not having knowledge of Ras siddhi.</p>
<p>2- Bodhi satwa raja Nagarjuna - He is a avatar of Bodhisatwa and as king, but he was not having knowledge of Ras siddhi.A discription of the nagarjuna is seen in Raj Tarangini, verse 172-173.</p>
<p>3-Ras siddha Nagarjuna third - He was known as Loha siddhi, in Bhont Language of Harihar Nath Shastri composition, description of Nagarjuna is written. He was well known to Ras siddhi.</p>
<p>4- Sushruta Pratisanskarta Nagarjuna - Dalhan have described about the Nagarjuna in the commentaery of the essays on Susruta.</p>
<p>5- Anandkar Nagarjuna - Dalhan have described the Nagarjuna.</p>
<p>6- Bhadant Nagarjuna - He was the composer of the Ras Vaisheshika and expertise of Ayurveda. The description of Nagarjuna is well given in this book. This is an excellent book on the khadaras, vipaka, veerya, gunadi gyan and the treatment by the khadaras.</p>
<p>7- Nagarjuna Nagesh- he was producer of Ras Kachcha put and was a master of Ras shashtra.</p>
<p>8- Ras siddha Nagarjuna second - The description of nagarjuna is seen in the classical book like Prabhavak Charita,Vividha Teertha Kalpa, Prabandha Chintamani, Prabandha kosha etc. He was known ansavatar of Bodhi satva.</p>
<p>Inbetween these eight Nagarjunas, description of Ras siddha third is available as an authority of Loha and Deha siddhi. Anandkar Nagarjuna was a master of Visha tantra [toxicology] and Nagarjuna Ganesh was also master of Ras tantra. The description of these nagarjunas are available in very brief. Loha siddhikar Nagarjuna description is available sufficiently and possibility of this Nagarjuna can be clearly workouted.Other Nagarjunas are related to Ayurveda, but their descriptions are not clearly available.</p>

<p><b>DESCRIPTION OF NAGARJUNA THIRD [TRATEEYA]</b></p>
<p>It is believed that Nagarjuna Third was born in a Bramhin rich family in Kanchi Nagar of Barar [Vidarbha]. The family was very deppressed because they are not having any child.A dream seen by the one of the family member, hundreds of bramhin fed by the family and by the grace of god ,they got the male issue. Some astrologers suggested that the child will not survive after the age of seven years, this came in notice, the gaurdians left the child in a lonely temple. By the grace of God Bodhisatva Avalokiteshwara the child was brought to Nalanda , Bihar, a state of India. The head of the Nalanda Shri Sarah Bhadra adopted the child and make a follower of Budha and arranged for his education etc.</p>
<p>After accepting Budha religion, he became a notable maestro of Ras Tantra, the description is available. After his completion of education, he engaged himself to prepare the new mercury-sulpher based medications.</p>
<p>Nagarjuna got education and training of Ras Tantra by Vashshtha and Mandavya, who were the famous Ras Tantragya. It is believed that he studied the available Ras Classicals of that time, which are Shambhav Tantra, Shaiva Tantra, Rudrayamala Tantra,Shakra Tantra, Maula Tantra,Kuleya Tantra, Damar tantra, Swachchand Bhairav Tantra, Nakul Tantra, Vatul Tantra, Kakchandeeshwara tantra, harmekhala etc and make himself expert of the Ras subjects.</p>
<p>The time of Nagarjuna Third is seems to be of round about 8th century.He broke the ideas of Adya Shankaracharya. The period of the Adya Shancharacharya is round about 788 AD. Shri Sarah Bhadra was the chief of the Nalanda University. Nagarjuna and Shabasidhdha were two famous Ras siddha of his time. Shabar Siddha belong to the king Dharam Pal of Gaur Desha. The period of the Kinh Dharam Pal is 760 to 809 AD. In this way the calculation of the period is matching. The name of Ras Siddha Nagarjuna Third is mentioned in the classics of the Ras Ratna Pradeep, Rasendra Chunamani, Ras Prakash, Sudhakar, Kakchandeeshwar Tantra, Kalpa Tantra, Lauha Sarwashwam,Rasopanishad etc. Brand Madhav and Chakradatta is also mentioning the Nagarjuna.</p>

<p>It is highly objectionable that some concerns are propagating against Ayurveda, the Indian system of medicine. They are raising questions that heavy metals which are used in the Ayurvedic formulea , is dangerous to the health. Before independance, Britishers were ruling on India round about 250 years. This was the period of Kings and Nawabs. Earlier to Britishers, Mughals were ruling on India. Every Kingdoms have their own Ayurvedic practitioners to provide the health services to the public through Ayurveda because at that time no medical system was in existence. The Vaidya provides the medical treatment using these Ayurvedic medicines.Britishers have also taken treatment of the Ayurvedic practitioners during their ruling periods. Not a single evidence is available that any Britishers or foreigner have gone through with any serious problems , as it is said about kidney and liver etc. Even then Bhav Mishra in his Bhav Prakash Classical book mentions the accurate and foolproof treatment of the Syphilis and Gonorrhoea, the diseases spread in India by the contact of the Europeans.Heavy metals are used in the treatment for total cure of thiese diseases.</p>
<p>Regarding use of Lead,Arsenic, Mercury, these metals are used after a process of purification. By the process of purification, the toxicity of the metals becomes very less and is used for the preparation of the drugs. In Ayurvedic formulary few medicines are containing Lead,few medicines are containing Arsenic and no medicine of only [single] Mercury which have mentioned in the Ayurveda page. Mercury is always used after purification process with purified Sulphur. Without mixing Sulphur, Mercury can not be used in any formula because it will never mix up with any herbs. Only Sulphur have the power to mix and assimilate Mercury and provides a black powder forms, which is known "Kajjali".</p>
<p>Those who are talking for steroid in the formula, they should clear it up, what brand they have examined,whether the formula is classical or proprietory, who is the producer of the drug etc. Merely saying that the Ayurvedic drugs are poisonous, is not justifiable.</p>
<p>In my opinion, these are the mischivious attacks on Ayurveda done by those who have never used Ayurvedic medicines in the treatment and is opposing Ayurveda for the opposition only.</p>

<p>With respect, there is convincing evidence that consuming heavy metals carries health risks (see the links in the article). The article does not say that ayurvedic medicines are poisonous; it does say (and provide evidence for the fact that) medicines containing heavy metals carry health risks. These metals have been found in about 20% of ajurvedic medicines sold in the US (see citacion in article) - this carries health risks, and it is appropriate to mention these in the article. The article does provide evidence that ajurvedic treatment has caused health problems for Indians, including "kidney and liver damage due to mercury deposition, nerves and abdominal problems due to lead." <a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/full_story.php?content_id=71247&amp;pn=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/full_story.php?content_id=71247&amp;pn=1" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> Even if ayurvedic medicines have not harmed 'foreigners' and have 'only' injured Indians (something I find unlikely), this is not exactly an argument in their favour.</p>
<p>Re. the 'purification' of ajurvedic medicine, this has not been shown to be reliable (and the fact that heavy metals are found in the medicines suggests that it is unreliable). As Meera Nanda puts it "We constantly hear assurances from the proponents of Ayurveda that the traditional process of turning heavy metals into bhasams "detoxifies" them and makes them harmless. The message is that if the manufacturers faithfully followed the instructions in the classic Ayurvedic texts, there would be no problem of toxicity...But we are supposed to accept these assurances of faith alone, for they are not based upon any actual research." <a href="http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2307/stories/20060421004011200.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2307/stories/20060421004011200.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_m_72a2.html" title="User:Jon m">Jon m</a></p>
<p>Surely people who have never used Ayurvedic medicine, and never intend to use Ayurvedic medicine, should be considered by default to be more neutral regarding Ayurveda than someone who is a practitioner of Ayurveda? Dbbajpai1945, you have made several statements that are patently false and impossible for anyone to know. Your word alone cannot be trusted, since you have lost the assumption of good faith edits. Provide evidence to back up your statements and do not present your opinions as fact.--<a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolitas_bfff.html" title="User:Politas">Myk</a> 03:20, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/y/u/Talk%7EAyurveda_c920.html" title="Edit section: Mercury: as uses in Ayurveda">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mercury: as uses in Ayurveda</span></h2>
<p>The use of Mercury as medicine in Ayurveda is centuries ago. First of all it should be known to all that Mercury is naturally founded in the <i>unpurified form</i> and is never used as medicine both internally and externally. This fact was observed by the Old age Ayurvedicians as it is mentioned in the classical book <i>RAS TARANGINI</i> written by Shri Sadanand Sharma. Ras Tarangini, Pancham Tarang, verse 5 and 6 narrates the charecteristics of the unpurified Mercury. Verses 7 to 9, narrates the Unpurified Mercury's bad effects, which are eight in numbers.</p>
<p>Unpurified Mercury contains eight abnormalities, which causes severe and serious problems of human health. These eight abnormalities are: 1-Nag, 2-Vang, 3-Vahin, 4-Mala, 5-Chapalya, 6-Visha, 7-Giri, 8-Asahayagni.</p>
<p>1-Nag's bad effect causes wounds and absecess, 2-Vang's bad effects causes Leprosy, Leucoderma and anomalies of blood , 3-Vahin causes Hyperpyerexia,high fever, increases body heat, 4- Mala causes rigidity, motionless body, 5-Chapalya causes abnormality of reproductive systems, 6-Visha causes loss of life, death, 7- Giri causes severe skin disorders, 8-Asahayagni causes mental disorders, mental diseases.</p>
<p>The Ayurvedic practitioners, hundreds thousands years before, observed the bad effects of the Mercury and they warned in the verse 9 last line that Mercury should be used after the purification of these abnormalities.</p>
<p>Verse 14 to 16 tells the need of Mercury purification. Verse 17 to 18 tells the quantity of Mercury taken at a time for the purification. The process of the purification is given in the verse 22 to 26, in which the herbs are used to eradicate the all eight abnormalities of Mercury.This is known first process of the purification. The second process is given in the verses 27 to 30. The third process is given in verse 31. The fourth process is given in the verse 32 to 33. Two more processes of the purification is given in the verses 34 to 37.</p>
<p>Apart from this, Asta sansakar and Sixteen samsakara of the mercury purification is also given in the Ras Tarangini.</p>
<p>After passing from these purification processes, Mercury is used in the preparation of the Mercury-sulphur based medicaments with herbs, minerals mixture etc. It is observed by the Ayurvedicians that mixing Mercury with purified sulphur, the combination is suitable to human consumption without any harm.</p>
<p><b>GREY POWDER</b> This powder is used by the British Doctors. They named it 'Grey powder'.The internal use of the Gray powder cures Diarrhoa, Vomitting, Gonorrhoea and Syphilis. It is particularly beneficial to childrens. The method of the preparation is very easy. One part purified Mercury and two parts of purified Chalk [Calcium Carbonate], mix both with the help of Mortar and Pestal. In Khasta Tarang of Ras Tarangini verse 9 to 19 tells the preparation, doses and uses. The adult dose of this powder is 50 milligram and for children 5 to 10 milligram. When the symptoms of disease subsides or cured, the gray powder should withdraw immediately and the doses should not be used frequently. This formula is also find in some Allopathic Pharmacy books.</p>
<p>In books of toxicology, over 15 kinds of Mercury preparation is founded. But in Ayurveda only Quick silver or Mercury is used, which is after the vigourous process of purification.</p>
<p><b>One Mercury-sulphur based medicine:</b></p>
<p><i>Sootshekhar Ras</i></p>
<p>Contents: One part each of the followings: Purified Mercury, Purified Sulphur,Phoola of Suhaga, Purified Vatsanabha, Suwarn Bhasam, Tamra Bhasam, Ginger, Black pepper, Peepal, Shuddha dhature ke beej, Tej patra, Nagkeshar, Elaichibeej, Belgiri, Shankha Bhasam, Kachoor [total 16 herbs and minerals] should be taken in equal quantity of eachone. Mix all with the help of mortar and pestal, grinding all by mixing Eclypta elba {bhrangraja} fresh juice. When juice dried again mix juice and grind. Repeat the process total 7 times.</p>
<p>The dose of this medicine at present is 100 milligrams to 200 milligrams with honey one or two times a day, morning or evening or both the times with Anupan according to the disease conditions.</p>
<p>Indications: This medicine is covering the wide varieties of the disease conditions.The medicine cures Hyperacidity, Vomitting, Nausea, Abdominal Intestinal colic, Abdominal Tumours, Bronchitis, cough of all nature, Dysentery, Burning sensations, Diarrhoea, complaints arising from Tridosha, Asthama,Diminished Hunger, Very acute hiccough, Flatulence, Frequent Eructations,feeling of temparature, Tuberculosis, pathophysiology of ailimentary canal etc.</p>
<p>The above formula contains the purified Mercury only 06 to 12 milligrams per dose.</p>
<p>The fatal dose of <b>Unpurified Mercury</b> is 03 grains [about 200 milligrammes] to 20 grains according to the book of toxicology.</p>
<p>The difference is that Ayurveda uses mixture of the purified Mercury with the purified Sulphur and not alone. Purified Sulphur assimilates the therapeutic and curing properties of Mercury in itself and when this mixture is mixed with the herbs, it becomes an assured medicaments.</p>
<p>Now evaluate whether the Ayurvedic Mercury-sulphur combination Medicines are toxic&#160;?</p>

<p>Lead is used as medicine in Ayurveda. But the Lead is used as 'Bhasma' after purification process of the metal. Let us know, what is <i><b>Bhasama</b></i>&#160;?. It is similar to when wood is burnt and the wood is lastly converts in <i>ash</i>. <b>Ash</b> in english and <b>Bhasma</b> in Sanskrit / Hindi language, both have similar meanings.</p>
<p>Likely to this, Lead is first purified according to the process of purification, narrated in the classical books of Ayurveda and then it is converted in the Bhasma form.</p>
<p>Masters of the Ayurveda of olden times observed and experienced that Lead can not be used as medicine, as it is found in the natural state. In <i>Ras Tarangini</i>, the classical book of Ayurveda, in chapter Ekonvinshastarang, verse 4 to 6 narrates that use of impure or unpurified Lead causes anomaly of blood, produce Leprosy, Leucoderma and several Skin disorders, joints problems, paralysis, tumours, anomaly of urine, diabetes,tympenitis of Abdomen, dropsy, fistula, anus problems, Digestive disorders, Cervical spondylitis,frozen shoulders, abdominal colic, tuberculosis etc. The masters of Ayurveda warned the Vaidyas that purified Lead should be used for medicinal preparations. In verses 7 to 10 the process of purification of the Lead is given.</p>
<p>The Bhasma process of purified Lead is several and they are given in verses 11 to 45.</p>
<p>The dose of the Naag [Lead] Bhasma is 30 milligrammes to 120 milligrams, as advised in verse 46 to be taken one or two times with the Anupana according to the disease conditions.</p>
<p><i>Indication of Naag [Lead] Bhasama</i></p>
<p>The indication and therapeutic uses of this bhasama is narrated in the verse 47 to 55. Some uses of Bhasma are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>cures diebetes and anomaly of urine</li>
<li>Bleeding per vagina and uterus</li>
<li>Bleeding Heamorrhoides</li>
<li>Tuberculosis and intestinal tuberculosis</li>
<li>Hydronephrosis state of kidney, swelling of kidney</li>
<li>Paralysis and trembling of whole body</li>
<li>Revitalise Muscular system in condition of whole body paralysis</li>
</ul>
<p>The fatal dose of unpurified Lead is 300 grains according to the books of toxicology.</p>

<p>Arsenic is a fatal poison. The fatal dose of Unpurified Arsenic is 200 milligrammes and more. This fact is known to the Ayurvedicians since hundred thousands years before, that's why they warned to use Arsenic [Sankhia/Malla in Sansakrit and Hindi language] after purification processess as mentioned in the Ayurvedic classicals accordingly strictly. In <i><b>Ras Tarangini</b></i> classical book, chapter Ekadashtaranga, verse 133 to 137, the process of purification is given. After purification, Arsenic is ready for Bhasama procedures. In <b>Ayurveda Sar Sangrah</b>, a book of pharmacy and pharmaceutical preparations, tells the process of the preparation of <i>Malla Bhasam</i>. The Bhasma is useful in Malaria fever, Infectious fever, infections of different varieties, Arthritis, Gout, joints problems, Anomalies of Blood, Cough and Asthama of all nature, Leprosy, Leucoderma, Paralysis of all natures, Male infertelity and male sexual disorders etc etc.</p>
<p>ONE EXAMPLE&#160;: FROM <i>RAS TARANGINI</i></p>
<p><i>SHANKHVISHODAYA RAS</i></p>
<p>Ingredients: Purified Arsenic 100 milligrams, Black pepper powder 03 Grams, Ras-sindoor 03 Gms, Purified Dhatura-beeja 02 Grams, Pippaly Churna 02 Grammes.

<p>Indications: The remedy cures all kinds of Malarial fevers, Infectitious [Bacterial, parasitic,fungul,Viral] fevers and allied syndromes etc.</p>

<p>Mercury is never used in its natural forms in any Ayurvedic medicines. After vigorous purification process, purified mercury is mixed with the purified sulphur in ratio of [1] One part of purified mercury and one part of purified sulphur or [2] one part of purified mercury and two parts of purified Sulphur or [3] one part of purified mercury and six part of purified Sulphur.</p>
<p>When purified Sulphur assimilates purified mercury, mercury converts in a black powder, kajjali. Take the reference of <i>Sulphur</i> from the book <b>Foods that harm, foods that heal</b> published by the Readers Digest Association , 1996 edition writes about the Sulphur&#160;: although sulphur is preserve in the cells of human body, but it mostly accumulated in hair, skin and nails. Sulphur mostly recieved as part of the protiene intake, which are amino acids, cysteine and methionine. Three B Vitamines thiamin, Pantothenic acid and biotine are also part of sulphur. The sources of sulphur is proteine from animal and vegetable sources. In Onion, sulphur compounds are founded and researchers believes that onion prevent the growth of cancer cells.</p>
<p>The black powder of the mixture of Purified Mercury and Purified Sulphur makes a new compound in which the nature of purified mercury is changed. When the herbs are mixed with this compound, the purified mercury works better and becomes more effective in healing of disease conditions.</p>

<p>Ayurveda provides comprehensive treatment of the diseases / disease conditions / disease syndromes. The Ayurvedic treatment and management of the patient is differ to the other medical systems. In Modern Western Medicine [Allopathy] the treatment is basically given by the part of the body accordingly, while in Ayurveda the treatment is given according to the patient complaints. The whole body is treated and not the particular organs as in Allopathy.</p>
<p>Suppose a person is suffering from the Asthmatic problems, Skin rashes, fever, abdominal pain,Irritable bowel syndromes, Arthritis, backache etc. If he desire to consult the Allopathic physicians, he have to go for the Skin specialist, Pulmonary specialist,Gastroenterologist,Orthopeadics and other physicians. He have to take the huge numbers of medicines of his diseased conditions simultaneously. While comperatively, if the patient consult the Ayurvedicians, the Ayurvedic physician will solve his whole problems, because he will provide the patient comprehensive treatment at a time and will provide the treatment according to the sick persons conditions and the syndromes.</p>
<p><br />
<b>No side effects of Ayurvedic medicines</b></p>
<p>It is misconcieved by the so many people that Ayurvedic medicines are dagerous to health. These peoples are making mistakes to understand the Ayurveda medical science. In Ayurveda about 95 percent medicines are prepared from the herbal resources. Only about 5 percents are prepared from the mixture of herbs into metals, minerals and animal kingdoms. The metalic medicines are known Rasausadhi or Lauh, in which the contents of the metals are very very low. The classical Ayurvedic medicines are consumed by the Indian masses everyday.</p>
<p>Most of the westerners can not understand the efficiency of the Indian traditional system, because they are fail to understand the basic philosophy of life existed in the nature and environment Ayurveda begins with the nature and environment. The science progresses step by step to understand the motive behind it. Westerners only talks of the Infections and Bacteria now, while in Ayurveda the concept of the infection was concieved by the Ayurvedicians hundred thousands years before.</p>
<p>In <b>Madhav Nidan</b>, which is a book of the collection of the symptoms, syndromes of the diseases for disgnosis purposes, is seems to be the oldest book on disease diagnosis. The book provides the knowledge of the diagnosis, which is as true as observed hundred thousands years before. Now the descriptions of the diseases which was in nutshell at that time written in Madhav Nidan, is expanded because of the introduction of the microscopes, pathological examination, scanning facilities etc. In olden days the diseases were diagnosing on the clinical syndromes and sympatomatology and so was the tradition before 40 or 50 years. Today there is no changes at all in the olden concept, because the procedure of the disease diagnosis is the same as it was thousands years before. What happened today, our knowledge about the disease diagnosis is increased because of the research in the field, but the treatment is same with little changes except the introduction of the new chemical medicines. If one go through the history of medicine before 100 years, nobody will be able to find the description of Microscopes. Bacteria, pathogens, infections came in existence after the invention of Microscope. Earlier to that there is no description of Infection, but in Ayurveda, the practitioners oberved that there is some morbific agents, who grow themselves in a certain period of the year and creat a certain syndromes, when wheather changes. They called it "Agantuk jwar" or Ahantuk Vyadhi". Ayurvedic physician observed that at the change of weather in the month of "Basant" or "Vasant" [round about February/ March], there is a disease condition appears every year and affects the masses simultaneouly. They named it Vasant Rog/Masurika/chechak [Chicken pox, small pox, measles]. Ayurvedicians finds out that the disease spreads due to polluted air, polluted atmosphere, polluted environment. They also found that by contact of the sick persons, the disease affects to the contacted personals.Ayurvedicians also observed that in a certain period of the year, Typhoid fever grasps the population particularly youngesters. They also observed that Malaria fever is happening in the period of rain and in raint seasons. Ayurvedicians formulated herbal drugs for the cure of malaria and they treated successfully malarial fever, when there was no preparation of Quinine was found. Likewise in the same line of the treatment of Malaria, even todays patients are treated with these medicines, when Quinine fail to recover the patient or without quinine.</p>

<p>Ayurvedicians diagnose the disease condition by Pulse examination. They also goes for the Astawidhi examination with Urine and stool examination. Actually they developed the diagnosis technique for determination of the disease condition based on the Tridosha principles. With the conclusion of the diagnosis, the prescription is given by the Vaidya. So the theory of the comprehensive treatment is translated into total care prescription with Ayurvedic medicines.</p>

<dd>Quite true, the entire claim of quackery is rubbish. All the refs claiming "Quackery" pointed to Homeopathy, not Ayurveda. The basic precept of Ayurvedic medicine is strong and sound. Just that because Ayurveda does not have a fixed set of standards, there is greater opportunity for fraud. Ayurvedic concepts are very useful for the treatment of many mild illnesses and allergies, though they fail for more serious cases where modern medicine is the only realistic solution. Those who insult Ayurveda are ignorant people with no knowledge of the sound empiricism behind the discipline.<a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> 06:16, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The edits had a lot of failed verifications. Many of the sources pointed to criticism of homeopathy and the general precept of "Holistic Medicine" and were not specific to Ayurveda. Homeopathy is a western pseudoscience, not an Indian one. If you read the refs, the criticism is specific to a lack of modern standards in Ayurveda which leads to fraud, exaggerated claims, poor quality etc. However, Ayurvedic medicine is sound for treating and partially curing many ailments (uaually minor ones). Obviously, the Vedic Rishis did not possess the technology or the means to study or cure more sophisticated diseases</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>(many of which evolved during more contemporary times) such as Diabetes, Cancer, AIDS, Alzheimers etc. Plus, drastic medical treatments requiring sophisticated surgery or powerful antibiotics etc will not work Ayurvedically. However, Ayurvedic medicine can treat mild allergies (through Herbal antihistamines), it can supplement diets (multivitamin herbs, preparations, mineral sources like calcium etc.), it can enhance some neurological abilities through extended use (Vishwanathan Anand, India's Chess master and possessor of the highest IQ recorded in India in recent years, enhanced his memory with Ayurvedic regimen that lasted years).It's all about the right dosage and the right kind of treatment, which often doesn;t work because of the lack of organization in the field, the lack of a medical standards baseline, and the lack of objective testing that leads to exaggerated claims, fraudulent practices etc.<a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> 06:30, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Looks great.</b> Your rewrite was very much needed. The article was rampant with linkspam and is much better now with your cleanup. It really needed a science section. On the other hand, I think you're barking up the wrong tree with the skeptic angle. I understand that there may not be much out there in the way of research supporting this topic, but Ayurveda is much bigger than evidence-based and scientific methods. There will be plenty of published work in the years to come, as the NIH/CAM institute is in the middle of the largest study ever done. Keep in mind that it's 3300+ years old and it may take time for westerners to understand it.<br /></dd>

<p>I am going to delete the line saying that ayurveda goes against modern scientific beliefs of disease such as pathogens, genetics etc. Ayurveda believes that an imbalance in tridoshas reduces the immunity and makes one susceptable to the attack by pathogens resulting in disease. The sentence is completely wrong. Both Charaka and Sushruta (ancient authors of Ayurveda) have written about pathology in their books (samahitas).</p>

<p>If Ayurvedic science is so bad for some criticisers, commenting that they have not yet seen the worst page in the whole Wekipeadia articles [ now they have seen ] and according to them , this is the worst and worst article they have read. Whether they have thought over it, if Ayurveda is so bad, why Americans and other foreigners are interested in the patenting of the Ayurvedic herbs and Ayurvedic formulea? There is a big list for obtaining the patent in various countries patent's offices for patenting the Ayurvedic herbs.</p>
<p>Some years ago, Turmeric and Azadiracta Indica was patented by some Americans. The patent was challenged by the Indian Government to quash the patent. Now Ashwagandha and other herbs are patenting by the foreigners. What is it? At one side, they are abusing and defaming Ayurveda and other side they are wanting benefit from Ayurveda. It shows, they are playing the double game and showing their double personality. Their intentions seems bad, unfair and dishonest. <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDebbe_53e3.html" title="User:Debbe">user:Debbe</a>, 27 October 2006, 07: 50 PM IST</p>

<dd>Firstly, some 'treatments' are completely ineffective but still very profitable (e.g. homeopathy). Patents on this type of thing can be valuable, even if the treatment is useless. The fact that something is patented (or that people have tried to patent it) doesn't prove it works.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, it's feasible (very likely, I'd say) that some ayurvedic treatments are effective; however, this doesn't mean that other ayurvedic treatments aren't ineffective and/or dangerous.

<dd>In terms of heavy metals and safety, the risk comes from using (not just misusing) contaminated remedies.

Sure- drinking alcohol to excess, for example, is dangerous. However, this does not change the fact that studies have shown that ayurvedic medicine contains toxic heavy metals in overly high quantities. Ayurveda is therefore often blamed for toxic materials because it often contains toxic materials - seems fair enough to me. The dangers associated with the heavy metals in ayurvedic preparations should be covered in this wikipedia article (just as, for example, the <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcohol.html" title="Alcohol">alcohol</a> article discusses the potential toxicity of ethanol). <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_m_72a2.html" title="User:Jon m">Jon m</a></p>

<p>Meera Nanda's article Ayurveda under scanner is less than half, devoted to Baba Ramdev. Some part of the article is with the opinion of few doctors. Some part is to communist. Some part is to Government. But no part is seen to Ayurveda. It is very easy to critisize over any thing. The article is nothing and not written seriously acording to the caliber of Meera Nanda , who is perhaps research scholar in United States somewhere, researching in religion and science. No body knows about her medical qualification or medical knowledge, because the article is full of cricism and shows the negative attitude of the writer. The article is lacking nutrality. The Journalists are said to be, the jack of all trades but master of none.</p>
<p>Few years back, in a Televison interview, while one of the senior most Journalist of India was inteviewing to Kashmir's Chief Minister Abdullah, the journlist asked, why you are not solving the problem of Kashmir, now is the time the central government is with you and this is the best time to solve the Kashmir's problems? . In reply to question, Chief Minister Abdullah asked question to that journalist, whether he can solve the problem of the Kashmir?. The journalist replied that Yes, he have solution of the Kashmir problems, but he is not the chief minister of the state and without being the CM, how is possible to solve the problem&#160;? Abdullah replied that National conference is in majority at the movement, if you have any solution of the solving of Kashmir problem, I will depute you Chef Minister within few hours and you can solve the problem very easily. The next movement, most senior journalist shamefully geared back and told to Abdullah that he is having no solution of the Kashmir problem.</p>
<p>Nanda is a reserch fellow in the field of religion, we should await about her unique contribution in religions, which is a necessity in the present era. The world is being divided in the different ideology in Christianity and in Islam. If she should work on these important topics, her share and contribution will be more appreciated.</p>

Basically the Baba Ramdev thing was just a smear campaign by that commie <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brinda_Karat_a5b5.html" title="Brinda Karat">Brinda Karat</a> that was so obvious that even other commies condemned her for it.Incidentally, my father had been following the controversy and he told me that Baba Ramdev's did not reveal the fact that he had been following normative ayurvedic practice of using deer horns to boost the Calcium content of his medicines. He didn;t do this because he didn;t want to piss of his more finicky Jain followers.Brinda Karat got wind of this and exploited the situation to her advantage, spreading absurd nonsense about Ramdev using "Human Body parts" (she obviously saw too many reruns of "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom", lol!), then got thoroughly thrashed by both left-wing and right-wing politicians.Her credibility is shot to nothing as far as I can see.<a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> 07:41, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Take the reference: Acharya Pandit Vishwa Nath Dwivedi, Ayurveda Brahaspati, ex-director, IASR, Jamnagar, Gujarat, now presently associated with the Gujarat Ayurveda University, Jamnagar, writes in his book <b>"Bharatiya Ras Shastra",</b> that at the very beginning of the Ayurveda, when no written words were invented, at that time the Guru-Shishya parampara was persisting. Guru transferes the knowledge through shruty-smraty [listening and memorising] traditions. Some times after, these words were engraved on the stones of the caves. The disciples were memorising the words and sentences according to their capacity of storage of memory. Later when literature increases, the division of memorising of the words and senetences, had been segregated to different groups. Thus the tradition of Ayurveda was alive by this methods.</p>
<p>After that when script came in existence ,the sentences were written on the stones,woods,taalpatra, bhojpatra and copper sheets.</p>

<p>Take the reference from Atharvaveda:</p>
<p>The fourth kanda of Atharvaveda, 13 sookta and Dasham Mandal of Rigvada, 137 sookta is famous for the "Roga-Nivarana sootra". It is believed that the originator of these sookta are Rishi Santati, Devata Chandrama and Vishwadeva. While in Rigveda the first mantra is written by the Rishi Bhardwaj, Second Kashyapa, Tratiya Gautama, Chaturtha Atri, Pancham Vishwamitra, Khasta Jamadagni and Saptama Rishi Vashistha and Devata Vishvodeva. By chanting these verses continuously normal health is assured, it is believed. The Rishies have prayed to dieties for providing cure to sick.</p>
<p>The followings are the seven verses from Atharvaveda in Sansakrit Language;</p>
<p>1- Uta Deva avahitam deva unnatha punah, Utagashrachkrusham deva deva jeevayatha punah:</p>
<p>english translation: O god, o god, those who are fall down, give them strength to up. O god , o god, and those who have done sin, alive them alive them</p>
<p>2- Dwavimou vato vata aa sindhora parawata, Daksham te anya aavatu vyanyo vatu yadrapah&#160;;</p>
<p>english translation: There are two Vayu. One from the side of oceans and other from the far away from earth. In these two Vayu, one provide you strength and other provide you cure from sickness.</p>
<p>3- Aa Vata Vahi Bhesajam vi vata vahiyadrapah / twam hi vishwabhesaj devanam doot eyase /</p>
<p>English translation: O Vayu, bring medicine here. O vayu, remove our Dosha, O Vayu, the keeper of all medicines, certainly you come like angle, moves and goes.</p>
<p>4- Trayantamimam devastrayantam marutam ganah / trayantam vishwa bhootani yathayamrapa yasat /</p>
<p>English Translation: O god, save this sick, O groups of Marut, save, all beings save, by the act the sick became normal</p>

<p>The ultramodern discovery of Ayurveda information, Electrotridoshagraphy [ETG] was mentioned on the main page of Ayurveda upto July/August 2006. When pages of Ayurveda were splitted in the few sections, another page was fabricated and the information of the Electrotridoshagraphy was transferred to new page "Research and innovation in Ayurveda".Which is as under:</p>
<p><a name="Electro-Tridosha-Graphy_.28ETG.29" id="Electro-Tridosha-Graphy_.28ETG.29"></a></p>

<p>About 10 years ago, an Ayurvedic practitioner in Kanpur, India claimed to have invented an "electro-tridosha-gram/graph". The device is designed to measure the levels of the Ayurvedic Basic Principles (i.e. tridosha, tridosha-bhed, sapta dhatu, malas, agni, oaj, etc) in the human body. An electro-tridosha-gram report can show the levels of these doshas in a variety of formats (i.e. data sheet, graphical) along with traces of ETG readings. Medicine. The technology is supposedly very simple to use.</p>
<p>This is the first and only Ayurvedic whole body scan, with the Ultimate Evidence Based Ayurvedic Diagnosis Solution.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/y/u/Talk%7EAyurveda_c920.html" title="Edit section: Procedure">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Procedure</span></h3>
<p>The Basic concept of the technology is based on the <b>Human Anatomy, Human Physiology,</b> <b>Biophysics, Biotechnology,Electrophysiology, Action potential, Signal</b> <b>transduction,Electrolytes, Membrane potential, Biomedical Engineering etc</b>. The ETG produces signal traces from electrodes placed at 21 selected sectors and points on the patient's body. The traces are fed into a computer which processes them.</p>
<p>The traces produced by the ETG are collected to produce seven waveforms, creatively labeled "ABCDEZF". A high LEFT KAPHA reading in the 'E' wave is an indication of cervical spondilitis. 'F' wave presence almost seen in the patient suffering from any fatal diseases conditions i.e. Cancer, Kidney failure, Incurable disease conditions etc. Deppressed waves at RIGHT PITTA sector signifies Hepatitis and pathophysiology of Liver. In this trace, if 'E' wave is horizontal signifies presence of Gall bladder stone. 'E' wave downward signifies that Gall bladder is operated. Deppressed 'B' wave in RIGHT VATA signify colitis and Inflammatory condition of bowels.</p>
<p>If the electro-tridosha-gram actually works as advertised, it would have tremendous implications. It may advance the field of Ayurveda by giving researchers the ability to see precisely how various stimuli affect dosha levels in the body.</p>

<p>Central Council for Research in Ayurved and Siddha, Department of Ayurved [AYUSH], Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, is trying to develop this technology. NATIONAL INNOVATION FOUNDATION, AHAMADABAD, INDIA, well appreciated the technology. An International research center KERI is established for the research, training and development of the technology. It is believed that with the help of this technology, Ayurved will be more evidence based medical system and will proove its scintificity.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>This information was on the main page of the Ayurveda upto the formation of the new page as earlier said.</b>Some newspapers and magazines published articles and news on this Ayurveda discovery, which can be seen and brows by anyone interested in the Ayurveda and want to see Ayurveda progressess with the modern Hi-tech.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately some persons, it seems to me they are prejudice about this technology and does not want to keep on the pages of Ayurveda. They removed the entire information and made mockery of the technology, as if some thing have been done wrong by the Indians. What is motive behind it, cannot say? The ETG technology is practicing today in its established centers at Kanpur and in their branches. Its popularity is increasing day by day.</p>
<p>The news and the articles, which have published in the news paper and magazines in Hindi Language, because the Ayurvedic Literature is in either in Sansakrit language or in Hindi Language. English is spoken and understood in entire globe and is a global language for communication. So, to introduce with this technology to all persons of the globe, the articles and the news have been translated into english language, so that every person could understand the benefit of the technology.</p>

<p>The Indian system of medicine is considered to be about 5000 years old medical science. The complete Ayurveda is based on the basic principles like Tridosha, Tridosha-bhed, Sapta-Dhatu, Mala, Oaj, Agnibal etc.</p>
<p>To quantify the status of these principles, stages of Dosha presence in human body, radial pulse examination is the only way, which is known Nari Pareekshan [Pulse examnination]. Pulse examnination is dependent upon the qualification and experience of the Ayurvedic physician. The process of Pulse examination and their results are experienced and concieved by the brain and mind, depending upon the capacity of the Ayurvedic physician, but cannot be seen physically.</p>
<p>How Ayurvedic physician accepts the state of the presence of the Tridosha, Tridosha-bheda,Sapta Dhatus, Mala etc himself and how they estimate the intesity of the dosha-dhatu-mala and how they express the intesity of these principles, this is not possible in evidence form. For example in modern medical science, as they talks of the "Evidence Based Medicine", i.e. Xrays,CT scan, MRI,ECG,Pathological examinations.</p>
<p>In the history of Ayurveda, probably this is the first time happens that after the invention of the Electrotridoshagraphy machine, with this technology all the basic principles of the Ayurveda is produced successfully in the evidenced based form.</p>
<p>It is believed that with the invention of this technology, Ayurveda, the Indian System of Medicine will proove its scientificity. The Ayurveda will be more scientific. The technology will open new doors for research in the field of the Ayurveda, Ayurveda basic principles, Ayurveda philosophy, Maulik Siddhanta and new innumerable concept in the Ayurveda research. At modern time, Ayurveda have a scientific tool and scientific approach with this technology.</p>

<p>1- The ETG technology scans the whole body. It detects the most sick parts to the lesser sick parts of the human body. The technology is very cheap. The expences of the single examination is worth Rs. 10/=IC [equivalent to less than quarter [1/4] US dollar]</p>
<p>2- So many diseases / disease conditions are not tracable from Xrays, Ultrasound, Scans and other Pathological examinations. ETG traces these complaints.</p>
<p>3- Monitoring of the sick persons health are easily possible. The effects of the treatment, the effects of the medicines, the effects of the managements can be examined and monitered.</p>
<p>4- This technology is for the use of all medical sciences practitioners, physicians practicing in their diciplines i.e. Modern western medical practitioners, Yoga , naturecure, Unani, acupuncturist etc etc. The technology is very easy and simple and can be performed anywhere, any place, any time, any condition, in clinic, in hospital, in home. The technology is very easy and no need of any prior medications and preparations.</p>
<p>The technology is invented by Dr. Desh Bandhu Bajpai,Kanak Polytherapy Clinic and research center, 67/70, Bhusatoli Road, Kanpur.</p>

<p>Many curious reader's reactions about the invention of Electrotridoshagram technology have been recieved after the publication of the article in the 09 August 2005 issue. The curious readers have asked several questions regarding the ETG technology, which are common, uncommon, serious and very serious.</p>
<p>1- The development of the ETG technology came in existence slowly and gradually by the continuous efforts since 10 years to the present state.</p>
<p>2-The scientific presentation of this technology have been successfully done before the high level expert committee set up by the Department of Ayurveda [AYUSH], Ministry of Health and Family Welafre, Government of India, New Delhi on 23 December 2004.</p>
<p>3- The Institution set-up by the Government of India for Grass root innovation recognition, National Innovation Foundation, Ahamdabad, India accredited the technology as " extraordinary combination of Ayurevda and modern scientific technology", believing with the fact that the technology will be foolproof for the dianosis of the ailments.</p>
<p>4- The ETG technology is selected as competition entry for Asian Innovation Award 2005, Singapore and international "Global Entrepolis Singapore Award 2005.The competion is organised by the famous Hongkong newspaper The Wall Street Journal with Do-Jones inc.</p>

<p>Readers of The Moral is questioning that ETG technology is useful for the all practitioners and all physicians Modern western medicine practitioners, Ayurvedicians,Hakims, Naturopaths, Accupuncturist etc. can use the technique. On the other side the technology is specifically for the use of the Ayurveda and quantify Maulik siddhanta of Ayurveda and propagated that the technique is useful for the Ayurveda, there is controversy in the statements? Which two statement are correct?</p>
<p>In reply of the question, it is better to say that both the statements are correct. For recording the tracings, the whole body is divided in the 21 sectors mainly and few sectors in options, which are known additional sectors. In fact in this technology the modernisation is included and at one side the data obtained is analysed in view of Modern western medicine, at the other side the data is analysed in view of Ayurveda Dosha-dooshya-mala-oaj. Thus the Ayuveda physician have advatages of the disease dagnosis in both way.</p>
<p>The body is a single unit. The body cannot divided into the separate parts. The technology gives the indication of the [a] Physiological basis of the diseases [b]Pathological basis of the diseases [c] Metabolic basis of diseases [d] Psychological basis of diseases. All the four divisions are represented to Ayurveda.Which quantify the status of the seven doshas, 15 doshas kinds, Seven dhatus, three Malas, two oajas, four Agni etc etc.</p>
<p>For example, if in the tracings of the Vata and Pitta, the B wave is 4 e.v.,Ras dhatu is below 50 percent, Mans Dhatu is 160 percent, Pureesh, Mootra and Swed is below 50 percent, Oaj and complete Oaj are less than normal level. In ETG B wave signifies the Saman Vata and Ranjak Pitta.</p>
<p>This details signify the diagnosis according to Ayurveda is "Yakrat janit Vata-Paittik shotha" or "Vata-paittik yakrat shotha" and in the view of Allopathy Modern western medicine the disease condition will be "Hepatic Oedematous condition" or "Hepatic Edema."</p>

<p>The Ayurvedic Research is being published since last two issues of The Moral newspaper. A large number of the readers of the newspaper from the different states all over India welcommed the research work done by Dr. Desh Bandhu Bajpai of Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. Many questions were asked for.</p>
<p>1- The research work is carried with the financial help from the patients and donations from the patient's family and the admirer of the Ayurveda. Therefore it is decided by the inventor Dr. Desh Bandhu Bajpai that the Electrotridoshagram technology should be dedicated to the entire community of the patients, all over the globe. Dr. D.B.Bajpai is dedicating his entire ETG research work to the patients.</p>
<p>2- This is known to be all concerned to Ayurveda that in future Ayurveda should be ready to face the possible challenges standed by the Modern Western Medicine. The target is straightly towards the Ayurveda.Foreign Multinational companies are in mal-practices to sell their products in India. They are using mal-tactices to sell their products by hooks and crooks. These multinationals directly or indirectly is advertising that Ayurvedic medicines are containing toxic materials and herbs and those will use these medicines, they will be poisoned and their body parts will hurt by using these Ayurvedic medicines. By using Ayurvedic Bhasma and Mercury-sulphur based medicines causes to fail kidney and liver and many Vital Parts of the body is affected. This type of the news published and broadcasted by the media, now a days the American, British, Canadian, German, Francicy governemt banned on the use of Ayurvedic medicines in their respective countries.</p>
<p>This is a direct attack to defame, on the 5000 years old timely developped Indian system of medicine, Ayurveda and an insult of the Indian traditional medical system. The foreigners why forget that the development in the Modern western medicine is not very old and the progress which have in the Allopathy that is 40 and 50 years old. In Indian during the regime of Britishers, the overall British families taking the treatment of the Ayurveda which was provided to them by the King and Nawabs of the respective states by their Rajvaidya. At that time there is no complaints done by any Britishers to failure of Kidney or Liver damages.Years and years Britishers uses theses medicines. Why this propaganda against the Ayurveda is at this time?</p>
<p>3- However a famous Ayurvedic Medicine Arogyavardhini Bati has been tested by the Electrotridosha graphy technology on human body. In this Vati medicine the Mercury, sulphur, herbs , minerals, metals are used for the preparation. The medicine is tested on the patients of Hepatitis, Enlargement of Liver, Swelling of Liver, Gall Bladder inflammation and time to time monitored their health conditions. After testing this medicine on the human body, no side effects or adverse effects are not observed and patient safely got cure. All the body parts did not shown any abnormality.</p>
<p>4- The technology is not yet Patented, so that the details will be provided to the readers with limitations.</p>

<p>Ayurvedic physicians from all over India welcommed, by heart and soul, the invention of the ETG technology.</p>
<p>1- It should be well noted to all that Electrotridoshagram technology is the First, only, alone Hi-tek of Ayurveda, which is in existence. This is the only indigenous technology, which is developed in the country, without any external supports. The technology is a boon of Ayurveda, which is giving by the Ayurveda to the whole world. It should be noted here that all the scans, examinations are came from the Modern Western Medicine [Allopathy] sides.</p>
<p>Electrotridoshagraphy is came from Ayurveda, complementary medicines and Holistic healing medicine sides.</p>
<p>2- Many Ayurvedic practitioners shows interest in the E.T.G. machine and the technology. To understand the ETG and the interpretation of the recorded tracings are the essential part of the technique. One have a good knowledge of Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology, Practice of medicine etc along with the Ayurvedic Dosha-dhatu-mala and other Ayurveda basic principles. Because the interpretation of the data will be based on the Ayurveda side diagnosis and Modern Western Medicine sides both. So without having a good knowledge of the mentioned subjects the interpretation will be difficult.</p>
<p>3- It is observed since long experience that Ayurvedic treatment based on the Electrotridoshagram diagnosis and findings, cure is ascertained. The reason is, all the comprehensive disease picture comes before the physician in data, index, graphical forms of Tridosha existence, Five kinds of the Tridosha, Sapta Dhatus including Vata affected sapta dhatu, pitta affected sapta dhatu, kaphha affected sapta dhatu, Three malas - stool, urine, sweat, Agnibala, prakrati etc. The data also provides that which side, right or left, is affected or which part of the body is more or less sick.</p>
<p>This data provides physician the diagnosis ability and the physicians finds the exact location of the problems in the body. The physician came to know where and what treatment should be given to patient with the management.</p>

<p>It is very easy to estimate the presence of Vata Dosha in the human body by the help of ETG technology. Hundred thousands Electrotridoshagram trace record's pattern shows that ETG records are identical and individual. It is impossible that similar pattern of one person will tally with the other person in the same way. This fact came after studying hundred thousands recording. Therefore recording of the ETG is said to be identical and individual.</p>
<p>Before recording , a normal parameter is seted to the sick. This parameter is came from the IEC and CEC. The parameter can be changed and will not remain same.</p>

<p>Tracing no:1- this is record of a 58 years old male. The normal parameter is 25.44 e.v. The person is having 16 e.v. from Vata-sthan. Thus he is having presence of Vata in his body 62.89 percent. The normal should be 95 to 99 percent.</p>
<p>Tracing no:2- this is record of the 38 years old male. The normal parameter is 12 e.v. In the tracing 8 e.v. is present. This person is having vata presence 66.66 percent.</p>
<p>Tracing no:3- this is record of a 50 years old female. The normal parameter is 14 e.v. The tracing shows 10 e.v. She is having presence of Vata 71.42 percent.</p>
<p>Tracing no:4- this is a record of the 71 years old male. The normal parameter is 26 e.v. The tracing is 28 e.v. The person is having presence of the Vata 107.69 percent, which is above from normal 95 to 99 percent.</p>
<p>Tracing no:5- this is a record of 22 years lady. The normal parameter is 20 e.v. She is having 20 e.v. She is having normal presence of Vata.</p>

<p><b>English Translation:</b></p>
<p>In connection with the publication of news and details about the invention of new technology of Ayurveda in weekly newspaper The Moral, physicians and medical practitioners have taken it with great enthusiasm and applaudes expressions.</p>
<p>1- Dr. S.K. Gupta M.B.B.S.,M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Chacha Neharu Children's Hospital, Cooperganj, Kanpur have gone through with details of Electro-tridosha-gram technology, expressing his view that the technology can provide good diagnostic ability in early detection of cancer, of the body-parts.</p>
<p>2- Ayurvedic treatement experiences, which have been gained with those disease conditions, which are chronic in nature and is going parrellel with the life spawn, can be treated by taking the base of ETG findings. ETG findings makes easier the comprehensive Ayurvedic treatment classical concept, which have been said in the classical books of Ayurveda without any doubt and mistakes, because the technology provided the internal organs sickness stage foolproof and no chances of any mistakes in the provision of treatment. The Ayurvedic physician have thus confidence in himself and his Ayurvedic treatment and medicine/drug prescribing. ETG avoids the risk of wrong diagnosis. What is to be cured in the sick? this target is provided by the technology. The technology avoides confusion of Physician and opens the target for treatment, on the other side the technology provides confidence in the mind of the physician and save from any deviation before, during and after treatment.</p>
<p>3- The technology is easy for the doctors and the patient. Any place, any time, any circumstances the recording can be done. There is no need of any premedication or pre-preparations.It is a very easy technology. There is no torturing medications, no blood lettings, no injections no pain. When patient is Hospitalised or on bed or in emergency and if physician feels for regular monitoring of the patient's conditions, electrodes can be fitted in the proper place and thus the condition can be monitored as desired interval quickly. The psychological aspect of the regular monitoring will provide patience in patient's mind that the physician is watching regularly his/her condition and they are doing something.</p>

<p>As already said that technology provides diagnois of diseases also apart from the Ayurvedic principles. Some of the examples tracings are for the readers.</p>
<p>These are the trace records of the patients who are suffering from the Cervical/ Thoracic spinal problems and syndromes. All the sick have Cervical spondylitis disease conditions but they have pain in between scapular region or the upper part of the back is painful or rigidity in the chest muscles with pain, in some the pain spread in the both upper limb upto ankle joints or numbness sensation in the upper hand fingers or pain or skin eruptions , dermatitis. Some have missed diagnosed Cardiac diseases, angina etc.</p>

<p>The tracings no. 1 to no. 6 are of those patients who are suffering from the Cervical spondylitis disease syndromes. Some have painless problems while some have no direct syndromes of the cervical problems.</p>
<p>The Z wave becomes peaked or exagerated in the tracings of the Kaphha sectors.</p>
<p>All the patients were advised to go for the Cervical X-ray examination for counter check-ups. The X-rays confirmed the Cervical sponylitis in these earlier ETG examined patient.</p>

<li>Today Ayurveda have a scientific technology and scientific base. Ayurveda medical science will enter into a new era of research by this hi-technology at present period. There is unaccountable and innumarable possibilities of research in the different branches of the Ayurveda is hidden. In future Ayurveda shall have many paths and branches of its developments, which have never been explored earlier.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Electrotridoshagraphy [ETG] technology is useful for all systems of medical practitioners i.e. Modern western medical practitioners,Allopaths, Homoeopaths,Unani Medical practitioners, Yoga practitoners, Naturopaths, Accupuncturists, Accupressurist, Herbal healers, Magnetotherapist,Faith healers, Reiki healers, Holistic healers, Dietician etc etc etc, because the technology scans the whole body and it detects the normal and abnormal parts of the body with their working capacities, pathophysiology and pathology. The technology is cheap, very easy and the test can be performed any where, any place, any time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The technology can help to those patients, who are suffering from the incurable, undiagnosed, difficult to cure disease conditions. Regular monitoring of these patients can show the effect of the treatment given by the doctors, whether patient is improoving or declining health.</li>

<p>It is observed that most of the research work have not been done in the proper way. The details are yet not available about the researchers and they have concluded according to their own way. I have gone through to some of the research report. They are seems to be doubtful because of the lack in the proper restriction in the diet, which Ayurveda restricted during the treatment. If Gugal is used for the diminishing of the body fat, Ayurveda restricted to not to take the Fatty substances like butter milk, Ghee, Oil and other fats which can increase the level of the fat in the body, or the fat level, say cholesterol. The restriction of the diet, which can trigger the problem, is suggested by the Ayurvedicians according to the personal temeperament and diseases conditions. It is not permissible for a patient of Suppurative bilateral Tonsillitis to use icecream and chilled cold water or cold drinks for intake, because it will never cure the diseases and will inhibit the curing process. Even the researchers may trial for any best of the Ayurvedic medicaments for judging the effective of any medicine without inhibition of the diet. So is of the life style.</p>
<p>If researches on the Ayurvedic medicament is to be performed, they should performed in the Classical Ayurvedic way and should follow the basic rule for the maintenance of the health and restrictions i.e diet, proper fooding, life style etc.</p>

<p>I've reinserted the 'citation needed' tag for this claim. Although these treatments are mentioned in the [research and innovations in ayurveda] page, the citations in this page don't provide (nearly enough) scientific evidence of efficacy. The citation for Kshar Sutra links to a brief article on how it takes place (not a description of a scientific clinical trial)<a href="http://www.ayurvedahc.com/articlelive/articles/8/1/Kshar-Sutra---Thread-Healing-Ayurvedic-Surgery/Page1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ayurvedahc.com/articlelive/articles/8/1/Kshar-Sutra---Thread-Healing-Ayurvedic-Surgery/Page1.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> and a very short biog of a researcher <a href="http://www.sethayurvedics.com/kshar-sutra/specialist.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sethayurvedics.com/kshar-sutra/specialist.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>. The section on Panchakarma just links to a short journalistic piece describing a machine <a href="http://www.pharmabiz.com/article/detnews.asp?articleid=25799&amp;sectionid=50" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pharmabiz.com/article/detnews.asp?articleid=25799&amp;sectionid=50" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> - again, without a clinical trial to show if the machine does anything useful. The section in [research and innovations in ayurveda] dealing with Triphala is most promising - but just shows promising trials on cell cultures and in animals: there is nothing close to a clinical trial in humans cited (and cell cultures and animals' bodies often behave differently to human bodies). It may be that there's better evidence to support the efficacy of these treatments: if so, it would be great to include it in the article <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_m_72a2.html" title="User:Jon m">Jon m</a> 23:36, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The claims I make are not original research: all I've done is check some of the citations from the [research and innovations in ayurveda] section, to see if a) they cite sufficiently reliable sources and b) if the sources say what they are cited as saying. This is simply good practice.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The disputed sentence is "The efficacy of certain Ayurvedic regimens have been established by medical research, such as the Panchakarma, Kshar Sutra and the Triphala209 herbs". Being as this is at the start of the "Modern scientific research" section, I would read this sentence as a claim that research using the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_method.html" title="Scientific method">scientific method</a> has a) shown that certain ayurvedic regimens is effective and b) that this includes the Panchakarma, Kshar Sutra and the Triphala. The citations in the [research and innovations in ayurveda] section are not sufficient to show this. If you meant something different by the sentence, perhaps it could be rewritten/qualified?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Firstly, even if the sources were utterly reliable, some do not say what they are cited as showing. For example, although there are reliable journal articles that show triphala having interesting effects, these effects have only been shown to take place in cell cultures and non-human animals (rats and mice iirc) - these articles should therefore not be cited as showing that ayurvedic treatment (of humans, I presume) is effective.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, some of the sources are not reliable enough *and* do not say what they are cited as showing. The references to Kshar Sutra, even if one accepts the sources as reliable, just say that a researcher is working in this area <a href="http://www.sethayurvedics.com/kshar-sutra/specialist.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sethayurvedics.com/kshar-sutra/specialist.html" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> and give a description of how one practitioner uses this technique <a href="http://www.sethayurvedics.com/kshar-sutra/specialist.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sethayurvedics.com/kshar-sutra/specialist.html" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> The sources do not even claim that research using the scientific method has shown Kshar sutra to be effective.</dd>
<dd>Moreover, the sources cited re. kshar sutra are not sufficiently reliable to back up the claims made made. The <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> policy states that "All reports must be evaluated according to the processes and people that created them....Reliability is a spectrum, and must be considered on a case-by-case basis. Typically peer reviewed publications are considered to be the most reliable, with established professional publications next. Government publications are often reliable, but governments vary widely in their level of reliability, and often have their own interests which will explicitly allow for withholding of information, or even outright deception of the public. Below this are sources which, while not tangible, can be providers of reliable information in some cases, for example websites associated with reliable publishers." While the sources you cite aren't blogs, the sources for Kshar sutra are one website selling ajurvedic treatments <a href="http://www.sethayurvedics.com/kshar-sutra/specialist.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sethayurvedics.com/kshar-sutra/specialist.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> and an arjurvedic community site <a href="http://www.ayurvedahc.com/articlelive/articles/8/1/Kshar-Sutra---Thread-Healing-Ayurvedic-Surgery/Page1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ayurvedahc.com/articlelive/articles/8/1/Kshar-Sutra---Thread-Healing-Ayurvedic-Surgery/Page1.html" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>. The latter even has a big disclaimer, saying that "is not intended to treat, diagnose, prescribe or heal any health condition" - not a good sign of reliability. Given the claim for scientific proof of medical efficacy, one would want a citation from a reliable peer-reviewed scientific journal (for each of the regimens for which efficacy is claimed), or at least an article from a RS which reports on a peer-reviewed journal article that proves efficacy.</dd>
<dd>I have re-added a citation needed tag to the sentence in question: if you want to claim that science has shown efficacy, better citations are needed; if you did not mean to claim that, the sentence should be reworded <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_m_72a2.html" title="User:Jon m">Jon m</a> 13:09, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd also be reluctant to add more to the article (though not sure is Ama is notable in the first place - deleting the Ama article would be one option, or perhaps cutting it down to a short sentence for inclusion in the ayurveda article?) More subtopics is a good idea, although perhaps moving 'history' or 'development' of ayurverda to another page would be a better idea - imo, one of the most notable aspects of ayurveda is how widely practiced it is (and it would therefore be important to keep info on current status, practice and criticisms of ayurveda in the main article) <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_m_72a2.html" title="User:Jon m">Jon m</a> 19:07, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Debbe, feel free to have a go at revising this for NPOV and referencing it. However, in its current form I think it needs to go - there's no point in removing unsuitable content from this article, just to put in in a new wikipedia article, in my opinion <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_m_72a2.html" title="User:Jon m">Jon m</a> 22:40, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This section has, for quite a while now, made strong medical claims for ayurvda and not provided adequate references. I'd argue that either proper references (e.g. to peer-reviewed journal articles describing blind [RCT]) need to be provided, or this section needs to have the unreferenced claim removed: wikipedia shouldn't make claims re. medical benefits which can't be backed up. <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_m_72a2.html" title="User:Jon m">Jon m</a></p>

<dd>Another reminder - it has been a week or so since I asked about this. If this isn't revised in accordance with <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable_sources</a>, I'd suggest removing the offending claims in a week or so. If anyone wants to revise this before then, that'd be great, or if anyone wants more time to work on this let me know&#160;:) <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_m_72a2.html" title="User:Jon m">Jon m</a> 17:10, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have already written a complaint in this page that some unidentify users particularly of the red links, are creating unnecessary arguments without understanding the subjects matters. These peoples are creating disturbances for dusturbances, opposition for opposition, vulgarity for vulgarity. There is no creativity or positiveness in their arguments. <b>I will request to wikipedia officials that they should take some hard steps against these nonsense creating peoples.</b></p>

<p>- Hang on 'debbe' - I'm as (un)identified as you are. Anyway, it's wikipedia policy that articles should be verifiable: see <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>. I checked to find any reliable sources for certain claims, couldn't find any, and am therefore asking that the more significant claims are either verified or removed. It's very undesirable - and potentially dangerous - for an encyclopedia to include unverifiable (and therefore perhaps false) medical claims <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_m_72a2.html" title="User:Jon m">Jon m</a></p>

<p>I have seen in Ayurveda page along with the other so many Wikipedia articles pages that many editors are doing blunder corrections. In my opinion, these editors are not having well recieved knowledge about the subject matters and thus their editing capability is doubtful.It is like that a Ph.D. student's capability is examined by the High school student or a High school student is guiding spacecraft engineers, how they should take precautions to moove on the Saturn's surface.</p>

<dd>I am completely in favour of your view. But the fact is fact and this should not be ignored.I will appreciate to the editors, if they will try to make the Ayurveda pages more encyclopeadic. The article is a haphazardous, irregular, unsequential collection of information. It does not look encyclopeadic due to corrections.<a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDebbe_53e3.html" title="User:Debbe">user:debbe</a>, 22 January 2007, 12:20 UTC</dd>

<dd>I think a lot of the problem is that there's too much on the page, and most of it's unreferenced. This makes it much harder to edit - it's hard to figure out what's relevent and what isn't. Cutting down the section would be a good idea, but it's hard to figure out what to cut... <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_m_72a2.html" title="User:Jon m">Jon m</a> 22:34, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/y/u/Talk%7EAyurveda_c920.html" title="Edit section: Ayurveda and  Infectious diseases">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ayurveda and Infectious diseases</span></h2>
<p>There is great controversy in modern time that Ayurveda have no mention of Bacteriology as it is talks in the sense of Modern western medicine. In the main page of the Ayurveda questions have been raised about the Bacteria, infections etc. Let us see that Bacteriology came in existence after the invention of microscope. Microscope in invented by a French person, who was a “Kabari” , round about 200 years ago. Bacteriology came in existence round about 100 years ago. Before that no mention of Bacterial causes disease in any pathology or physiology books or practice of medicine except few like Malaria. Clinical pathology and testing of blood, urine etc. came in existence within 100 years.</p>
<p>Those who are raising questions, they should go for the history of Ayurveda, how much it is old. Scientist say that tiny creatures was in existence since thousands of thousands years, when earth separated from the celestial body. Ayurveda came in proper existence after the collection of the experiences gained by the practice in different part of the land some how before 5000 years. When writing came in existence, this collection was written on the wood, metal, leaves, stones and finally on paper. Earlier to it, the knowledge was transferred by memorizing the youngsters by the teachers.</p>
<p>One should go with a serious thinking before commenting Ayurveda, how this scientific knowledge was saved by the Indians. Why people forget the invasion history by the foreigners. This is a fact which should not be forgotten. These hurdles in view of the scientific progress, development and researches in Ayurveda, should not be over looked by anyone. In between these high crisis situations, Ayurveda was alive because of the Ayurveda have provided the living style, the life style, which every Indian has adopted since centuries even today.</p>
<p>If anybody will go with the literature of the Ayurveda classical, he will find the mention of some hidden creatures, like fungus, spores that can damage the human system under the Bhut Vidya and Vish vigyan [Agad Tantra]. It seems that at that time the sharp vision of the Ayurvedic practitioners observed that there is some factors which damages the normal health. These Ayurvedic practitioners naturally shall have the capacity to invent and recognize the bacteria and bacterial originated diseases, if they have invented microscope in their time.</p>
<p>However these Ayurvedicians have given foolproof treatment to over ride the consequences as result of bacterial infections with a concept of total cure. If anybody talk of the infectious disease conditions, they should first go to study seriously Bhut Vidya, Kay chikitsa and Visha Vigyan. They will get the answer as they want.</p>

<p>Ayurveda, the Indian System of Medicine have so many advantages to cure of certain surgical disease conditions, where Modern Western Medicine suggests only surgical interventions. These Surgical conditions are may be as under:</p>
<ul>
<li>1-Glands, Adenoids, Lymph adenoids, Tumors, cysts etc</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2-Sinusitis, Nasal Polypus, fleshy growth inside the nose</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>3-Tonsillitis, suppurative tonsillitis, pus pockets in mucous surfaces, sub-mucous ulcers, Oral ulcers, Vocal cord problems, throat problems, initial stage of Leucoplakia cheeks etc.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>4-Lungs disorders which require surgery</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>5-Some nature of cardiac problems including Blood Clotting of cardiac arteries</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>6-Articular joints, Joints which deposited calcium etc</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>7-Kidney problems including raised serum creatinine, Renal Calculus of any size, calcium deposit in kidney, Gall Bladder calculus below 5 mm, sludge deposits, cholecystitis,</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>8-Some kinds of cancer</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>9-Ulcers, Abscess, which are not healing</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>10-Benign or malignant stage of disease</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>11-Uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes problems, salpingitis etc</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>12-After surgical intervention, those diseases are not relieved or cured and reappear again</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>13-Those diseases which require treatment after surgery</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>14-If your surgeon prefer for a disease condition which require surgery, before that it is better to consult an Ayurvedician. There is so many conditions which can be cured or treated by the Ayurvedic medicines</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
In my 40 years of Ayurvedic, Homoeopathic and Modern Western Medicine [Allopathy] practice, I have observed that many conditions, which require surgery according to the opinion of Surgeons, can be treated successfully by Ayurvedic medicines. But Ayurvedic treatment needs very skill, experienced and expert hand. Novices or those who have little experience in the Ayurvedic practice, may feel difficulty to cure these disease conditions.</p>
