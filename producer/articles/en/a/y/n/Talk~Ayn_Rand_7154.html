<p>If this page ever gets opened up again for editing, a sentence we need to address is the following, from the section where Rand's dislike of Kant is discussed. " It is not in fact clear that Kant would have disagreed with such a weak formulation of realism." I think this is a rather weak representation of Kant's philosophy versus Rand's. If we are to be "balanced," given the savage nature of Rand's attack on Kant (calling him a monster, etc) it would be more NPOV to make it clear that Kant isn't exactly what Rand claims (or rather, thinks) that he is.</p>
<p>I have my own opinions as to why Rand is so anti-Kant (to me its pretty clear that she came to his philosophy through the German idealists, who Kant wasn't overly fond of, she hadn't read the primary sources, and she conflated the german term "kritik" with the english term "criticize)but my opinions as to the source of Rand's anti-Kantian bias are irrelevant. The fact of the matter is that Rand, in her works, misquotes and misargues Kant in a dreadful way, and that needs to be drawn out more. There's a lot of talk around here about citations, so here are some:</p>
<p>From Rand's "Philosophy: who needs it?"-</p>
<p>"I can't prove it, but I feel that it's true." You got it from Kant. Or: "It's logical, but logic has nothing to do with reality." You got it from Kant. Or: "It's evil, because it's selfish." You got it from Kant."</p>
<p>The problem with Rand's attack here on Kant is not that it lacks subtlety or misinterprets the philospher's meaning (as her attacks on Hume do), but that, it is simply untrue, or false at the root of it. I hate to use such an inflammatory word, but Rand here is lying. Kant never did, and never would, make the statements or express the toughts that Rand attributes to him. KAnt is, despite Rand's claims that he is anti-rational, to a great degree the father of modern rational inquiry.</p>
<p>Kant is a tough read. I know because I spent a great deal of time at University reading him, and he is perhaps, in terms of grammatical construction and whatnot, the most torturous and truly German of philosophers. Nevertheless, it does not excuse Rand from her duty of reading Kant before she criticizes him. It is very clear, from even a cursory examination of the Critique of Pure Reason, that Kant is <i>not</i> anti-rational. This is from the <i><b>first paragraph</b></i> of the work.</p>
<p>"Time was, when [Human Reason] was the queen of all the sciences; and, if we take the will for the deed, she certainly deserves, so far as regards the high importance of her object-matter, this title of honour."</p>
<p>Additionally, the word "critique" in the title does not mean "attack", but rather, the critical application of reason to the esamination of reason itself.</p>
<p>The most egregious of Rand's misquotations is the claim that Kant would say "I can't prove it, but I <i>feel</i> [italics added] that it's true. (cited from above work by Rand). Compare this to what Kant <i>actually</i> says in The Critique of Pure Reason:</p>
<p>"As regards certitude , I have fully convinced myself that, in this sphere of thought, <b>opinion is perfectly inadmissible</b>, and that <b>everything which bears the least semblance of an hypothesis must be excluded</b>, as of no value in such discussions. "</p>
<p>It doesn't get any clearer than this. And I think this <i>must</i> be brought out within the text of the main article. Rand's "Kant is a monster" contrasted witht he article's "Kant might not agree with Rand" is horribly weak.<a href="../../../p/9/7/User%7EP97dav45_1659.html" title="User:P97dav45">P97dav45</a> 12:55, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

Most of what is said above seems like original research to me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Rand's "Kant is a monster" contrasted with the article's "Kant might not agree with Rand" is horribly weak."</p>

<p>I agree. On the other hand I don't see a simple solution to this problem unless someone has a scholarly criticism of Rand's treatment of Kant that can be referenced. 24.17.165.124 02:52, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

This isn't original research- it's a simple reading of the source material. If simly quoting a text counts as original research we have a serious problem with making any claims at all in Wikipedia. Kant's writing say what they say, so do Rand's. Why not just insert a quote from the critique? <a href="../../../p/9/7/User%7EP97dav45_1659.html" title="User:P97dav45">P97dav45</a></p>

A "serious third party source?" Why do you need a third party source when you are quoting text? Do I need yet another source to verify that source? further removal from a primary source weakens the "chain of evidence" it does not make it stronger. Kant says what he says, and Objectivists have a hard time dealing with that. Because (as the article you mentioned above makes clear) they have to go through torturous psuedo-exegesis of Kant to make it appear as though Rand hasn't made a mistake. That's strange in of itself (is Rand like Jesus? If so, that's curious. Why not simply place, in the article (after Rand's attack) "however, Kant's work XXX states ZZZ." If that makes Rand look bad, well, tough. <a href="../../../p/9/7/User%7EP97dav45_1659.html" title="User:P97dav45">P97dav45</a> 15:41, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How do you know that Rand and Kant use the same definition of reason? They don't, by the way. A single quote is entirely insufficient to prove contradiction. Kant uses words in a very explicitly defined fashion, and these are in many cases different definitions than those that Rand uses. That matters when comparing them. Kant's work as a whole and Rand's work as a whole do require expert analysis before one can draw conclusions about contradictions in this regard. Philosophy is more complicated than a series of quotes. <a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuadpe_b5ef.html" title="User:Huadpe">Huadpe</a> 04:49, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One thing that is not mentioned in the article is why Rand and her _______ (fill in whatever you like: sect, or philosophy, or whatever) are the subject of so much disagreement and controversy among so many? Just look at this discussion page for proof. I mean, in a certain sense she at least had the power to create something that has us here disagreeing about her. Relative to what she achieved while alive, compared to other famous (or infamous) people, I find a bit surprising the amount of passion she can still stir both from the pro and from the anti camps. Shouldn't we mention this in the article? <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnagnorisis_ce78.html" title="User:Anagnorisis"><font color="#FF3300"><i><b>Anagnorisis</b></i></font></a> 00:29, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Rand advocated the individual as the final arbiter of reality, so I find it quite humorous when an organization such as Wikipedia, based on encyclopedic concepts of multitudes of individuals, has such a hard time defining (outlining, delineating, etcetera) her and her philosophy. It is a resounding indictment of her success in forming her ideas. I think Rand would be happiest (if somehow miraculously still alive) if this organization abstained from defining her and her work any other way than leaving the names of her books under her name, possibly a picture and dates of birth and death. Of course, most others will not agree with me as the beloved majority rule must be observed. ~RJM</p>
<p><b>Reply: We are not amused</b>. Ayn Rand advocated the exact opposite of the amusing nonsense: "the individual as the final arbiter of reality." Rand's unique philosophic motto is: "Existence exists." That is, <b>independent</b> of any individual(s). Just as we need to flesh out criteria, criterion by criterion, in debating specific issues in Rand, we need to refer to Rand's actual text, specific piece for piece, in terms of running commentary. Too many clearly seem not to know anything of Rand's actual text. AOluwatoyin 08:25, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Finally you admit sources count. Now, could you please use actual MLA citations to point them out instead of the Rand-esque, academically weak "see this piece for more info"?</dd>
<dd>Also, I'd like to note that "existence exists" is hardly a unique phrase. Any idiot could throw two similar words side by side. All of Rand's supposedly brilliant short anti-thoughts ("Existence exists", "A is A", etc) were far from profound, only showing her disdain for actual thought, as all of them essentially said "don't think about anything deeply; what you see is all you get". -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 17:28, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"'Reply: Re: We are not amused'" If the individual does not decide (arbitrate) what is presented by existence existing, who will? A corollary of existence existing is that each existing informed mind must think for itself. So, perhaps you thought I meant that the individual is the final 'creator' of reality. This is not so. Regardless of how fleshed out your criteria becomes, criterion by criterion, I must still have to agree with the content of this organizations decisions on who Rand is and what she left to posterity. If I didn't do so, acting as the final arbitrator of my existence (or my interaction within reality) who will? Existence and existents hold the validity (or lack thereof) of my perceptions, my concepts, my decisions, consequences of my ethics, etc. Not Wikipedia. Certainly not you who thinks such a thought nonsense. And I have all her texts, I'm quite aware of her ideas. Making assumptions without checking on premises is what landed Rand's page in this editing nightmare. Also, Rand didn't form the thought Existence exists (existence qua existence) or A is A, Aristotle did. She resurrected the import of the phrase and logically extended the consequences. Its been fun. ~RJM</p>
<p><b>Warning and Reply to LGagnon</b>: I don't know what you mean by "sources." Again, Rand is unique in demanding rigorous, objective standards. "Sources" are not made equal.</p>
<p>I am going to issue a warning to you in terms of how you continually employ ugly juvenile terms like "idiot" in the context of academic discourse.

<p><b>Reply to ~RJM and further reply to LGagnon:</b> Existence exists is not merely Aristotelian. It extends and deepens the genre. It is a call to metaphysical primacy ("A is A" is not merely logical for Rand) that does not reduce to primacy of the senses (empiricism). We must not confuse "tools of cognition," how we come to know, with what we come to know and that we <i>do</i> come to know.</p>
<p>Rand goes beyond the matter of who comes to know (rational men). Her focus is on <b>how rational men ratiocinate</b>, the symbiotics of perception and conception. AOluwatoyin 08:30, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>For some strange reason, the "is she or is she not a philosopher" issue managed to get sorted out satisfactorily on the main "Objectivism" page, though not without similar discussion. Just to repeat: if the question is about the content of the texts, as opposed to some group's perception of them, there is no question that she is a philosopher. I don't even think that most academic philosophers would disagree with that classification. What they would say is that she's not a very <i>good</i> philosopher. We ought not to use "real" and "good" as synonyms, even implicitly. The best characterization I've seen anywhere by an objective source is Richard Posner in <i>Public Intellectuals, A Study in Decline</i>, where he classifies her as a <i>nonacademic public intellectual</i> (and claims that she is one of the four most influential of such since WW2, with Betty Friedan, Rachel Carson and William F. Buckley, none of whom I would describe as philosophers). An argument could be made that partitions AS into fiction, FNI into intellectual history (tricky, since it is philosophy's history), and all the other essays into political advocacy or cultural criticism. But that would still leave ITOE and the first essay in VOS. They are nothing if not philosophy: what nonphilosophical genre discusses the problem of universals in Plato and Aristotle? Or the Is-Ought problem in ethics? There's no escaping it by any reasonable standard. And the proof is that Nozick refuted her take on the latter in an academic philosophy journal article, "On the Randian Argument." How is it possible to be a professor of philosophy at Harvard, refute a philosophical argument in a philosophical journal, and not be talking about <i>philosophy</i>? And if it is philosophy, wouldn't that make the author a philosopher? Seems like a no-brainer to me. Bad does not equal nonexistent. <i>Routledge Encyc. Phil.</i> put it this way: she's in, she has an entry, and the entry says she's no good. That, BTW, is about as standard standard reference material can get, yes?</p>
<p>And BTW, if you want to really get the edit wars started, list "Marx" as an influence. I would (and have the credentials to be a reputable source if uncloaked), and so would one of the leading (damn near only) published academic press Rand scholars, Chris Sciabarra. The parallels are extensive. And, BTW, most would classify Marx as a philosopher, though I think that such a classification raises exactly the same problems to the same extent as here.</p>
<p>As for the LeVay thing, I don't know if we're past it, but if it stays, I'm heading over to the Hegel entry and adding "Mussolini" as "influenced by", which is also true, and ever so helpful in all sorts of unspoken ways. I appreciate LGag's efforts a lot--we need balance--but what I want is balanced balance, not this endless teeter-tottering between what seems to me contrary POVs. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_Cooper_70dd.html" title="User:Agent Cooper">Agent Cooper</a> 17:23, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As one source pointed out (it was either in this talk page or another Rand-related one), there are academics who do consider her work to be pseudophilosophy. This, at the very least, should be mentioned. And given that such varying views exist, would it not be POV to assert that, beyond a shadow of a doubt, she is a philosopher? I do not intend to remove any and all claims that she is one, but to balance the article by showing that there is a dispute over whether or not she deserves the title. You may find some sources that consider her merely a bad philosopher, but other sources will claim she doesn't even deserve that. I think that these opinions deserve to be balanced, not treated in a way that makes the article contradictory. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 14:00, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Now we're getting somewhere. Yes, you can say that some people say that she's not a real philosopher; again, sourcing this is going to be difficult in the same way that sourcing the general academic lack of enthusiasm was difficult (though we got there in the end!). Most academic philosophers have a kind of tacit idea of what is and is not philosophy, though none can define it, and most proposed definitions would be rejected. There are clear cases: I think that almost all academic philosophers would say that <i>Conversations With God</i> is not philosophy. There are certain areas where for historical or political reasons, something may be included that would otherwise not be included--for example, in the past decade or so, some introductory philosophy classes have begun to add Native American religious texts. Almost no academic philosophers would regard these as philosophical texts if they were written by anyone other than who they are written by. But that aside, I think that there is very little disagreement about what is in and what is out. Now there is a secondary phenomenon which is not uncommon, in which, for example, Analytics may say about some instance of Continental philosophy that it isn't really philosophy (though oddly, this is seldom reciprocated--the response is more like "Analytic philosophy is shallow"). But in almost every prominent instance, there will also be people saying that the figure is a philosopher, is good and is important. I think that everyone understands that when these kinds of discussions go on, the upshot is that everyone agrees that the figure is doing something that resembles something another "canonical" figure has done, but that they are disagreeing on whether it is being done well or importantly. In these kinds of cases, however, the horse is out of the barn and there is a debate over whether someone should go fetch the horse. The Rand situation is different. First, the amount of discussion is dead minimal--despite some change on this front, the presence of Rand on campus is mostly due to students. To the extent that there is non-Objectivist talk about Rand, though, I think that Rachels is probably representative: he knows that some of his students will be Objectivists, and he knows that they have views and arguments which are philosophical in character, but which prevent them from being receptive to anything else, so these arguments must be rebutted early or else no further teaching can happen. So he rebuts the arguments, in a standard philosophy textbook. Now that's not by itself dispositive, because I will admit that that kind of phenomenon involves a kind of shading off into darkness--a textbook will sometimes address an argument widely accepted but SO bad that philosophers won't see it as something to *discuss* so much as to warn against. I think I would characterize Intelligent Design this way: almost no one in science thinks that it reaches the starting gate of being worthy of consideration qua science, but feel that because it gets considered by students and the public anyway, there needs to be a hygenic discussion to undo its influence. And yet very few people would say that ID is *therefore* science because a scientist discusses it in his professional capacity.</p>
<p>So my question is: how should Rand be thought of? How is Rand thought of? And I guess if I'm talking only about perceptions and not what I personally think, I guess I'd say that it's closer to indeterminate--the response by analytic philosophers is akin to their response to continentals whom they themselves concede are philosophers but not their sort. But the response of continentals is that she's just pro-capitalist ideology akin to the writings of Newt Gingrich. And the response of the faculty who must do duty with intro ethics courses is that she's something akin to ID--you don't quite want to say that it is in but bad, but you don't quite want to say it's out and hence not relevant. And there there's the very small handful who think that all these responses are just biased, that she has something interesting and different to say worth considering. I think my comments have been *normative*--I think that she should be treated exactly the same way that many Continentals are because objectively, she's no worse than most of them, but that she doesn't because of the Left bias of Continentals. Conversely, if the Analytic way of thinking her beyond the pale prevails, well pretty much all Continental philosophy has to go too (which to me is a kind of reductio).</p>
<p>But our problem, now that I see more clearly where you are coming from, is ambiguous. I think it's a *fact* that she's a philosopher, and *maybe* a fact that most academics view her as somewhere in between being not a philosopher and being a philosopher so bad that you don't want to deal with her except hygenically with undergrads. And my first claim makes me think that we just say that in articles because isn't the reporting of fact what is at issue? Whereas you, I take it, are saying that for me to say that is something akin to violating the "original research" rule, and that we must start from the social consensus about how to classify her because in effect that is what we are reporting when we report that she is or is not a philosopher. Here's a possible analogy. There are Southerners who believe that the the 14th Amendment was never properly ratified. Most people think they are loony-tunes, no one agrees, no one will ever agree. Suppose that on closer examination, we see that all reasonable people would have to agree that it really wasn't ratified. But this observation goes nowhere because our whole system of government presupposes that it was, and no one dares even say that it wasn't out loud. And then we're working on an article that contains a sentence "the 14th Amendment says that..." and our imaginary Southerner says "this is a factual error, because it was never really ratified," and you say "well, the reference stays in but we can add a section called "Ratification Controversy" if you like. And they say "well great, but we still can't refer to the 14th Amendment because actually, there isn't one." This would be something of a pickle, because usually expert and consensus opinion is pretty close to the truth.</p>
<p>So I'm actually at something of a loss here, in part because I don't know how to think about Wikipedia's own intentions. I want to say that because it is a fact that she is a bad philosopher widely rejected by academia for her badness, we should just *say* that. But I realize that that is perhaps not quite how the academic consensus would characterize things, and that some, but not all, would probably say that she's not really a philosopher any more than UFO abduction stories are science. And if we ever sorted all *that* out (good luck!) then there's the source problem: as an inside observer, I know exactly what goes down and why, but no one is on *record* about what goes down, so it's damned difficult to get anywhere near even the truth about the disagreement without there too straying into original research.</p>

<dd>Just wanted to say that this is an impressively substantive analysis, and fits well with what I see from the inside also. I think it's also sad that the article is now locked and littered with loud tags at the top. I appreciate LGagnon's efforts to make the article NPOV -- my own main contribution to the article has been writing and defending the Philosophical Criticism section -- but I think this needs to be done in a less militant way.

<p><b>Reply to LGagnon</b>: Please note that throughout I corrected neither your appalling grammar nor your disgraceful typos.

<p>I made no reference to Hegel or Kant. You provide no specific citation from Rand. Once again, you conflate my view with someone else's entry.</p>

<dd>And the quote about Hegel and Kant was from one of Rand's books. That is what she assumes, in her considerably poor scholarship, to be an appropriate citation (even though she'd be laughed out of academia if she tried to get that published with them).

<p><b>Reply to Agent Cooper.</b> Please do not conflate "influenced by" with "influenced." That Rand was influenced by Marx is no more problematic than that she was influenced by Nietzsche. Or, Kant, for that matter. AOluwatoyin 03:02, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You've completely lost me. Karl Marx died before Ayn Rand was born. How have I confused before with after? I don't even know what you're talking about. Once we get that sorted out, I meant that she was influenced by in the more specific sense of "indebted to, learned from and as a result has similar ideas as."

<p><b>Reply to Agent Cooper</b>: Again, "influenced by" is not problematic. Again, Rand readily acknowledges "influenced by" (e.g; Nietzsche) so long as this does not intimate "agrees with."</p>
<p>"Influenced" is a problem, precisely because it non-cognitively, (some scholars would argue, cognitively) intimates agreement or some sort of "shared" core belief/view, as opposed to something that could be as weak (loose generic) as "shared opposition to institutional theism."

<p>Under the heading Gender, Race, and Sex is a reference to a line in Atlas Shrugged: "In Atlas Shrugged, Rand writes that the 'band on the wrist of [Dagny's] naked arm gave her the most feminine of all aspects: the look of being chained.' (One must note that this description is from the character Lillian Rearden, whose views certainly are not intended to reflect those of Ayn Rand.)" This is erroneous. The passage is Rand's narrative and is most assuredly NOT Lillian Reardon's dialogue.````Fourchette</p>

<p>In the literary criticism section there are a few examples of protagonists which are, contrary to assumed conceptions, flawed. This is the excerpt:</p>
<p>"Further, defenders of Rand's novels have noted that many of her heroes are far from flawless, and that not all are wealthy. They note that Rearden, the Wet Nurse, and Fred Kinnan suffer due to either moral flaws or errors in reasoning [4]; further, they point out that not all of the villains in Rand's novels are weak and pathetic: Ellsworth Toohey is portrayed as a masterful communicator, critic, and manipulator, while Robert Stadler is a brilliant scientist."</p>
<p>I think that Eddie Willers should be added into this evidence; however, he isn't included in the source from which the other examples are. It'd be possible to list him separately from the others, with the citation being a specific quote from Atlas Shrugged. The quote is in a dialog between Francisco d'Anconia and, IIRC, Hank Rearden. Francisco states that Eddie does not have the ability or competence to achieve what others have, but he has no sense of entitlement, and tries his hardest to adhere to similar Objectivist principles as Francisco and Rearden.</p>
<p>In essence this dialog portrays Eddie as a flawed being, with no implied inferiority to the speakers.</p>

<p>I still haven't heard a good explaination for why we keep on removing Alan Greenspan, Anton LaVey, Terry Goodkind, and Steve Ditko from the Influenced list.

<dd>Based on the edit summary, the reason was to keep the list confined to philosophers.

<dd>no, it is a question of what you actually do for a living. if you are primarily paid to be a philosopher or make your living through philosophy then you are a professional philosopher, if you make your living primarily in other ways then you are a lay philosopher. they are both philosopher, but of which sort. for instance, George Orwell is a lay philosopher as was Dostoyevsky.--<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBuridan_23f5.html" title="User:Buridan">Buridan</a> 14:38, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Do we limit the designation "philosopher" (the non-lay type, that is) to one who works full-time within an academic institution? That seems too narrow. But would we require that she publish in peer-reviewed journals? Possibly. The situtation has changed since pre-Socratic days... even since Locke's day. A philosopher now is expected to demonstrate familiarity with quite an expanse of the thought that went before, as well as great care and rigor in developing her own contributions. Rand made strong and original contributions; I think the question is whether she showed enough respect (I almost said "deference") for her predecessors in the process that she be considered to belong to the "main line" of philosophy, whatever that may be. I would say that many philosophers, good and bad among them, have believed their own insights so astounding and their elaboration of them so definitive that they find little of what came before worthy of consideration. We aren't talking about the Supreme Court -- in philosophy, a certain degree of freedom from constraining ancestors can be a positive thing. It makes sense to place Rand in the Non-academic category, but it is perhaps unfair to the vigor, insight and consistency of her philosophic writings to call her a "lay" philosopher, especially since professionals debate her ideas seriously. --<a href="../../../p/h/e/User%7EPheidias_172d.html" title="User:Pheidias">Pheidias</a> 22:00, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>few professionals debate her, i think the last count was something under 50, though we should probably check that again. given the size of the profession worldwide, it was a relatively tiny number. we should also note here that outside of the u.s. her recognition is much less.--<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBuridan_23f5.html" title="User:Buridan">Buridan</a> 23:42, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How is she not a professional philosopher? She studied philosophy at university. Furthermore, she produced many nonfiction philosophical works. The Virtue of Selfishness is an undeniable work of philosophy, as was Philosophy: Who Needs It?. The claims that Ayn Rand was not a real philosopher are simply perpetrated and perpetuated by disagreeing 'critics'. Give evidence and sources that contradict her being a real philosopher, and then we can go from there. Until that happens, please stop posting your opinions as if they were fact.</p>
<p>"we should also note here that outside of the u.s. her recognition is much less." No, we shouldn't. If that were the case, then we should also note that Kant is not recognized in the US. It's a matter of culture. It's assumed that people with more socialist regimes, like Europe, will not agree with a capitalistic philosopher, such as Ayn Rand. It's implicit, and does not need to be expressed explicitly.</p>
<p>I disagree with the last part. We should note that she is less well known outside North America (if we can cite it, though it seems obvious). More people in the US know of a socialist like Chomsky than of Rand, so the culture angle doesn't really work. In response to Buridan, Rand is debated enough to have scholarly journals and books on her philosophy, so 50 seems entirely too low. <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELaszloWalrus_c9d2.html" title="User:LaszloWalrus">LaszloWalrus</a> 05:04, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Of course she is less known outside of North America. It's IMPLICIT. It doesn't need to be stated. Do I need to keep making analogies? Abraham Lincoln is less well known outside of the US.

<p>LGagnon, why do you go from saying that Ayn Rand developed an "ideology" to saying that she was a "lay philosopher"? It's becoming clear that your only interest in this matter is lowering Rand's prestige, not developing the article. --165.234.117.82</p>

<dd>Another personal attack from the anti-logic crowd. Don't you just love how Rand's use of fallacies have rubbed off on her followers? Glad to know Jimbo lets his fellow Randists get away with whatever they want to do, policies be damned.</dd>
<dd>And if you guys didn't delete my sources, I'd use them to fix the whitewashing you've done to the article. However, this is not a NPOV encyclopedia, it's a Randist POV one, and Jimbo and his servants aren't about to change that.

<dd>Also, LGagnon, if you're looking for a scholarly book on the subject of Ayn Rand published by professional philosophers, I would recommend <i>The Philosophic Thought of Ayn Rand</i>, edited by by Douglas J. Uyl and Douglas B. Rasmussen. Some contributors include philosophers Erik Mack, Anthony Flew, Wallace Matson, J. Charles King, and Tibor Machan. In the introduction, the editors state that each of the contributors agrees that "Rand was a philosopher, not a mere popularizer." And while some articles are somewhat favorable or completely neutral, a few are very critical. So, LGagnon, to say that academia has completely ignored Rand is absolutely false.</dd>
<dd>It's also fallacious to say, as you do, that only Objectivists refer to Rand as a philosopher. Consult Britannica Encyclopedia and The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Even Michael Huemer, who is highly critical of Ayn Rand, referred to Objectivism as a "philosophy."</dd>
<dd>So, you can keep trying to de-neutralize this article to attack Rand, but fortunately facts will have the last word. --165.234.117.82</dd>

<p>LGagnon's charge that Rand did not get a degree is spurious; in Russia at the time, "certificate" = degree, much like (for example) a bachelor's degree is undergraduate in some contexts, and graduate in others. <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELaszloWalrus_c9d2.html" title="User:LaszloWalrus">LaszloWalrus</a> 19:20, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>or it is a sign that the standards of doctoral research in philosophy are being severely degraded.... or it is a sign that there is at least one blue mouse.... or it is a sign that..... hmmm. anyway the point is that one book or 30 books does not really make one a philosopher, what makes one recognized as a philosopher, a professional philosopher, is your participation in the profession.

<dd>don't be daft, no one has done that math, though I assure you that if you really want me to go to the philosopher index and show once again that in most fields where people think she is relevent she is less relevent than some noted novelist, i surely can. that one or 30 people have published a work on here, the key is that only one noted philosopher did anything with her work and that is generally looked on poorly. i'm not sure who the rest are, frequently they are also philosophers outside of philosophy, but there are apparently enough to publish a book or two. however, in terms of editorial review, whose to say the actual merits of that publishing over time. are the secondary literatures on rand's philosophy selling well?--<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBuridan_23f5.html" title="User:Buridan">Buridan</a> 18:54, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It seems that you simply have a low opinion of her work and worth, and so disingenuously promote these patronizing pinpricks (such as "lay" and "actor").

What exactly did she fail to do which disqualifies her from membership in the (very large) club of philosophers?

<p>the argument that i'm making in the lines is this, presenting rand as primarily a philosopher is disputed even on her own page in footnotes. as best as we have been able to determine in the philosophy discussions, she is more widely recognized as a novelist or literary figure than as a philosopher. to present her either primarily as a novelist or primarily as a philosopher is to present something that is not neutral, therefor to be neutral, we should choose a way of listing her professions that is neutral. there are two that come to mind, one is alphabetical, and the other is by income. her novels greatly outsell her philosophical works, and it is likely that her screenwriting/playwriting also earned more money, though we would need to do the research. due to lack of research, alphabetical is the way left to be neutral.--<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBuridan_23f5.html" title="User:Buridan">Buridan</a> 15:15, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think listing her as a novelist first is appropriate. The Ayn Rand Institute calls her novelist/philosopher, and her novels outsell her philosophy books by quite a bit. Also, Rand initially considered being a novelist her primary interest, using philosophy as a means of creating in her own mind the values she wanted to project. <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELaszloWalrus_c9d2.html" title="User:LaszloWalrus">LaszloWalrus</a> 17:15, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It goes without saying that Ayn Rand would see disrespect in placing her "day job" work alongside her life's work.

<p>To my knowledge, the most acting Rand ever did was as an extra — hardly notable.

A blind follower is precisely what my philosophy condemns and what I reject. Objectivism is not a mystic cult."

<dd>There are plenty of cases of Fans behaving in cultish ways. Do you really think this is NOT the case? Regarding Rand/Objectivism, plenty of "Objectivists" have behaved in cultish ways. The point Rand made was that she expected people to think for themselves. She didn't attempt to control people, other than saying that she wouldn't associate with or deal with people who behaved a certain way or held certain beleifs. You may think Rand's ideas suck, but the cult claim is laughable when compared with her own statements and actions, and the actions taken by actual cult leaders. They are as different as night and day. This is not a real critique of Rand. If Rand's comments and actions regarding not being a cult don't matter, then why do Rothbard's claims matter? It's enough to say that he made that claim and cite the source. The whole alleged-cult-leader category is meaningless and should be removed from wikipedia, or more carefully defined. Otherwise it becomes a a case where anyone can claim someone is a cult leader and any comments to the negative by the target are treated as meaningless. It's a POV smear category that holds no value whatsoever.

<p>There's specific criteria for Rand being an alleged cult leader, and she fits it. It doesn't matter if she denies it; all cult leaders stand to gain from denial of cult activity, and thus all would do so. The point isn't whether they are one or not, but that they are accused of such. Rand has been accused, and fits Wikipedia's criteria to count as an alleged cult leader. This may bother Randists, but that's tough; it's a fact that she's been accused, and you can not erase that fact from existence just because it makes you uncomfortable. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 00:43, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That is a very poor argument LGagnon. Very very subjective and POV. All I need to do is find one person calling someone something and then they are it? Face it, you and Buridan are not interested in documenting criticism, you are anti-Rand and simply wish to attach anything you think will make her look bad. I've said in numerous places that keeping criticism is important, but you are over the line, and appear to me to be on a POV campaign. It's time to stop.

<p>I just removed the category "leader of alleged cult." There are basically four main interpretations: journalistic (tends to be sensational), theological (defines "cult" by some standard of orthodox truth), sociological (uses "cult" to describe groups that self-consciously oppose the mainstream of culture), and psychological (uses a standard of psychological manipulation and coercion) <a href="http://www.spiritwatch.org/cultdef.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.spiritwatch.org/cultdef.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. What counts as a cult differs by these varying definitions. obviously, but Objectivism doesn't seem to me to fit any of the four categories. The fact that someone <i>labelled</i> it a cult -- which is indeed mentioned in the article, yes -- does not make it a justified allegation, particularly if the accuser(s) didn't back it up with any evidence whatsoever other than their opinion. I can call Islam or Christianity or Judaism a cult if I feel like it, that doesn't mean you could out "Leader of alleged cult" on the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> article. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookgrrl_63e2.html" title="User:Bookgrrl">Bookgrrl</a> 02:25, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>hmm, not quite, the key is in having a reputable source. In terms of Rand, the source is the New York Times. The key to rejecting this will be with one of two arguments. Either Rand cannot be the leader of the cult because she is dead and most accepted norms of leadership outside of cults don't accept that leaders can be dead(however, i think this will fail because there is ample evidence that in cults, death does not prevent leadership of a sort), or changing the criteria on alleged cults. What we have to be careful with and you'll see this all throughout wikipedia in regards to rand is that there seems to be a tendency to act without and against verifiable evidence, and even with that there seems to be a strong tendency to revert/delete materials that are critical of rand/objectivism in any way. There is also a tendency to put up highly questionable pro-rand pov's, so we need to keep in mind the principle of neutrality and evidence. In the case of the cult status, the article itself mentions it, so it should be included.--<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBuridan_23f5.html" title="User:Buridan">Buridan</a> 13:55, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry to come to this discussion late, but I can't understand the purpose of stating that objectivism is considered by some a cult activity on the Ayn Rand page. Shouldn't that be addressed only on the objectivist page itself? On Wiki's cult pages (which are a mess), where Rand is referenced, it looks like her critics were pointing out that the author herself had/has something of a cult of personality status among some followers of the school of thought. But that's a far cry from the philosophy itself from being cultish. I mean, how can a form of reason or philosophy itself be cultish? It's nonsensical. 66.57.225.77 07:49, 12 December 2006 (UTC) DEL</p>

<p>The article currently paints a picture of her as rather distant from philosophy as an academic field. While this was true of her personally (she rarely engaged with it), it's not my impression that it's true of the current state of things. It's certainly true that many philosophers disagree with her views, and that many don't engage with her writing, but that's different than saying that few-to-none engage with her writing. She's regularly covered in university philosophy classes, especially ones on ethics, and the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Philosophical_Association_c292.html" title="American Philosophical Association">American Philosophical Association</a> (the main U.S. professional society for philosophers) has a sub-group, the Ayn Rand Society, specifically devoted to philosophical study of her works and influence. --65.182.51.67 06:05, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think there is a difference of view and presentation between you thoughts above and the widely accepted view. coverered in a few courses, having a relatively unpopulated subgroup, etc. does not contitute any notion of 'vibrancy' or 'closeness' to philosophy. what you see above is a POV of someone that already like sees Rand as a figure in philosophy, that is a significantly minority view, I think. To demonstrate it is a minority view, traditionally we look at citation analysis, which indicates the work that is being done in philosophy, and the relations amongst it. --<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBuridan_23f5.html" title="User:Buridan">Buridan</a> 13:02, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Buridan, I disagree. Seems to me if the American Philosophical Society recognizes her as worthy of study, as implied by the fact that they have a subgroup for study of her works, that's a pretty strong argument. 17,000 students annually compete in the Ayn Rand Institute's essay contest. Last year members of the ARI were included in numerous panels on free speech in response to the Danish Mohammed cartoons. A search of The Philosophers' Index (an abstracting database for scholarly journals in philosophy) gives 609 hits for Objectivism. And Cambridge University recently instituted a Fellowship for the Study of Objectivism, which I think definitely brings her out of the "few to none" cstegory. --<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookgrrl_63e2.html" title="User:Bookgrrl">Bookgrrl</a> 13:30, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>but also keep in mind that this is an article about rand, and not an article about who studies rand. i do not know the nature or history of the apa subgroup, but that would need to be investigated before one can claim it has any meaning. That students submit things to ARI has no indication of philosophic merit, it is a strong indication of sophomoric popularity. Fellowships are sponsored by people with money, anyone can sponsor one, that someone has sponsored one in objectivism does not certify any merit. what we need is a large population of noted philosophers interacting with her work, and that is not reflected in publication. This though is still an article about rand, so it is better to stick to the facts of her life and things that have verifiable and incontravertible evidence.--<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBuridan_23f5.html" title="User:Buridan">Buridan</a> 17:41, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>1.) Her stand that objects have objectively intrinsic value - it seems strange, even wrong, to me that the economic value of objects is intrinsic. This is far removed from mainstream economics that holds value depends upon the marginal utility one gets from a good/service. This leads me to my second contestation.</p>
<p>2.) Her apparent support for a <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold_standard.html" title="Gold standard">gold standard</a> - I cringed while I read the part when John Galt told Dagney they used only gold coins in the Gulch or valley thing. He said because they would only deal with objects with objective value. While the gold standard still has adherents, it has largely discredited by mainstream economists as being inflexible and doing more harm than good. I've yet to see an economics textbook recommending it.</p>

<p>The gold standard is useful in periods of hyperinflation. You are correct though, it is generally not very feasible in comparison to fiat money. As much as I like her novels, I have to say that her statements can be pretentious at times, such as the conversation with Galt that you posted.</p>

<dd>Buridan, I think you're missing the whole point. Rand's point was that gold is something that is a material commodity that people value, and even though that value fluctuates in the market it is something material and objective. Even if the value of gold drops you would still be effectively left with the material in question. fiat money is tied to no physical objective substance. Being confused about this is fine, but let's not let people claim that Rand said X when she never did.

<p>Ola sorry for my lateness. Gosh thanks for the responses. I've read the link provided and Aynd Rand definitely understood the concept of money as a proxy for goods and services produced by an economy. But the thing is so is gold. It wasn't until the advent of electronics did gold have any practical use. No one can deny you have a physical lump of gold. But it's just as valuable as metal coins or paper money (<b>which is also tied to the physical objective substance of paper and metal!</b>) if people will not be willing to trade goods and services for it. I'll be reviewing Aynd Rand's Virtue of Selfishness before commenting further.</p>
<p>I think I have yet to answer the 2nd responder's an argument. But it seems self-contradictory. If you just want to establish a unit of exchange why not use fiat money? However, I must review Aynd Rand first.</p>
<p>For clarification, Ethan, does your comment: “Even if the value of gold drops you would still be effectively left with the material in question.” also provide for instances when the price/value of gold is zero? Will people still “value” gold for it's own sake? Say in a hypothetical post-apocalyptic world of barter exchange or during prehistoric times before man started making jewelry?

<dd>During the early part of Rand's life, the gold standard was generally accepted by nations around the world, and was used as the measure of economic worth for any given unit of currency. It was this objective standard of value that Rand supported; gold happened to be the one that was generally accepted within the "civilized world" at the time, for reasons that could be presented, but in other cultures or at other times, animal skins or some other generally agreed-upon material objects could play a similar role. It was the divorcing of currency from any material constraint (so that governments could merely print more currency and thereby inflate the economy) that Rand objected to. — DAGwyn 20:30, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>EXACTLY! Ayn Rand sided with the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold_standard.html" title="Gold standard">gold standard</a> that today is considered to be unwieldy and impractical. Yes, there was much debate during the 60s and 70s whether to continue or discard the gold standard. Ayn Rand was simply on the losing side on this one. I would like to debate the merits and demerits of the gold standard but this is not the place to do so. I think it is sufficient to askː “how do you fight the recessionary effects of deflation under a gold standard?” to see how cumbersome it is. You could open the vaults in the central bank and release gold into the system to increase money supply. But this can only be done with a limited amount of gold in the world. In the long run, if the amount of gold in the world does not increase inline with economic activity, it will constrict economic growth. Note that hyperinflation is at least curable and its risk is partially offset by the seperation of central bankers and politicians.</dd>

<dd>Will answer further when I review Ayn Rand becuase I don't remember Ayn advocating gold standard simply because it put a lid on money supply which government could not control.

<dd>Keep in mind that to Rand, "objective" involves a specific relationship between the observer and what is observed, whereas "intrinsic" implies properties independent of observation. And of course "values" are determined with respect to the valuer. Gold does have certain intrinsic properties (malleability, durability, divisibility, scarcity) that make it nearly the best possible choice for an objective standard for purposes of economic trade, and people used to use genuine gold coins (as well as silver and other metals) as currency, world-wide. A gold coin is literally "worth its weight in gold," and retains its economic value (assuming free trade under a gold standard) regardless of governmental actions, etc. Paper money and cheap-metal token coins, however, represent <i>more</i> value than their own material, and thus that value is more at risk (such as by inflation of the money supply). Not so long ago, when the US was on the gold standard, US paper money could be officially exchanged for its equivalent in silver (more practical than gold for one-dollar quantities), but that is no longer supported. — DAGwyn 21:36, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree — either Paterson had some influence, or at least her ideas partly met with Rand's approval. As I recall, they later parted ways, but that was common for Rand's associates. There seems no harm in including Paterson in the list of influences. — DAGwyn 23:43, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Both the criticism and the defense seem biased. I have long noted that the main apparent motivation, admitted or not, behind much of the academic criticism of Rand's philosophy is that it deeply challenges the critic's personal beliefs. Thus there is a natural defensive reaction, taking the form of trying to prevent the spread of the perceived threat, by discouraging others from looking into it seriously. The (un)cited "perceived lapses in quality" are meaningless without an objective standard of "quality", which if it indeed existed and were exhibited would probably raise questions about the standard itself, and similarly "perceived lapses in originality" is a pointless criticism, if the standard is truth rather than publication in academic journals. I suggest that both the criticism and the defense be removed from the article, which should simply present relevant facts clearly, not try to summarize irrelevant debates. — DAGwyn 20:43, 11 December 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>Stating that Marx was an influence on her would be the wrong approach - it might imply that her ideas were just reactions to his writings and that's not the case. And a person would not be able to find a source to back that kind of phrasing. The way to most accurately express her ideas in this area would be to provide examples of her opposition to collectivism, egalitarianism, communialism &amp; communism etc - directly (properly cited). Or, another approach is to find any place where she named Marx directly and provide that as a sourced quote. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveWolfer_b631.html" title="User:SteveWolfer">Steve</a> 18:17, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is no debate among Objectivists as to whether or not the categorical imperative is compatible with Objectivism.

<p>As for Kant's rationality, Rand is quite correct, no matter what Kant claims for himself. Rationality is the degree to which one's subjectivity matches empirical reality. Kant's entire theory of "noumenal existence" does not match empirical reality because noumena are entirely uprovable and there is no shred of evidence they even exist. Yes, there are things the "human animal" cannot be aware of because of the limits of his sensibilities; yet many things never conceived were identified either by hypothoses proved, or by technology that allows us to discover and to use that which we cannot otherwise even see. These things are not noumenal. Noumena by Kant's definition are <i>Italic text</i>never<i>Italic text</i>identifiable. They are that which cannot by their nature be identified either by man's senses nor by his mind since the contents of his mind all come from the senses. This is not rational thinking. Prove that noumena exist, and you have thus proved that no noumena exist, that all things are phenomena. And someone please explain to me why, when I use the "italic" icon, the above effect happens.

<dd>Have you read Kant? Positing the possibility of something whose existence could never be proved isn't irrational. It would be irrational to deny the possibility that such things might exist. Your penultimate sentence ("Prove that noumena exist...") is just plain false, by the way. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadr_ad74.html" title="User:Cadr">Cadr</a> 11:10, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>DAGwyn, thank you.</dd>
<dd>Cadr--"Proving" noumena was the point. It cannot be done, and positing the impossible is irrational. I did not myself, by this, posit the irrational by pointing out what cannot be done: Kant "denied the existence of any but sensuous intuitions," Dictionary of Philosophy which is false anyway, since we have intuitions all time that are made of combinations of concepts, which are twice-removed from sensations, because sensations create perceptions, and combinations of perceptions cause concepts <a href="../../../r/a/n/Rand.html" title="Rand">Rand</a>. Then Kant posited the fallacy that something "trancendental" <i>must</i> exist <i>and also</i> that the trancendental <i>must</i> be unprovable in order for it not to be of phenomenal origin. He did not convince Rand, and that is where she veers from the philosophy of Kant, back toward Aristotle, making a virtual fork in the road. Plato posited "essences" in the heavens, Aristotle posited (wrongly, said Rand,) that essences were "in the things themselves." Kant put it back where Plato had it and Rand took essences to be of <i>conscious origin,</i> disagreeing with both Plato and Aristotle. Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology.</dd>
<dd>Yes, I read Kant until he proved himself <i>to me</i> to be irrational. Until then, I had no idea why Rand really hated him. I had to see it for myself to understand for what reasons she despised his epistemology.</dd>
<dd>And somewhere in her works--I do not remember where--she said plainly that most errant thinkers did not mean to make the mistakes they made. I think she saw how Kant could make his mistake in the same way that people of faith believe in the noumenon of God. I see it. I despise their belief, but I often love the people since so many of my family have faith made of rock.</dd>
<dd>She also said plainly that she <i>preferred</i> talking to left wingers rather than right wingers because they were more cerebral, more conceptually interactive. She could not find someone more conceptually interactive for her interests than Kant and I think she would have taken him on face to face--amicably in debate--and respected his intelligence while despising his ideas.</dd>
<dd>So, the whole point was to say, why posit what one defines as "the object of a non-sensuous intuition" and then define <i>that</i> as unprovable?</dd>
<dd>Rand's philosophy accepts "transcendental" because perceptions and concepts transcend empirical reality and are subjective; but perceptions and concepts are provable, and Kant never says noumena are subjective, but puts them outside of consciousness, never to be known, never to be proved, always to be infinitesimally outside the realm of Man's "animalism."</dd>
</dl>
<p>This has lead to the conclusion that Man is a failed animal, when in fact it is his animalism that causes his knowlege in the first place by giving him consciousness of existence.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Where Kant wrote: “…[R]eflections… on the starry heavens above…of a countless multitude of worlds annihilates, as it were, my importance as an animal creature," Rand wrote of Man qua Man, essentially <i>reveling</i> in her importance as an animal creature. I certainly revel in mine; it allows me these types of cerebral interactions with other people. That transcends two minds, yours and mine, and it is provable because it is phenomenalality of the mind.</dd>

A few of them (e.g. Thatcher) date back much farther and would take some research to find citable sources. One criterion I applied was that there already be (for independent reasons) a Wikipedia article. I was tempted to create an article for Erika Holzer (whose book "An Eye for an Eye" was made into a major motion picture starring Sally Field &amp; Kiefer Sutherland), but haven't yet done so.</dd>
<dd>As to what "influenced" means, I had to consider that when selecting from the considerably longer list found in that journal. I left out any case where the only influence was along the lines "I really enjoyed the book"; if in an interview someone said "it changed my life" then I definitely counted it as a significant influence. I left Sharon Stone out because, although she had been actively pursuing the role of Dagny Taggart in an Atlas Shrugged movie (which it now appears Jolie actually has), it seems to have been more a case of liking a strong female lead than of adopting the philosophy; I understand she more recently turned to Scientology.. — DAGwyn 18:35, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A user just reverted the addition of Spinoza to the <i>influenced by</i> section, citing "what is the evidence that spinoza influenced rand?". I believe the citation would be the "Russian Radical", but it's been too long since I read that to be 90% sure. Here's a link to the author's site that touches on the subject: <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/essays/randt2.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/essays/randt2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/essays/randt2.htm</a>. He says</p>
<dl>
<dd>After 1923, the Marxist, Borichevsky, taught the course in logic--but his expertise was limited to Spinoza, Epicurus and materialism. Given that Rand took this course early in her academic career, probably in the fall of 1921, it seems certain that she studied with Vvedensky.11 It is of some interest that this was not the only course on logic that Rand ever took.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So, it can be probably be referenced as such, but the above link is only a loose connection. --<a href="../../../o/t/h/User%7EOtheus_fe85.html" title="User:Otheus">Otheus</a> 01:14, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't recall Sciabarra arguing that Spinozo influenced Rand. I'll take a look though. The quote you provided claims that one of Rand's teachers was an expert in Spinoza, not that Rand was influenced by Spinoza. Endlessmike 888 01:21, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Unless I missed a passage, Sciabarra makes no argument that Rand was influenced by Spinoza. He argues that they were similar in some respects, and that Rand on occassion praised Spinoza, but that is different from "was influenced BY Spinoza." Endlessmike 888 01:28, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The above citation seems to say that some <i>other</i> professor, not even the one Rand probably studied under, specialized in Spinoza. At any rate, if Spinoza was an influence he was certainly a minor one. — DAGwyn 20:25, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
