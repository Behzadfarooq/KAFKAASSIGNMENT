<p>I think we should eliminate the ARI Watch link because it's not very notable; if there must be a critique of the ARI, it should probably be one from the Objectivist Center website, since that is the far more important organization.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Okay; the current link to TOC is fine. I may try to work some of the content from ARI Watch into the text, too. --<a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZenohockey_178b.html" title="User:Zenohockey">zenohockey</a> 23:58, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>-oOo-</p>
<p>Not very notable"? One can note that ARIwatch.com is focused on the Ayn Rand Institute and its associated organizations. It addresses this Wikipedia subject perfectly.</p>
<p>I've no quarrel with including the Objectivist Center critique as well, and for the same reason.</p>
<p>Chris Matthew Sciabarra, who is, whatever you think of him, a notable person in Ayn Rand studies, gave two links (main and a page) to ARI Watch December 22, 2005. See</p>
<p>www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/notablog/archives/2005_12.html#000935 "a useful compendium of quotes can be found <a href="http://www.ariwatch.com" class="external text" title="http://www.ariwatch.com" rel="nofollow">here</a>"</p>
<p>-oOo-</p>
<p>I still think we should eliminate ARI Watch, inasmuch as the positions it takes seem to be neither in line with ARI nor with TOC. It seems like irrelevant criticism from some fringe group.</p>
<p>-oOo-</p>
<p>Of course a critique of ARI is not going to be in line with it! Some reputable people, see above, think it's relevant criticism. It's literate and, if forceful, still urbane.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I deleted the link to ARI Watch website, interesting as it may be: as far as I can tell it is totally anonymous and as such has no authority. Perhaps Jackem9 is one of the authors? In any case, is it too much to ask that ARI Watch authors sign their articles and perhaps add brief biographical notes that would indicate some reason to think these authors' opinions are worthy of note to any prospective reader — let alone worthy of note in an encyclopedia? It should not be hard to find links to critics of ARI who can be cited by name. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlanchette_8572.html" title="User:Blanchette">Blanchette</a> 06:41, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>-oOo-</p>
<p>Come on! By that standard you wouldn't have referenced the Federalist Papers in the 1780's. It's difficult not to suspect that you deleted <a href="http://www.ariwatch.com" class="external text" title="http://www.ariwatch.com" rel="nofollow">ARIwatch.com</a> not because it is anonymous but because you disagree with it.</p>
<p>It contains many interesting Ayn Rand quotes not found elsewhere on the web, easily verified as authentic by going to the original books. It quotes ARI writers, which is also easily verified. And it contains analysis and comparisons which stand on their own merit. They don't depend on the author having or not having a Ph.D. or whatever.</p>
<p>I shall restore the link.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Federalist Papers were published in some of the leading newspapers of the day. This is a website set up by an anonymous person. One can find forceful, urbane things written by people without Ph.D.s by using Google.</dd>
<dd>Having said that, it is certainly of note that ARI is widely seen as housing imperialist, bloodthirsty warmongers. This topic deserves more thorough treatment than a link to a random site. With all the time you people have spent inserting and removing the link, maybe you could have posted some excerpts from it—or, even better, from a more important, respected, recognized source. Just saying. --<a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZenohockey_178b.html" title="User:Zenohockey">zenohockey</a> 23:58, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>-oOo-</p>
<p>Yes, the Federalists Papers were originally published as newspaper editorials. My point is that they were published <i>anonymously</i>, or to be precise, <i>pseudonymously</i>.</p>
<p>ARIwatch is not a “random site.” On the contrary, it’s focused on the very subject of this Wikipedia entry. It belongs here. And I shall restore it.</p>
<p>-oOo-</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with <i>criticizing</i> ARI watch, but that’s not what the vandal who keeps deleting the link to it is doing. He would <u>prevent</u> criticism, criticism of ARI. No openness and transparency for him, he wants ARI Watch to just disappear. Let’s not let him get away with it.</p>
<p>Dear vandal, why not create your own website, called say “ARIwatch Watch” and link to it. More power to you if you do <u>that</u>.</p>
<p>But by trying to prevent others from seeing <a href="http://www.ariwatch.com" class="external text" title="http://www.ariwatch.com" rel="nofollow">ARIwatch.com</a> you only reveal your contempt for the Wikipedia user’s intellect.</p>
<p>-oOo-</p>
<p>One has to wonder at the validity of Wikipedia when someone, or group, who does not reply to the above can repeatedly vandalize an article while getting their opponent labeled the vandal.</p>

<p>I think we should remove the "Libertarian" sidebar, inasmuch as the Ayn Rand Institute condemns libertarianism outright; Objectivism certainly was an influence on libertarianism, but I don't think the Institute is. <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELaszloWalrus_c9d2.html" title="User:LaszloWalrus">LaszloWalrus</a> 06:53, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Of course websites with critical opinions of something must stay. Please reread <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> - it clearly says that all views must be presented, including critical views. And there is no exception that anonymous criticism somehow doesn't count. Now if we already had links to ten different critical websites, it would be ok to select "more important" ones or something - but right now without ARI Watch link the article wouldn't say anything about criticism of ARI, and it wouldn't link to any criticism of ARI, and it would be totally one-sided.</p>
<p>And it's unreasonable to expect some famous names among the critics here, ARI is not that well-known, so it has less well-known critics. That doesn't make this article exmept from NPOV policy. <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETaw_8bc0.html" title="User:Taw">Taw</a> 14:58, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>ARIWatch is run by ONE MAN named Marko something or other. It is not an organization, but more of a blog. Those don't count. <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELaszloWalrus_c9d2.html" title="User:LaszloWalrus">LaszloWalrus</a> 21:45, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Of course they do count. It's mostly the usefulness of information that matters, not whether the guy is called Marco or not, and ARI Watch website seems to contain the most detailed criticism of Ayn Rand Institute anywhere on the Internet, and it is well-sourced.</p>
<p>Anyway, I did select one other American think-tank at random: <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cato_Institute_745b.html" title="Cato Institute">Cato Institute</a>. What's there&#160;? A real criticism section, and links to "private websites" criticizing it, like <a href="http://world.std.com/~mhuben/cato.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://world.std.com/~mhuben/cato.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>As you can see, linking to criticism on "private websites" too, is a well-established practice on Wikipedia. We've been doing it since as far back as I can remember (like, since 2001). You cannot simply claim they do not count.</p>
<p>And I think people definitely want Wikipedia to inform them about members of Ayn Rand Institute endorsing torture, genocide, and suspending civil liberties, if that's actually true (well, the sources are there, anybody denying their validity&#160;?), no matter who pointed that out first.</p>
<p>If you think what I'm doing here is totally wrong and against established Wikipedia practice, please ask some other person for their opinion. I guess they'd be much more likely to agree with me than with you&#160;:-) <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETaw_8bc0.html" title="User:Taw">Taw</a> 16:20, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It looks to me that the history of this page is a history of removing the link to ARIWatch. Also, copying all that text could well be a copywright violation. Also, blogs do not count as valid sources. <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELaszloWalrus_c9d2.html" title="User:LaszloWalrus">LaszloWalrus</a> 19:33, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

The fact is <a href="http://www.ariwatch.com" class="external text" title="http://www.ariwatch.com" rel="nofollow">ARIwatch.com</a>, love it or hate it, is a collection of essays, some fairly long essays, essays on which obviously much time and effort has been spent.

<dd>I quote from Wikipedia's article on reliable sources: "A self-published source is a published source that has not been subject to any form of independent fact-checking, or where no one stands between the writer and the act of publication. It includes personal websites, and books published by vanity presses. Anyone can create a website or pay to have a book published, and then claim to be an expert in a certain field. For that reason, self-published books, personal websites, and blogs are largely not acceptable as sources." Further, "Personal websites, blogs, and other self-published or vanity publications should not be used as secondary sources.</dd>
<dd>That is, they should not be used as sources of information about a person or topic other than the owner of the website, or author of the book. The reason personal websites are not used as secondary sources — and as primary sources only with great caution and not as a sole source if the subject is controversial — is that they are usually created by unknown individuals who have no one checking their work. They may be uninformed, misled, pushing an agenda, sloppy, relying on rumor and suspicion, or even insane; or they may be intelligent, careful people sharing their knowledge with the world. Only with independent verification by other sources not holding the same POV is it possible to determine the difference.</dd>
<dd>Visiting a stranger's personal website is often the online equivalent of reading an unattributed flyer on a lamp post, and should be treated accordingly." <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELaszloWalrus_c9d2.html" title="User:LaszloWalrus">LaszloWalrus</a> 16:12, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The complete article “Reliable Sources” from which <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELaszloWalrus_c9d2.html" title="User:LaszloWalrus">LaszloWalrus</a> quotes can be read at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:Reliable_source" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:Reliable_source" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:Reliable_source</a> . Possibly <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELaszloWalrus_c9d2.html" title="User:LaszloWalrus">LaszloWalrus</a> didn’t provide a link to it because, like the admonition that one should always be grammatical, it allows exceptions.</p>
<p><a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELaszloWalrus_c9d2.html" title="User:LaszloWalrus">LaszloWalrus</a> avoids the burden of consistently defining “personal website.” What kind of website is the Ayn Rand Institute’s about itself –- aynran.org -– now gracing External Links? Is it subject to independent fact-checking? It is not. Is it subject to peer review? It is not.</p>
<p>Is it self-published? It most assuredly is.</p>
<p>It might be objected to this that, since the Wikipeida article under discussion is <i>about</i> ARI, anything published by ARI, even if riddled with fallacies, is “primary source material” and therefore must be allowed. Very well! But if other External Links pointing out those fallacies are not allowed, the Widipedia article becomes just a mouthpiece for ARI.</p>
<p>ARI Watch may not be the ideal website for reviewing ARI but it does articulate what many students of Ayn Rand have been thinking.</p>
<p>What makes <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELaszloWalrus_c9d2.html" title="User:LaszloWalrus">LaszloWalrus</a> think ARI is above the criticism of ARI Watch? “ARI is a group, ARI Watch is just an individual” doesn’t cut it. What really matters, of course, is whether the ARI Watch website is relevant and useful. That is what LaszloWalrus should argue against, if he can.</p>
<p>Whether or not it is "relevant and useful" ARIWatch does NOT meet the criteria for website inclusion on Wikipedia. Period. <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELaszloWalrus_c9d2.html" title="User:LaszloWalrus">LaszloWalrus</a> 23:46, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As one who objected to the anonymity of ARI Watch and the probable self-promotion of that site by one or more 'sock puppets', usually from the University of VA, I'm surprised to see no one taking up my suggestion to find "critics of ARI who can be cited by name." Here are some links, by no means exhaustive and not all of which I would consider to be 'encyclopedia grade', but all of which connect to the larger world by having names, institutions, or forms of dialogue associated with them.

<p>I know this is a big debate and this is probably not the place for it, but should we call Peikoff Rand's intellectual heir, especially in an article that is not directly about him? I don't think he is even refered to as such on his own page. Should we delete it?Atripodi 07:28, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it could go either way, but I lean towards keeping it.

<dd>I think "intellectual heir" should be removed. It doesn't appear in Dr Peikoff's own page and I'm not aware of the basis for the use of this title in relation to him. If anyone can point me to where it is stated as accurate I'd be happy to change my mind. As it is, it is an undocumented addition. This has been a big debate between ARI/TOC/et al debates. We can easily sort this out if someone who thinks it should be kept can provide the source. I'll delete it now and summarize this in the edit.

<p>There should be some indication of who he is beyond her legal heir. Such an heir could simply be a family member. Something like "her legal heir and student of 30 years." "Intellectual heir" is contentious (though I've never understood why), but the fact remains that she made him her legal heir at least partially because she thought he understood her philosophy better than anyone else.

<p>Someone keeps inserting the following misleading sentence:<br />
<b>“Though some Institute writers promoted the invasion of Iraq, the Institute opposes how the Iraq War is being handled.”</b><br />
The fact is ARI strenuously agitated for the Iraq invasion. Just look in their archives, or visit&#160; <b><a href="http://www.ariwatch.com/RelentlessPropaganda.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.ariwatch.com/RelentlessPropaganda.htm" rel="nofollow">Relentless Propaganda</a></b>&#160; for a raft of statements of them doing so. It’s disingenuous to say only “some” did so when it was <u>practically all</u>. The truth is as follows:<br />
<b>“Most Institute writers, including the Institute’s director, promoted the invasion of Iraq, however they now oppose how the Iraq War is being handled.”</b><br />
And citations for examples of them doing <u>both</u> these things is in order, not just the second. The person who keeps changing "practically all" to "some" evades the true history of ARI and seeks to deceive others as he deceives himself.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Practically all?" Your article cites four writers, one of which no longer works for ARI. If you want to maintain that "practically all" (or any equivalent) ARI writiers said this, the burden is on you to document it. So I've eliminated the "outspoken" and added the quantifer "some," changing the sentence to "Though some at the Institute supported the invasion of Iraq, it now opposes how the Iraq War is being handled." (This is the first time I've changed the sentence. I don't know who did in the past). Endlessmike 888 00:16, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Someone keeps inserting<br />

This history of ARI is important and deserves stating with citation just as much as the above fact, which by itself is but a half-truth.</p>

<p>The original post in this section conflates two issues, namely what ARI says about the Iraq war as it is, and ARI's desired war against Totalitarian Islam. ARI had put out various op-eds supporting the war on Iraq, though the specific reasons often varied from writer to writer. For example, Tracinski supported it for reasons very similar to those given by President Bush, while Peikoff very reluctantly supported it on the grounds that going into Iraq was better than doing nothing. As it stands now, based on numerous essays published in The Objective Standard, the consensus is that the Iraq war was worse than doing nothing. The only hold out is Rob Tracinski, who has left ARI.</p>
<p>Articles concerning action against Iran are of a different kind. These types of articles address how various Objectivists think the war should be fought. For example, Peikoff advocated war on Iran only several weeks after Sept 11, 2001. He advocated being merciful to Afghanistan and instead concentrating on Iran.</p>
<p>As Mark of ARI watch would write this section, he fails to take into account the varying opinions on the war at ARI several years ago. He also underappreciates the rationale many Objectivists were giving at the time, namely that going into Iraq was better than doing nothing. And by neglecting this last point, he underappreciates why the opinion of most ARI writers (with Tracinski as the exception) have changed. Endlessmike 888 00:33, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>ARI boosters twist and squirm to evade the fact that every writer at ARI wrote an essay advocating the Iraq War during Bush’s deceitful run-up to that war. Every one. “Most” would be generous to the ARI boosters, but let’s say “most” in case an ARI writer was in hospital or something and didn’t weigh in.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In short: ARI advocated the Iraq War. It yearned and hankered and ached for the Iraq War.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The question is: Why are ARI boosters in a state of denial and evasion about it? We give them twenty quotes selected from about fifty on hand and they say: “How do I know these quotes are reliable?”</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Answer: You go to the ARI website and check them! But ARI boosters pretend they can’t do that. ARI Watch simply must be unreliable. Yes, that’s it. ARI Watch is unreliable. Now they can say “some” instead of “all” or “most” – and erase that horrid reference to all those horrid ARI quotes.</dd>

<p>Nandesuka’s standard of reliability is rather weak. It is enough, he/she claims, that “ARIWatch is viewed as a reliable source by anyone other than ARIWatch.” <i>Anyone</i>? Talk about social metaphysics!</p>
<p>There are two questions here.</p>
<p>1. The truth of using “practically all” (or to be generous “most”) instead of just “some.” This truth is independent of ARI Watch. And it <u>is</u> true, just read the ARI archives at ARI’s official website (aynrand.org).</p>
<p>2. The reliability of the <u>one</u> page of ARI Watch that lists many quotes from ARI op-eds, press releases, and letters to the editor promoting the invasion of Iraq. This page is reliable simply because the quotes are reliable. Nandesuka could easily confirm that any quote is reliable simply by going to the original ARI article referenced. These articles are all over the Internet, in particular at ARI’s official website (aynrand.org).</p>
<p>As <a href="../../../t/s/u/User%7ETsunami_Butler_ee9c.html" title="User:Tsunami Butler">Tsunami Butler</a> pointed out, Nandesuka is being less than honest on this point. <small><small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> (<a href="../../../a/l/i/User_talk%7EAlienus_286a.html" title="User talk:Alienus">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Alienus_1d05.html" title="Special:Contributions/Alienus">contribs</a>).</small></small></p>

<p>Here's a suggested re-writing of the section on the War on Terror, that I think makes clear the Institutes position on the War at different stages and the extent to which it has and has not changed its mind. I also think it's better organized than the existing section:</p>
<p>The Institute claims that America is at war with “Totalitarian Islam”. Since September of 2001 it has been calling for aggressive military action against Iran, which it considers the primary state sponsor of this movement.</p>
<p>In the build up to the Iraq war, it vigorously defended America’s right to invade Iraq unilaterally, and most of its writers supported the war, even while arguing that Iran was the more important target. From the beginning, the Institute has been critical of the Bush administration’s war policy, which it characterizes as “altruistic” because it places the goal of bringing democracy to the Iraqis above the goal of ensuring America’s safety. Most of its speakers now maintain that, given the way in which the war was conducted, it would have been better not to invade Iraq at all, and many favor withdrawal over a continuation of the present policy. <a href="http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=13587&amp;news_iv_ctrl=1021" class="external text" title="http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=13587&amp;news_iv_ctrl=1021" rel="nofollow">8</a></p>
<p>The Institute’s own views on how the war should be conducted are controversial. According to the UCLA Daily Bruin of October 17, 2006, Institute chairman Yaron Brook has called for the killing of hundreds of thousands of citizens of states that support Islamic terrorism to combat "Islamic totalitarianism," <a href="http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:O09rZrgNQV4J:www.dailybruin.ucla.edu/news/articles.asp%3Fid%3D38431+%22Yaron+Brook%22+Daily+bruin&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=3&amp;client=opera" class="external text" title="http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:O09rZrgNQV4J:www.dailybruin.ucla.edu/news/articles.asp%3Fid%3D38431+%22Yaron+Brook%22+Daily+bruin&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=3&amp;client=opera" rel="nofollow">9</a>, and during an appearance on The O'Reilly Factor, he said that the United States should "turn Fallujah into dust." Institute fellow Onkar Ghate has written that: "In fact, victory with a minimum of one's own casualties sometimes requires a free nation to deliberately target the civilians of an aggressor nation in order to cripple its economic production and/or break its will. This is what the U.S. did in WWII when it dropped fire bombs on Dresden and Hamburg and atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. These bombings were moral acts."<a href="http://www.capmag.com/article.asp?ID=2547" class="external text" title="http://www.capmag.com/article.asp?ID=2547" rel="nofollow">10</a>.</p>
<p>The Institute has taken other controversial positions with respect to the Islamic world. The Institute is generally supportive of Israel <a href="http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=5171" class="external text" title="http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=5171" rel="nofollow">11</a>, and has started what it calls a Free Speech Campaign in response to the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy.</p>

<dd>This is much better than the attempts to astroturf the ARIWatch link. However, you need to find a reliable source that describes the institute's positions as "controversial"; otherwise, it's original research.

<p>It's OK except that "most writers" needs a citation, such as the one Nandesuka keeps deleting. One footnote hardly constitutes "astroturf" as she claims. -- 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The citation to ARIWatch listed only four writers, one of which no longer works with the institute. ARI has 28 writers listed on their <a href="http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=media_speakers_writers" class="external text" title="http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=media_speakers_writers" rel="nofollow">website</a>. Four out of 28 does not constitute "most," even if ARIWatch is a reliable source. Endlessmike 888 23:21, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<br /></font> This is not a complete list, I stopped when I got tired. To these we ought to add the following. Though they do not directly advocate military action in Iraq, context is everything here:<br />
<font color="#FF0000">“America Needs a Leader Like George Washington” by John Ridpath, Feb. 11, 2003<br /></font> (see&#160; ariwatch.com/GeorgeWashington.htm &#160;for why this ought to be included).<br />
<font color="#FF0000">“Honoring Virture” by Andrew Bernstein, May 22, 2002<br /></font> (see&#160; ariwatch.com/HonoringVirtue.htm &#160;for why this ought to be included).<br />
<br />
And though Harry Binswanger may not have advocated the Iraq invasion before it occurred (I’m not sure, he may have), he did support it afterwards. There are several articles, for example:<br />
<font color="#FF0000">“The Big Lie: Intelligence Failure in Iraq” Harry Binswanger, Feb. 23, 2004<br />
<br /></font> There are many other articles we could include in the afterwards category, but let it rest. So we have the following ARI writers during the Administration’s run-up to the war:<br />
– Peter Schwartz<br />
– Onkar Ghate<br />
– Robert Tracinski<br />
– Alex Epstein<br />
– Andrew Bernstein<br />
– John Ridpath<br />
– Dianne Durante<br />
– Scott McConnell<br />
– and Harry Binswanger afterwards, at least.<br />
<br />
This list includes most of the major ARI writers. The above were <u>the top guns at ARI</u> at the time. Also note that no other writer spoke out <u>against</u> the invasion. None. Silence is complicity here, after all they belong to the same organization.</p>
<p>Nandesuka could have done this research herself, why didn’t she? Nandesuka is evading the facts, trying to re-write the past.</p>
<p><u>The Ayn Rand Institute was gung-ho the Iraq invasion.</u> Anyone claiming otherwise has a lot of explaining to do.</p>

<dd>Mark, why don't you sign your posts? Use four (~) in a row to sign. Second, I just now read the first article, “How America Abets Its Terrorist Foes” by Dianne Durante Feb. 15, 2001, for which you did not provide a link. Did you neglect to provide links on purpose? This article does not advocate the Iraq war. Rather, it makes a general point that the US government not appease countries that threaten our national security. Iraq is listed, along with Lybia Sudan and Iran. She is making a general call for action against nations that support Islamic terrorists, not a call for war against Iraq. I'll look at the rest soon, but so far, #1 doesn't indicate that ARI was "gung-ho" for the war in Iraq. Rather, it indicates that ARI is against appeasment and decided to use Iraq as one among many examples. Anyhow, it is not being disputed that some at ARI were supportive of the war. What is being called into question is your characterization of their reasons for advocating the war. From what I can remember off the top of my head, every advocacy of the Iraq war was on the grounds of 'it's better than doing nothing.' If the rest of your unlinked "sources" are as piss poor as the first, you're the one who's gonna have some 'splainin to do. Endlessmike 888 02:09, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The second article is slightly more relevent, in that Durrante advocates ultimatums to a collection of countries, of which Iraq is but one. Though the question is on the war in Iraq, not the war on terror in general. Mark, since you're the one making the positive claim, why don't you provide links to articles that specifically call for war on Iraq so we can discuss them?

<dd>Mark, what did you do? Search ARI's webpage for "Iraq" and then list every hit? Take the third article. So gung-ho about the Iraq war is Onkar Ghate that in his article <i>War, Nuclear Weapons and ‘Innocents'</i> he says in the first paragraph, "Central among these is Iran, but the enemy includes Iraq, Syria, Sudan, the PLO and others," and then NEVER MENTIONS IRAQ AGAIN in the rest of the article. What gives? Endlessmike 888 19:11, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The articles are listed in order by date. ARI’s war advocacy builds to a climax. About the third article: Ghate explicitly calls for the destruction of Iraq. Sure, he says it <i>once</i>. Does that mean he didn’t say it? Read the rest of the articles on the list, they build up to “Let’s Roll.” -- Mark, 31 December 2006</dd>

<dd>I took one at random, Rob Tracinski's The War on CEOs. The first paragraph reads: "Just as the War on Terrorism dissipates into total inaction--the latest word is that we will not invade Iraq--our leaders have launched a new war to replace it: the War on CEOs." Tracinski then goes on discuss the governments actions towards various business men, never mentioning Iraq, or the any literal war, again. Also, a significant number of these are only open to evaluation if one has the relevent back issues of TIA. Given your track record of including any and every article that inclueds the word "Iraq," regardless of its relevence to this discussion, are we supposed to just take your word for it? I highly doubt that "The War on Art Historians" is about why we should invade Iraq. Another example: "Innocents in War" by Onkar Ghate does not advocate the Iraq war. Rather, it discusses the moral status of supposed innocent in an enemy country during war, using the Iraq war as an example. From what I've read so far (there are a lot on your list), the only two that explicitly advocate the Iraq war are "The Justification for War” Peter Schwartz (PR), Dec. 2, 2002, a press release, and “Let’s Roll” by Scott McConnell (Letters to the Editor), Mar. 20, 2003, a paragraph long letter. This bolsters my claim, which is that the current wording "Though some at the Institute supported the invasion of Iraq, it now opposes how the Iraq War is being handled " is accurate, and any suggestion that the institute was "gung-ho" for the war is a fantasy. Again, no one is denying that some at ARI were pro-Iraq war. So I'll reiterate my request. If your case is to rock solid, present us all and only the articles that have a theme explicitly advocating the war, with links. Endlessmike 888 17:23, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well I see EndlessMike has a reply. Why read it? I’ve presented the evidence and I’m confident that a <u>sincere</u> reader will agree that ARI advocated invading Iraq. Whether ARI calls it warring on Iraq or destroying Iraq, they wanted it and said so many times. My case was amply made at&#160; www.ariwatch.com/RelentlessPropaganda.htm&#160;.&#160; ARI leaves many a sightless eye and dead brain in its wake of admirers.</dd>

<p>Isn't anonymous criticism inherently not sourced. Furthermore, I do not see how including every critic constitutes NPOV. Furthermore, there is clearly a double standard here. Objectivism is treated worse than Scientology for Christ's sake; Islam gets off very, very well. Indeed, when I tried to add, "Islam is a religion and political ideology" to the Islam article, I had my change immediately removed though Islam supports Sharia law and pushing for a law code is inherently a political act.</p>
<p>How can unequal treatment be inherently nuetral?</p>
