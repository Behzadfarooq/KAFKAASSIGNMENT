<p>I would like to use the photograph (publicity photo) of Ayn Rand for a entry in another Wikipedia. Is this picture Public Domain?</p>
<hr />
<p>Quote from the article: "Her novels were based upon the archetype of the "Randian hero", a man whose genius leads others to reject him, but who nonetheless <b>perseveres to prove himself superior</b>." Unquote</p>
<dl>
<dd>Can anyone provide any evidence of the boldface part? Having read all of Ayn Rand's fiction, I am unable to find a single "Randian hero" who tries to <b>prove</b> their superiority to anyone. Personally, I think the best way to characteize her novels are her own statements, to the effect that her novels aim to portray heroic people as "ends in themseleves".</dd>
<dd>If no one can provide evidence to the contrary I will change the article text in about a weeks' time.</dd>

<hr />
<p>For the record, regarding the "second most influential book" claim for Atlas Shrugged, here is what the FAQ from the Objectivist Reference Center says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>No one knows exactly how influential Atlas Shrugged is, because there has never been a proper study done to check. The "second most influential" claim comes from a Survey of Lifetime Reading Habits conducted in 1991 by the Book-of-the-Month Club and the Library of Congress. Printed surveys were sent to members of the Club, asking them what books had most influenced their own lives. A little over 2,000 responses were received. The Bible ranked first, and Atlas Shrugged ranked a distant second. Because the survey targeted an audience of book lovers (members of the Club) and an active effort was required to mail in a response, it is likely that the results were skewed towards people who were influenced especially strongly by a particular book. Such a result cannot be reliably interpreted as reflecting the entire US population, although enthusiastic promoters of the novel sometimes make such claims. (The survey is also often inaccurately described as a "poll" or "study," and various incorrect sources are cited for it.) {<a href="http://www.noblesoul.com/orc/books/rand/atlas/faq.html#Q6.4" class="external text" title="http://www.noblesoul.com/orc/books/rand/atlas/faq.html#Q6.4" rel="nofollow">Link</a>}</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>The phrase "While he claims to be promoting and naturally extending her philosophy, some scholars see him as espousing his own philosophy, one that some argue Rand herself may not have agreed with were she still alive." should be removed in its entirety unless someone can provide actual references which would support the statement as fact. This appears to be a smear attempt on Peikoff and nothing more, given the context and the content of the following paragraph. Those who pay attention to the placement of this and the following argument might agree that it may only serve to coerce the reader into believing that Peikoff is in the wrong, and many who have read Ayn Rand works work would readily say otherwise.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have heard this accusation made before, but don't recall where. I don't think including this in the article is a smear attempt, but is factual, reporting a valid POV that somebody has said about Peikoff. Just giving my input, I didn't write the article material. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChessPlayer_1f3d.html" title="User:ChessPlayer">ChessPlayer</a> 01:57, 9 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think it's a particularly controversial accusation—among philosophers who follow in a vaguely Objectivist tradition, many feel that Peikoff is extending Rand's philosophy in one possible way, but obviously not everyone agrees it's the proper way. He obviously does <i>something</i> other than merely restating exactly what Rand said, and this is a controversial enough area that anything he does is going to be challenged by others. So I think it's fairly neutral to say that he claims to be the heir to her intellectual tradition, but that many scholars see him as more of as independent philosopher who happens to be greatly inspired by her. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 02:00, May 9, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've noticed Ayn Rand works being modified, including the original tenets of Objectivism. has anyone considered documenting "Objectvism: Original Philosophy"&#160;? SEWilson</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The claim that Dr. Peikoff somehow differs in his philosophy is refuted by Ayn Rand’s own statements and actions. Dr. Peikoff posthumously gave a speech in her name and at her request (“<i>The Sanction of the Victims</i>”, 1982) worked on a number of her papers, also at her request, and inherited all her works, with instructions to dispose of them as he wished. This is from Ayn Rand’s introduction to Dr. Peikoff’s “The Ominous Parallels,” written two years before her death:</dd>
<dd><i>"It gives me great pleasure to introduce the first book by an Objectivist philosopher other than myself. Perhaps the best recommendation I can give this book- and its author, Dr. Leonard Peikoff – is to say that it and he are not of today’s cultural mainstream. They will be part of tomorrows.”</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The fact that Ayn Rand only used the term “Objectivist” to refer to someone who agreed with her philosophy in it’s entirety, and the fact that Dr. Peikoff has delineated his original philosophic work from Ayn Rand’s is a good indication that neither claim should be made without a link to factual references for any such claims.</dd>

<li>Nobody's really suggesting deleting anything, just commenting on what a mess it is. When little fragments of an article go flying off into their own articles, the reader is not being well served. Here, an important point about the novel, its setting and what it means, has turned into an separate independent article. The article on the novel is made less informative; the separate article is nearly worthless outside the context of the discussion of the novel. I thought reading Ayn Rand was supposed to make one ruthlessly logical. Guess not. <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrtolan88_d8ce.html" title="User:Ortolan88">Ortolan88</a></li>

<p>From article: "Branden's relationship with Rand eventually took on romantic aspects, though they were both married at the time."</p>
<p>Ayn Rand would hardly respect such euphemism. According to Barbara Branden's book, Rand regularly <i>ordered</i> O'Connor out of their apartment so that she and Nathaniel Branden could have sex, with the explaination that to O'Connor that her ideology required it. <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrthogonal_2fa0.html" title="User:Orthogonal">orthogonal</a> 01:46, 13 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>While I was in the mind to do the edit myself, it seemed a little presumptuous. But I do think it's important to add a note somewhere that many people, including just about every philosophy professor I've ever had, think that Ayn Rand is an entirely unimportant philosopher, that Objectivism, at its best, is watered down Nietzche, and at its worst, is dangerous for its readers...</p>
<p>And as far as I'm concerned, philosophy aside, Atlas Shrugged is not a particularily good book.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not suggesting that we deface Ayn Rand here, but only add a few notes as to her position in a community (the philosophic/academic) which many might be confused into thinking she was an important part of.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know enough philosophy to know if you're right, but go ahead and make the change. The worst thing that happens is that someone disagrees with you, and then you two can work things out. It would be helpful if you <a href="../../../u/s/e/Special%7EUserlogin_5f6a.html" title="Special:Userlogin">created an account</a>, just so people would have a pseudonym to attach to your edits--it's quick, free and anonymous.

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>By all means please be bold in editing. I have gathered the same impression as you have, but I wonder if it is not perhaps influenced by a dislike for her philosophy? I know it might be difficult, but it would be helpful if you could cite some sources to whatever you decide to write, instead of being vague. That would help the page become more NPOV.<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChessPlayer_1f3d.html" title="User:ChessPlayer">ChessPlayer</a> 22:42, 3 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There will always be professors who disagree with Rand but the fact is that most of their reasons are superficial. I would read the section on Rand under <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudophilosophy.html" title="Pseudophilosophy">pseudophilosophy</a> for an overview on why they disagree with them. (Some do so simply because she set forth a philosophy in fictional novels.)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>In addition, there is an Ayn Rand branch of the American Philisophical Association, a <i>Journal of Ayn Rand Studies</i>, and prominent Objectivists holding chairs at colleges (i.e. Tara Smith of the University of Texas, among others). Any attempt to discredit Rand's philosophy based on the fact that professors don't agree with her is subjective at best and a fallacy in logic and deserves to be treated as such if it is to be mentioned in the article at all. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedfarmer_d952.html" title="User:Redfarmer">Redfarmer</a> 05:28, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<hr />
<p>I think it would also be helpful to note her writing style: verbose, tedious, and frequently inscrutable. Brevity was not one of Rand's virtues, and the validity of Objectivism aside her works were frequently far longer and more self-important than they otherwise needed to be. I went back and re-read "The Fountainhead" a couple of years ago, and was amazed when I realized that Tooey's final monologue is something like 60 pages long. Even assuming that she wasn't shooting for a realistic situation, the points she make therein are tortuous, poorly constructed, and are more often than not endless variations upon the same theme.</p>
