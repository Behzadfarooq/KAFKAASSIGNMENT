<h2><span class="mw-headline">Is Objectivism a Cult?</span></h2>
<p>That's a good question but it has a lot more to do with the fate of Objectivism as a philosophy and a movement than with the person of Ayn Ran herself, which is the subject of this article. I have replaced a section on this subject in the <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivism_%28Ayn_Rand%29_e3e6.html" title="Objectivism (Ayn Rand)">Objectivism (Ayn Rand)</a> article which had been notable for its lack of source citations. I think the move improves both articles, though the 'cult' section as it now stands is overwrought in including such highly peripheral subjects as L. Ron Hubbard, etc. We can improve it in its new and more appropriate location. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlanchette_8572.html" title="User:Blanchette">Blanchette</a> 21:45, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

The reason why you (and at least one other member of your cult) are failing to win this argument is because you literally have no logic behind your arguments.

<dd>And your argument against them is still ad hominem. They have given evidence (for instance, the claim that we should kill more in Iraq), yet if you don't actually read the sources you wouldn't know that. If you have a problem with their arguments, find some sources arguing in Randism's favor against these accusations. Find some proof for your own opinion. It'll help a lot more than personal attacks will. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 23:48, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There is no such cult. It's a myth that keeps feeding on itself. I don't mind it being in the article at all. I think it's hilarious. And, you help to feed into it. For example, you have called me a "Randist fundamentalist" when I'm not even an Objectivist. You find someone that looks like he may be interested in learning about Rand's philosophy or that may agree with a few of Rand's points and you automatically accuse them of being a member of this mythical "cult." But, it's all in your head. You want their to be some kind of "cult" out there worshipping Ayn Rand, but it just doesn't exist. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 01:15, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Why is it that you are so obsessed with backing her when you yourself admit to not know much about her ideology? You vandalize in her favor despite self-proclaimed ignorance? That's just how cult members act. You and the others who vandalize these articles only help prove there's a cult around Rand.</dd>
<dd>And if you're not that well versed in her work, why are you so quick to back it? Why are you so quick to accuse others of ignorance? Why aren't you open to different interpretations of it? You seem a little too zealous about Rand for me to believe you're seriously not devoted to it yet. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 02:40, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>The cult label would be better applied to <b>Leonard Peikoff</b> and his ARI group than to Objectivism in general, saying that the whole Objectivist movement is a cult is like saying that the Democratic Party is a cult because it promote an ideology and a way of thinking and living in the world. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Fading_Light_2d38.html" title="User:The Fading Light">The Fading Light</a> 23:17, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The sources we have claim that Randism itself is a cult. Peikoff and ARI are pretty cultish, but Rand and her ideology also recieve this criticism. And it's not mere fact that it creates a way of thinking &amp; living that makes it look like a cult; it's because of the very robotic nature of that way, which has the same qualities of a cult (check the Michael Shermer article for more info). -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 23:41, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What is it with all the people obsessed with denigrating Ayn Rand? Don’t you have better things to do? It’s like we’re a global conspiracy obsessed with taking over the world. I’m a fan, I admit. I think her ideas have the potential to change the world for the better. That doesn’t mean I treat Objectivism as a religion. Sure, a few people do, but they are a small minority in my experience. I met Dr Peikoff last year. I was pretty intimidated, but he seemed like a nice guy, genuinely interested in my life. He once remarked that he didn’t like that people always behaved so formally and seriously around him.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, this is a quote from the radio show he used to do regarding the “Objectivism as a cult” discussion. This is what Peikoff said about the "Beethoven Myth" on his radio show:</dd>

<p>"She knew in great detail of the conflicts -- such conflicts or disagreements as there were -- and as long as you could specify what you liked in terms that were understandable in reason (and that were not an assault on reason, as I indicated to you before) there's no such thing.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Power difference fetishism</span></h2>
<p>The source for Ayn Rand endorsing "power difference fetishism" is pretty thin. The only thing I can think of is the scene in The Fountainhead, which lies in interpretation. Rand herself did not view this scene as an endorsement of power difference fetishism. Also, in her view, men being the "metaphysically dominant sex" had nothing to do with "power difference fetishism"; it just meant that due to the nature of a man's anatomy, he is generally the prime mover and initiator in sex (see the section on sex in Ayn Rand Answers). This is a long way from "power difference fetishism." <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELaszloWalrus_c9d2.html" title="User:LaszloWalrus">LaszloWalrus</a> 17:26, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><a name="Sexual_discrimination" id="Sexual_discrimination"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sexual discrimination</span></h2>
<p>Ayn Rand never defended the right to discriminate based on sexual preference. Yes, one can infer that she WOULD have defended this right, but she never did so explicitly. Likewise, one could infer what her position would have been on many issues she never wrote explicitly about, but let's keep this verifiable. <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELaszloWalrus_c9d2.html" title="User:LaszloWalrus">LaszloWalrus</a> 17:31, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, actually, she did. She opposed and laws that would interfere. Please stop whitewashing. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus"><font color="darkcyan">Al</font></a> 17:35, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>From what I understand of Miss Rand's views on sexuality is that she was opposed to any government interference in the sex lives of adults but that she considered things like homosexuality to be "sick" and never formally renounced this view in public. So I'm not sure if we should even bother putting her into the either or categories about LGBT support and opposition. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Fading_Light_2d38.html" title="User:The Fading Light">The Fading Light</a> 18:22, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>This has been hashed out over time to a stable compromise. She's not at all neutral on LGBT issues, but her view was somewhat mixed. Therefore, she supports LGBT rights in some senses, opposes them in the rest. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus"><font color="darkcyan">Al</font></a> 18:56, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Vandalism</span></h2>
<p>LaszloWalrus recently reverted the article, citing "rv v". This is a blatant lie. There was no vandalism to revert. In fact, the version he tried to remove had a long explanatory edit comment and itself only rearranged and added to previous content. In short, LaszloWalrus intentionally left a deceptive edit comment, which is in violation of Wikirules. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus"><font color="darkcyan">Al</font></a> 21:11, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Cult section</span></h2>
<p>There's been some reverting on the title of the cult section. Those who favor Rand seem to support "Is Objectivism a cult?". Others, including myself, favor "Objectivism as a cult". Note that nobody is suggesting "Objectivism as a cult" or "The Objectivism Cult", which would be asserting the controversial claim that Objectivism is a cult.</p>
<p>My feeling is that a question mark is inappropriate for a section heading. In contrast, "Objectivism <i>as</i> a cult" is about Objectivism taken as a cult, whether or not it genuinely qualifies. This seems accurate and neutral. What's your opinion? <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus"><font color="darkcyan">Al</font></a> 21:44, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Objectivism <i>as</i> a cult" creates a POV that Objectivism is designed to fuction as a cultic group (like <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a>) when there is only one group in the Objectivist movement that could be called a cult (the Ayn Rand Institute) and they are in the minority. "Is Objectivism a cult?" is the more neutral choice and is the one that I support. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Fading_Light_2d38.html" title="User:The Fading Light">The Fading Light</a> 23:46, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The claim that Scientology is a cult is just as much a controversial POV as the parallel claim about Objectivism. Both organizations have been viewed as cults, so we can speak "X as a cult" for either with equal accuracy. Again, this heading does not assert that X <i>is</i> a cult, only that it is viewed <i>as</i> one. A question mark, on the other hand, implies that the question will be answered, which is untrue. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus"><font color="darkcyan">Al</font></a> 01:58, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's no consensus. Mainstream academic philosophy rejects it. Sources which are concidered legit for Wikipedia's use say it is not a philosophy but a cult. To pick and choose which sources to trust is to make the article POV, and thus go against the rules of Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>Again, the Randist agenda is put above making a NPOV article. We're not calling ID science just because ID supporters call it that, nor because they can provide sources saying it is one. Likewise, if the vast majority of academic philosophers reject Randism, then we have a good reason to not refer to Randism as a philosophy, even if you can provide sources saying it is.

<p>LGagnon, would you please stop your anti-randist angry Jihad? It seems you like to pose as a Massachusetts (pseudo)liberal (in which case I suspect it's your own anti-capitalist POV that drives you to such heights of zealotry) even claiming to be "supportive of the ACLU", and yet I've seen few wikipedians as authoritarian and arrogant. For truth's sake, cut off your ultradogmatic, fanatic anti-randism and get a life, man. Reality isn't black and white and Ayn Rand, though not without fault, is not the devil. You may not share her ideas (and even I don't, to a great extent), but trying to impose your views in such an authoritarian and overbearing way, without a minimal respect for other people's beliefs and with such contempt for consensus (e.g. decrying anyone who disagrees with you as a Randie-tainted POVist), that's way too much.

<p>Hm. Firstly, I admit of being more forthright than desired, and perhaps should have worded it differently. Feel free to dissmiss the most pungent bits and retain just the critique, LGagnon. Secondly, and just for the record: I'm not an Objectivist, far from it. At any rate, your comment "I consider 'Randists' to be illogical" seems pretty much an ad hominem attack against true Objectivists, disguised by syntactic choice. <i>That</i> is the sort of thing that irked me so much about your attitude.<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustice_III_359d.html" title="User:Justice III">Justice III</a> 01:02, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My point with calling them illogical was to further point out the problem with all the personal attacks on this page. Not only do they violate policy, but they make the person using them rhetorically weaker due to the illogical nature of them. And given that almost every (if not every) Randist here used them (as well as every Randist I've met outside of Wikipedia), I have come to believe that they always resort to such things. Now, I'm willing to be disproven on this, but there's going to have to be some effort on the other editors' behalves for that to happen. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 01:33, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First, the section title could be "Of objectivism as a cult", which would not be misinterpreted. Without something else, "Objectivism as a cult" is easily misread and is stronger than meaning "Looking at objectivism from the perspective of it being a cult". Above, in the first comment of this section, there is even a typo, where it was supposed to read "Objectivism is a cult", as a negation, it instead reads "Objectivism as a cult".</p>
<p>Second, while there could be Objectivist groups that behave like a cult, it is false to state that the philosophy itself (or if you prefer, system of ideas) is a cult. Whereas a <i>religion</i> can be a <i>system of faith</i>, abstractly as ideas, the meaning of the word <i>cult</i> includes the application of the system, in <i>acts</i> of worship or devotion in rites and ceremonies. Unless a person who considers true the Objectivist system of ideas, must necessarily bow down to Ayn Rand and recite John Galt's speech every week (or something, this particular requirement would clearly never gain a cult many followers), Objectivism is not a cult. If Ayn Rand encouraged devotion and rituals about her, then information about that belongs in this article, but that does not mean that "Objectivism" is a cult, and if it is primarily other cultish individuals or groups who profess to adhere to Objectivism then information about that belongs in their respective articles. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>Talk</i></a> 01:04, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But "Is Objectivism a cult?" also sounds bad for the Randists. It's kind of like those Fox News headlines that read "Is John Kerry a communist?" Calling the section "Objectivism as a cult" actually sounds nicer for the Randists.</dd>
<dd>No, a cult does not have to be religious. Read the <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">Cult</a> article, which says it doesn't have to be. And given that we have sources cited accusing Randism of being a cult, it stays in the article. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 01:43, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was recommending "Of Objectivism as a cult", not a question, and it doesn't matter what's "nicer".</dd>
<dd>Actually, the <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">Cult</a> article begins by defining a cult as a "group of people" devoted to certain practices and separates it from the "novel belief system" that they believe in. If it used the term in the way it is applied here to Objectivism, the article would state that a cult <i>is</i> a "novel belief system". The article then goes on to talk about "brainwashing" and "mind control", which again do not apply to the system of <i>ideas</i>, and then to its generalized use to refer to anything strange or non-mainstream and things like "cult of personality" , which if they apply to Objectivism apply just as well to anime and Magic cards, and just about any political figure. In the relevant uses, under "secular cult opposition", it describes it as any group that tends to "manipulate, exploit, and control", again, a <i>group of people</i> not simply ideas, and then in the sociology of religion it defines it as a <i>religious group</i> with novel beliefs and high tensions with the rest of society, and with this we don't even need to get into whether Objectivism is a religion or not, because nevertheless it must be <i>a group of people</i>.</dd>
<dd>I never asserted that a cult must be a "religion", though it is not clear what you mean by that. Regardless, "Objectivism" is not a cult, using the meanings given in the <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">Cult</a> article. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>Talk</i></a> 02:16, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This article doesn't have to call it a "novel belief system" for it to be one; that is pretty obvious on its own. Brainwashing and mind control are shown as examples of one technique (psychological and financial exploitation, which could be argued to happen in Randism), not as requirements for a cult. And no, a cult of personality would not apply to anime or Magic, because they have no personality; Randism, with Rand at the helm, does have one. And who says Randism doesn't "manipulate, exploit, and control", or doesn't have high tensions with the rest of society? Again, we've got sources cited that back these up. And yes, there's a group of people: the Randists. They may usually work separately (such as the ARI or another group), but they are often in a group, and they all work together towards the same goal of getting Randism treated as real philosophy. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 03:01, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I did not assert that Objectivism is not a "novel belief system", nor did I assert that as a reason why "Objectivism" is not a cult. Yes, brainwashing and mind control are examples of one technique; I mentioned it in order to be fairly complete as to the statements of the article, it is one of many criteria that "Objectivism" does not meet. I did not assert that anime or Magic were cults of personality, I asserted that groups centered around them could qualify as "strange" or "non-mainstream" under that meaning of "cult". The "political figure" separately relates to "cult of personality". Please be more careful in reading. "Randism" is a set of ideas; as <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">Cult</a> states, it is <i>groups</i> who "manipulate, exploit, and control". Whatever your philosophy, an idea either sits in a realm of its own or it is present only in the minds of people, who do something about it. The ideas <i>do</i> nothing.</dd>
<dd>As is reasonable, most of the sources state that there are groups of Rand followers who act like cults. This does not mean that "Objectivism" is a cult. They talk about the "Ayn Rand cult", "the Objectivist subculture...of Rand's sychophants", "the Objectivist movement". This does not mean that the set of ideas is a cult. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>Talk</i></a> 03:42, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Scientology is a set of ideas too, but is also accused of being a cult. And yes, the ideas do something; that's what the psychological exploitation is about. Randism has been accused of being a cult since the early days. Even before the ARI it was accused of such. Thus, it doesn't need the groups to be accused of it. And there are still sources that specifically call Randism a cult; you're just ignoring the ones that do. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 04:14, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>The Church of Scientology, which as the article notes is often referred to simply as "Scientology", is accused of being a cult, but the ideas themselves cannot be (although there is an important distinction here in that the "Hidden Truths" of Scientology can only be seen by joining and being a part of the Church of Scientology, whereas the fundamental texts of Objectivism are available at the library, or can be ordered online. Still, the ideas are not a cult.).</dd>
<dd>The ARI is not necessary for having a cult. As some of the sources in the article are talking about, this cult can consist of people who knew Rand and joined her. Even saying "The Objectivist movement as a cult" would make more sense. The only source that states that "Objectivism" is a cult is from the non-notable M.R.M. Parrott from his writings, apparently published only online, though regardless produced by his own company. It should be taken out of the article anyway for these reasons. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a> 06:13, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the choice is between Objectivism and the Objectivist movement. The movement started with Objectivism, but branched out into things which are, depending who you ask, not strictly regarded as Objectivism. We know that the original Objectivism was considered cultlike by a few notable people (Rothbard, for example), but I don't know off-hand whether the same has been said of Kelley's organization, for example. I think, on the whole, we're quite safe just going with something along the lines of "Objectivism has been viewed as a cult by X, Y and Z". <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus"><font color="darkcyan">Al</font></a> 14:53, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Where does Rothbard say this? He repeatedly refers to the "Rand cult", and he mentioned one thing about "Objectivist Psychotherapy", but this is not the same thing as asserting that a mere set of ideas is a cult. "Rand followers as a cult" may be accurate (and it would actually make sense to include this in the Ayn Rand article), not "Objectivism as a cult". —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a> 22:18, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yeah, that's false. Objectivism is the "philosophy" of Ayn Rand, so to follow Objectivism, you must follow Rand, in precisely the same way that a Kantian follows Kant. You don't have to be a member of the ARI or TAS or any other specific group, though, and I never said you did. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus"><font color="darkcyan">Al</font></a> 14:32, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So everyone who agrees with Kant is a cultist? What are you talking about? A person needs to join a group in order to be part of a cult.

<dd>I don't know what you mean by "Randists", but "Objectivism"—being ideas rather than any collection of individuals—cannot be a cult. An "Objectivist", being a person who believes in Objectivism, is not ipso facto a cultist. If "Randists" were the people who personally knew Ayn Rand and joined her in some "Objectivist movement" in the 1950's and 60's, then the sources, to varying degrees and in varying particulars, say that they behaved like a cult, though I do not know if "Randists" would be the accurate term for that group. None of this implies the unique mutation of language and meaning inherent in saying that "Objectivism is a cult". None of this requires that an "Objectivist", a person who considers Objectivism true, be a cultist. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a> 05:22, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Of course it can be a cult; Scientology is considered one, and it too is a collection of ideas. And the ideas are controlled by the people involved with them, who do, in fact, fit into a group. It may not be a singluar formal group, but it is a group nonetheless. And I'm not referring to only Rand's collective; I mean all Randists form a singular group to which we are capable of giving a name. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 15:28, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have already explained why the Scientology ideology is not a cult, and why Scientology is usually shorthand for the Church of Scientology, which can be a cult, and why even then it is not analogous to Rand-related organizations. As for group, it is part of the meaning of cult and part of all that I have stated above that the group must be cohesive and have mutual relations.

<dd>Ethnically, yes, Rand was Jewish. She was born into a Russian Jewish family, although her parents were not particularly observant. As an adult, Rand did not practice Judaism as a religion, since she became an atheist at an early age. A number of Rand's close associates over the years, including Nathaniel Branden, Barbara Branden, Leonard Peikoff, and Alan Greenspan, have also been ethnic, but non-religious, Jews. Many of the newest generation of Objectivists are also ethically Jewish - Yaron Brook, the president of the Ayn Rand Institute is an Israeli immigrant.</dd>

<p>Great article. One thing lacking for me was a mention of how and when Rand learned English. The article mentions her studying French as a girl, but how would a 21-year-old Russian woman (well after the ease of learning a new language diminishes) be able to come to the U.S. and immediately try a career in screenwriting (not to mention write many books in flawless Enlgish) if she hadn't already had intense instruction in English? I'm sure she must have studied it in Russia. Can someone elaborate, even with a few words, in the article?

<dd>A quick google turn this up:
<dl>
<dd>After several stops in western European cities, Rand arrived in New York City in February 1926. From New York, she traveled on to Chicago, Illinois, where she spent the next six months living with relatives, learning English, and developing ideas for stories and movies. She had decided to become a screenwriter, and, having received an extension to her visa, she left for Hollywood, California.

Is there evidence that her editors helped her a bit? I know a lot about language acquisition, and it's very difficult (though not impossible) to acquire language to the level she did if you start at age 20 or so. I don't say this to doubt her (obviously she was fluent in English), but rather that it's notable that she started learning so late (if she did; my hunch is she had instruction in Russia too) and learned it so fluently, and that deserves a mention of some kind. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 18:29, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Here's some original research. When I lived in NYC, I was exposed to lots of Russian immigrants, and plenty spoke fluent (though not accentless) English despite being in their late teens or early twenties when they arrived. Typically, they have a basic conversational grasp of English in the first year. Some older immigrants were also quite fluent in English (though usually with worse accents) due to learning it in the FSR. I don't have a clue as to whether Rand was exposed to English to any extent when she was younger, but it's certainly not implausible.</dd>
<dd>In short, according to my limited and second-hand experience, the speed at which Rand learned English was nothing special. And, to be frank, the popularity of her novels comes more from their content than the writing itself. She knew just how to pander to teens. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus"><font color="darkcyan">Al</font></a> 03:52, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Again like so many other places you make an assumption based on your system of personal view. Thankfully you are incorrect and Rand has more than been credited with being a profound author or merit, to all age groups. The fact the fortunately some younger people find the value and truth of life within the pages of her writing is further proof of the grasp of the Human condition. And to be frank, your opinion cannot be placed as fact, just conjecture on your part and to be blunt as well as frank, your postings are just that pandering to the few who are only here to provide negative content. <a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMystar_a512.html" title="User:Mystar">Mystar</a> 16:55, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

 Again.... seeing as how you seem to miss the point :) your "reasearch"..fine, but as I said you are attempting to push your conjecture as factual rather than empirically derived. Case in point, " And, to be frank, the popularity of her novels comes more from their content than the writing itself.  She knew just how to pander to teens". Simply a derisive conjecture, aimed at demeaning her abilities and style. You could more than easily have said, I feel that her works speak, or I felt her style was to pander to.... Rather than forcing people to take your commentary as if you have a source that is solid and irrefutable.

<dd>Successful authors combine a variety of skills to create text that readers like. A few are masters of the written word and can make a laundry list riveting. Many succeed on the basis of skillful characterization, dialogue, or plotting. Others enrich their work with insider knowledge, technical expertise or literary references.</dd>
<dd>And then there are to ones who start with an ideology and construct their stories with the primary purpose of proselytization. Both Goodkind and Rand are a fine example of this last strategy, which means that they do not rely so heavily on the things that make a good in general. So long as the readers are swallowing the ideology, they're not going to pay lots of attention to the vehicle anyhow.</dd>
<dd>Now, if you want to take insult at my literary criticism, I can't stop you, but you'd be guilty of assuming bad faith. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus"><font color="darkcyan">Al</font></a> 16:44, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's a really, really naïve (though pretty common) mistake to believe that only opponents have an "ideology" that they spread to enthrall young minds into partaking of their evil plan to rule the world...wuhahaha. Lefties only see ideology in their right-wing opponents (those Bourbon fascists), conservatives think that only leftism is an "ideology", often referred to with contempt (look that lil' liberal hogwash!). Seldom will someone honestly describe their own worldview as an "ideology". Well, truth is, everyone has an ideology of their own, and it is even more obvious that it will be reflected on their writings. What's the problem here? If these writers eventually gain "adepts", it doesn't mean they are hitlerish cult leaders searching for spiritual slaves; it just means that several people have identified themselves with those books and/or characters. Again, I see no problem with that. In fact, using the same criteria you're using here, <a href="../../../n/i/e/Nietzsche.html" title="Nietzsche">Nietzsche</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/l/Tolstoi.html" title="Tolstoi">Tolstoi</a>, and even Sallinger should be dismissed as whacky Waco drinkers of the <a href="../../../k/o/o/Kool-aid.html" title="Kool-aid">kool-aid</a>... I don't consider Ayn Rand to be any literary genius, but she was no Dan Rather, either. Let's be fair. (Sure you haven't been mistaking her for <a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleister_Crowley_151e.html" title="Aleister Crowley">Aleister Crowley</a> all allong? Just asking. And yet, you see - <i>that guy</i> is on every category: possible, including "Pederastic poetry" but <b>not</b> on "Cult leaders"! ha!

<dd>I just finished reading a novel that was very well written and engaging, but had no apparent ideology. Books <i>can</i> be ideologogically neutral, or nearly so, while still being good books. In fact, they can often be <i>better</i> books this way because, on the one hand, the author is free to go where the characters want instead of twisting the plot to fit the message being sold and, on the other, the author has to make the book sink or swim on its own merits rather than riding the coattails of ideological agreement. However, Rand is not one such author: she writes with the primary goal of pushing her ideology and it shows. Her writing has routinely been criticized for its lack of literary merit, from cardboard characters to endless, self-idulgent monologues. Similar criticism dogs Goodkind, as his books follow very much in Rand's mold. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus"><font color="darkcyan">Al</font></a> 22:02, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In the article text you can indicated that some sources consider her a cult leader because one can rebut that with sources that don't agree --the reader is made aware that there is not a consensus on the matter. But, that's not the case with the Category tag. It places her in a "List of cult leaders" with no way to indicate to the audience that there is not a consensus on the matter from sources.

<dd>If a cult formed around Ayn Rand, that's very interesting and bears mentioning in an article about her and her life -- but I fail to see how that is a criticism. Cults happen because an individual is born with a tremendous amount of personal charisma, but this charismatic power is focussed within a small to medium size group of people. Compare to charismatic leaders like Hitler, JFK, Mao, Mohammed, Jesus, etc., whose power to influence and lead was strong enough to influence whole nations or even continents. Anyway, as these examples point out, a person's charisma has nothing to do with whether or not their ideas are right or wrong. --<a href="../../../j/s/c/User%7EJscherer_0de2.html" title="User:Jscherer">Jscherer</a> 06:12, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Note that these cult-accusing sources are primarily referring to a cult of personality around Rand and a devoted, exclusive group of people considered strange. The issue is whether this constitutes reason to include Ayn Rand in a category that is about cult leaders—many of whom proclaimed themselves as the messiah—of religious, apocalyptic, and suicidal cults—many of which revolving around of aliens—which are nothing like the cult accusations in the Rand sources. Even the most "normal" of persons listed in Category:Cult leaders—that is, aside from the overwhelming majority which are involved in murders, suicides, or messiah claims—are still the heads of religious groups or seclude themselves with their followers in communes in the woods. <a href="../../../l/2E/_/L._Ron_Hubbard_3ec8.html" title="L.

<dd>There are a lot of problems with that category. What about the very many important historical cult figures who are missing?

Instead, the category contains a lot of modern-day secular figures like Lyndon LaRouche, who just happen to have a lot of devoted followers. Cults are basically religious or mystical in nature. Sure, the word "cult" is frequently used to describe secular leaders as well, but this a loose usage of the word. Even crazies like David Koresh always have some mystical or religious part of their belief system. You can't confuse the fact of someone being charismatic with their being the leader of a cult. I know this seems to contradict what I said before -- but before I looked at that category page, I thought we <i>were</i> using the term loosely. --<a href="../../../j/s/c/User%7EJscherer_0de2.html" title="User:Jscherer">Jscherer</a> 13:56, 25 June 2006 (UTC) p.s. what about <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Baker_Eddy_01fc.html" title="Mary Baker Eddy">Mary Baker Eddy</a>? <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigham_Young_eeef.html" title="Brigham Young">Brigham Young</a>? etc.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">plot spoiler</span></h2>
<p>With all the debate about Ayn Rand as a philosophical (rather than literary) figure, I think something has been overlooked -- namely, that the section on "Atlas Shrugged" contains a blatant plot spoiler. A good two-thirds of the book centers around the mysterious disappearance of wealthy industrialists who are the "motor" of the world. Dagny, the main character, is enganged in a frantic search for the "destroyer" who is taking away these people. There's a tremendous amount of suspense -- it reads almost like a mystery novel.</p>
<p>I recently picked up Atlas Shrugged, knowing next to nothing about Ayn Rand, and I got very caught up in the story. When I was halfway through the book, I came to this Wikipedia article to find out more about Ayn Rand herself, her philosophies, etc. Imagine my disappointment when the short paragraph on Atlas Shrugged gave away what was happening to all the industrialists! I would have expected that from the article on Atlas Shrugged itself (which contains a proper spoiler warning). However this article is about Ayn Rand, and I didn't expect the secret of the first 2/3rds of the book to be revealed here.</p>
<p>I'm going to change it now, but I'm adding this comment so the folks who are watching over this article know my rationale. Thanks. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.108.19.219 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.108.19.219_b1c8.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.108.19.219">contribs</a>) 04:57, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>The new revision does not seem to convey the meaning as well, which is the purpose of the mention. Is it sufficient to, as the article does now, only make the point that the economy collapses with their disappearance, or should it still say something about the industrialists wilfully leaving society? If the latter is the case, would it be sufficient to say that they just "leave" or "disappear", without saying anything, on the one hand, about the mystery of it, and on the other hand, about going on the strike and the mountain hideaway? —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 06:00, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to the blurb on the stamp fair use template, stamps shouldn't be used to illustrate articles on the subject of the stamp but rather to illustrate the stamp itself. Since this article really doesn't talk about the stamp itself, the stamp image should be removed. The alternative is to talk a little about the stamp (was it particularly controversial, for instance?) and then illustrating that with the stamp would appear much fairer as fair use. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 20:03, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>One accusation (it was more of a throw-away comment) in the BBC is not several, or even a couple of accusation from reputeable sources. As to the subject that started this: Ayn Rand and objectivism: There have been several noteable persons, both former objectivists, and outsiders who have leveled that claim. I personnally do not feel that Objectivism as a movement is a cult ANY LONGER (though it was rather cult like prior to her death), I do recognize however that it is VERY common criticism; it is of course challenged as well. To NOT inculde such information simply because it is challenged is ridiculous.--<a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECourtland_Nerval_7f9f.html" title="User:Courtland Nerval">Courtland Nerval</a> 17:36, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I haven't misunderstood at all. During Rand's life and after one of the most common criticisms against her and Objectivism was that it was at the very least Cult-Like. Is there a consensus saying that it was a cult when Rand was alive? NO, but you will find many more sources supporting that claim then you will supporting the claim that Objectivism is a cult now. Its not one of 2 people or a even a slew of whack-jobs, there are many reputeable sources form both inside and outside the movement that made that claim and lets be frank, Rand's behavior amidst her close associates did nothing to dispell those accusations. The fact is that the claim is disputed, but not so heavily as to make the accusation lack weight. --<a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECourtland_Nerval_7f9f.html" title="User:Courtland Nerval">Courtland Nerval</a> 19:14, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree entirely. I'm not sure what it would take to get a consensus (a consensus of whom?!) but there is clearly a non-fringe opinion that she is a cult leader.

<p>I don't have much of an opinion for or against Ayn Rand, but I am reading her book at the moment, so I'm trying to weigh in here with some common sense. Consulting dictionary.com, I see there are two very different senses for the word "cult":</p>
<p>Sense 1. A religion or religious sect generally considered to be extremist or false, with its followers often living in an unconventional manner under the guidance of an authoritarian, charismatic leader (or, the followers of such a religion or sect)</p>
<p>Senses 2 through 4 also have to do with religion. Senses 5 and 6 are probably more what people think of w/r/t Ayn Rand or Lyndon LaRouch:</p>
<p>5. Obsessive, especially faddish, devotion to or veneration for a person, principle, or thing (or the object of such devotion) 6. An exclusive group of persons sharing an esoteric, usually artistic or intellectual interest.</p>
<p>What I think is interesting about the Cult Leaders category is that the list contains about 90% "cult leaders" in sense 1. However, scattered throughout, there are a few "cult leaders" from senses 5 and 6. It seems to me that if you want to have a meaningful category of cult religious leaders, you should eliminate from the category people like Lyndon LaRouche -- it's confusing. From what I understand, Anton LaVey probably shouldn't be in there either, since his "church" was really just an ironic and tongue-in-cheek media stunt.</p>
<p>I mean, let's be honest -- some kid comes to wikipedia and says "Hey, I want to find a list of wacky cult leaders who poisoned their followers or said they were the messiah and murdered a bunch of people." They click around and find this list, and start gleefully reading about various wackos on that list. Then they click on Ayn Rand. Their reaction -- "who is this? Some kind of philosopher or writer or something? Whatever..." It's just not the same thing. --<a href="../../../j/s/c/User%7EJscherer_0de2.html" title="User:Jscherer">Jscherer</a> 22:05, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Objectivism has been accused of being a cult as per the first definition, not merely the fifth or sixth. For that matter, I don't believe Wikipedia is the domain of kids who search for cult leaders. A more realistic scenarior is someone investigating the scope of organizations that have been considered cults. Excluding Objectivism here would deprive this hypothetical person. Finally, please understand that your original research is not sufficient basis for making these decisions. We have to operate on what is verifiable, and these cult claims against Objectivism are quite verifiable, regardless of what you might think.

<p>The arguement being used By Jossi is a Non-sequeteur: we haven't added George w. Bush to War criminals or Michael Jackson to Sex offenders therfore we can't list Ayn Rand as a cult leader. This is a non-sequeteur because both of the above stated categories SPECIFICALLY LIST that all individuals on the list have been CONVICTED in some specific legal format of the crime listed. It is not illegal to be a cult leader. There are certainly several behaviors often times associated with cults and cult leaders that ARE illegal, but having a cult and leading it is not, technically speaking, illegal. Thus Alienus's arguement holds sway. Incidentally I didn't get the impression myself that Alienus was attempting to claim ownership of any article (that would be foolish), simply that he has a strong and well reasoned stance on the article that some people take exception too; he is not alone in his stance however. At the end of the day it is unargueable that: 1. There are Several BOOKS that have been written by both former objectivists as well as outsiders accusing it of being a cult. 2. There were many people during Ayn Rand's own lifetime that accused Rand, the collective, and objectivism being cult like (in senses 1, 5, &amp; 6.) 3. ONe of the most common criticisms of objectivism is that it is a cult, or cultish. Even if this is a minority viewpoint it is a VERY significant minority, significant enough that the ARI and Peikoff (as well as Rand) saw fit to respond to such criticism. The category should stay, and judging by the vote so far probably will...--<a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECourtland_Nerval_7f9f.html" title="User:Courtland Nerval">Courtland Nerval</a> 13:57, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Saying that my concerns are baseless, do not make them so. The fact that there are two or three sources that describe Objectivism as a "cult" is not disputed. The inclusion of a person in a category is, based on violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> in which it is described that:
<ul>
<li><b>The policy requires that, where there are or have been conflicting views, these should be presented fairly, but not asserted.</b>;</li>
<li><b>NPOV says that the article should fairly represent all significant viewpoints, in proportion to the prominence of each. Now an important qualification: Articles that compare views need not give minority views as much or as detailed a description as more popular views</b>&#160;; and</li>
<li><b>Undue weight applies to more than just viewpoints. Just as giving undue weight to a viewpoint is not neutral, so is giving undue weight to other verifiable and sourced statements</b></li>

<p>As I said, nothing you add can take away the existence of a significant minority that considers Objectivism to be a cult, not even a selective reading of NPOV. The cure for biased selection, of course, is to point out what was omitted. The section goes on to define three types of views:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>If a viewpoint is in the majority, then it should be easy to substantiate it with reference to commonly accepted reference texts;</li>
<li>If a viewpoint is held by a significant minority, then it should be easy to name prominent adherents;</li>
<li>If a viewpoint is held by an extremely small (or vastly limited) minority, it doesn't belong in Wikipedia (except perhaps in some ancillary article) regardless of whether it's true or not; and regardless of whether you can prove it or not.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Before the residents of Jonestone drank the Kool-Aid, the idea that Jones was running a cult was a viewpoint held by a significant minority, with prominent people nameable. It was therefore sufficient to place the group in the cult category. We didn't have to wait until after the mass murder/suicide, when the view became even more popular and was held by the majority, to acknowledge what was already expounded by a significant number of people.</p>
<p>At this time, the belief that Objectivism is a cult is likewise at the level of a significant minority, as we can name a few prominant, notable people who assert it, as well as the books and articles that they assert this in. Therefore, failing to report their beliefs would be giving undue weight to those who do not regard Objectivism as a cult. This is the case even if the ARI never does get around to nuking Moscow.</p>

<p>Jossi. No one is trying to Bypass NPOV (well, at least I know I am not). You might try looking at the category in question.

<p>1. NO it doesn't only apply to Rand, that is the disclaimer that is already on the category page, which Rand has Just removed from. There are MANY MANY people who disagree with Rael being placed on the list as well as others. If we use Jossi's standards Yahweh Ben Yahweh and just about everyone else will have to come off except Jim Jones and Charles Manson.</p>
<p>2. It wouldn't matter if it DID only apply to Rand since the disclaimer is on the category page, and then the individual arguements pro and con are listed on each individuals page.

<p>Court's right, of course. If we raise the bar arbitrarily high, we'll cut the list down to one or two people, thus making is useless. Let me repeat a point that has been ignored over and over again: membership on a list is not a de facto claim of truth. I'll give you a good example.</p>
<p>Contrary to what many people seem to think, Richard M. Nixon was never impeached. He would have been, but he stepped down before it could happen. In contrast, Bill Clinton <i>was</i> impeached, but this is equivalent to an indictment, not a conviction, so he remained President. These are fine points, and when someone is searching for impeached presidents, both of these people should show up, even though it's not technically accurate in Nixon's case. This is because the purpose of categories is to aid in searches and they explicitly do not make claims of truth.</p>
<p>Yes, we shouldn't include someone in a category that's unrelated to them, but if we have a well-cited minority viewpoint that favors inclusion, this must suffice. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus"><font color="darkcyan">Al</font></a> 18:09, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The category is clearly not going to be deleted if the vote is any indicator. I am still waiting to read a <b>reasoned</b> arguement that doesn't just consist of someone saying "thats not WP:NPOV or WP:V". I would really like them to show <i>WHY</i> they feel that is the case and go about proving it. It seems to me that those who oppose the list in general, and Ayn Rand being on it specifically, are <b>Assuming BAD FAITH</b> by everyone who disagrees with them. This may not be the case (and I am not making any accusations), but that is how it appears to me. I would really like to read a well reasoned and explanatory arguement <i>against</i> putting Rand on the list, that won't involve lending undue weight to Rand's Supporters.</p>
<p><b>Cult</b> is not just a pejorative word: it has an objective definition that we can look at and compare to the groups in question. Objectivism, especially under Rand, seems to unargueably fit one of those categories to a tee, and argueably 3 of them.

<p>The disclaimer was added two days ago as a result of intensive focus on the category in these discussions. Applying these criteria would leave many persons. The first two articles in the category, actually, undeniably would belong in the category (cult suicide, self-proclaimed prophet and murderer). There are numerous more, I have looked through every article in that category, and only a minor few are questionable, and all but one of those minor few (LaRouche) are still proclaiming a religion. All but one of the Ayn Rand "cult" sources are not talking about the meaning of cult used in all of these articles, and in the cult article. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 20:21, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Sense 1. A religion or religious sect generally considered to be extremist or false, with its followers often living in an unconventional manner under the guidance of an authoritarian, charismatic leader (or, the followers of such a religion or sect)</p>
<p>Senses 2 through 4 also have to do with religion. Senses 5 and 6 are probably more what people think of w/r/t Ayn Rand or Lyndon LaRouch:</p>
<p>5. Obsessive, especially faddish, devotion to or veneration for a person, principle, or thing (or the object of such devotion) 6. An exclusive group of persons sharing an esoteric, usually artistic or intellectual interest.""</p>
<p>5&amp;6 fit objectivism under Ayn Rand like a glove. Hell they fit the ARI TODAY like a glove. and Objectivism as a whole can argueably fit into both of those categories. These are all valid, definable uses of the word cult. SImply because you do not want her on the list is not sufficient reason to exclude her. Now, please do me the favor of actually RESPONDING to my above objections, and actually giving a good reasoned arguement for exclusion that does not hinge on argueing WP:NPOV or WP:V without any backup or explanation. --<a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECourtland_Nerval_7f9f.html" title="User:Courtland Nerval">Courtland Nerval</a> 20:40, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I continue to disagree. We are not taking about a mere characterization, but one with inmense negative connotations. As such, and as reponsible editors, we need to exercise caution. That is why despite the fact that the category will very likely not be deleted, I will still argue for a criteria for inclusion based on wide consensus of sources. Otherwise, people with a negative POV about a person, will push that POV to get their object of criticism listed on a category of "cult leaders", and associated with undesirable people that the term clearly implies, based on a <b>minority viewpoint</b>. Not an option, as it is in contradiction with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 20:51, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It doesn't matter whether you think it's a cult. Our POVs do not matter because it's not our job to judge. Our job is to report, and we must report the fact that there are a number of notable sources that call it a cult. Anything else would violate WP:NPOV.

<p>Uhm, WP:NPOV <i>requires</i> use to report minority views. However, it requires that we not claim that they are majority views.
