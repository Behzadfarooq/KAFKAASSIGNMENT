<p>Note: I tried to list the Ayyubid rulers in the shorter versions of their names, rather than the full versions. In some cases, though, especially in the minor rulers at the end, I wasn't sure which name they would actually be known by, so I guessed based on the way the rulers I was more familiar with are named.</p>
<p>Also, I can't find a list of the Ayyubid rulers of the Jezireh (Northern Iraq). Any help on that would be good. <a href="../../../j/l/k/User%7EJlk7e_f298.html" title="User:Jlk7e">john</a> 04:57 May 2, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, it's three years later, and still no list of Ayyubid rulers of the Jezireh. Sigh. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 14:30, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>--- Is it really necessary to use the Columbia Encyclopedia for a reference to his Kurdish ancestry? That's just some other encyclopedia. They have the same sources we do and they don't go into any further detail. (In my mind it's not even the type of thing that needs a reference, apparently only Turks believe he wasn't Kurdish...) <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 16:24, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>All Ayyubid sultans had Arabic names, and the last one ,Turanshah, had a Turkish name. What are the references saying Ayyubid dynasty was a Kurdish dynasty? Are there any written document from that era proving that? Without any reference, anything written here can't go beyond being a point of opinion.</p>
<p>Ibn Asir who was a historian at the same time of Ayyubid dynasty confirms that this family were of kurdish origin.About names majority of muslims had arabic names, and Turanshah is persian name which composed of two persian word Turan and Shah and actually this names Turanshah, Gilanshah and Kermanshah ,Iranshah were common in Iran at era, It just reamins one question why a kurdish tribal leader chose such a name for his son because kurdish names were different.Another point is that uncle of salaheddin was Shirkuh which is a classical kurdish name and even nowadays are used between kurds.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Thats not true, "Shirkoh" is not a kurdish name, but an iranian name as origin! Another error in your claims, Turanshah is not persian. Turan is a turkish word and shah means ruler, so it is a combined word. I was searching on google and i could not find a single proof that "Shirkoh" is used as a kurdish name nowadays. Despite that, Saladins family was mixed, there were turks, kurds and arabs. Can you show me some sources that Saladin spoke about his kurdish origin? Saladin not even spoke kurdish, but arabian language. So what makes him kurdish, if he even didnt lived the kurdish kulture? I could not see one single convincing source for the claims in the article. --LACongress 07:21, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know what do you mean?Kurdish is an Iraniac language and that is clear that kurdish names must have Iranic language root.But some kurdish names (although have clear meaning in other Iranic languages)are specific just to Kurds names like Barzan,Rezgar,Hiwa,Hemen,...and Shirkuh.Shirkuh is a very well known kurdish name between kurds.</dd>

</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And everybody knows Turan is a classical Iranian geographical name and has no root in any turkish language. TuranShah is a persian name,thats completely clear.About your claim that there is no source to prove that he spoke Kurdish is very strange,so can we claim that because there is no document to prove that malikshah to be turk, just because</dd>
<dd>there is no source to prove that he spoke Turkic.By this logic origin of majority of turkic rulers became doubtful,Anyway do you like Kasravi or not?if you do,please check the book Shahryaran e Gomnam , in that he proves the origin of Ayubid dynasty.(Kasravi was an azeri from tabriz and he din't like kurds at all) If you do not like kasravi,ok check Ibn Asir, because it is the main source that all historian refer to it and prove that that family is kurdish origin.</dd>

<dd>1)Shirkuh is a kuridish name, and kurdish language is a branch of Iranic languages.</dd>
<dd>2)Iranian has two meaning,citizens of country of Iran which has nothing to do with linguistics and a linguistic classification which kurdish is a branch of this language family so kurds are Iranic people in the second meaning and some of kurds are citizens of Iran by the first meaning.</dd>
<dd>3)ethnicity has nothing to do with genetics, this was fabricated by panturks and has no scientific base,those who speaking an Iranic language are part of Iranic people(in linguistical meaning).</dd>
<dd>4)If those nomads were not Arab or Turk,so they were Iranics,and in Iran there are only three major iranic nomadic group, Kurds,Lurs,Baluches.No baluch or lUrs were in northwestern Iran at that time, so Saladdin family were of kurdish origin.</dd>

These men, having become Kurdicized (means assimilated), emerge in the late fourth/tenth century as the paramount clan among the powerful Hadobanya tribe in Azerbaijan, whence one branch moved to take up residence in the district of Dvin at some point in the eleventh century.
