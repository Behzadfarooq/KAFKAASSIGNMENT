<p>On the festival articles, could you guys also write the Western days of celebration? (its written 19 Masi) but most people are not familiar with the tamil calendar so the western dates would be appreciated.<a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman">Bakaman</a> <sub><a href="../../../b/a/k/User_talk%7EBakasuprman_b63a.html" title="User talk:Bakasuprman">Bakatalk</a></sub> 22:57, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>No. I don't agree. we need a separate page for Ayya Vazhi to describe the religion and a separate page for mythology.It would be like putting <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramayana.html" title="Ramayana">Ramayana</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> in the same article. <a href="../../../r/a/j/User%7ERaj2004_2e07.html" title="User:Raj2004">Raj2004</a> 17:49, 13 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So, as I understand it, the page "Ayya Vazhi Mythology" contains the stories (if you would) from the book <a href="../../../a/k/i/Akilattirattu_Ammanai_eab7.html" title="Akilattirattu Ammanai">Akilattirattu Ammanai</a>, as written by <a href="../../../a/y/y/Ayya_Vaikundar_a30e.html" title="Ayya Vaikundar">Ayya Vaikundar</a>. Correct? If so then, those pages, Ayyavahzi and <a href="../../../a/y/y/Ayyavazhi_mythology.html" title="Ayyavazhi mythology">Ayyavazhi mythology</a>, should be cleaned to that end. I strongly suggest that the difference between the mythology and the religion be more clearly distinguished. One possible, and simple, way to do that would be to retitle the <a href="../../../a/y/y/Ayyavazhi.html" title="Ayyavazhi">Ayyavazhi</a> page to something like The Essential Tenents of Ayya Vazhi. (By the way, is it one word or two, so be consistent there as well.) <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevenwmccrary58_d710.html" title="User:Stevenwmccrary58">Steven McCrary</a> 20:21, July 13, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That's correct. I think the title is fine as it stands. The articles on religions are not titled as the essential tenets of Christianity, etc. Unfortunately, I am a native speaker of English and ayya vazhi religion uses <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamil.html" title="Tamil">Tamil</a> so I am not sure about the spelling. When translating, there's no consistent way to write in English. I have created redirects for both possibilities, ayyavazhi and ayya vazhi.</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestions. Sam Spade and Mel Ettis have been cleaning the article up.</p>

<ul>
<li>Your welcome. I am not convinced about the title. I believe that comparing the title "Ayyavazhi" to the titles "Christianity," "Islam," and "Hinduism," assumes the reader is as familiar with Ayyavazhi as with the others. Generally, this would not be the case, i.e., the average reader would be aware that the terms "Christianity," "Islam," and "Hinduism," are religions, but not aware of that for "Ayyavazhi". "Ayyavazhi" could be a man's name, the capital city of some small Asian village (I was going to say a small town in southeast Missouri (USA), but with that name, who would believe SE Missouri&#160;:-) ), a book, etc. I still believe the title needs revision. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevenwmccrary58_d710.html" title="User:Stevenwmccrary58">Steven McCrary</a> 13:42, July 14, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Steve, you are probably right. That's good suggestion. I didn't know ayya vazhi either until recently. perhaps it should have a suffix, such as Ayyavazhi Faith. I didn't know about <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bahai.html" title="Bahai">Bahai</a> until I attended college. so perhaps adding the word faith would help and then create redirects for people who are familiar with ayyavazhi. If you type in Bahai, it redirects to Bahai faith.</p>
<p>Let's see what Sam and Mel think.</p>

<p>While the proposed merge is being discussed (at <a href="../../../a/y/y/Ayyavazhi_mythology.html" title="Ayyavazhi mythology">Ayyavazhi mythology</a>), could no-one unilaterally remove the notice? My own view is that the merge is probably not a good idea, but tthe issue should be properly discussed before any one person removes the notices and closes the issue. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 09:56, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yea, I have never heard of this religion and it isn't hard to see why. It seems to me as a sect of Hinduism. They believe in the same Hindu trinity (just different names) and it seems like their beliefs are still pretty much Hindu at the fundemental level.<a href="../../../z/a/c/User%7EZachorious_df65.html" title="User:Zachorious">Zachorious</a> 09:52, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Improvements to the English have been made by many contributors. I do not see anything wrong with the English now. Ought not the administrators remove this article from the "need copy-editing" category? <a href="../../../p/m/_/User%7EPM_Poon_6c1e.html" title="User:PM Poon">PM Poon</a> 08:56, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>There is still a grave need for improvement to the English. The second paragraph starts with "Ayyavazhi functions autonomously. But since it was not recognised as a separate religion it was considered as an offshoot of Hinduism only officially and not religiously." This is incorrect English and also doesn't make much sense. Considered? By whom? Since it says officially one can guess it is by the state of India, but this needs to be cleared up. Overall the text reads like Indian English, not as English. I personally find it very annoying and hard to read since I am not from India. <a href="../../../b/o/x/User%7EBoxed_d113.html" title="User:Boxed">boxed</a> 15:38, 9 February 2006 (CET)</p>
<p>I couldn't agree more -- and it's not just the English. The summary section at top gives a casual/lay reader VERY little information. (Anyone ever heard of the "inverse pyramid" principle in journalism? Summary/broadest statements at top, narrowing to details? So if you only read the first paragraph, you get the "most meat"?) The whole bit about "official" recognition and all is simply not comprehensible to someone outside whatever the relevant cultural/social/political sphere is. Someone desperately needs to rewrite the intro in its entireity, pretending there's NO more article below, which encapsulates to a NAIVE reader what Ayyavazhi (religion and/or mythology) IS.

<dd>This is the claim from from the headquarters of Ayyavazhi at Swamithoppe. Also personally, Some five or six years back I found Ayyavazhi told by Valamburi John (வலம்புரி ஜாண்)at <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun_TV_3666.html" title="Sun TV">Sun TV</a> on the program Intha Naal Iniya naal (இந்த நாள் இனிய நாள்) for 15 minutes. There he told that ayyavazhi covers a population of 0.7 million and 7ooo worship centers.

<dd>How do you cite a 'mid 19th century missionary report' for its current 'rapid growth'? - <a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVenu62_2094.html" title="User:Venu62">Parthi</a> 22:40, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also now it's growth is similar to that of earlier days. Saying rightly now it is growing more. But not identified. Because sociologically it was not seen as a seperate religion. Instead seen as other gods in Hinduism. So like other festivals like kumb mela in Kumbakonam and other festival in tiruchendur the festival in Swamithope also seen as a hindu crowd.</dd>

<dd>Even in the early, mid and later ninteenth century, Ayyavazhi is seen only asa part of Hinduism. But not by the cristian missionaries. Because while in the travancore state Hindus were taken to Christianity in hundreds and thousands Ayyavazhi crowd remain stable and screen the people frm converting to christianity. Till the rise of Ayyavazhi, Christianity recorded an out standing growth in Travancore state and in southern parts of tirunelveli. But after Ayyavazhi was a challenge for them. While Hindus undergoes mass convertion Ayyavazhi stood steady. This is the reason why Christian missionaries viewed Ayyavazhi seperate from Hinduism. No other reports says Ayyavazhi because they see it only as hinduism.</dd>

<dd>Even the author of the book Religion and Subaltern Agency mentioned it.

But not able to find even a single.</dd>

<dd>Finally The archive at United Theological College, Banglore was visited to study of London Missionary Society from 1819 to 1900. There they said that, A rich data was collected, both in quality and quantity on Vaikundacami (Vaikundar) and on the religious penomenon (Ayyavazhi).</dd>

<dd>So only the christian missionaries study Ayyavazhi as a religion and all other viewed it as a sect as many others not even consider it saying it was part of hinduism. That is the reason for the growth of Ayyavazhi unknown to the outer world. Still some developements otherside; The leave for Vaikunda Avataram. Do the govt announce leave for three districts to a festival celebrated by a few hundred people&#160;? No, so the growth is felt. But not as a seperate religion instead as a festival inside Hinduism. - <a href="../../../v/a/i/User%7EVaikunda_Raja_cde9.html" title="User:Vaikunda Raja">Vaikunda Raja</a> 00:04, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bala Prajapathi adikalar present considered leader of Ayyavazhi meet the chief minister of Tamil Nadu (before the assembly election) and mentioned about 20% of the followers in the three districts of Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli and Thoothukkudi. This news form the head line of the evening news papers of Kanyakumari like(அய்யாவழி மக்கள் ஓட்டு யாருக்கு). So as per this the collective population of three dists were more than 50 lakhs and 20 per cent of this cross over a million</p>
<p>And out side this Virudunagar dist also covers a nearly good number thoug not as in these three dists. Also Chennai had a good number of population, (not less than 70 Thangals). More over Kerala had a few number. Some ten Thangals in Mumbai city. As per these accounts the population sould be more than a million. But I dont't place it. I stated as a million because the leader claim to the state's chief minister. I place it insideHinduism there because in the censes matter the official recognition to Ayyvazhi is yet to come and so it falls officially under Hinduism - <a href="../../../v/a/i/User%7EVaikunda_Raja_cde9.html" title="User:Vaikunda Raja">Vaikunda Raja</a> 01:37, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree, and Bala Prajapathi Adikalar, the present considered leader and with him one may be able to collect Ayyavazhi related sources. We use to do so. He had laid foundation stones for more than a thousand Nizal Thangals so far. To highlight once on a single day he laid foundation stones for five Thangals. He may be a good resource. And in the matter of Wiki as you said 'a needed solid reference' that not presently with me. And tommarrow the Kodiyetru Thirunal, a festival begins in Swamithoppe and during I will try to approach Bala Prajapathi Adikalar in need of the reference to the source. Let him say if there is any. So please wait for a day or two. I shall also seek for any other source. Thank You. - <a href="../../../v/a/i/User%7EVaikunda_Raja_cde9.html" title="User:Vaikunda Raja">Vaikunda Raja</a>.</dd>

<dd>I know nothing about Ayyavazhi.

<dd>According to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, sources should be a published source. It could be a newspaper published by the Ayyavazhi but it has to be something that someone could get a copy of and say "Yup, that's what they claim". It's OK to provide estimates of numbers but they should be documented as estimates rather than census counts. Clearly, saying 20% of three provinces is a wild, hand-waving estimate. But, if it can be documented via a reliable source, that the Ayyavazhi believe and claim that their adherents number 20% of the population of those provinces, then you can say that. You should not say that 20% of the population ARE the adherents of Ayyavazhi but you should say instead that the Ayyavazhi leader believes and claims that this is the number.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Talking to the leader of Ayyavazhi and asking him is not a verifiable source because it cannot be easily verified independently. The best explanation of this is: If the leader were to unfortunately pass away, we would have no basis to prove your claim that he said 20% instead of 10% except for your word. However, if you could provide a paper document showing that a reporter had written that he said 20%, then the claim that he said 20% is considered to be more reliable. Yes, admittedly, the reporter could have gotten it wrong but we assume that there is some editorial check on the reporter. Plus, the fact that the newspaper has some distribution argues that the facts published there cannot be too egregiously false. (Caveat: Some newspapers do write egregiously false statements but, at least if we know the name of the newspaper, we can evaluate the credibility of the statement based on the credibility of the newspaper.)</dd>

<dd>I have no claims to be any kind of expert on comparative theology, but armed with nothing more than a preliminary reading of the articles and a good understanding of Hinduism, here's my 0.02
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li><b>Is Ayyavazhi a religion</b> - Firstly, it does seem that the underlying philosophy has a strong underlying theme of good vs evil, which seems quite distinct from the pantheistic foundations of Hinduism (where everything has a place within an attributeless whole). Secondly, it is important to remember that Tamil culture is documented to be very ancient and there is evidence that Hinduism in Tamil Nadu state exhibits a different chart of progress, when compared with the rest of India. Indigenous faith symbols like Ayyanar, Mariamman etc. are speculated to predate the advent of Vedic Hinduism. It would be incorrect to dismiss these symbols as "hero stones" or aberrant one-off streams of Hinduism, as the rituals and folklore underlying these symbols are intricately woven, rich as concepts, and widely known. These deities are thought to have become syncretized initially with Vedic Hinduism, and later with Shaivism and Vaishnavism. In fact the worship of the deities <i>Muruga</i> and <i>Meenakshi</i>, are also unique to Tamil Nadu. Though, they are today identified with Subramanya and Parvati (deities from a common Hindu stream) the mythology surrounding the two seem localized to Tamil culture (with frequent references to places and customs in Tamil Nadu). Ayyavazhi seems to have evolved from a similar development of ideas. In fact, Sikhism and Jainism are recognized as syncretizations of Hinduism (the ideas of Vishnu and Hari are prevalent in both these faiths), but are recognized as distinct religions. So, it would seem logical to accept Ayyavazhi as a religion in its own right.</li>
<li><b>Is it a "major religion"</b> - Quite simply no. The only way to classify a system as a major religion would be to base it on the numbers. With no documentary evidence or a credible popualr estimate, one cannot do that.</li>
<li><b>Citations</b> - This is a frequent problem in India-related articles. There is a wealth of information to be documented with very few citations, simply because there is very little acceptable source as yet available. There is a very low penetration of the internet into rural India, and academically rigorous research materials into localized cultural beliefs are in short supply. No doubt, it is important that Wikipedia strive to be rigorous, but not at the cost of ruthlessly putting down every bit of information, for lack of supporting evidence.</li>

<dd>I strongly feel it is better to be "inclusionistic" when dealing with such articles. Deletion of content painstakingly provided by a few users who have the knowledge will only discourage them from participation and only help to maintain the persistent "Ameri/Euro-centrism" in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChancemill_4449.html" title="User:Chancemill">Chancemill</a> 12:55, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My dispute with these articles is not religious or demographic. I too accept the fact that we need to be inclusionist, however I am of the personal view that this set of articles is a good example of how to make an obscure subject widely available on the net. As there is no systematic review process in WP, with little effort anything becomes acceptable. <a href="../../../v/a/i/User%7EVaikunda_Raja_cde9.html" title="User:Vaikunda Raja">Vaikunda Raja</a> has single handedly created these dozens of articles and stubs on other wiki namespaces and language wikis including Latin and Afrikaans. There has not been a single query as to the source of the material. One wonders how many such articles are lurking in WP... - <a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVenu62_2094.html" title="User:Venu62">Parthi</a> 20:00, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If Ayyavazhi is not a 'major' religion, then we should ask the question whether it is <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">notable</a>. According to the articles, even the followers don't consider it as a separate religion, rather as part of the Hindu faith. If it is not known beyond the immediate group of followers, then by definition it is not notable. Vaikunda Raja has single-handedly made it widely available on the net and elsewhere and I congratulate him on his effort and pass on my Kudos too. However, my concern is the reliability of WP as a source. We are not asking for these articles to be deleted. They must most definitely be cleaned of POV copy and unsourced claims.</dd>

<dd>I don't agree with your comments on citation. The 'citation needed' templates are inserted only for claims that can and should be cited, such as the birth date of the founder and his exploits. There is no requirement to provide citations for faith based claims, as long as they are coached in NPOV language (such as 'when Ayya was bodily present', etc). Why don't you spend a bit of time copyediting these pages? - <a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVenu62_2094.html" title="User:Venu62">Parthi</a> 23:10, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with <a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVenu62_2094.html" title="User:Venu62">Parthi</a> that the question is not the significance of the religion, rather the massive amount of original research. Wikipedia's most important principle is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a>, and that triumphs everything else. Information MUST be cited from a different source. It may be true that information about the religious beliefs are not widely publicized, but still, citations are vital because wikipedia is NOT the place to do original research (see <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>). When almost all the articles and sources of information come from a single user, and no citations are provided, the verifiability of these articles MUST be questioned. Any unreferenced information cannot be included in an encyclopedia. Whether you are an inclusionist or deletionist doesn't really matter. Otherwise, WP will be filled with articles people claim to know, but which can't be found outside wikipedia. So, I'd request the author of these pages to provide references as soon as he can, otherwise the unreferenced material will be removed soon.

<dd>I would think a "major religion" needs at least 100 million adherents but that's just an arbitrary number that I picked. I'm not sure how many Jews there are in the world. Maybe not as much as 100 million. Perhaps 10 million is a better number. The influence of Jews is disproportionate to their number (please, no POV attacks).</dd>

<dd>Yesterday I met Mr.Bala Prajapathi Adikalar at his residence in Swamithope and asked about the source for listing. He told that it was announced according to the list of members given by Nizhal Thangals of all Districts. And for me the estimation may not be so accurate, but approximately it may be right. But as told earlier Wiki need citation and so it may not be a right source. So I shall search for some other source. And till then we shall remove Ayyavazhi from the Major world Religion List.

<p>I dont know earlier that published works are not considered important in Wikipedia. As far as I've read there are some not less than 50 books published in Ayyavazhi and not less than 100 historical books refer Ayyavazhi either as a religion or as a reform movement. But with me there are only a few. Any way I am glad to know that published works could be used for citation. And here I've done. And still Iam under my work.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Sect vs. religion</span></h2>
<p>I am not convinced that this is a useful debate. If the adherents of Ayyavazhi want to call themselves a religion instead of a Hindu sect, the article should document that. If someone feels that it is important to argue that Ayyavazhi is not an "official" religion by Indian government standards, then they should document that. If someone wants to comment that much of Ayyavazhi is based on Hinduism, then they should document that. Hopefully, this article focuses on the differences between Hinduism and Ayyavazhi. The reader should come away understanding the ways in which the two are alike and the ways in which the two are different.</p>

<dd>No Ayyavazhi followers claim Ayyavzahi as an offshoot of Hinduism. But it is noted in the sub-heading 'Phenomenology' that Many Ayyavazhi followers think them as Hindu and unaware of their deviated ideology from Hinduism. - <a href="../../../v/a/i/User%7EVaikunda_Raja_cde9.html" title="User:Vaikunda Raja">Vaikunda Raja</a> 10:34, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Original Research</span></h2>
<p>The section titled 'New religious phenomenon is a blatant attempt to insert original research. I have removed it. I have given the paragraph below:</p>
<p>It may be concluded that Ayyavazhi emerged as a 'new and singular' religious phenomenon. Amidst the various traditions — the sanskritic Hinduism, the newly-introduced Christianity, the not-so-prominent Islam, and the ubiquitous folk forms of worship — Ayyavazhi was developing as a distinctively alternative religio-cultural form in South India, its place of origin. This fact had been recognized by the followers of Ayyavazhi.</p>
<p>They addressed their religion with a new nomenclature, "Ayya Vazhi" ("the path or way of Ayya") and thereby confirmed its new identity. They considered it, on the one hand, as ghee churned out of the existing religious traditions and, on the other, as a new phenomenon that had come to replace the old traditions. They believed, on the one hand, that Vaikundar had 'unified' all the existing deities unto himself and, on the other, that the essence of the old traditions had gone awry with the advent of Vaikundar. They placed their religion within the existing traditions and yet perceived it to be different from them. The distinguishing aspect of Ayyavazhi needs to be seen against the background of the sanskritic tradition whose pre-eminence was upheld by the State. That Ayyavazhi had emerged differently against this religious tradition is a pointer to its distinct singularity. The emergence of Ayyavazhi needs to be seen also against the presence of the British in India [70]. From a sociological perspective, reform movements in general were patronised by the British in the nineteenth century Thiruvithankur. But Ayyavazhi was never patronized by the British; it arose and stabilized without their support. In one sense, it was anti-establishment, presenting itself to be new, both in terms of a difference and in terms of a synthetic character. It called itself new, as well as a medley of the extant traditions [71].</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Controversy on Ayyavazhi Controversies</span></h2>
<p><b>The content from the article</b></p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Although some followers of Ayyavazhi assert that this is an independent religion, it has not received official recognition as a separate religion in India. Even its followers are of the opinion that this is but a Hindu sect rather than an autonomous religion.[72] The worship practises and mythology borrows heavily from Hinduism and the founder of the religion is considered by its followers as an incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu. They believe in the Hindu gods Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva. They also indulge in the mystic practices of pocessions and devinations similar to the tribal religions of Tamil Nadu. The rampent illiteracy and supersitions in the followers of the faith prevented them from attempting to understand the Ayyavazhi philosophy and as a result it has degenerated into yet another Hindu sect.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The penetration of Ayyavazhi in Tamil Nadu is confined to a few territories traditionally associated with the Nadar community. There are no official figures for the number of followers of Ayyavazhi. Apart from Akilattirattu Ammanai and Arul Nool, the two religious texts associated with Ayyavazhi, we have no other source of information on its philosophy. There is no independent analysis of the contemporary status available on this sect. Although some of the followers have attempted at defining an independent philosophy to this sect, the underlying philosophy, mythology and worship practices are identical to the Hindu philosophy of Advaita and Smartism and Hindusim in general.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p><b>I repectfully disagree with whole of the contents of this Sub-heading and reject it line by line. Let me define.</b></p>

<dd><b>"Although <i>some followers</i> of Ayyavazhi assert that this is an independent religion, it has not received official recognition as a separate religion in India. Even its followers are of the opinion that this is but a Hindu sect rather than an autonomous religion.[72]"</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>How do you say that <b>some followers,</b> consider it a seperate religion (and) Even its followers are of the opinion that this is but a Hindu sect rather than an autonomous religion? On the basis of the website cited as foot note 72? That is the view of a single webmaster. But the view of the researcher of the book <b>Religion and Subaltern Agency</b>, is not of a single person. Look the content from the book defining, how the details given in the book collected.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"The researcher could interview thirty-three persons altogether. Duration of interviews varied from a minimum of one hour to eight hours, depending on the time taken by the interviewee. Each interview was audio-recorded. The age composition of interviewees was above forty-five to eighty-two, except two persons below this category. Most of the interviewees were popular theologians, commentators, orators, and editors of journals on this religious phenomenon. Some of them were patrons of the different centers of worship of AV. The interviewees were drawn from differnt places - from Kanyakumari District to Chennai."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The conclusion of such a study (I mean among the followers in the matter of the religious phenomenon) on Ayyavazhi is given by the author and this was summerised in the sub-heading <b>"New Religious Phenomenon"</b> So you will consider what, the view of a single webmaster or that of 33 top known theologians?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It doesn't mean that that particular site should not be followed. It can be followed when it's views and the view of the Scripture is one and the same. This is the same in the matter of citing the book <b>Religion and Subaltern Agency</b>. It should only be followed when its implications don't move far away from the view of Akilam in beleif related matters.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In the matter of official recognition, as per the India constitution acts any one can create a religion, but not against the policies of government (as per the act 26 I think) and no body will question. But still you consider it a fact it was already mentioned right in the top of the article. A fact doesn't need to be mentioned more than once.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>"The worship practises and mythology borrows heavily from Hinduism and the founder of the religion is considered by its followers as an incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu. They believe in the Hindu gods Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva. They also indulge in the mystic practices of pocessions and devinations similar to the tribal religions of Tamil Nadu."</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>How can you tell Vishnu as a Hindu God. Vishnu is a concept(god-head) followed in both traditions. It means, Vishnu doesn't belongs only to either of them. This is not a scientific or social matter to take the oldest of them, but belief. So if needed you can tell in the article that "Ayyavazhi shares the term 'Vishnu' with Hinduism ".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Moreover, take care both Ayyavazhi and Hinduism provide different views about Vishnu and also in the matter of Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Let me define shortly. Ayyavazhi accepts the views of Smartism in the matter of Trimurthi. Both say that These three are the different aspects of the same God. Which means three were equal in power. But Ayyavazhi says that it was like this till Kaliyukam. Right from the time Kaliyukam starts the others give all (it means surrender) their responsibilities to Vishnu. So from the bigginig of Kaliyukam, that is at the present age Narayana is all in all among the trimurthis. So in the matters of Trimurthis and Vishnu the views differs.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Then in the matter of "the mystic practices of pocessions and devinations", if these were followed by tribal religions and also Ayyavazhi, does it mean that Ayyavazhi borrows? This is same as in the matter of Vishnu. Since these were beleif, we can't declare that the oldest is the owner.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>For example: 'Prayer' is a practice (concept) followed by almost all the religions of the world. Let us research and found XXX is the oldest religion in the world. Then shall tell that all others borrowed the concept of 'prayer' from the religion XXX. Is it right?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>"The penetration of Ayyavazhi in Tamil Nadu is confined to a few territories traditionally associated with the Nadar community. There are no official figures for the number of followers of Ayyavazhi."</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>How do you tell this. The foot note number five in the Ayyavazhi article and the book Religion and Subaltern Agency confirms Ayyavazhi's fast spread in Tinnelvely's (This Tinnelvely extends near to present Madurai) and Travancore's (This Travancore extends near to present Palghat) southern districts. Which means nearly 4 districts in present Tamil Nadu and 4 districts in Kerala almost 8 districts. Were all of them assocated with Nadar community? And if you attempt to tell that most followers of Ayyavazhi are from Nadar, it's already mentioned in the article. It doesn't mean that "Almost all of them are from Chanar" but majority of them.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In the matter of official figures of followers, If there is no official recognition then wht is the possibility for getting figure. But still in an indirect way there was recognition. That is the holiday for three districts. Was it given to two or three followers from each districts?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>"Apart from Akilattirattu Ammanai and Arul Nool, the two religious texts associated with Ayyavazhi, we have no other source of information on its philosophy. There is no independent analysis of the contemporary status available on this sect."</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Are you telling the book <b>Religion and Subaltern Agency</b> is religious and not independent?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And the books on <i>Ayyavazhi philosophy</i>:That is really rare in english, but in Tamil. That is really a difficulty.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>"Although some of the followers have attempted at defining an independent philosophy to this sect, the underlying philosophy, mythology and worship practices are identical to the Hindu philosophy of Advaita and Smartism and Hindusim in general."</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Not some followers (almost all the scholors of Ayyavazhi as told earlier)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Then in the matter of beleifs related to Hinduism you can't tell that <i>"the underlying philosophy, mythology and worship practices are identical to the Hindu philosophy"</i>. Bacause, you might have known the relation between Christianity-Bible-Judaism. Christianity does not borrows a little from Judaism but more than half. If you take a Bible (Both the Old&amp;New Testaments)only less than one-forth (The New Testament)is that of Christianity. All the else were selected from that of Judaism. But they were two religions. In that sense in Akilam only less than half is from the so called Hinduism. That is the second half starts with taking the body of Mudisoodum perumal for Vaikunda Avatar in to the sea. Where the events of previous yugas (that is things borrowed from Hinduism closes within <b>Akilam three</b>, where Akilam had seventeen sections).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So if you can consider Christianity as seperate religion from Judaism then can undoubtfully consider Ayyavazhi outside Hinduism.</dd>

<dd>The site in my vision is not an Ayyavazhi.

Then inside every page at the top lines from Bhagavat Gita are included as quote, which Akilam considered gony awry (lost their substance). Then <a href="http://www.vaikunt.org/AyyaVaikuntar/kalanemi.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.vaikunt.org/AyyaVaikuntar/kalanemi.htm" rel="nofollow">see this</a> here Kroni is alternatively viewed as Kalanemi. There was no mention about this kalanemi in Ayyavazhi scriptures. See the number of Yugas mentioned in that site. I think this cite master had tried to mingle both. Or this may be his view on reading both the Hindu and Ayyavazhi sources. But not of kilam.</dd>

<dd>May he the site master be a Hindu Inclusivist. But you can ask, May not he be a Ayyavazhi inclusivist? But Ayyavazhi scripture is telling the old scriptures gone awry, then how can you, as a ayyavazhi follower, accept that?</dd>

Do every articles in WP was censored in such a way? Then even after citing you said that this was a balant attempt to insert original reserch. I said I am ready to cite every line. Then said that Vaikundar utilises the superstitious nature of people to say himself god in the name of controversy. Now this. Even now I am telling, I am ready to cite each and every line of that section. But not a copy write. More over as per your policy in citation, Only copy writes may be suitable to wikipedia.

<dd>Jain, Buddha, Shikh are from Hindu but differ in many ways and hence separate religions whereas Ayyavazhi is only caste of Hindu.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ayyavazhi on the french wikipedia</span></h2>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm from the French wikipedia. I wrote some articles about the religion Ayyavazhi, because there was nothing about it in French. But I really am clueless about Hinduism (mythology,...) and all its related beliefs (like Ayyavazhi), so I had to translate parts of the english articles. I had help (in english) from someone who knows quite well this religion, but even then I can not be sure I did not make any errors. So, if someone can understand french well enough, could he (or she&#160;;) ) check my articles and tell me if I wrote stupid things, wrong things,...? It would really help me!</p>
<p>The articles&#160;:</p>
<ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Marking as NPOV</span></h2>
<p>I'm from Tamilnadu and visited most places in my 23 years and have not even heard of this so-called religion. I tried to google it, and didnt find much conclusive evidence, apart from pages caching WP. In the meanwhile, the article seems to be having a lot of unverfied claims and glorification on the sect, and all the proof seems to emanate from one person's book &amp; a couple of other questionable missionary sources. It seems to me that, anyone with some knowledge of WP and two questionable books as citation could glorify any thing as a religion in the world. The article doesnt even seems to show that majority of Tamils even have no idea what this sect means, and I'm not convinced why this sect should be considered more than any other sects in Tamilnadu. I'm not sure this aspect is NPOV and wanted more discussion on that.</p>
<p>Kindly don't delete this tag till the discussions are over and more research is taken by the Wikipedians (particularly from Tamilnadu) to make sure that the cited sources have meaning. Either we Tamils are totally ignorant of such a magnificient happening in our own place or it must be the biggest hoax in WP history.</p>

<dd>I'm surprized why even knowledeable Wiki editors and admins were silent on this hoax issue. How many have verified this so called proof - "Religion and Subaltern Agency" by a Englishman called Patrick. All the dozens of categories and articles about Ayyavazhi seems to quote only that and I could not find a single reference to what the book is about or whether that book even exists as I couldnt find in my library references. I would request the Admins to immediately mark all the Ayyavazhi articles as POV and make sure that the book cited is a notable work before allowing further alterations. If those Ayyavazhi guys cannot provide any conclusive sources, we have mark the articles for speedy deletion. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalajiviswanathan_cdc2.html" title="User:Balajiviswanathan">Balajiviswanathan</a> 23:40, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Neither the book nor its author is of any notability. Hundreds of such books come and publishing them is not hard. However, to use them as a citation, they have to have reputation. Before calling somethig as a religion and to the extent of creating a portal for it, you need to have atleast a few news articles, a few reputed books whose contents can be verified or a few good peer-reviewed papers. This issues might snowball into a big embarassment for Wikipedia itself and if things are left as it is, there wont be any credibility left. IF the admins left some unknown book written by an unknown author that is unread by any of us, to be a sole source for creating a new religious category and putting up a portal, what kind of management is going on in Wikipedia? Why am I always remembering "The emperor's clothes"? It takes a child's knowledge to see this as a big hoax. If you could provide me reputed sources (news papers atleast - "The Hindu" covers Tamilnadu extensively and puts even the minutest villages and obsucre practices in its articles and even that has not written anything about this "so called" religion. Something very fishy. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalajiviswanathan_cdc2.html" title="User:Balajiviswanathan">Balajiviswanathan</a> 00:40, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hoax may be a little too harsh. But then it is certainly being projected to be bigger than what it really is. I am not even so very concerned about the <a href="../../../a/y/y/Ayyavazhi.html" title="Ayyavazhi">Ayyavazhi</a> article eulogising this religion/sect. What I am more concerned about is you guys sneaking in Ayyavazhi everywhere - even on articles like <a href="../../../r/a/v/Ravana.html" title="Ravana">Ravana</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_India_4a4b.html" title="South India">South India</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Tamil_Nadu_3e8d.html" title="History of Tamil Nadu">History of Tamil Nadu</a> etc.,. Why should readers of Wikipedia have to know what a small sect/religion has to think about Ravana? It is nothing but giving <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NPOV#Undue_weight" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NPOV#Undue_weight" rel="nofollow">undue weight</a> to something that is held by a very small minority. In other words, <a href="../../../r/a/v/Ravana.html" title="Ravana">Ravana</a> is a figure from <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindu</a> mythology and in all fairness only <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindu</a> or other 'notable' views on <a href="../../../r/a/v/Ravana.html" title="Ravana">Ravana</a> should go into that article. Read the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NPOV#Undue_weight" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NPOV#Undue_weight" rel="nofollow">link</a> I've given. It says,
<dl>
<dd><i>"...In other words, views held only by a tiny minority of people should not be represented as though they are significant minority views, and perhaps should not be represented at all."</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Similarly, Ayyavazhi means almost nothing to <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_India_4a4b.html" title="South India">South India</a>. Entire <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_India_4a4b.html" title="South India">South India</a> minus the three districts you claim havent even heard of it. So why should it be there?</dd>
<dd>As for the book itself, I am convinced that the book and the author are real. I checked it <a href="http://www.worldcat.org" class="external text" title="http://www.worldcat.org" rel="nofollow">here</a>. But then, what about 'notability'?? Who on earth is G Patrick? Why should Wikipedia treat his work as sacred and sacrosanct?</dd>
<dd>Also, btw, I know you claim this to be a religion by itself, but I keep seeing references to both Hinduism and Christianity. So what is it really? An offshoot of Hinduism or Christianity? <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 03:11, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The religious study on Ayyavazhi by this book is based on 33 top known theologians of Ayyavazhi. Since it is a University publication it is valid. Then the number of worship centers (8000) too is from a University book (Madurai Kamaraj University).</dd>

<dd>Then in the matters of Ravana, etc... Ayyavazhi and Hinduism says about Ravana. (i.e) Both refers to a same person. The mythical events told about Ravana is also almost the same. But varries in some area. So if not mentioning Ayyavazhi view in Ravana article, then we may have to create seperate article for Ayyavazhi view on Ravana. Like wise once there were three different articles for Siva, Vishnu and Brahma which were Sivan Vethan and Thirumal. But then after a series of discussions all were merged to Trimurthi article.

<dd>Don't think that each and every view of every individual of the world is not appropriate to be placed in the article. Ayyavazhi is a religion which celebrates it's festival with a holiday for three districts. It is an indirect proof for the existence of Ayyavazhi.</dd>

<dd>For example, If a king is mentioned in a book XXX, which was written 500 years ago and also mentioned in another book YYY, 150 years ago, If the views slightly varries, them both is notable in an article about the king. The notability doesn't comes from, how many people's view is similar to XXX or YYY. But definitely, todays people may not be notable. But the view of books XXX and YYY are treated, almost equally for a study. This is a historical matter reffering to the king. But in the matter of Ayyavazhi and Ravana, this is not history to take the oldest and consider valid. It was a beleif.</dd>

<dd>Dear Vaikunta Raja alias Paul Raj. Are you using both the accounts or have you abandoned the previous one? Anyway. Since you have some very strong believes we dont want to question about your founders, Vainkuntar, Bohar etc. The main question is the one of notability. There are zillion organizations around the world and not all can be recognized in Wikipedia as religions and given separate portals and categories. The best you can do is to retain the article, but you have to tear down the portal and all the family of articles and dont mess up with Hinduism related articles. If we keep doing for every one-person religion, then Wikipedia will go nuts. An Wikipedia portal or a category denotes notability and in no way your grouping is close to the world major groups like Islam, Hinduism, Christianity, Judaism and Buddism. Even in that one line corner news stating the holiday for Vaikundar, there is no mention of your sect. So, the best such a non-notable grouping can get is an article. Since, one person is so passionate about it, the rest of Wikipedia have to put up with the article. But, the rest of the articles have to let go.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You have to be a bit reasonable. How do you expect people to accept some un-notable grouping among the world major groups, where there is no iota of a proof. Leave ISBN. Who is that author? Nobody has heard of him and what is that book? Except for the 33 people in your religion nobody had even heard of that book. Be more reasonable. Wikipedia is not the place for unnoted organizations to have their day of renaissance. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalajiviswanathan_cdc2.html" title="User:Balajiviswanathan">Balajiviswanathan</a> 19:53, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The LMS are the early historins (in the matter of Ayyavazhi) to note Ayyavazhi as a seperate religion and see it against and placing to another pole. They call it as a seperate religion with the name <b>Muttukkuttyism</b>. The LMS reports are valuable in Ayyavazhi related matters because the LMS plays an anti-Ayyavazhi role in the 19th century Travancore. So any reports on Ayyavazhi from the LMS about its growth followers etc.. become valid because thats the view on Ayyavazhi from the opposite pole. They considered them in the religious ground, as one among the three players, Hinduism, Muthukuttiyism(Ayyavazhi) and Christianity (LMS). And the report is from the London Missionary Society, the largest and the first Protestant Missionary. More than 80 years of LMS Reports says about Ayyavazhi and Vaikundar, and also told that this Muthukuttiyism is a terrible check for their grown, in Travancore, the most succeded zone of LMS in India.</dd>

<dd>I've told all this many times. You are going on calling Ayyavazhi as a reform movement. I still can't understand that. You may call Arya Samaj as a reform movement, but how do you call Ayyavazhi? They have seperate scriptures, holy places, etc... Especially Akilam the scripture of Ayyavazhi is seen seperately because (i.e) we can't consider Akilam as one among the Hindu Scriptures because Akilam says that all previous Agamas, Sastras, Vedas, Puranas etc.. have lost their substances right from the incarnation of Vaikundar. And alternative of that Akilam is given as scripture. Then how will you consider Ayyavazhi among Hinduism or as a reform movement?</dd>

<dd>Then keeping a portal and Category doesn't mean that it was compared with the largest religion in the World, Christianity.

It varries upon the users who make use of effort and time. May be, for some time there may not be any users from Kanyakumari and then the kanyakumari related articles may remain undeveloped, and may be the worse developed after a period of time. It doesn't be related with notability.</dd>

On the other hand the book is from a major University. Then the LMS; Iam ready to give the complete list of LMS Reports which mention Ayyavazhi. It covers more than eighty years.

<dd>The honest answer is that some followers of Ayyavazhi consider themselves to be Hindu and others consider it to be a separate religion. I have been unable to determine whether there is a majority one way or the other. However, judging from <b>websites</b>, which are admittedly a very biased sample in this case, the consensus seems to be that websites which represent themselves as Ayyavazhi are Hindu. Of course, you will no doubt hear an opposing view which states that these websites are not "real" Ayyavazhi.

<dd>This singular citation is used to support that AV is a separate religion. However, this statement is weak in many regards. First of all in what context is the statement referring to?

<p>This is as far I have gotten. It seems to me that some people consider Ayyavazhi as a new religion but it is far from being well established as such and also many consider it as a sect of Hinduism. Also, most of the important citations are coming from one book written by G.Patrick - everything I have read so far resembles many different sects in Hinduism however. Keeping that in mind it is not proper how this article and many entries of Ayyavazhi on other pages strongly lean towards Ayyavazhi as a separate religion. Finally, adding a token controversy paragraph at bottom is somewhat amusing. Is their even such a controversy outside wikipedia? It seems to me that the paragraph at the end has been added to address the uneasiness of various editors rather than referring to something that has happened outside Wikipedia.--<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlacksun_29e6.html" title="User:Blacksun">Blacksun</a> 14:40, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Citation 2</b>:- G.Patrick is a scholar (possibly a proffesor) in Christian department, University of Madras. Any way, let some body write some thing, I consider that book a valid because it was from one of the most creadible universities in India. Then in what sense that line could not be considered an authority for the new identification for the Ayyavazhi followers. On the other hand I may've to cite some tens of News papers calling them 'Ayyavazhi makkal' which means as 'Ayyavazhi followers' instead, calling them as Hindus while reporting Ayyavazhi functions.
<dl>
<dd>You seem to think that a book = fact. This entire article is based on one authors opinion. Atleast all of the important/controversial aspects of it are.

<dd>Entire article is based on one book?!!! What about the large number of references made here? Also your personal opinion is not more important than that of wiki guidelines. As per wikipedia, apart from several (independent) academics that book(valid third party source) is made as citations for the autonomous nature of Ayyavazhi. So are you telling that 'all academics along with the Madras University' which says Ayyavazhi is seperate, are all errors? <font color="LightSalmon"><small><b>==&gt;</b></small></font> <b><a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Raj_faba.html" title="User:Paul Raj"><font color="black"><sub><u>Д</u></sub></font></a><a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Raj_dbf4.html" title="User talk:Paul Raj"><font color="black"><small>=</small>|<u><font color="OrangeRed">Ω</font></u>|<small>=</small></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Paul_Raj_72c5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Paul Raj"><font color="black"><sub><u>Д</u></sub></font></a><sub><font color="green"><u>Paul</u></font></sub></b>|<b><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_India.svg_d5a5.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/4/41/Flag_of_India.svg/11px-Flag_of_India.svg.png" alt="" width="11" height="7" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_India.svg_d5a5.html" /></a></b> 11:04, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The first on is from a christian agency and the second is from a reserch on 'Ayya Vaikundar and hs activities' while the second is a reserch right on the field, "Ayyavazhi".
<dl>
<dd>External agents views are usually more significant. Furthermore, due to the very nature of Hinduism, many Hindus have no problem accepting various new dieties and gods. This does not mean that they are not Hindus anymore. You have not given me anything that satisfies me that good majority of followers of AV sect consider themselves to be non Hindus. Absolutely nothing. Consider that with the fact how similar AV is to Hinduism and that it started as a Hindu sect as per your citations makes things very complicated. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlacksun_29e6.html" title="User:Blacksun">Blacksun</a> 01:23, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

</dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Then... 'Religion is <b>not the same as</b> religious phenomenon'? Phenomenon means "a fact or an event in nature or society, especially one that is not fully understood", as per Oxford. That is same in the case of Ayyavazhi; 'commonly, not fully understood' or 'misunderstood so far'.
<dl>
<dd>No, religious phenomenon does not mean that it is a different religion. Lot of individual parts of a religion can be religious phenemenons.

<dl>
<dd>"Religious phenomenon is not equal to Religion" says You(POV); and "a fact or an event in nature or society, especially one that is not fully understood" says Oxford (third party). This definition, rightly fits to Ayyavazhi which is a socila fact not understood fully(commnly) by the society. Also note that,it was noted that 'recognisable religious phenomenon'. Also the sentence in the Ayyavazhi article is told that 'had come to be a seperate religion' which says the social condition of Ayyavazhi, felt by the LMS (the active historical recorders of Travancore 'in this matter') as outside Hinduism. <font color="LightSalmon"><small><b>==&gt;</b></small></font> <b><a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Raj_faba.html" title="User:Paul Raj"><font color="black"><sub><u>Д</u></sub></font></a><a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Raj_dbf4.html" title="User talk:Paul Raj"><font color="black"><small>=</small>|<u><font color="OrangeRed">Ω</font></u>|<small>=</small></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Paul_Raj_72c5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Paul Raj"><font color="black"><sub><u>Д</u></sub></font></a><sub><font color="green"><u>Paul</u></font></sub></b>|<b><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_India.svg_d5a5.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/4/41/Flag_of_India.svg/11px-Flag_of_India.svg.png" alt="" width="11" height="7" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_India.svg_d5a5.html" /></a></b> 11:04, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, that citation is not used their to cite Ayyavazhi as a religion but to say the spread of Ayyavazhi, then.

<dd>Generally such things are far beyond the reach of English news papers which are with limited reporters and news coverages. But regarding Tamil Papers the news related to Ayyavazhi are extinsive.

<dd>Why this Daily Thanthi and generally the Tamil News papers covers many news regarding Ayyavazhi because, Tamil news papers have a number of editions from Madurai, Tirunelveli and Nagercoil while the nearest Tamil Nadu edition of Hindu from Kanyakumari is Madurai more than 250 km away.

So friends, are you telling that also wikipedia should remain with limited subjects&#160;? Leave Hindu, are you telling that Tamil News papers are not creadible (especially Daily Thanthi, the largest readed news paper in India), enough to be cited here? - <b><a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Raj_faba.html" title="User:Paul Raj"><font color="black"><sub><u>Д</u></sub></font></a><a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Raj_dbf4.html" title="User talk:Paul Raj"><font color="black"><small>=</small>|<u>Θ</u>|<small>=</small></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Paul_Raj_72c5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Paul Raj"><font color="black"><sub><u>Д</u></sub></font></a> <sub><font color="green"><u>Paul</u></font></sub></b>|<b><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_India.svg_d5a5.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/4/41/Flag_of_India.svg/11px-Flag_of_India.svg.png" alt="" width="11" height="7" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_India.svg_d5a5.html" /></a></b> 17:42, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes the fact that you have only a handful of obscure "university papers" coupled with the fact that the "religion" has never found mention in any respected newspapers or anywhere else for that matter does indicate that it is not that notable. EVERN your university papers that you are citing is not done in good spirit - you use vague terms from the paper that do not give any specific information to build a castle in the sky. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlacksun_29e6.html" title="User:Blacksun">Blacksun</a> 10:26, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sir, I meant what is that quote taken from. Never mind all your citations have changed again then what I was referring to. I do not know how to take these new citations. They seem to be of newspaper clippings where someone or some organization is referring to Ayyavazhi as a religion. But without the proper context they could mean absolutely anything. I have to go by user Indianstar's analysis of all your citations that he posted on his talk pages. Do you have any reason to disagree with his analysis? --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlacksun_29e6.html" title="User:Blacksun">Blacksun</a> 22:17, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The news paper clipings are from the context that they are reporting the celebration of Ayyavazhi festivals and reporting the holiday announcement respectively. There they (the news papers itself and not any organisations or some other people) They report is there as if the author or editor of the news (news paper) is narrating the things. The news regarding the holiday announce ment is published on behalf of editor.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">User:IndianStar 's opinion</span></h2>
<p>Since both parties were waiting for his analysis and had more or less accepted him as a neutral party on this, it is important to look at his opinion after taking a critical look at all the evidence given by him. This is a copy/paste from his talk page in conversation with user Paul Raj:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Following are the views expressed by me to User:Blacksun and I stand by that statement.
<dl>
<dd>1) Tamil Newspaper citations are available to show that some Ayyavazhi followers believe Ayyavazhi as separate religion. There is no way to establish whether that "some" is majority or minority.</dd>
<dd>2) Credible evidences are not available to show that Majority of Ayyavazhi followers think Ayyavazhi is totally separate from Hinduism.</dd>
<dd>3) In my personal opinion(Wikipedia community may differ) only credible evidence to prove above point is either census or surveys. For example if census says India's population is 1 Billion and if some university paper says it could be 1.2 billion, I will take census because it is more credible source to estimate population. When census has enumerated 1650 religions (some of them are followed by tribal people whose literacy rate may be within single digit) there is no known bias available for group of census officers operating in different regions to club millions of Ayyavazhi followers along with Hinduism. There is no way to believe that people living in districts with 90% literacy rates are not able to say their religion correctly to census officers.</dd>
<dd>4) Newspaper citations are available to prove the existence of Ayyavazhi followers in large numbers in districts pointed out by you and celebration of Ayyavazhi festivals in grand ways. But that is not a proof that Ayyavazhi is different from Hinduism. There are many variants available in Hinduism like Shaivites, Vaishnavites, Lingayats etc etc.Different festivals are celebrated by each variants of Hinduism. --<a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndianstar_aec5.html" title="User:Indianstar">Indianstar</a> 11:51, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>This leads me to believe what I suspected all along - Their is no clear cut evidence for all the things claimed/implied in this article. What Paul needs to COMPREHEND - and I cannot EMPHASIZE on this any less - <b>that a handful of discrete statements in local newspapers and one book is NOT enough evidence to a) State with such confidence that Ayyavazhi is a separate religion in this article, and b) Go post about Ayyavazhi in scores of other articles.</b> Just reading this article, despite all the pov by Paul, still confuses me in terms of how exactly it is separate from <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism.html" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>. As User:DaGizza noted in the talk page of <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_philosophy.html" title="Eastern philosophy">Eastern philosophy</a> their are many different sects in Hinduism that have lot more people claiming to be a separate religion and are still not identified as such in Wikipedia. My proposal is that both sides be equally stated in this article and that Paul should stop adding Ayyavazhi in other articles. I am open to allowing his case of stating Ayyavazhi as a separate religion in this article as long as it is presented in a manner that leaves it open for interpretation than it being a fact. Otherwise, I will have to start a RFC and let this matter be settled by opinions of other community members. I hope Paul can understand what I am trying to state.--<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlacksun_29e6.html" title="User:Blacksun">Blacksun</a> 10:10, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've cited with University publication, you called it as "one university book"; Still In fact I don't know on what ground you are forecefully rejecting the opinion of 33 top know theologians (in the matter that what Ayyavazhi followers beleive about themselves) and the conclusion of such a creadible university in India. Then I cited with historian views you called as "mere POV".(as in citation 12) then for citing from independent cites the same is the reply. Then I cited with News Papers and wonderfully now calling as "mere news paper reports". I don't understand those things. And for the deviation of Ayyavazhi from Hinduism see <a href="../../../i/n/d/Talk%7EIndia_Ayyavazhi_b349.html" title="Talk:India/Ayyavazhi">Talk:India/Ayyavazhi</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dl>
<dd>"My proposal is that both sides be equally stated in this article and that Paul should stop adding Ayyavazhi in other articles.

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Though this seem to me as some sort of threatening, I shall come down. But the things shouldn't be considered like this in all articles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For example Once an Ayyavazhi related article is started as "Three God Heads" to focus the Ayyavazhi vision to Thrimurthi. But then it seems that some users opinion that it could be merged to Thrimurthi article and mention the vision of Ayyavazhi there under different heading.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So like so, if Vishnu, Siva etc.. doesn't find a place to mention the Ayyavazhi vision, then a very same article should be formed with a new name to the same Siva and Vishnu etc.. since Ayyavazhi vision on Vishnu and Siva is different from that of Hinduism. And it is of no use to do so. I think Black Sun will understand this thing. Otherwise <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlacksun_29e6.html" title="User:Blacksun">User:Blacksun</a>, you tell another way to proceed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Then other independent religion related works, when minor movements and organisations are mentioned it should definitely find a mention to Ayyavazhi. For example the article <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_text.html" title="Religious text">Religious text</a>. See there even small movements are mentioned there but it seems to me as a revenge on Ayyavazhi; it was removed from there. Likewise in the religious symbolism article.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If needed I will discuss in appropriate article's talk page before adding the Ayyavazhi contents. But it shouldn't be so, as some days before, "mass removal of Ayyavazhi" as a revenge <font color="darkblue"><small><b>==&gt;</b></small></font> <b><a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Raj_faba.html" title="User:Paul Raj"><font color="black"><sub><u>Д</u></sub></font></a><a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Raj_dbf4.html" title="User talk:Paul Raj"><font color="black"><small>=</small>|<u><font color="OrangeRed">Ω</font></u>|<small>=</small></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Paul_Raj_72c5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Paul Raj"><font color="black"><sub><u>Д</u></sub></font></a> <sub><font color="black">Paul</font></sub></b><sup><b><a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Raj_Ayyavazhi_discussions_ee84.html" title="User talk:Paul Raj/Ayyavazhi discussions">Ỹ</a></b></sup> 18:06, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ayyavazhi is such a minorreligion/sect that it cannot find mention in some of the largest journals in Tamil Nadu. Paul Raj (and Vaikunda Raja in an earlier incarnation) is the <b>only</b> author adding ayyavazhi related information. These two facts suggests that this is not a well known faith even in its limited area of influence in the three southern districts of Tamil Nadu. While creating hundreds of articles on such minor and obscure 'faith' may seem an overkill in wikipedia, it is unacceptable to spam links to ayyavazhi in hundreds of articles such as <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_man_or_woman.html" title="First man or woman">First man or woman</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/v/Ravana.html" title="Ravana">Ravana</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/r/Duryodhana.html" title="Duryodhana">Duryodhana</a>, <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilgrimage.html" title="Pilgrimage">Pilgrimage</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_text.html" title="Religious text">Religious text</a>, etc, etc... This is simply not warranted and gives undue weight to this minor faith.

<dd>So are you telling that Daily Thanthi, Dinakaran and all are not major news papers? If not so see the mentioning as cited in the article. Then you are also telling that Ayyavzahi "is not a well known faith even in its limited area of influence in the three southern districts of Tamil Nadu". So are you telling that declaring an official holiday for these three dists is a game played with teddy by the Government? Then adding Ayyavazhi related articles are aoverkill??!!! All the articles are written by citing the sources. So are you telling that such things do not existed? Or are you telling that the no such books (which are cited sources) ever exists? Then writing and improving the articles on certain subjects rest upon the intrest of the users to those related things. If some other religions don't have such a number of articles, then that may be a trouble on them or may be their lack of intrest towards them. What shall I do? Relating to it how you can address Ayyavazhi articles as overkill? In wikipedia any articles with suitable citations cannnot be questioned. No matter what is it related to. What overkill???!!!!!</dd>

<dd>My views are given below</dd>
<dd>Ayyavazhi as a phenomena is well documented in Tamil newspapers.</dd>
<dd>Most of the Tamil newspapers call Ayyavazhi as separate sect.</dd>
<dd>It is very hard to find news reports about Ayyavazhi in English newspapers/Internet websites etc. Paul's argument that social infrasture of Ayyavazhi is very weak is not convincing. Districts which has Ayyavazhi population in large numbers are few of the most literate districts in Tamilnadu. There is no data available to justify his claim that only Ayyavazhi people are illiterate in those districts. Most(May be all) of the Google English language search hits are pertaining to Wikipedia articles created by Paul in various wiki sites. But English language citations alone cannot be taken as source. Since Ayyavazhi people are concentrated only in few districts of Tamilnadu, Tamil newspaper citations can be considered as source.</dd>
<dd>None of the survey results like Family Health survey by Govt. of India, National sample survey of Government of India, mentions about Ayyavazhi religion. These surveys are large in nature with samples from all districts of India. Loyola college which conducts surveys frequently in Tamilnadu also does not point out anything about Ayyavazhi as separate religion.</dd>
<dd>We can allow both views in this article like Ayyavazhi as separate religion(Based on Tamil newspapers and some books) and Ayyavazhi as part of Hinduism.</dd>
<dd>Ayyavazhi festivals are celebrated in grand ways in few districts of Tamilnadu and citations are available for the same. I could not understand why that cannot be stated in Tamil people article.--<a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndianstar_aec5.html" title="User:Indianstar">Indianstar</a> 20:25, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlacksun_29e6.html" title="User:Blacksun">User:Blacksun</a>, the controversy is on only one thing. Ayyavazhi is a religion or a sect. Thats all. Even in that case I've provided as much of citations. But still agree that some people consider Ayyavazhi as a sect. It mean that, 'article need <i>some</i> changes' probably adding some lines. But it doesn't mean that a 'complete rewrite' is required as told by you earlier.</dd>

<li>"South India contains the largest population of Ayyavazhi practitioners,[15] with significant numbers of followers in the southern districts of Tamil Nadu such as Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli and Tuticorin.[16]" - This implies as if their are significant populations of Ayyavazhi in other parts of India/world when it would be far more accurate to state that, "Ayyavazhi is primarily followed in following three districts of Tamil Nadu."

<dd>Citations were re-named; Then Ayyavazhi practitioners are found through-out India. But only a few. But in South India the practitioners are of good numbers as if thousands of worship centers are found across South India. Then again the practitioners are comparably much regarding South Tamil nadu and South Kerala. LMS report is a proof for it. Then in the southern districts the prastitioners are more than any other Place. It is what told from the sentence. For all the above told, University books are th source.

<dd>Yes. Documented evidences state that Ayyavazhi followers are concentrated in specific districts of Tamilnadu.They are sparsely populated in other southern districts of Tamilnadu and south kerala.

<dd>I object to statement that "Ayyavazhi followers are counted along with Hinduism in census". This statement is original research. It sounds as if there is a bias in census officers. We have to categorically state that Ayyavazhi followers declare themselves as Hindus in census or something which sounds like that. I will try to modify the statement, see whether it is OK --<a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndianstar_aec5.html" title="User:Indianstar">Indianstar</a> 05:22, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Changes to come out of POV</span></h3>
<p>I made following changes to lead so that we can come out POV tag.</p>
<p>1) Article should start that it is sect of Hinduism, since credible evidence like census and government surveys shows them as Hindus and there is no known bias.</p>
<p>2) Views of Ayyavazhi as separate religion is also allowed since some Regional language newspaper reports and books consider it as separate religion.</p>
<p>3) Lead should clearly state that Ayyavazhi followers declared themselves as Hindus in Indian census and government surveys. Earlier sentence gave the impression that census officers clubbed Ayyavazhi along with Hindus and raises suspicion on census officers intention.</p>
<p>4) Estimate of population is based on one interview given by one of its practitioner which is not credible evidence.(Practitioners always estimate their popuation on higher side). Only estimation done by statistical surveys or well known sociologists can be quoted as credible evidence for population estimation.</p>
<p>Focussing primarily on Ayyavazhi as separate religion violates <a href="../../../u/n/d/WP%7EUNDUE_5fa0.html" title="WP:UNDUE">WP:UNDUE</a>. If we clearly mention Ayyavazhi as separate sect of Hinduism and allow opinions about Ayyavazhi as separate religion, I think community will agree to release POV tag. I suggest Paul to not to make changes to lead till community consensus is reached. I will try to collect opinions of other community members.--<a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndianstar_aec5.html" title="User:Indianstar">Indianstar</a> 06:10, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Friends, before forming an opinion line-by-line, My I suggest one thing?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Indian census is a independent agent which treats all people's views from the one or two words for their questions as 'discession making Golden words', irrespective of an short-sided illiterate (Iam not meaning that illiterates are fools) and a decidable scholar. If or not you people accept the above statement, My question is if so, then why thease news papers, religious agents, historians and even University papers consider Ayyavazhi as seperate religion? Are you whole-hartedly overtaking these citations as mere bias?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Mind that these above mentioned agents are the academics who in one way or another, might have deeply studies the social, structural(power-relation), scriptural and ideological depth of something, certainly than the 'mere questioning' census in a society. Additionally, creadibility is on thems side too. So this shouldn't be thrown into air as 'a mere clime'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am suggesting the above thought mere because, it will only be the reason that the census and the academics seriously disagree. <font color="darkblue"><small><b>==&gt;</b></small></font> <b><a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Raj_faba.html" title="User:Paul Raj"><font color="black"><sub><u>Д</u></sub></font></a><a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Raj_dbf4.html" title="User talk:Paul Raj"><font color="black"><small>=</small>|<u><font color="OrangeRed">Ω</font></u>|<small>=</small></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Paul_Raj_72c5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Paul Raj"><font color="black"><sub><u>Д</u></sub></font></a> <sub><font color="black">Paul</font></sub></b><sup><b><a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Raj_Ayyavazhi_discussions_ee84.html" title="User talk:Paul Raj/Ayyavazhi discussions">Ỹ</a></b></sup> 15:40, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your assumption is wrong. Indian census officer does not give multiple answer question for religion. It is a open question and respondents are free to quote any religion. 7500 respondents in Tamilnadu have chosen a religion which is different from 5-6 major religions.Your statement that Ayyavazhi followers are around 8 million is completely sourceless. It is as high as 20% of Tamilnadu population. I heard about Ayyavazhi only through wikipedia though I have travelled all over Tamilnadu. Even other people have expressed similar opinions like Venu or Balaji viswanathan who are from Tamilnadu. But argument cannot be centered around whether individual is conversant with the issue or not.(Wikipedia says " I don't know is not the right reason to reject the claim"). I weighed issue based on available citations not based on my personal opinions.--<a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndianstar_aec5.html" title="User:Indianstar">Indianstar</a> 18:01, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

My problem has always been the question of [[<a href="../../../u/n/d/WP%7EUNDUE_5fa0.html" title="WP:UNDUE">undue weight</a> with the single editor's evangelical zeal of inserting links to ayyavazhi is numerous articles.

<p>For <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndianstar_aec5.html" title="User:Indianstar">User:Indianstar</a>, Regarding the number of followers, the report of the interview may be a view of one follower, but, we can't reject or otherwise weigh less, the other sources in the matter that "Ayyavazhi followers are found through-out India, from - one a leading news paper, another from a historian, and other an university paper? You call it as 'claim'! I accept that even one personality is a scholar, heavy chances are there for a biased views from his works; But if his work is accredited by an university, then you can't argue from a 'vision of doubt', especially here in wikipedia. Citations 15, 16, and 17 should be changed from now, which weighs them much low than their creadibility; the word 'claim' should removed as per my opinion.</p>
<p>In the <b>'citation 18'</b> : See I've wrote the exact quote from his book, then why the sentence saying, the spread of followers across South India had been changed to "South Tamilnadu and South Kerala contains the largest population of them". Again in this matter, don't weigh it as a mere claim from the opinion from one person. This is what, which really worries me, 'Calling even university papers as Pov or as my own view'. People also argu once that, Iam making a big thing here on basing only a few university paper. I' ve another souces too, but still focus to University papers because, they are creadible than any other sources.</p>
<p><b>Citaion 20 &amp; 21</b> not fit to the statement. I may have given that from some other reason. I might have chequed and changed them; But you told me not to change anything. So please care this. Then, the statement, "those who consider Ayyavazhi as a seperate religion, classified it as a Dharmic religion". 'Those who consider' means some Tom, Dick etc consider it so. The citation is a source from one of the most creadibile universities in India.</p>
<p>In the matter of 8 million it is the view of one Ayyavazhi follower. One more citation, dating 3-3-2007 from the daily Dinakaran Nagercoil edition (I think this news is available in all editions through-out Tamil Nadu) which says the Ayyavazhi followers are over 1 crore. In this matter it couldn't be told that "one Ayyavazhi follower claims that so and so", but as "there are climes that..." (You told me not to change and so Iam not citing it now)</p>
<p>Then one thing, you told that, "I've never heard of Ayyavazhi from any other places than wikipedia", on the way of rejecting this claim of 8 million as a complete exaggeration. More than this, see here a wonder happened, Yesterday the Vaikunda Avatharam Festival is celebrated. No such news is seen in Hindu, even in the religional edition. Even the starting of Mondaicaud temple festival which have only local holiday is mentioned, but not this Ayyavazhi festival which have holiday for three dists.</p>
<p>Today's Daily Thanthi says that "அய்யா வைகுண்டசாமி அவதாரதின விழா- நாகர்கோவிலிலிருந்து சாமிதோப்புக்கு பிரமாண்ட ஊர்வலம் - <b>லட்சக்கணக்கான பக்தர்கள் கலந்து கொண்டனர்</b>"(news Heading). This report also says that, thousands from Kerala also participated in this procession. From the layout of the news, it seems that this news is reported in all the editions of Tamil Nadu. The Sun News channel also reported this festival. But such a festival not even mentioned in 'The Hindu'. That's the situation of english news papers.</p>
<p>To note intrestingly, Once when I spoke to a reporter of 'Indian Express' about this matter, asking that why such a large festival is not reported in English papers, he told that "they (The religious headquarters) might not invited the press for a meeting and so the reporters may not aware of that."</p>
<p>And for <a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVenu62_2094.html" title="User:Venu62">User:Parthi</a>, It's worriable that no others active users are there for writing about Ayyavazhi. But it's pity for Ayyavazhi. But it can't be mentioned as a reason for rejecting all things I've told. The article is not referenced as 'Paul's edits' as sources, but from around 150 citations. They are not my own vision. It's fitting to mention Ayyavazhi in atleast some articles, such as Tamil People, Holy texts etc where even minor religious movements are mentioned. <font color="darkblue"><small><b>==&gt;</b></small></font> <b><a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Raj_faba.html" title="User:Paul Raj"><font color="black"><sub><u>Д</u></sub></font></a><a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Raj_dbf4.html" title="User talk:Paul Raj"><font color="black"><small>=</small>|<u><font color="OrangeRed">Ω</font></u>|<small>=</small></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Paul_Raj_72c5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Paul Raj"><font color="black"><sub><u>Д</u></sub></font></a> <sub><font color="black">Paul</font></sub></b><sup><b><a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Raj_Ayyavazhi_discussions_ee84.html" title="User talk:Paul Raj/Ayyavazhi discussions">Ỹ</a></b></sup> 13:42, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Citations are based on superlative adjectives used by its followers</span></h2>
<dl>
<dd>All your citations for Ayyavazhi's presence all over India and Ayyavazhi population figures are based on superlative adjectives used by Ayyavazhi followers or supporters. If some Ayyavazhi follower or person who does research on Ayyavazhi says "Thousands of temple is found all over India"" does not mean thousands of temples exist.(For example if some book says Hinduism exist for millions of years then I cannot quote that in lead of Hinduism article. I should be able to find dozens of such books about Hinduism ) These are called metaphor. Have anybody tried to identify even 10 specific Ayyavazhi temples outside Tamilnadu??. Have anybody tried to identify statewise or districtwise population of Ayyavazhi outside Tamilnadu.?. How can you estimate population of the country or no. of temples in the country without even trying to estimate population at lower levels. Figures for population or number of temples does not fall under credible evidence. Giving population figures and saying Ayyavazhi's presence all over India in the lead based on available evidences is totally misleading. These can be quoted in separate sections like Ayyavazhi supporters views or something else. I really appreciate your efforts to collect lot of citations and answering questions from multiple editors. If this is done along with some grammar corrections or rephrasing sentences then I suggest POV tag can be removed. I wish to have views of other editors.--<a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndianstar_aec5.html" title="User:Indianstar">Indianstar</a> 16:46, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Here begins the unwanted controversy again. This is the exact place of the discussion where I am really worried about. Note that the reports are from leading news papers Historians and even university papers ect... May be, you can seal the historians as biased on. But what about the lading news papers and creadible universities.</dd>

<dd>Also a person who obtained a doctorate in some universities may not be geneune. But when a book itself is published by an University, on what ground you call it as Ayyavazhi biased? Are the universities the play ground of lunatics? or Are you arguing that all those universities denotes Ayyavazhi, were are depended to Ayyavazhi? And you your self know that since majority of it's followers sre considered Hindus, then how you could estimate them exactly. On the other hand creadible evidence exists for supporting that Ayyavazhi's are present accross India. Bt it doesn't mean that half the population of India is Ayyavazhi. But inspite (incase) of their low number, they are scattered accross India, and hence the worship centers accross the nation.</dd>

<dd>I've made a citation that thousands of people participated in the procession in Chennai on march 4th. And before no body might have accepted that Ayyavazhi is present in Chennai, merely telling that "I've travelled all accross Tamil Nadu for the last 40 years and not even heared of it." And one thing I wonder you asked "If somebody can find even 10 worship centers outside Tamil Nadu". This seems to be a good joke!!! Even, I personally know about (heared) some 10 Thangals in Mumbai city alone. One of my friend attended several functions there in some Thangals. Any way this is not official here in wikipedia. So leave it. The main thing here to be cared is the University papers. I once agin telling that, don't call as, "mere University papers" but as "even university Papers", especially here in wikipedia.</dd>

<dd>And finally, as a side note, as far as I've read, those persons, Patrick, Poulose or Ponnu; all are not Ayyavazhi. Patrick is a Christian, Poulose and Ponnu were Hindus, still they've done several works on Vaikundar and Ayyavazhi(these two people call Ayyavazhi as a reformatory system hghly focussing it's sociaological impact). <font color="darkblue"><small><b>==&gt;</b></small></font> <b><a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Raj_faba.html" title="User:Paul Raj"><font color="black"><sub><u>Д</u></sub></font></a><a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Raj_dbf4.html" title="User talk:Paul Raj"><font color="black"><small>=</small>|<u><font color="OrangeRed">Ω</font></u>|<small>=</small></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Paul_Raj_72c5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Paul Raj"><font color="black"><sub><u>Д</u></sub></font></a> <sub><font color="black">Paul</font></sub></b><sup><b><a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Raj_Ayyavazhi_discussions_ee84.html" title="User talk:Paul Raj/Ayyavazhi discussions">Ỹ</a></b></sup> 16:17, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My opinions are based on available citations and not based on whether I have come across Ayyavazhi people in my life or not. In same way, your view that I know 10 Thangals in Mumbai will not be considered credible source, we need third party source which lists down few Ayyavazhi temples in other parts of Tamilnadu. I did not question existence of Ayyavazhi which is proved by various university papers,news reports etc etc being quoted by you. I only questioned Population of Ayyavazhi people or No.of Ayyavazhi temples. All university research papers are not credible evidences. Accreditation given by university is to certify organized way in which research is conducted. It does not certify everything said in that paper is true. For example there are research papers which says population of Indian muslims is around 20%.(Census estimation is 13%). There are research papers which disputes basic science principles.</dd>

<dd>You have spent lot of time to write articles in structured manner.Please accept valuable inputs from others without arguing points again and again. Nobody is against Ayyavazhi religion or sect. They only question buildup being given to the article based on few available news papers, books, university papers etc. You are free to use Population estimation done in statistical or scientific manner. Please don't quote population,its spread, no. of temples estimations done by few Ayyavazhi supporters.--<a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndianstar_aec5.html" title="User:Indianstar">Indianstar</a> 04:16, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I accept, that the exaggerated POV of Ayyavazhi's is or should not be considered as citations. You asked that, "we need third party source". My suggestion is the reply for this exact thing. News paper reports and university papers are available for the number of worship centers and the spread of Ayyavazhi accross India. And apart from accrediting this statement, there is no chance for any univresities to go out and count door-to-door the worshipcenters, especially when it's followers are counted within or as some others. But on the other hand Univesities might not accredit any set of non-sense, especially such creadible universities like Madurai Kamaraj University. They might have verified some solid proof. They must. And it is the same in the matter of the Dinamalar report. It was not an interview or someother thing published by Ayyavazhi's. But that by the newpaper(one of the leading tamil newspaper) itself. And for the presence of Ayyavazhi worship centers throughout India (without numbers); again another university paper is the refernce; Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, from Kerala.</p>
<p>Also you said, "For example there are research papers which says population of Indian muslims is around 20%.(Census estimation is 13%)". Though in my POV, I can't say that which side is true, you can't compare Ayyavazhi citations in this matter. Because two (each of them shouldn't be thrown as invalid) views points are available in the matter of muslims which are controversial to each other. But in matter of Ayyavazhi, valid sources are available for support one side, that those centers are present accross India. <font color="darkblue"><small><b>==&gt;</b></small></font> <b><a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Raj_faba.html" title="User:Paul Raj"><font color="black"><sub><u>Д</u></sub></font></a><a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Raj_dbf4.html" title="User talk:Paul Raj"><font color="black"><small>=</small>|<u><font color="OrangeRed">Ω</font></u>|<small>=</small></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Paul_Raj_72c5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Paul Raj"><font color="black"><sub><u>Д</u></sub></font></a> <sub><font color="black">Paul</font></sub></b><sup><b><a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_Raj_Ayyavazhi_discussions_ee84.html" title="User talk:Paul Raj/Ayyavazhi discussions">Ỹ</a></b></sup> 15:23, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Their are various census carried out including Indian census. That is a solid evidence against the few sources you have provided. Your argument that census does not include Ayyavazhi does not hold merit - where is the source for that? --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlacksun_29e6.html" title="User:Blacksun">Blacksun</a> 09:11, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
