<dd>This shot was taken with my wife's Olympus Digital camera, which is NOT an expensive camera but does have a setting marked by a moon and star that allows it to take maybe 10 second exposures on "automatic". The problem is that I can't see the stars when I'm setting it up on the tripod, so I take several pictures and pick the best. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarptrash_5c7f.html" title="User:Carptrash">Carptrash</a> 22:10, 3 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sounds as if you have the same, or very similar camera. We've got the 10X zoom which carpwoman uses for hummingbirds and the like. I use it for tops of buildings. our booklet explaining it got lost within a day or two so there has been a lot of trial-and-error here. Say, I wonder if those instructions sef-destruct?

<p>Hi, Sorry to take so long to get back to you - and the answer is no, I never heard back from the ourshire folks... Which seems weird to me - I mean I certainly wouldn't ignore a message about potential copyright violation (either to say I wanted it removed immediately, or to say that I was okay with it). But, no, there was no response. You can try contacting them if you want, to see if you have any better luck, or maybe we just remove it and be done with it? -- All the best, <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickj_5f86.html" title="User:Nickj">Nickj</a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickj_9875.html" title="User talk:Nickj">(t)</a> 03:21, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Australian Christmas Tree</span></h2>
<p>Hi, AYArktos!</p>
<p>I wonder if you can help me.</p>
<p>Somone, a year ago, put up an article on <i><a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Christmas_Tree_4298.html" title="Australian Christmas Tree">Australian Christmas Tree</a></i>. The person who did it doesn't seem to have been around for a while- noting his discussion page.</p>
<p>Problem is, the page is wrongly labelled, and it has a tad which is also wrong (they match of course).</p>
<p><i>Australian Christmas Tree</i> should be called <i>Western Australian Christmas Tree</i>. It's exclusive to Western Australia and this is the name that it's known by. Because it's parasitic, it's not grown commercially.</p>
<p>Note- this is not the pretty mauve Victorian Christmas Bush, or the lovely white-turning-salmon Christmas Bush that grows right down the East Coast. This is something else entirely, and it's deep yellow to orange in colour.</p>
<p>I'm not really sure about how to move this stuff and connect it all up to the right places and fix the tad box.</p>
<p>Would you mind fixing it?</p>

<p>Sorry about the edit summary - I usually remember to do that when I propose articles for deletion, and I just forgot to do so last night.</p>
<p>It seems to me that while there may be some interesting content here (specifically the court case), there isn't really anything in the existing article that could be used to construct such an article. Based on what is there, it seems to be there not because it was a landmark courtcase (if it was - I'm not personally familiar with it), but rather because someone found the story salacious. In its current form, it comes perilously close to violating the project's living persons guidelines. I trust your judgement as to the notability of the case, so I won't nominate it for AfD yet, but I will if it remains in its current form for much longer. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 02:13, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If you had known the details of the case you would see its as much a kangaroo court as a kangaroo court can get in a modern state of law. I'm really not biased towards labeling it a kangaroo court because of personal motives, I know the US judicial system has its good and bad points. The case just clearly shows what can happen in a court of law when there is no intention of convicting anybody (the lack of an interested prosecutor was obvious). Perhaps sustaining the idea with more refferences both from US and Romania should help.Warfare utf 07:50, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Apologies if my edits seemed hasty, I did act with good faith to improve the article. I deleted no information that I did not later expand; I simply reorganised the sections appropriately and did away with unrequired headings. The indigenous politics section I integrated into the new "Release" section, where I placed information on his life after prison.</p>
<p>The image I see no problem with using.

<dd>Interesting. Post-release life is different, hence under the section "Release" (feel free to re-name it). I am not concerned at what image is used for Stuart.

I would say that this one chapter has more detail regarding the Stuart case than the whole article, and given the huge amount of references that are displayed in the article, I am at a loss as to why it was 'skin and bones' - especially when an obvious amount of work had been put into it.</dd>

<dd>Perhaps 'young and commited lawyer' was inappropriate. My source text glosses over said lawyer and describes other characters in detail as well. However, articles require detail - but not non-neutral language.</dd>

<dd>"gives more weight to the case as before". I'm not here to rewrite history - it has already taken place. He was a convicted and guilty child rapist and murderer, with his case causing controversy. I've already spoken about the lack of detail in the article. The introduction doesn't speak of a convicted and guilty child rapist and murderer - it speaks of an Aborigine who campaigned against a murder sentence with the aid of the press, and was then released to became an elder and councillor. Both "sides" of Stuart require attention, not just one.</dd>

<dd>The Stuart Case section already notes the press' involvement, if this was expanded (like I would have intended) it would have involved a larger section on their influence. The "newspaper campaign" paragraph might fit in 'Stuart Case' better, further cutting unrequired headings.</dd>

<dd>No, I find information in those references that has not been used in the article even when it could (and should) have been. In all honesty, I have no intention for conflict and want a solution. I intend to enlarge the Stuart Case section and want to know the most appropriate way to go about this. Before I make future changes to this section, would you be happy to review my text prior to it being placed on the page? Should a new article, 'Stuart Case' be created and the section in the article reduced to 2/3 paragraphs?</dd>
<dd>I do apologise if my comments did offend you, but I really am somewhat irritated by tip-toeing around and appreciate it when people are frank, even if comments sometimes come across as harsh.

<p>Hi AYArktos. Firstly, apologies for my late reply. I've been somewhat distracted of late planning a move from my home town of <a href="../../../g/e/e/Geelong%2C_Victoria_f161.html" title="Geelong, Victoria">Geelong, Victoria</a> to another faraway place to live, up near the mighty <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murray_River_9586.html" title="Murray River">Murray River</a> this time. For this reason I've tried to keep my in-depth editing at bay and to concentrate on the smaller things at Wikipedia for a while whilst I'm otherwise busy behind the scenes. I tried a wikibreak. I found I couldn't keep away&#160;:)</p>
<p>I'm free now. Would you like me to look over the issue you mentioned with the Max Stuart article now, or is that matter largely resolved? Happy to help, just that article squibbles and talk page issues can get complex, and had to take a second priority there for a while whilst I had my thinking head into gear planning a major life change. Let me know either way and I'll do my best to jump in with some opinions. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> 10:43, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi AYArktos. Some time ago your user page made mention of Avoca, Victoria and an interest you had in the township. During my recent wikibreaks of late, I've been passing through Avoca quite a bit. What exactly, assuming my memory isn't failing here, was your interest in Avoca? Would you like some images of the town, or some research done in regards to it's history perhaps? I intend to be back up that way in a week or so and am happy to expand Wikipedia's knowledge of Avoca in any way I can be of assistance. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> 13:00, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

I wasn't sure whether it was worth introducing importance parameters on a wider scale however it seems to have been accepted further up the chain so I don't see any major problem with proceeding.

I am initiated by the way so anyone talks in such a scoffing manner re Indigneous symbolism, its personal.</p>
<p>Note re here - 'Arktos' ' messages appear but the replies to stuff he asks contributors, dont. He asked me what the fishing meant. Someone should market 'administrator' tools and put them next to another well known power booster. They'd make heaps. Its no longer TBH I must fear, but TRH.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Myth</span></h2>
<p>You might not think what Grahamec said was offensive. It may not be to you.</p>
<p>It was to me though so your opinion of whether it wa sor not is pretty invalid.</p>
<p>That is the difference.</p>
<p>Different people see different things differently.</p>
<p>I dont think what I put up on the massacre discussion page in response to what grahamec said when he scoffed re myth offensive.</p>
<p>You do.</p>
<p>That isnt that valid an opinion either.</p>
<p>The page is about the coolac massacre and respect for Indigneous culture. Carrying on about "myth" is highly disrecpectful. Would wik carry on about whether the 'jesus' story was myth or not. Probably not as to do would be highly offensive to xians and there is no need to do that.</p>
<p><br />
I tried to tidy coolac up and couldnt work out what was happening. Some posts/paragraphs were there twice. 'Pilotguy' was there too undoing my (tidying) edits. I give up.</p>

<p>I suggest if wik wants to put up credible explanations for Aboriginal placenames it only use the recorded ethnologies or similar sources such as archaeologists might cite.</p>
<p>"Myth" seems to get thrown around on wik re Aboriginal cultural hertiage by people who its not the concern of to be commenting on.</p>
<p>Again I repeat - the source that can say with authority what Aborignal culture is about is culture itself, (or archaeologists though they sometimes have no idea re some stuff but pick it up pretty quickly once they are steered the right way as they hold a memory bank of associated stuff from being in the field).</p>
<p>Its appropriate to say that the word for Canberra comes from such and such, and leave it at that. All the breast talk is trying to record Aboriginal culture at Canberra and that is something wik has no authority to do and nor do any others only local Aboriginal people. Wik puts stuff up about the Catholic Church but does not attempt to make qualifed statements about the Catholic religion does it if wik isnt catholic? Whether there are breasts or not at Canberra is the business of culture and for those of it; and others trying to get that knowledge who are not qualified to have it, cant use it so are really just after it to sticky beak at restricted content. <small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 203.54.9.250 (talk â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.54.9.250_d0e3.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.54.9.250">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">July 10 1812</span></h2>
<p>The date is 1812. It was taken from the <i>Encyclopedia of Australian Events</i> available on Macquarie.net. The entry reads in full</p>
<p>"The first detailed inquiry into the convict system in Australia, a report of a Select Committee on Transportation, was published in London on July 10, 1812. In general, the committee supported Macquarie's liberal policies, but thought that fewer tickets-of-leave should be issued. It also opposed the governor having the power to grant pardons. The committee concluded that the colony should be made as prosperous as possible so as to provide work for the convicts and to encourage them to become settlers after emancipation."</p>
<p>I noticed over the weekend that the Portal entry for today had no entries and so cobbled together an entry from the Encyclopedia of Australian Events above plus two people born on July 10 according to the Australian Dictionary of Biography and one person who died according to the same source.</p>
<p>It wasn't the Bigge Report because my memory of Australian history was that Bigge was critical of Macquarie's administration. I assume it was a Select Committee of the British parliament.</p>

<p>Hello, AYArktos, how are you? I'm just visiting while on my Wikibreak and decided to give a shout out. Also, I found two links regarding the level of insanity that has been reached in the United States regarding Christophobia (anti-Christianism). Here are two links I found quite interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/feder121300.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/feder121300.asp" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> â€” Very convincing rant against the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secularization_of_Christmas_171d.html" title="Secularization of Christmas">secularization of Christmas</a>...by a <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jew</a>!.</li>
<li><a href="http://dicklist.blogspot.com/2005/12/43-merry-holiday-from-aclu.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://dicklist.blogspot.com/2005/12/43-merry-holiday-from-aclu.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> â€” Hilarious interpretation of an <a href="../../../a/c/l/ACLU_cdbb.html" title="ACLU">ACLU</a>â€“sponsored "Holiday Claus" (replacing <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Claus_71fe.html" title="Santa Claus">Santa Claus</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/t/Father_Christmas_15a9.html" title="Father Christmas">Father Christmas</a>) that outlines the problem America has.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy, and you can comment at my talk page. I may not respond for a while, however I'm expecting to return for another brief period circa <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_22.html" title="July 22">22 July</a>. â€” <sup>`</sup><a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyInSane_3df2.html" title="User:CrazyInSane">C<small>RAZY</small></a>`<a href="../../../c/r/a/User_talk%7ECrazyInSane_e382.html" title="User talk:CrazyInSane">(<small>IN</small>)</a>`<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CrazyInSane_cf68.html" title="Special:Contributions/CrazyInSane">S<small>ANE</small></a><sup>`</sup> 08:42, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A lot of the reverting I did on that article were related to vandalism/non-verifiable content as well as implied personal attacks on myself, as shown in the edit summaries of the article. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> 23:59, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay then. It's just that content such as invasions have been in question of their notability for some time. The changing of "Anonymity" to "Anonymous" is not really necessary, as the near-good faith editors have done so. The "Sourdough breads often reach store shelves at speeds in excess of 70 mph" picture with its caption is patent nonsense. And the /b/radio section was deemed by another editor to be non-notable. I will leave your latest message here for a period of time, although I will still copy it over to my archives. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> 00:33, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I also do not want to be a target for the users of the boards. I had my User page sprotected because of <a href="../../../w/a/t/User%7EWatchtowerJihad_e36b.html" title="User:WatchtowerJihad">WatchtowerJihad</a> sockpuppets, and I don't need my talk page or any subpages to be vandalized by /b/tards. The mentioning of my user name <b>specifically</b> in several of the edit summaries was a final straw. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> 00:40, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I do use this username elsewhere, but it is what I have been using for a while. And I doubt that they would be able to find my username elsewhere due to various numbers I use after it. I believe I am safe, for now. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> 00:57, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with your point about list of bus stops as it stands, I just havent got back to it to make it more stand alone/justifiable &#160;:) too many forks in too many fires &#160;:) <a href="../../../v/c/x/User%7EVcxlor_b6bb.html" title="User:Vcxlor">SatuSuro</a> 01:23, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I dont know if you have been following the main art during the bits and pieces coming and going over time, but the list (created with warnings against it mind you) was made as if you look at the rotto island board map, and any usual dli map - there are many feature names on the island which relate to issues when discussing the island in the main art - but which would clog the main art up - so part of the idea of the map was a gazetteer that isnt one (heheh) as a cross ref. if it dosnt work, lets get rid of it! &#160;:) <a href="../../../v/c/x/User%7EVcxlor_b6bb.html" title="User:Vcxlor">SatuSuro</a> 01:42, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
