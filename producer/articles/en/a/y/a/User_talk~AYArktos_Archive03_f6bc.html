<p>Hi, I don't suppose you've been down to Namadgi and taken some pictures of the rock art? When I tried to get some I got hailed on and didn't make it to the Yankee Hat shelter.

<dd>Thanks. Thanks for getting rid of that embarassingly unsourced and probably inaccurate text from the Canberra article too. I had the same problem with the Nellie Hamilton info too, she clearly was a real person, but what evidence is there to suggest that she was the "last full-blood aboriginal"- as it still reads in the History of Canberra article.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 23:54, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Since your defense was crucial to the preservation of Ashley Burns at AfD earlier this year, I thought you might be interested to know that a similar case of a UK schoolchild is up for deletion in similar circumstances, in case you wished to contribute to the discussion. See Joseph Lister. Best wishes, <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 19:32, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I don't believe your photo is a W. gloriosa, more likely a W. stricta (<a href="http://www.anbg.gov.au/images/photo_cd/732131822163/032.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.anbg.gov.au/images/photo_cd/732131822163/032.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). Reasons: a) the habit is wrong, W. gloriosa forms a mat with short flower stalks, W. stricta forms a mound with talk flower spikes. b) the colour is wrong. Yes, W. gloriosa is hard to photograph, but the colour should still be darker (<a href="http://plantnet.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/NSWfl.pl?page=nswfl&amp;photo=27&amp;file=9/165/wahl_glor2.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://plantnet.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/NSWfl.pl?page=nswfl&amp;photo=27&amp;file=9/165/wahl_glor2.jpg" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>) c) I think the 'style' should be 1 or two lobes rather than 3. d) the vegetation is wrong, in all the places I've seen it in the wild it is growing with either alpine poas (such as fawcettae or heimata) or in shaded mountain forest on rock faces. e) the petals are flattened rather than tubular.</p>
<p>and the killer: f) Red Hill is way to dry and hot for gloriosa&#160;:-(</p>

<li>I'm not trying to make some legal assertion. I am not sure of the details of the court case you mention, but I doubt it was about displaying the flag and expect there must be some sort of commerical element involved. The question of copyright over a flag rests on it usage. If this Aboriginal Flag is used as a national flag, and is widely flown in Australia, then it is doubtful that any copyright is enforceable (at least for display purposes). Making a flag subject to copyright defeats the purpose of having a flag. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 20:02, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi AYA. I've replied to your question on the suburb info page. Here is what I wrote: The exact words on the map are "Date of First settlement". I suspect that perhaps the date refers to the date the first suburban development appeared after the suburb was gazetted or declared a suburb, but I didn't put the map together. To make double sure, perhaps you could contact the Land Information Centre who published the map. The ACT Planning and Land Authority logo also appears above the Land Info Centre name, so I'd start there. The name of the publication is the 'Map of Canberra by Suburbs' and it is a series of suburb maps with block and section info and comes in a ring binder. -- <a href="../../../a/d/z/User%7EAdz_7b0c.html" title="User:Adz">Adz</a> 11:46, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A while ago I said that I would double check the dates that I supplied on my suburb info page. I've checked the dates for the inner north and inner south and they are correct. I think that the dates supplied are the dates of first suburban settlement, as opposed to dates of first settlement... ... or dates first settled with the intention of becoming a suburb of Canberra. Not very helpful for the history article, but there you go. I would be interested to know if you find out nay more about it. -- <a href="../../../a/d/z/User%7EAdz_7b0c.html" title="User:Adz">Adz</a> 01:17, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>With all respect, I strongly disagree with you that the old photo is a better one. I know it's pretty biased coming from me, but my photo is higher res, much sharper and IMO is shot from a much better angle - showing Mt. Ainslie, and the War Memorial not to mention a nice flag flying. If you still disagree I propose putting it to the vote of a few people. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFir0002_4967.html" title="User:Fir0002">Fir0002</a> 09:57, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My mistake AYArktos, I didn't realize my photo showed the back of the building. Even so I think it would be a usefull photo somewhere on the canberra article because it clearly shows three prominent landmarks.

<p>An article without any text is a clear speedy deletion candidate. If someone only wants to add pictures, they should be adding them to commons or to existing articles.

<dd>I wouldn't be too quick to assume total good faith from fir0002 in this recent matter. I contacted him on his talk page and directed him to the Canberra wikiproject. He continued adding his photos without entering the discussion, he didn't comment until his photos started being removed from articles. This demonstrates some level of bad faith if you ask me. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartyman_a0b9.html" title="User:Martyman">Martyman</a>-<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartyman_49e7.html" title="User talk:Martyman">(talk)</a></small> 23:57, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi AYArktos, thanks for expanding the article on Tilba, that's exactly what I hoped would happen when I started the page - some good wikipedia would notice it and add a little text (not my talent) thus starting an article. It's good to see that there are some Wikipedians who would rather expand than delete. Thanks for the compliments as always Martyman. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFir0002_4967.html" title="User:Fir0002">Fir0002</a> 04:14, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi AYArktos. Apologies for my latish reply. I'll remove the crime template from this article. When the template was intially created I went on a minor pasting effort to get the template out there and in use on articles related to Australian crime. I agree, it doesn't quite serve the intended purpose here. On my 17" monitor, moving the template down gives it no place to go as the current article content is approximately one page long as is. I'm happy to see it removed and have done so. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> 00:14, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi AYArktos-</p>
<p>Thank you for thoughtfully placing my comments in the Prohibition article. I noticed that earlier in the entry, Russia's prohibition is given different dates than I listed. My source for the 1916-1917 date is: Ewing, John A. and Rouse, Beatrice A. Drinks, Drinkers and Drinking. In Ewing, John A. and Rouse, Beatrice A. (Eds.) <i>Drinking Alcohol in American Society - Issues and Current Research</i>. Chicago, IL: Nelson-Hall, 1976, pp. 5-30. Should I change the other dates given for Russia?David Justin 18:00, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi AYArktos-</p>
<p>I did some googling also and agree that the 1916-1917 date must be erroneous. Therefore, I deleted my mention of Russia for that reason as well as the fact that Russia is addressed in an earlier section.David Justin 19:37, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>The advice from my better-half is to stay away from talk pages and just edit!

<dd>I understand your feelings about RfA.

<dd>Anglia, is the Latin noun for England, East Anglia is a part of England (from the Angles, a people who moved to England after the Romans left) but when Anglia is used as another part of speech, the -c- is included to make it easier to say. Hence Anglican, anglicize. Anglica also occurs as a Latin adjective in soome places such as species names where it means Engish. There is no such place as <i>Anglica</i>, except when used by people trying to make a back-formation from an Anglic- word. By the way I could not see the religious site you referenced, it won't go through my company firewall. <a href="../../../d/a/b/User%7EDabbler_9770.html" title="User:Dabbler">Dabbler</a> 14:05, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have had a chance to look at what you were looking at and Polydore Vergil's Anglica Historia proves my point. It is Latin for <i>English History</i> not <i>History of England</i>, the latter would be genitive <i>Historia Angliae</i>. <a href="../../../d/a/b/User%7EDabbler_9770.html" title="User:Dabbler">Dabbler</a> 20:20, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have to ask - why do you think it is relevant to list a document that noone working on the page has read, and is not widely available in a list of additional references. I have referenced notes from the 1998 version in the notes list.</p>
<p>I have a suspicion that the list of references was probably cut and pasted from one of the external online sources (along with parts of the text which still need to be rewritten). Very few of the other sources listed in that section was in wide circulation. I plan to remove the whole section when I have fact checked and referenced the rest of the article.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 22:51, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I doubt the old version is significantly different from the 98 version, but the 98 discusses the flags approved since 1989. The purpose of a refernce section isn't to show everything ever written about a subject, its to show where the article was sourced from, and as I said, judging for the amount of cut and pasted copyvio material and common apperance of those sources on external site, I doubt they were ever consulted.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 23:10, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>My main point is that we shouldn't be concerned with a list of refs that probably were never consulted to produce the text.

<p>I have not seen the books you mentioned, but I will check for them at the library at the University, as well as at the State Library, to see if I can find them.</p>
<p>There are some monuments at Anzac Square in Brisbane, with respect to various wars, including the Second Boer War (1899-1902), World War I, World War II, the Korean war and the Vietnam War, among others. I have photos of the Second Boer War memorial, which I put onto the <a href="../../../a/n/z/Anzac_Square%2C_Brisbane_530a.html" title="Anzac Square, Brisbane">Anzac Square, Brisbane</a> article. Would these also be okay to put onto your article page?</p>
<p>By the way. I have put your comments to me on their own archive page, so that the comments can be kept together. The page is <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFigaro_others_79c7.html" title="User:Figaro/others">User:Figaro/others</a>.

<dd>OK, so we could put the 3 Melbourne bridges in <a href="../../../t/r/a/Category%7ETransport_in_Melbourne_648a.html" title="Category:Transport in Melbourne">Category:Transport in Melbourne</a>, is that what you are suggesting? I guess that's messy, but ok. The reasons I haven't justified the excessive categorisation is that I don't why it is considered excessive. It's just been called "excessive" and "overkill", which aren't really explanations. I'm guessing it's excessive because:
<ul>
<li>Readers have to click through another layer of cats (which I don't mind, since the result is a sharper category, but others might mind it)</li>
<li>It is a burden on the servers (I don't think so, but maybe)</li>
<li>It's is annoying not to be able to view all, say, bridges in Victoria without purusing both the cat and it's subcat (this is a problem with the MediaWiki software, which should be resolved)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I can't justify something when I think it's better than every other option, unless the benefits of the other options are presented. Also, thanks for working through this problem with me.

<p>AYArktos - As an inclusionist I am missing your point in removal of Navy line from Wagga article especially as it is not vandalism and courtesy requires discussion before the type of action you are taking. The introduction into the article about Wagga attempts to provide a general overview of the town - Navy have been stationed as their own branch of the services in Wagga Wagga since World War II - personnel are posted to Wagga Wagga RAN not to the RAAF. If it is important enough to provide a general overview of the town in the lead paragraph that includes the presence of the services then the Navy is part of that fact which gives people a correct overall picture of this aspect of the town. It certainly does not belong in the body as a side-line. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirtualSteve_38d8.html" title="User:VirtualSteve">VirtualSteve</a> 21:47, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Look a little more carefully. Any check of Google or other search engine will reveal detail of RAN Wagga. They have been there since World War II - Navy personnel are posted to Wagga Wagga as Navy. They run their own race, wear their own uniform, report to their own superiors and conduct Navy business. They have been mentioned in parliament and there was a ship called the HMAS WAGGA WAGGA. Where they are housed is not the issue and a reference to Woolworths and Coles is very non-sequitir. Any way I see that you feel you own this article and have reverted again - your call AYArktos - your immediate support is what makes working on Wiki so good to so many. Thank you. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirtualSteve_38d8.html" title="User:VirtualSteve">VirtualSteve</a> 22:15, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>(see previous chain of correspondence) Your comments are getting a little rude now. I am thanking you for your support - my additions are not insensible - I have never used the word 'Base' I have used the word 'presence' - since world war II the Navy has had it's own presence - as it's own entity - this is a fact. And you should not paint all editors with the same brush - I am committed to wiki and do read the talk pages where a particular talk is relevant to my interest. Now for sources try the first few hits to see Navy is it's own organisation and presence in Wagga Wagga, is mentioned in Parliament as it's own entity and of the fact of HMAS Wagga Wagga named for it's link to the town.</dd>

Now to help me understand your point can you cite sources that the RAAF incorporates RAN as a part of their command - in other words that the Navy do not operate as their own group - as per wiki policy? <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirtualSteve_38d8.html" title="User:VirtualSteve">VirtualSteve</a> 22:39, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>My intention is not to be rude. You asserted that <i>"Any way I see that you feel you own this article"</i>. I responded to that assertion - neither I nor anyone else "owns" articles on wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<p>I had done a google search and had came up with the same references as you and hence my reversions and comments were based on that info. The first reference you gave states "Navy personnel based at RAAF Base Wagga". HMAS Wagga Wagga was as far as I can see a ship <a href="http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LA20030529041" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LA20030529041" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> named no doubt for it connection to the town, but that isn't what the addition said. There is no base. <a href="../../../h/m/a/HMAS_Harman_0a8f.html" title="HMAS Harman">HMAS Harman</a> for example is an inland navy base. Without being a base as far as I can see it is not an "entity" at Wagga. It has a presence but not to my mind significant enough - hence my reference to Coles and Woolworths who have a more significant presence. If you want to assert significance do so, but in a meaningful way.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a> 23:00, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>(Important to keep the chain at it's commencement point so other people can also maintain the relevance - or perhaps you don't agree with that also?) Anyway I have come across this type of bludgeoning semantic rudeness before - the twisting the argument and not answering the question changing reference points and then when all else fails stating simply that what you (AYArktos) write is significant and what others write or post as pictures is not. You haven't answered my question - forget about nonsense of Woolworths/Coles - Navy have been a presence since the War - just as Army and Airforce have, but you don't think that is significant enough. Fair enough - you're the boss - don't worry about providing your source as I requested as per wiki policy use mine. Enjoy your day in Canberra with architecture and we'll leave Wagga Wagga somewhat unwritten.<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirtualSteve_38d8.html" title="User:VirtualSteve">VirtualSteve</a> 23:13, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Oh and of course the New South Wales Parliament (see my references) stating in Hansard, <b>Honourable members may be surprised to learn that there is a Navy in Wagga Wagga</b> - is not significant either!</dd>

<dd>Interesting! My page is a compilation of private editing tools and prompts. It is not an attack on you in the slightest and you should instruct your ego to not be offended or facilitated by it.

<dd>I only want to do this one more time AYArktos. Make yourself clear without using bludgeoning language tactics. How are you personally attacked? What is it that you are upset by? What is your problem exactly? Please I do not have time to be harassed by circular talk additions - indeed I would just like to edit - I promise I will leave any editing that you make to any edit anywhere on wiki alone - your edits are right, everything you say is correct! <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirtualSteve_38d8.html" title="User:VirtualSteve">VirtualSteve</a> 21:53, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Thank you. Finally you make yourself clear. One should be careful when one takes any word or phrase out of context don't you think? The phrase in full is actually somewhat praising - in total it means, <b>Silence, life is too short, let those who demand to be in charge have their way</b>. It is a prompt for me to remember that if you (and a couple of other users - yet to be added - that I have encountered) place any edit on an article - I am to let you and your methodology be - because it is a waste of time discussing such edits with you - you will always be right and everyone else will always be wrong. That is not a personal attack - it is a prompt to me. Now can I have your permission to edit?

<p>Minor adjustment has been made - so you can take off the chain-mail shirt. Smile - We (you) are all so damn insignificant.

Glad you understand you are a tyrant (and I assume that this is not because you are from Canberra - unless you are PM John H under a pseudonym) but - well no point putting in a prompt to myself unless I mean it - and I do - so I will leave Wagga Navy alone (I spent 12 years in Wagga Wagga) and know very well what it does there. I will also leave any edit you are involved in alone - at least until I feel that I am may get somewhere. I am moving on now. Cheers.
