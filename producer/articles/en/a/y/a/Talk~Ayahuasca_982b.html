<p><i>as the intense vomiting it produces can clear the body of dangerous worms and other parasites common in the rainforest.</i></p>
<p>This seems a little unlikely, as most parasites live in the intestines, not the stomach, and no matter how intense the vomiting is, it's unlikely to cause partially digested food to reverse its course along the small intestines, pass by the Duadnum/<a href="../../../p/y/l/Pyloric_valve.html" title="Pyloric valve">Pyloric valve</a> and exit through the stomach/esophagus. Parasites don't really do too well in the stomach, as it's a pretty hostile environment, what with the <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrochloric_acid.html" title="Hydrochloric acid">Hydrochloric acid</a> and all. I suggest we remove this section unless there's some evidence somewhere to back this up. Note: purgatives are certainly sometimes useful in medicine, but the removal of <i>parasites</i> specifically is what seems incorrect to me. --<a href="../../../o/v/e/User%7EOverand_6955.html" title="User:Overand">User:Overand</a> @ public terminal 160.39.225.2 09:54, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>the ayahuasca treatment as i understand it traditionally includes extensive dietary restrictions for days before and after, and fasting on the day of drinking the brew, which most certainly does have an effect on the intestines, and on any parasites therein, and purging thru vomiting is not universal although common, purging thru defecation does also happen and perhaps these are the cases anecdotally referred to as clearing parasites... perhaps the reference to clearing parasites can remain while the vomiting being the cause of their removal be edited.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It should be reworded- first, we're talking about traditional usages, ie what they use it for rather than what it actually does. but perhaps more importantly, it shouldn't say "vomiting"- it can (and often does) cause intense diarhea as well, it just gets everything movin' in there, and can keep it movin for days afterwards . . . --<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeah_5965.html" title="User:Heah"><font color="#FF0000">he</font></a><a href="../../../h/e/a/User_talk%7EHeah_0915.html" title="User talk:Heah"><font color="#FF6600">ah</font></a> 08:48, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This text should be revised to mention the anthelmintic properties of harmala alkaloids (particularly harmine and harmaline), which actually do reach the large intestines (Hassan, I. 1967. Some folk uses of Peganum harmala in India and Pakistan. Economic Botany 21: 384.). Thus, this action is two-fold; a direct action on the parasites by these harmala alkaloids (particularly harmine in ayahuasca) AND through increased intestinal motility that is caused by these alkaloids.

<dd>The text already provides the basic recipe (boil stuff up). I think for specific recipes (and there are many of them possible, with lots of different plants) the external links are sufficient.

<p>As I am an Ayahuasca drinker myself, I strongly agree with you. Wikipedia should not go into this kind of detail, as it may be even harder to American Ayahuasca users to have the freedom do take the tea. As you might know, it is stil in dispute the legal right to drink the concoction within the American territory, and one of the arguments of the prosecutor was exactly that it might "spread its evil effects in "the American Youth".</p>
<p>Moreover, Giving the recipe here is overflowing the scope of Wikipedia, as I see it.</p>

<p>has anyone read "spirit in the city"? i haven't; from examining it online it seems to be about how to bring shamanistic religion into your life, but isn't about ayahuasca. but i could be wrong, so please say something if i am- otherwise i think the book should be deleted. there are a million books on shamanism, and imho the list here should only have books particularly relevant to ayahuasca (as all the others are.) eg, i don't think there should be any michael harner books on the list either . . .</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ross, i removed your book from the list because it isn't about ayahuasca. wikipedia is not the place to advertise yourself and its against the rules to do so. If you write a book about ayahuasca feel free to put a link to it here; but otherwise, your book is just one of thousands about co-opting ancient spiritual practices into new age drivel. for instance, shamanism should certainly NOT be employed to help Nike become a bigger company, like in that one article on your site . . . It is a religious path essentially diametrically opposed to consumerism and capitalism. But that doesn't even matter, as this entry is for ayahuasca, not shamanism. ayahuasca is not in any way related to voodoo, except in that voodoo incorporates ecstatic techniques and ayahuasca creates one. thanks for understanding. <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeah_5965.html" title="User:Heah">Heah</a> 19:54, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello to all past and present contributors,</p>
<p>I have rewrited the first phrase to avoid the classic confusion between vine and tea, and to restore priorities: as almost all other vernacular names, ayahuasca firstly refers to the vine.</p>
<p>In reading the history of this article, I realized it is some kind of stalactite: successive depositions around an almost unchanged initial nucleus, without other guiding strategy than a form of crude gravitational force. Clearly a deep reorganization around a well thought-out architecture is needed for this article to honor its subject. My proposal is to structure it along botanical, anthropological, pharmacological, and psychological aspects, with notes and references. A lot of work...</p>
<p>I have reformatted the Books section according to a mixed MLA (the italics) - APA style (the rest), combining lisibility, accuracy, and handiness (ISBN links). It is also enriched in scholar references. Doctorcito 18:04, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>sounds good to me, doc. if you need a hand, just tell me what to do. I'd be more than happy to help you out where needed, especially with grammer and stuff. I feel much more comfortable with your scholarly analysis and contribution than mine! <a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeah_5965.html" title="User:Heah">Heah</a> 19:04, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wouldn't it be appropriate to mention that under US law some of the chemical constituents are legal, and others are not? B. caapi is grown commercially within the US, and contains no banned alkaloids.</p>
<p>Also, should Syrian rue really be listed here? Yeah, it's a good MAOI source, but it's not a traditional ingredient in ayahuasca. It's an old-world plant, not an amazonian one, and the name "ayahuasca" also refers to the B. caapi vine. (I hear the vine and Syrian rue have subtly different effects, as well, but not having had ayahuasca I wouldn't know.)</p>
<ul>
<li>technically, none of the <i>plants</i> are scheduled, and can all be bought, sold, imported, and so on; they are also grown commercially within the us. concoctions made from these plants, on the other hand, are illegal- ie ayahuasca tea, as a prepared dmt drink. ayahuasca has never officially been scheduled but has occasionally shown up as a scheduled substance because of the dmt. perhaps there should be a little something about all that. as for the rue and caapi, i kinda think this just needs a lot of rewording and reworking. i feel like rue should at least be mentioned, as people have different ideas of what ayahuasca is. you're right, of course, and from what my good friend tells me the differences aint so subtle.<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeah_5965.html" title="User:Heah">Heah</a> 14:55, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Edited the page a little to remove some of the cultural bias (more correctly, ignorance of the indigenous cultures using ayawaska) which gave this article a strongly Euro-American viewpoint that ayawaska is only a psychedelic and that DMT is an essential element. DMT is not essential, and ayawaska is used for non-psychedelic medicinal purposes as well. <a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMurple_ec9a.html" title="User:Murple">Murple</a> 31 Aug 2005</p>

<p>Absolutely couldnt agree more. also ayahuasca Analogues which do not contain b.Caapi are NOT AYAHUASCA and should not be called as such. These druggy fools are not only completely disrespectfuly but linguistic simpletons. As for "pharmayhuasca" that is a total joke and insult to the culture of Ayahuasca. Its basically calling some chemical concoction "drug vine". Imbeciles.</p>
<p><br />
Interating how the cultural bias comes through in this section on cultural bias! By the way, the correct spelling is 'pharmahuasca', and I don't see much use in these judgemental lables for these so-called fornicating rectums or 'druggy fools'. Seems to me that ayahuasca, and the alkaloids therein, are used to expand awareness rather than contract it. Could we try to be a little more patient with those who are not as far along the path?

<p>The article opeing needs to be fixed, it uses way too detailed language. The whole article doesn't need to be in the 1st sentence.

<p>From a conversation with heart of the initiate, so anyone else interested can weigh in:</p>
<p>I appreciate the work you guys are doing, but i'm really not sure that your library qualifies as a valid external link under the wikipedia <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">external link guidelines</a>. particularly the first few "links that should normally be avoided":</p>
<ol>
<li>Any site that does not provide a unique resource beyond what the article here would have once it becomes a <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_7cf3.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article">Wikipedia:Featured article</a>.</li>
<li>Any site that contains factually inaccurate material or unverified original research, as detailed in <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>.</li>
<li>A website that you own or maintain, even if the guidelines above imply that it should be linked to. This is because of neutrality and point-of-view concerns; neutrality is an important objective at Wikipedia, and a difficult one. If it is relevant and informative, mention it on the talk page and let other — neutral — Wikipedia editors decide whether to add the link.</li>
</ol>
<p><br />
Your library, while perhaps being written with an eye to different aspects of the human condition, don't seem to have a whole lot to do with ayahuasca, per se. A collection of links to lots of articles about ayahuasca might be one thing, but almost the entire thing is written by the guy who runs your organization, ralph miller, with a handful from stewie wild.</p>
<p>As for soga del alma and wasiwaska-- soga del alma has a chapel, yes, but they are also a legally recognized religion in the country of peru, with members from all over. And they don't seem to really run retreats, although they do host the yearly conference. wasiwaska--which i don't think there is actually a link to--is primarily a research facility, not a place running ayahuasca retreats.</p>
<p>I really don't mean to denigrate the work that you guys are doing. i'm just not sure what your link adds to the article that makes it link-worthy under EL guidelines. You say that you are one of the older and more popular ayahuasca retreat centers, but i'm not sure that that, in itself, is something that would make your site worthy of a link. there are LOTS of retreat centers these days, and linking to them seems to go against EL guidelines. generally, as a rule, businesses just don't get linked to. I know that you guys are not in this for the money; running ayahuasca retreats in the jungle isn't something one gets into for the cash. but the fact remains: your website exists primarily to inform and attract people regarding your own retreat center. the library consists almost entirely of the thoughts of ralph miller. generally, operations such as yours just don't get linked to.</p>
<p>anyone else care to voice an opinion?</p>

It is actually related to the <a href="../../../b/a/h/Baha%27i_faith.html" title="Baha'i faith">Baha'i faith</a> and has absolutely nothing to do with any <i>bona fide</i> ayahuasca group. As such it has been taken out.<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThamarih_bb8f.html" title="User:Thamarih">Thamarih</a> 07:34, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The individual responsible for the Aurora Baha link has taken it upon themselves to delete a log in a discussion regarding an article. This is <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sockpuppetry.html" title="Sockpuppetry">sockpuppetry</a> and against wikipedia's terms of service. The link has been taken out again, together with the comments of said individual. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThamarih_bb8f.html" title="User:Thamarih">Thamarih</a> 02:27, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>And they are once again doing it. This individual is a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sockpuppet.html" title="Sockpuppet">sockpuppet</a>. Administrators be warned. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThamarih_bb8f.html" title="User:Thamarih">Thamarih</a> 06:00, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Administrators, the individual with the handle Aurora Baha is committing sockpuppetry, malicious deleting and changing entries. Per the Wiki terms of service, I ask their account be temporarily suspended <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThamarih_bb8f.html" title="User:Thamarih">Thamarih</a> 07:41, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The sockpuppeteer AuroraBaha is removing links and adding material to this site that does not meet Wikipedia standards. The link for the Fatimiya Sufi Order was indeed added in July of this year. That this individual has now removed it needs intervention by the administrators. This individual is vandalizing this page <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThamarih_bb8f.html" title="User:Thamarih">Thamarih</a> 09:12, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The sockpuppeteer AuroraBaha has made an unsubstantiated claim regarding his group. Inquiries have been made to the bona fide ayahuasca churches, and no one in South America has heard of it. Until such time as they can demonstrate membership, administrators be warned that this individual is committing sockpuppetry <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThamarih_bb8f.html" title="User:Thamarih">Thamarih</a> 09:23, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The website www.auroabaha.com is registered to an individual, one Seven Thunders also going by the name Lobo. It therefore has no independent value.<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThamarih_bb8f.html" title="User:Thamarih">Thamarih</a> 09:34, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><i><b>Lobo aka Aurorabaha's idea of truth</b></i></p>
<p>Lobo, has the truth prevailed about your claim,</p>
<p>"<i><b>I am of Taino descent born in the Quisqueya/Hispaniola, the first place in modern history where the use of the Sacrament (in the form of Cahoba) was recorded, in 1496. I became a Pipe-Carrier in 1996 and had Hambleche on Bear Butte with a Lakota Sun Dance chief; Keeper of the Elks Altar (this elder is well known by the Altar he Keeps). I acquired my pipe-stone directly at the quarry in Minnesota and carved both the pipes which I now carry. I began to work with the Shipibo-Conibo in 2001, and was given Camalongo as a plant to diet with - hence I became a Camalongero; In March of 2002, in the Peruvian Amazon, I received the Fire Altar of Purification of the Eagle and the Condor when the Pipe and Ayahuasca were brought together; I was later initiated as an Ayahuasquero. A banco (bench), serving as a specific function and tool of the Mother, is always bestowed by La Divina Madre Herself - a matter clear to those who have sat in ceremonies with one</b></i>. "</p>
<p>The thread is here: <a href="http://ayahuasca.tribe.net/thread/82db6f81-9517-4572-8c4d-ba945ea96783" class="external free" title="http://ayahuasca.tribe.net/thread/82db6f81-9517-4572-8c4d-ba945ea96783" rel="nofollow">http://ayahuasca.tribe.net/thread/82db6f81-9517-4572-8c4d-ba945ea96783</a></p>
<p>When you said to me in email in February,</p>
<p>"''<i><b>Regrettably, though mostly of Lebanese decent, my family uprooted from Lebanon (Miziara Region - NE of Tripoli, and about 25 minutes from Khalil Gibrans home) and relocated to the Caribean Islands. Hence, my first language is Spanish...I have only begun learning Arabic in more recent years''</b></i>."</p>
<p>Yes, let the truth prevail indeed. Your website is registered to yourself. Neither the Santo Daime, the UdV, or any number of offshoots in SA have heard of AuroraBaha. Obviously the truth has prevailed - publicly today - that you have a proclivity to fudge it. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThamarih_bb8f.html" title="User:Thamarih">Thamarih</a> 09:50, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Administrators, note that the sockpuppeteer Aurorabaha has registered under another name, i.e. Ayahuasca Churches, and is once again removing items from the main article.<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThamarih_bb8f.html" title="User:Thamarih">Thamarih</a> 01:55, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also note that sockpuppeteer Aurorabaha removed the item under IP address 66.68.115.56 which is registered to ROAD RUNNER CO HOLDCO registered in TEXAS AUSTIN ROAD RUNNER HOLDCO LLC, i.e. the location and IP of Aurorabaha aka Seven Thunders aka Lobo Siete Truenos. This is a blatant case of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sockpuppetry.html" title="Sockpuppetry">sockpuppetry</a>.

<p>Aurora Baha is a legally documented Religious Society which utilizes the Sacrament Ayahuasca. We are intimately involved in alliances with other Ayahuasqueros and other Churches involved with the Religious/Sacramental use of Ayahuasca, with a view towards Universalism and the Gathering of all peoples in Peace.</p>
<p>Any claims to the contrary is by a certain individual who abhores the fact that we hold certain Spiritual tenants of Baha'u'llah [Baha'i Faith] as important to our Religious view, and have made it their personal crusade to defame anything Baha'i or Baha'i tolerant.</p>
<p>This matter was refered to Wikipedia for Vandalism for the original removal of the listing under Ayahuasca Churches and for the false allegations made by the same person.</p>
<p>I have temporarily left the link out until such time as it is independently added by a different party, we having become aware of Wikipedias "Conflict of Interest" policy. Thank you for making us aware of the policy.</p>
<p>I have also removed the link to "Fatimiya Sufi Order" which was added by the sockpuppeteer <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurandero101_8aa2.html" title="User:Curandero101">Curandero101</a> on July 10, 2006 and is the alternate (sockpuppet) of the individual <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThamarih_bb8f.html" title="User:Thamarih">Thamarih</a> who originally vandalised the Aurora Baha Church link. The link to the "Fatimiya Sufi Order" removed is the personal creation (and website) of the same <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThamarih_bb8f.html" title="User:Thamarih">Thamarih</a>/<a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurandero101_8aa2.html" title="User:Curandero101">Curandero101</a> and is therefore subject to the same independent review and "conflict of Interest Policy". This user has been formally reported for being a sockpuppet of <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurandero101_8aa2.html" title="User:Curandero101">Curandero101</a>, the third of such incidence against him. He has presently already had two accounts closed for sockpuppet activity and has had his sockpuppeteer account temporarily blocked for the behaviour on several occasions.</p>
