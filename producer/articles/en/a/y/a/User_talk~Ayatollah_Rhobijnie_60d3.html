<p>Kermanshahi, will you please, please teach me how to be such a good user as you? How to make good articles? How to get such an enormous respect as you've got? Please, teach me, help me, give me tips, I need it! I'm your loyal servant, as you know, and I helped you to make an allready great user-portal even better. So it would be nice if you would help me. I've allready added some nice contributions, and now, I'm going to build up a user-portal. When it is a good user-portal, wil you watch it, and give me a star? Please?</p>

<p>To be a good user you have to just contribute to wikipedia a lot. After making and contributing to some good pages and if you have a good users page other users will find it by them selves and give you stars. To me they came a bit unecspected when I was doing a lot of work on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_countries_by_number_of_total_troops.html" title="List of countries by number of total troops">List of countries by number of total troops</a> article i wasn't really expecting anybody to give me a star I just did it because There wasn't one on the Dutch wikipedia and that was kind of anoying when I saw there was one here without much in it I decided to expand it, then I saw that Mrlob had made my user-portal and suddenly people started giving me stars. the same will happen to you if you just add good things. <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iran.svg_133f.html" class="image" title="Flag of Iran"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/ca/Flag_of_Iran.svg/22px-Flag_of_Iran.svg.png" alt="Flag of Iran" width="22" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Iran.svg_133f.html" /></a> <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKermanshahi_c325.html" title="User:Kermanshahi">Kermanshahi</a> 21:32, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Kermanshahi, when you ever again log in on wikipedia, watch <b><a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_ea9e.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets">THIS DAMN LINK</a></b>, to see what those bastards did to us! I am sorry but I can't help you right now; sadly, at the moment, I can't even help myself. All hope for me to ever be your loyal servant is now lost. It is very sad, but you have lost your loyal servant, friends, reputation, userpage and everything for over a month; I have lost everything. It is sad, very sad, but wikipedia and all of its users had turned us down. They just don't seem to be very smart; you have shown them you right, and they just turned you down. I am so disapointed, I don't think I'll do wikipedia ever again; maybe not even under a different username...</p>
<p><b>This is probably my last message on you, and to everyone on wikipedia. I Likes the place, I was thinking how to make myself usefull. But it seems to me, that everybody has turned me down, the way this whole, ounce wonderfull website did. Goodbye, dear Kermanshahi, and Goodbye wikipedia, I shall miss you all...</b></p>

I know, Mrlob lied because the admins didn't believe him. The checkuser kind of proved you kashwialariski and him are the same person, I know it is not true but then the admins wouldn't listen so mrlob went and said it was true and that he was sorry sow he now has a 2 weeks block and those admins unblocked me. I am not happy with it at all because I know it is not true and now those admins think they are cleaver, saying see we where right all the time. You should send an e-mail to netsnipe and explain him about what mrlob did. This sertainly ruined my reputation but it even more ruined Mrlobs reputation. He said to me he had no other choise and he rather had you 2 blocked than himself I'm afraid my help isn't wort much as those admins didn't even want to listen to me when I was defending myself, what will help is to stay polite otherwise they definetly won't llisten to you. I'll try to cantact Netsnipe about this lie of mrlob. Please stay active on your talk page and don't make any other accounts. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKermanshahi_c325.html" title="User:Kermanshahi">Kermanshahi</a> 12:34, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have send a message to netsnipe about it hopefully he will listen, and don't forget Mrlob is ustill banned. BTW look on the ditch wikipedia on my talk page my account is kermansjahi and he is MaoVerdonk, Sirlob and dr Hans. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKermanshahi_c325.html" title="User:Kermanshahi">Kermanshahi</a> 12:48, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well he is not really a friend (blowland is Bytheway) but do I know him in real life, and why would you think I am half dutch? Netsnipe has not answered me but I' hoping he does, he probably can't speak dutch but I hope some other admin can and that he will than tell Netsnipe, I could translate it myself but I don't think he will believe me. Well, I hope you get unblocked soon. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKermanshahi_c325.html" title="User:Kermanshahi">Kermanshahi</a> 15:13, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think your Dutch, because you mentioned it on Blowlands' talk page. I've watched his talk page several times; it is related to my <b><a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_ea9e.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets">THIS DAMN LINK</a></b>-thing, so that probably explains it all. And why, by the way, should an <b><a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian.html" title="Iranian">Iranian</a></b> be able to write Dutch? You said it yourself, that you where also active on the <b><a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch.html" title="Dutch">Dutch</a></b>-wikipedia.

<p>Well I live in The Netherlands, not in Iran thats why I can speak Dutch and thats why I am also active onthe dutch wikipedia.

<p>He said you and Mrlob have the same IP so he is not going to unban you.

<p>I haven't given up all hope... ...yet... ...thats partly because of someone re-adding my user-page; for that, <b>my severe thanks</b>!

<p>I added a section on your users page where I explain your innocence. Please send that Netsnipe a message, when you try to edit anf there sais you are banned you can find somewhere where you can send an e-mail to netsnipe, please do it it is the only way to get out of this, he will argue that you are a sock puppet but I think he will realise you are not eventually because why would Mrlob do that. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKermanshahi_c325.html" title="User:Kermanshahi">Kermanshahi</a> 15:21, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well I got some news about him: He made a new account <a href="../../../m/a/o/User%7EMaoVerdonk_9eed.html" title="User:MaoVerdonk">MaoVerdonk</a> and changed kashwialariski to my sockpuppet and added sockpuppeteer to my users page plus he made an artickle with my sockpuppets. I deleted all of it and the admins complained about that I was doing vandalisme so I told them what happened and they found his real puppet acounts and banned tham plus <b>his bann is extended to 2 months</b>. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKermanshahi_c325.html" title="User:Kermanshahi">Kermanshahi</a> 06:32, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Kermanshahi, I thank you for having that Mrlob blocked for another two-months. But, I still don't think it is enough, considering that I will <i>never</i>, <i>ever</i>, edit wikipedia again under this user-name. And that sucks. But still, thanks, tanks for everything, and thanks for your help. Humble greeting,</p>

<p>Please don't geve up yet, send Netsnipe a message. Blowland got himself out of it too like that, Mrlob got him banned as a sockpuppet of him and than he send a message and I helped a bit and now he is back on. And as soon as Mrlob has a new sockpuppet he will be banned for ever too so he is finished. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKermanshahi_c325.html" title="User:Kermanshahi">Kermanshahi</a> 14:32, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, in thatcase; I really hope he does something wrong again soon; I wanna see the <b><a href="../../../m/r/l/User%7EMrlob_8c47.html" title="User:Mrlob">bastard</a></b> pay for what he did to me (and other, innocent users)!</p>

<p>I am currently e-mailing with an admin about this, just stay active cause I'm trying my best to get you unbanned. I'm telling the true story and he said he trusts me so I hope I can get you unbanned because I know you are innocent. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKermanshahi_c325.html" title="User:Kermanshahi">Kermanshahi</a> 20:23, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I shall actve, in that case. And I will await your answers anxiously. I don't know which admin your e-mailing with. But I know, there still are a few you can really trust. They can't help nor stop Mrlob for spreading his lies all over the place either! Humble greetings,</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAyatollah_Rhobijnie_7c24.html" title="User:Ayatollah Rhobijnie">Rhobinji, loyal servant of the Great and Mostly Honarable Kermanshahi!</a> 08:57, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Now the bigest problem is their Checkuser proved you are him, that's why they believed him. How do you explain that? I can't really, I only give arguments why you can't be him, like him admitting it and you wanting him to get banned. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKermanshahi_c325.html" title="User:Kermanshahi">Kermanshahi</a> 07:24, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'll stop with wikipedia now. It just doesn't workes for me. When everything seems certainly working against me, I simple don't see any point in going on even longer. I'll quit wikipedia, Kermanshahi; It ain't your fault, but you'd be better searching for a new loyal servant. Goodbye,</p>

<p>Please don't stop yet I'll send 1 last e-mail where in I tell what happened and ask for a final answer and if it is now than I agree there is nothing else you can do than stop. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKermanshahi_c325.html" title="User:Kermanshahi">Kermanshahi</a> 14:25, 8 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, in that case; I shall await your final answer, and after I heared it, and I'll get unblocked, than I;ll remain active. Otherwise, when it is negative, I'll quit wikipedia. Forever. At least, I will answer your message, whatever that message might be. Greetings,</p>
