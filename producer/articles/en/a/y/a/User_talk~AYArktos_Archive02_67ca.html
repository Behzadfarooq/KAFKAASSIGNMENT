<p>Thanks. I grew up in Albury, but left 45 years ago. When I was there, it certainly was the longest station in the Southern Hemisphere, or so I was told by my teachers. I believe it has since been overtaken, but can't confirm the details. Mind you, I was also taught that Ayers Rock (now Uluru) is the world's largest monolith - in fact it is the second largest, the honours going to Mt Augustus(?) in Western Australia, which most people have never even heard of. And I was also taught that the Sydney Harbour Bridge is the world's longest single span bridge, which was never true. It was beaten by a few meters by a bridge in the USA, built before the SH Bridhe was even completed. So "facts" are not always facts. How's Canberra this snowy day? I lived there for 27 years until moving to Melbourne in 2002. Cheers <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 23:39, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is a bit hard to generalise the link that was placed in the Holbrook article as a business directory. The site also includes our local newsletter which I believe should be seen on websites relating to the town of Holbrook. --Hail 22:19, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I'm going to work the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canberra.html" title="Canberra">Canberra</a> article up to featured status.

<p>Hi, I had a picture of Glebe Park and have been meaning to upload it to contribute to the canberra wiki project. I noticed that you seemed to know something about its past, so I uploaded the pic and created the page. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> also included an external link on the Civic page, and it seems to have lotso f useful info.

<p>Hi AY, I've seen your post about Commercial centres. I agree that something needs to be done, but want to have a bit of a think about it before I get back to you.

<p>Howdy! I didn't create the Nimmitabel article, I just added information to that one. 203.129.49.214 created it, but didn't have to much to say, I just started adding info, I didn't even look at, or think about, the namming convention. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiDon_41bb.html" title="User:WikiDon">WikiDon</a> 15:16, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Thanks for catching my spelling mistakes. See what happens when it is late. Could you add a caption to the photo saying which way we are looking, and maybe what the main building is across the street? <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiDon_41bb.html" title="User:WikiDon">WikiDon</a> 16:25, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Why take out my "driving distances"?
<ul>
<li>1) If you only knew how long it took to complie the list.</li>
<li>2) It is not a question of the file being to large. If the file ever got really big, I could get behind taking it out.</li>
<li>3) I put it in for people who might be from Kansas, or some such place, to give them added information.</li>
<li>4) It adds value, I like things that add value to articles.</li>
<li>5) I thought maybe an extra tourist or two might see that they can stop off on the way from Melbourne to Sydney (of course if gas keeps going up they all take the train or fly and not drive through there).</li>
<li>6) I got interested in the town because I was watching the movie, which made me want to learn more, so I thought I would make it easier for the next geographically-&amp;-historically-inclined-movie fan to learn more. And, speed up the process.</li>
<li>7) It took up 200 bytes of space, we can afford it.</li>

<ul>
<li>Well,
<ul>
<li>1) What about Bombala? It is closer than Bega.</li>
<li>2) Picking Seattle, New York and Los Angeles, or even Boston for a neighborhood in Dallas, Texas is a <b>silly-ridiculous</b> analogy. They are <b>thousands</b> of miles away. Scyene is just a neighborhood of Dallas now, or at best a suburb (bad example). But if you look at <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheyenne%2C_Oklahoma_dfe1.html" title="Cheyenne, Oklahoma">Cheyenne, Oklahoma</a> you will see the two closet cities of some size, Amarillo, Texas, and Oklahoma City, Okalahoma. Adelaide and Melbourne are a stretch, but Sydney and Canberra are not out of the question. Sydney (of Australian cities) is, or course, the city most known around the world, and using it for a reference point is not out of the question. If you picked a town, say <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pendelton%2C_Oregon_ea49.html" title="Pendelton, Oregon">Pendelton, Oregon</a>, it would be well within reason to put in Spokane, Washington; Portland, Oregon; Seattle, Washington; Boise, Idaho; Kennewick and Walla Walla, Washington; Umatilla and Baker, Oregon. Seattle like Sydney gives you not only a reasonably good city that is well know, but for also their economic and transportation ties between the two places. If I said "<a href="../../../b/i/c/Bicknell%2C_Utah_ab61.html" title="Bicknell, Utah">Bicknell, Utah</a>", you would say "what"? But, I added that it is "212 miles (south of) Salt Lake City", so now you might have a ready idea of at least where in the world it is, and how far it is to nearest major city/airport. Cheyenne, Oklahoma has economic and trading ties to both Amarillo and Okalhoma City, Bicknell has trading ties to Salt Lake City. If I say "<a href="../../../c/h/e/Chetwynd%2C_British_Columbia_74fe.html" title="Chetwynd, British Columbia">Chetwynd, British Columbia</a>" you might not have a clue. But if I tell you how far it is, and it what direction from both Vancouver, B.C. and Edmonton, Alberta, you might get an idea, and an easy way to find it on your road atlas of Canada.</li>
<li>3) I say the more aminition you have the better. Arm the masses with knowledge. It is not unrealistic to tell the reader how far Cheyenne is from Oklahoma City, Pendelton from Seattle, Bicknell from Salt Lake City, Chetwynd from Vancouver, and Nimmitable is from Sydney.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Are you sure the Institute of Advanced Studies is commonly refered to as "the Institute"?

<dd>Hi again. I don't care enough to change it. The usage of accronyms around the university must vary, our school is often refered to as RSPhysSE and many of the others are refered to as acronyms in general conversation such as RSBS and RSC. I guess "the institute" makes sense in the article, I am just surprised that it would be a more common usage than the IAS. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartyman_a0b9.html" title="User:Martyman">Martyman</a> 03:09, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hiya AYArktos. I'm not entirely sure why you don't think this has been resolved? The Rfar was initiated against Skyring in large part because he would not accept the consensus. It was resolved among editors at <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government_of_Australia_74b0.html" title="Government of Australia">Government of Australia</a> that Skyring's (perhaps purposefully) flawed understanding/argument was incorrect, but that a view of the G-G as HoS was held by a large enough minority to be noted in the article - without extending it any credence. Astrokey's vote concurs with that resolution; I'm not sure why he chose to state it after-the-event. --<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">Talk</a> 04:43, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I converted the time entries to a 24 hour clock based on the Wikipedia Manual of Style concerning formatting of time.</p>
<p><i>Times should be written in the 24-hour clock (hh:mm or hh:mm:ss). The 12-hour clock has a number of problems: it isn't used throughout the world; it often makes it harder to convert between different time zones; and "12:00 am" and "12:00 pm" are ambiguous.</i></p>

<p>That being said, I see no point in getting into a revert war so I will leave it as a 12-hour clock.</p>

<p>Hi AYArktos! I greatly appreciate your help with my newest project. I seem to have come to an important crossroads. Before you go any further head over to my My Laboratory and read the message I posted there at the top. I'm not abandoning the project, but I need to come to some guidelines that would remain in place once and for all. I do appreciate your willingness to help me with this. Even though, it can be <i>very</i> tedious and possibly even boring. <a href="../../../j/a/b/User%7EJaberwocky6669_a14e.html" title="User:Jaberwocky6669">Jaberwocky6669</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/b/User_talk%7EJaberwocky6669_d6e6.html" title="User talk:Jaberwocky6669"><font color="orange">☎</font></a></p>
<p>The reason I started this experiment was to possibly influence future policy. Failing that, the information is useful in determing Wikipedia's adminship idealogy. As for an intended audience, considering that WP is an open place, then anyone who feels that they may find our results to be useful may use them however they saw fit. A while back I asked if there was a peer review process for editors <i>before</i> they nominated themselves for adminship status. I didn't ask because I necessarily wanted to ba an admin. I still don't as I don't feel I could wield the mop just yet. BTW, I can't get over these amazing results you came up with! So, we don't have to do every single month (please say yes!) That would be awesome! But we would have to do both successful and unsuccessful ones right? <a href="../../../j/a/b/User%7EJaberwocky6669_a14e.html" title="User:Jaberwocky6669">Jaberwocky6669</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/b/User_talk%7EJaberwocky6669_d6e6.html" title="User talk:Jaberwocky6669"><font color="orange">☎</font></a> 00:54, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>You are doing some amazing work! While I am racking my brains over streamlining the tally sheets you've already got to the point to where you can draw conclusions! Awesome! You are a valuable <i>cornerstone</i> upon which this building relies! <a href="../../../j/a/b/User%7EJaberwocky6669_a14e.html" title="User:Jaberwocky6669">Jaberwocky6669</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/b/User_talk%7EJaberwocky6669_d6e6.html" title="User talk:Jaberwocky6669"><font color="orange">☎</font></a> 01:37, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Those are interesting conclusions. I noticed that there are far fewer unsuccessful candidacies so it will take more tries before a more definitive conclusion can be drawn! I hope to see you stick around even if you don't help out as much as you have been but if you would like to cool down I would understand. I am very happy with what just you alone have done. <a href="../../../j/a/b/User%7EJaberwocky6669_a14e.html" title="User:Jaberwocky6669">Jaberwocky6669</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/b/User_talk%7EJaberwocky6669_d6e6.html" title="User talk:Jaberwocky6669"><font color="orange">☎</font></a> 00:05, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>P.S. did you keep count with my tally sheets? If so could you get them to me so that I can keep them together in one place?

<dd>I'm not saying that you haven't - I'm saying that it looks as if you haven't. It looks really unprofessional, and I just don't see any justification for it. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 01:40, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please do archive recent/discussions in progress. I just archived 2/3 of the talk; and talk pages need not conform to 32k limit. Furthermore the articles was just mentioned on an NPR radio program, which pointed to the discussion page as a key part of Wikipedia's strength. With nothing there it may (initially) be confusing to new users. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 23:19, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Heh, yeah I meant do not. I did say aggressive, and I also lamented I could not reduce it further. The reason I did not take it further is because not fragmenting discussion takes precedence over file limitations. If there is even a possibility a thread is ongoing (as there was for everything I left since it was posted in the last few days) you leave it. As to reinstating some of it, I will reinstate everything, not out of spite... but because to not do so means more work for everyone actually involved in the discussion. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 23:42, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>PS: If someone does have that limitation with their browser, then we tell them to edit sections only.

<dd>On second thought, I won't bother. If there are issues we can adapt. Didn't care much for that discussion anyway. :"D Just remember, don't fragment discussions. - <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_492a.html" title="User:RoyBoy">Roy</a><a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyBoy_dc3a.html" title="User talk:RoyBoy"><b>Boy</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyBoy_The_800_Club_b619.html" title="User:RoyBoy/The 800 Club">800</a></sup> 23:48, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, what was your copyright justification for your additions to the Red Hill article on <i>13:17, 10 August 2005</i> from the pedal power site? --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartyman_a0b9.html" title="User:Martyman">Martyman</a>-<span style="font-size:90%"><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartyman_49e7.html" title="User talk:Martyman">(talk)</a></span> 11:24, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Umm, just because other people have also stolen the text doens't make it public domain. Also admitting you have made a copy and paste copyright violation doesn make it legal. The only way you could use a solid block of text like that would be to include it in the article as a quote from the other source. ie. Evironment ACT has this to say about Red Hill "blah blah blah". --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartyman_a0b9.html" title="User:Martyman">Martyman</a>-<span style="font-size:90%"><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartyman_49e7.html" title="User talk:Martyman">(talk)</a></span> 20:55, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
