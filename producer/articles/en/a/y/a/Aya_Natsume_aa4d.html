<p>Aya is the younger sister of <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shin_Natsume_07a3.html" title="Shin Natsume">Shin Natsume</a>, and <a href="../../../m/a/y/Maya_Natsume_7952.html" title="Maya Natsume">Maya Natsume</a>. She is a freshman at Toudou Academy. She has a similar build to her sister and is close to equaling her in bust size. Since the first time they met, she has decided to become <a href="../../../s/o/u/Souichiro_Nagi_d835.html" title="Souichiro Nagi">Souichiro Nagi</a>’s wife because she believes it's fate; and it follows the tradition of the Natsume women. This attraction to Souichiro also leads to a rift between her and her sister, as Souichiro is in love with Maya. Though out the series, she has increased her skill and dedication so she can support Souichirou in anyway.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/a/s/Masataka_Takayanagi_7588.html" title="Masataka Takayanagi">Masataka Takayanagi</a> is also in love with Aya, but she has shown no interest in him.</p>
<p>Throughout the Manga, it is shown that Souichiro and Aya have some sort of mental connection between them that calls to the other when they are in trouble <sup id="_ref-H1_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-H1" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-H2_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-H2" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-H3_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-H3" title="">[3]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-H4_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-H4" title="">[4]</a></sup>. This could be due to their powers complimenting each other, since Nagi's dragon fist provides unlimited ki and Aya's dragon eye absorbs unlimited ki.</p>

<p>Aya has the power of the <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon.html" title="Dragon">Dragon</a>'s Eye (竜目, <i>ryuu me</i> or <i>ryuugan</i>), which synchronizes with the spirits of all things<sup id="_ref-D.eyes_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-D.eyes" title="">[6]</a></sup>, thus allowing her to see anywhere past, present, possible futures as well as seeing and hearing the dead. Aya can also use her Dragon's Eye to project herself outside her body. The Dragon's Eye can literally drain infinite ki, so sustaining it too long can cause the user to lose consciousness. She fully awakened this power around the time she entered high school, unlike her brother who awakened his power when he was still a boy. Although when younger she showed signs of her ability, since she was able to hear her dead parents voices when they were speaking to Shin.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/y/a/Aya_Natsume_aa4d.html" title="Edit section: Swordsmanship">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Swordsmanship</span></h3>
<p>Aya has an affinity for katanas, and is fairly skilled with them. She isn't as skilled as someone like <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madoka_Mawari_2efb.html" title="Madoka Mawari">Madoka Mawari</a>, nor does she seem as good as her sister. Aya's first katana was shattered by Ryuzaki, and after a brief time in possession of Reiki, she borrows other swords.</p>

<p>Aya has developed a relationship with Reiki an evil ceremonial <a href="../../../n/o/d/Nodachi.html" title="Nodachi">Nodachi</a>, that is her family's heir loom. Her sister is the current guardian of the blade, but as Reiki has its' own spirit, Aya's Dragon Eyes have enabled her to speak to it. The Reiki seems to indicate the two will eventually become one, so Aya may indeed gain possession of the Reiki eventually. Unlike Maya, Aya actually has a special power and thus can activate the Reiki's power even though her sister can not.</p>

<p>The series starts with Masataka meeting Aya, and he falls in love with her at first sight. Aya on the other hand has no interest in Masataka, as she falls in love with Souichiro after he falls through the roof of the shower room she is in. She was rejected by Souichiro, but she continues to pursue him none the less.</p>
<p>As Masataka beats up on Souichiro after Souichiro attempted to sucker punch him, Aya "wakes him up" by yelling at him. She also refers to Masataka as a low level martial artist greatly disheartening him, which she doesn't understand. Souichiro uses the lunch Aya forced on him to do his "barrier" technique by shoving it in Masataka's face, and then punching him in the stomach. Now fully enraged by his rejection by Aya, Souichiro's rude treatment of a gift from Aya, and his cheap shot; Masataka attacks Souichiro in a berserker rage. Souichiro is pushed back to the wall by the enraged Masataka who gives him a severe beating, Maya and Aya tried to stop Masataka, but they are tossed away. In the Anime this is by far the most violent beating, at one point hitting Souichiro in the stomach so hard he vomits. In the end, Masataka misses his finishing blow (most likely intentionally), shattering the concrete wall behind Souichiro. This beating makes Souichiro make a promise to Aya to never lose again.</p>
<p>Later as <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Makihara_d6b9.html" title="Bob Makihara">Bob Makihara</a>'s motorcycle is burned, Souichiro and Bob realize Bob's girlfriend Chiaki is in danger. They rush to the laundry-mat to help, but Chiaki has already been assaulted (raped in the manga). They are subsequently beat down by an Enforcement Group member, Ryuzaki. Aya picks up on these events with her dragon eyes and rushes to help. She is too late, and is hit by Ryuzaki ripping her shirt open after he breaks her katana on his way out.</p>
<p>As Souichiro joins the Juuken Club and is trained by Maya. Aya starts to grow increasingly paranoid of the relationship between Souichiro and her sister. It did not help of what vision was shown to her by her dragon eyes.</p>
<p>The group later gets attacked at a bowling alley and Aya is isolated after an argument with her sister regarding Souichiro. She is attacked by Tagami, an Enforcement Group member who fears her potential power. Given Tagami's weapon is a staff she moves up the stairwell to a narrow space to limit his movements. Unfortunately Tagami can split his staff into a multi-section weapon and Aya takes some damage, before she moves the fight to the roof. Aya's dragon eyes awaken and she starts to become over-enthusiastic to the fight as she gives into the dragon. She mercilessly beats Tagami, knowing every move he will make before he makes it. Despite the fact she hears his thoughts, and knows his bones etc... are breaking she can't stop herself and nearly kills him. Afterward she is very torn up about her actions, until Souichiro reassures her. She later tries to take on Mitsuomi with Tagami's staff, but Mitsuomi uses the Muscle Bomb to shatter the staff and knock her down with out actually moving himself. Later as her dragon eyes activate, he merely flicks her in the forehead, but it's enough to knock her unconscious.</p>

<p>As her sword was shattered by Ryuzaki she elects to borrow a new one from her sister, she fails to tell her sister that however. Maya is quite surprised to find the family's heir loom, Reiki missing. Once she realizes Aya has taken it she is quite concerned. Reiki had played a large role in driving her brother Shin crazy, eventually leading to his death. As word gets out the school enters an uproar, when <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitsuomi_Takayanagi_bc5c.html" title="Mitsuomi Takayanagi">Mitsuomi Takayanagi</a> the Enforcement Group President finds out he agrees to help search for Aya, despite his conflict with the Juuken Club.</p>
<p>Aya meanwhile doesn't understand the significance of her possession of Reiki and thinks her sister is just picking on her. She ask Masataka Takayanagi to let her stay at his place for awhile. As he has a crush on her, and as no one has told him what was going on he of course agrees. While at Masataka's Aya sees her brother's ghost coming to take Reiki away from her. He says it will only bring her sadness most likely destroying her like it did him <sup id="_ref-Aya_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Aya" title="">[7]</a></sup>, but she insists she wants to get stronger eventually convincing him to leave it. In the end Maya ends up fighting her sister over the whole thing, Aya loses and Maya takes Reiki back. Despite this, after some encouragement from Souichiro, Aya gets in good spirits again.</p>
<p>Mitsuomi also agrees to put of all aggression until the schools annual election tournament.</p>

<p>There are 12 families that have historically support the Takayangi family, but have broken up. The families are split into white and red feathers, the Red Feather Families all have a special power. Natsume was one of the Red Feather Families with the Dragon Eyes as the family's power. The new alliance of the heads of families has formed supposedly under Mitsuomi and call themselves 'F' (although all 12 have not joined). Despite Mitsuomi's order to wait for the tournament, F attacks the Juuken club anyway. It is later revealed they don't follow Mitsuomi, but Souichiro's estranged father, Sohaku Kago.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/y/a/Aya_Natsume_aa4d.html" title="Edit section: F arc">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">F arc</span></h4>
<p>Aya is assigned to taking care of Souichiro and to help him train. She takes him to a house where <a href="../../../d/%C5%8D/g/D%C5%8Dgen_Takayanagi_b4e8.html" title="Dōgen Takayanagi">Dōgen Takayanagi</a> and his mother, <a href="../../../m/a/k/Makiko_Nagi_8d1f.html" title="Makiko Nagi">Makiko Nagi</a>, are. He refuses to train with them. He is subsequently taught his place by Aya, and attacked by masked warriors, and returns to the house to find one of the masked men holding a knife to his mother's eyepatch. As a result, Souichiro awakens his Demon Exorcist self, and it is revealed the masked assailants are actually the former heads of the 12 families (Natsume and Kago excluded). He is trained by them for awhile before he is attacked by <a href="../../../t/e/s/Tessen_Ishiyumi_ac36.html" title="Tessen Ishiyumi">Tessen Ishiyumi</a>, Aya is nearly killed as she arrives, but Souichiro saves her.</p>
<p>Much later a boy named Mouki Enmi shows up at the Natsume house, claiming his home was attacked. It turns out Enmi is one of the 36 branch families, a branch of the Natsume family in this case and thus he has a similar power to the dragon eyes. This causes the Red Wing Resonance Effect allowing Aya to use her powers more easily. As Mouki is kidnapped by men on motorcycles, Aya and Souichiro hunt down the men on a scooter using Aya's dragon eyes to find all the shortcuts through town. She defeats the men and takes Mouki back. It turns out the assault on the Enmi family, was done by the F member, <a href="../../../j/u/s/Jushi_Mataza_Tsumuji_a65a.html" title="Jushi Mataza Tsumuji">Jushi Mataza Tsumuji</a>. Aya, Souichiro, Mouki and the stow away Shinichirō Kurei, head to Kyushu to investigate.</p>
<p>There they encounter Yorihira Tsumuji, Mataza's father who assists them initially. Turns out F is after the Enmi family scroll, more specifically a computer chip hidden with the scroll. A huge conflict breaks out between Yorihira, and Mataza with Aya, Souichiro and Mouki trapped in the middle. This culminates in a battle between Mataza and Souichiro, one so fast paced Aya can't intervene even with her dragon eyes working perfectly for her. In the end the victory goes to Souichiro, but he is driven crazy by his "Dragon" and attacks Aya and the others. He is stopped by his mother who loses her arm in the process of stopping him.</p>

<p>Later, Aya returns to the Juuken Club, alone. She reveals Souichiro has been kidnapped by his father <a href="../../../s/%C5%8D/h/S%C5%8Dhaku_Kago_11cb.html" title="Sōhaku Kago">Sōhaku Kago</a>. Aya is so sure he will return she doesn't try to save him, but instead trains to get stronger. Despite her outer determination, she is very upset on the inside. As Maya, Mitsuomi, and Madoka Mawari go to rescue Souichiro and kill Souhaku, leaving Aya remains behind. However, Reiki (which was with Maya), awakens Aya's dragon eyes and shows her Maya's battle. Aya awakens Reiki for her sister allowing her to defeat <a href="../../../t/e/t/Tetsuhito_Kagiroi_e62e.html" title="Tetsuhito Kagiroi">Tetsuhito Kagiroi</a>.</p>

<p>Reiki using Maya's stored up ki, creates a visual body for Aya to see, a naked woman, and takes her on a tour of past events. Everything from the reason Tetsuhito can use other family's powers to visions of ancient Japan and her ancestor. She views two time periods at once at one point, witnessing the (implied) insertion of Souhaku's eye into Souichiro's body. Eventually she regains herself to find Hirohiko Myouun Kabane looking over her along with Mitsuiro Tokuan Shōjō. She throws Hirohiko across the room, but calms down when Mitsuiro shapeshifts to look like Aya.</p>

<p>The story jumps to the start of the tournament, and Aya has cut off some of her hair. As she looks at Souichiro on their way home one day, one of her dragon eyes awakens and she sees Souichiro morph into Souhaku. Suddenly he returns to normal and she is left confused of what to do. It seems she is the only one who knows Souhaku's eye was placed in Souichiro, but it's unknown if she is helping keep his personality dominant or Souhaku is just laying low for now.</p>
<p>As the tournament starts the Juuken Club gets pinned down by their first round opponents, the Archery Club. Aya and the others are helpless as they can't get to the Archery Club's position. Masataka slept in on accident and on his way to the fight encounters Tagami. Tagami shows Masataka a shortcut to the Archery Club's position, where Masataka crushes the leaders crossbow and wins the round for the team <sup id="_ref-round_1_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-round_1" title="">[8]</a></sup>.</p>
