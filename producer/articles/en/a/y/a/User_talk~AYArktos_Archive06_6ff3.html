<h2><span class="mw-headline">Re link removals</span></h2>
<p>Looking at your comments below - I was hoping you would hear my opinion as well. It took many years and 1000s of people's contributions to create such an amazing repository of images on underwater.com.au - a community website - and yes it does have commercial aspects as well, but how could a website like that run any other way.</p>
<p>We have a community of people that spend a lot of their time at not charge to put photos into our galleries, to catalogue the underwater world of australia and to encourage visiting these amazing destinations.</p>
<p>I agree with not creating links to purely commercial sites and links that add no further content to wikipedia, but honestly believe these collections (which are constantly growing as the community keep submitting images) are a value add to the articles on wikipedia - most people don't even realise the amount of underwater life and beauty Australia has to offer. We don't need the 10s of click a week we would be getting from wiki links but honestly believed them to be an enrichment of the site.</p>
<p>Also the links are not merely to a collection of pictures - they also crosslink to articles by the community if they are related.</p>
<p>Of course i will respect the decisions of the wiki family and will not post a collection of external links again.</p>
<p>I would like hearing from you.</p>

<p><i>Could people please offer opinions on external links added in these edits. The pictures are very pretty and possibly encyclopedic, but I think it skates a fine line it terms of being a commercial website. - What do you think? -- Adz|talk 15:12, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
<p><i>Adding links from one website to a bunch of otherwise unrelated articles with no other content-adding edits? Looks like linkspam to me! pfctdayelise (translate?) 15:52, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
<p><i>* I feel that they fall within the scope for removal under Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not a mirror or a repository of links, images, or media files: There is nothing wrong with adding one or more useful content-relevant links to an article; however, excessive lists can dwarf articles and detract from the purpose of Wikipedia. The link is merely to a collection of pictures. Interested readers, if they were looking for pictures, could find them in other ways, eg Google. I agree with Pfctdayelise, looks like Linkspam.--A Y Arktos\talk 20:35, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</i></p>
<p><i>They seem clearly commercial to me. The front page (at least from the link in the Broome article) contains items for sale. I would remove them all, along with any other commercial links already there. Kevin 21:59, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</i></p>

<p>just checking if you got my comments re the link removals</p>
<p>Response copied from IPs talk page: *Hi I got your message and was mulling it over. I think the problem is also the addition of links about underwater photography to city pages. If the link been dealing with a reef or other predominantly underwater topic, then perhaps would stay. The increasing preference is that external links are really only references to the content, not additional tangential material. Hope this makes sense - if not feel free to queryRegards--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A&#160;Y&#160;Arktos</a>\<sup><a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">talk</a></sup> 08:34, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>the thing is that most people forget the underwater life the cities have to offer - appreciation should go underwater as well - which is what we are all about and why we have such an active community of contributors. It is not about the photography, it is about what is to see especially at that location - which is why we have made our gallery based on localities.</p>
<p>But who is the judge of all this - maybe I should write a short article addition on each locality and reference underwater and the gallery - would that be something wikipedia is more happy with&#160;?</p>

<dd>He's been told how to sign posts, and still refuses to do so. It's hardly rocket science. I'm going to block him on that behaviour alone if he persists in ignoring reasonable requests. Nobody needs to go along behind him and clean up - that's not why we're here. The rest of his anti-social behaviour only brings a block even closer. I used to work for his ISP. Contacting them isn't going to be easy, as most technical support staff are outsourced nowadays and any chance of reaching anyone able to do anything about this user are very remote. I think the best course of action if and when they return is simply to block the entire range. Affected customers can then determine if it's worth sticking with an ISP that doesn't act on disruptive users. Any help you need with this character, let me know. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> 22:32, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Our comments on respective talk pages overlapped. My comments about the 3RR apply to all editors. I am somewhat interested in Armstrong, also Landis and enjoy watching the TdF. I don't have a strong view though whether or not the section is POV or otherwise - thus in the case of the Armstrong article I am not interested in the content - only the behaviour. The other user presently involved seems well aware of the 3RR.

<dd>Please just think about it: What is the sense of a POV-tag if it can just be removed by someone without any discussion, claiming there is nothing controversial? The very fact that there is someone who reinserts the tag shows there is a dispute. Of course this someone can be a nerd who sees a dispute where no one else does. This is not the case here, as can be easily seen at the talk page where Calton did not even bother to participate in the discussion. Removing a POV-tag without consensus is vandalism, as is removing requests for citations of unsourced quotes, there is nothing controversial about the fact that a quote in a quote section needs to be sourced. <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESocafan_ad96.html" title="User:Socafan">Socafan</a> 02:07, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

However, it does not count as "simple vandalism", and apparently "complicated vandalism" is not exempt from the 3RR:</dd>
<dd><i><b>Improper use of dispute tags</b></i></dd>
<dd><i>Dispute tags are an important way for people to show that there are problems with the article. Do not remove them unless you are sure that the dispute is settled. As a general rule, do not remove other people's dispute tags twice during a 24 hour period. Do not place dispute tags improperly, as in when there is no dispute, and the reason for placing the dispute tag is because a suggested edit has failed to meet consensus. Instead, follow WP:CON and accept that some edits will not meet consensus. Please note that placing or removal of dispute tags does not count as simple vandalism, and therefore the reverting of such edits is not exempt from the three-revert rule.</i></dd>
<dd>I apologize and will not do it again. However, I ask you to restore the tag, as there is a content dispute. Furthermore, I ask you to think over your question. Can a POV-tag be placed consensually? If there was consensus, no POV-tag would be needed.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">History of cricket</span></h2>
<p>Hi. The history of cricket category is being used by the cricket project for generic historical articles like the four or five currently in there. If you want underarm bowling to be in a history category as well as bowling then it needs to be in one of the sub-categories: you may even need to create a new sub-category for similar items. The project is presently reviewing cricket history categorisation. --<b><a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackJack_1e91.html" title="User:BlackJack">BlackJack</a> | <sup><i><a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlackJack_a011.html" title="User talk:BlackJack">talk page</a></i></sup></b> 21:23, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sorry, I apparently wasn't signed in when I wrote the above. I hate IP addresses. --<b><a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackJack_1e91.html" title="User:BlackJack">BlackJack</a> | <sup><i><a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlackJack_a011.html" title="User talk:BlackJack">talk page</a></i></sup></b> 21:23, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Given that a new category <a href="../../../h/i/s/Category%7EHistory_of_New_Zealand_cricket_7b1c.html" title="Category:History of New Zealand cricket">category:History of New Zealand cricket</a> was created yesterday, I've placed underarm bowling in that and also in the equivalent <a href="../../../h/i/s/Category%7EHistory_of_Australian_cricket_ab73.html" title="Category:History of Australian cricket">category:History of Australian cricket</a> so that the 1981 incident is kept in the historical profile. We cannot have specific articles like this in <a href="../../../h/i/s/Category%7EHistory_of_cricket_b56d.html" title="Category:History of cricket">category:History of cricket</a> as eventually we will have enormous and uncontrollable clutter. We are looking into the creation of more new historical sub-categories to assist the process. --<b><a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackJack_1e91.html" title="User:BlackJack">BlackJack</a> | <sup><i><a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlackJack_a011.html" title="User talk:BlackJack">talk page</a></i></sup></b> 21:32, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>And yet I reckon Greg Chappell was nothing like as bad as his elder brother who frequently brought the game into disrepute. I know this all seems a bit pedantic but it is because of the potential clutter of the main history section that we need to have appropriate sub-categories. Would there be any value in splitting out the incident from the bowling article, but with suitable xrefs, to give the incident a higher profile? There is already an article about a riot at Sydney in the 1880s so a similarly direct title might be better for the 1981 event. All the best. --<b><a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackJack_1e91.html" title="User:BlackJack">BlackJack</a> | <sup><i><a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlackJack_a011.html" title="User talk:BlackJack">talk page</a></i></sup></b> 21:46, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi thanks for watching my edits. For the record I am not an alumnus of WC in Berkshire and have no pro-Berkshire feeling. The move was done because it can well be said that the Berkshire school's public school status brings it a lot more <i>attention</i> (-&gt; notability) and is quite well known internationally for being just that, and is notable enough for it to be noted in the City media. As for the school in NZ, it (like a lot of the NZ school articles) was probably added by an ex-student---its notability is local in nature (restricted to the city region it serves).</p>
<p><small><i>Following sentence added afterward</i></small>Sorry for not reading the edit summaries before writing this message. Yes obviously NZers will be thinking of the NZ school, but it would not be unreasonable to suggest that someone in... India... would be thinking of the school in the UK.<small><a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Bluefin_7d0a.html" title="User:Mr Bluefin">Mr Bluefin</a> 11:32, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>Apologies if I sounded sarcastic in my first sentence---I wanted to say it was good that someone stepped in to review my page move. I didn't intend to offend. You are right about the argument "all the other school in Berkshire follow this format" being weak, haha. My edits concentrate mainly around the NZ school articles, some of which are in a terrible state, hence my attention on this dab page as part of my project. My bone of contention is that having the unqualified dab page linking to qualified article titles for each of the schools could give the impression that all the schools are of equal prominence (which I've expressed was a wrong impression). Lol anyway this is moot for me in the short term since we'll need more discussion&#160;:D Cheers <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Bluefin_7d0a.html" title="User:Mr Bluefin">Mr Bluefin</a> 11:45, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, I entered Mount Dromedary into wiki's search box. Wiki took me to Gulaga - I didn't want to go there; I was taken there. That's why I failed to mention it. Sorry about that.</p>
<p>And no need to further implore me to sign. I signed earlier talks, it was just an oversight. Sorry I made you page thru the site to figure who I am.</p>
<p>Also, so far it has not been clear to me as to what screen/method to use to start/continue/reply to a conversation. Do I try to write on your page, or edit mine, or? Part of the confusion lies in the fact that wiki seemingly uses basically the same interface/software to generate articles as it uses for talk, etc. Cute, but not always clear, and in the case of talks/discussions/whatever, as you point out, there can be no way to have automatic signing. I've never used any kind of chat/forum whereby the author of the comment was not immediately identifiable. Maybe Wiki should think about this. Maybe something's in the FAQ, but so far I've missed it.</p>

<p>That's what the GNB were told "wagga wagga" means. But they accept whatever anybody tells them. It would be nice, if the article says "in wiradjuri dialect wagga means crow", <b>if we knew that is a correct statement</b>. Similarly the page claims that in the wiradjuri dialect, to make something a plural you repeat it. <b>Is that true?</b> I really don't think the GNB can answer those questions.</p>
<p>If that is the reference you are quoting then please rework the paragraph so that it is not stating facts about the meanings of non-english words. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarrieIrons_a500.html" title="User:GarrieIrons">Ga</a><a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGarrieIrons_ba7c.html" title="User talk:GarrieIrons">rr</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GarrieIrons_2eb8.html" title="Special:Contributions/GarrieIrons">ie</a> 23:22, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks, you are referring pretty much directly to the <i>kind of reader</i> I was trying to refer to. Personally, I can see where they are coming from I just don't appreciate their manner in doing it. I take on board your criticism about me claiming GNB don't back-check place names. I guess I'm repeating a bad arguement? But I think this is the first time I've seen someone provide the reference that GNB cited.</p>
<p>BTW do you know, is there a WP:Wagga / Riverina / Rural NSW? I am interested in contributing more to these articles, the WP:Sydney template is proving very successful in getting articles created (editors create articles listed on the template becuase, due to the number of times the template is used, putting something on the to-do list puts the to-do list item well up on Special:Wantedpages), --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarrieIrons_a500.html" title="User:GarrieIrons">Ga</a><a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGarrieIrons_ba7c.html" title="User talk:GarrieIrons">rr</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GarrieIrons_2eb8.html" title="Special:Contributions/GarrieIrons">ie</a> 00:16, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">WP:Riverina?</span></h2>
<p>I'm sure WP:Wagga Wagga would be too narrow a scope. WP:Rural Australia would be too broad and would exclude, say, Wagga Wagga Marketplace (it's a retail facility in a city!) there is already a WP:Canberra. I would drop a lot of the dross I'm doing on shopping centres and work through an established, coherent to-do list if there was one covering the Riverina or a similar area. I suggest proposing it somewhere on WP:Australia to get other participants, and get some consensus regarding a scope etc. But personally I'd go with WP:Riverina - if it gets <b>worked out</b> we can always move on to WP:Bogan River or something (gee, WP:Bogan would be interesting though!) My main thought is to put the various wagga, temora, cootamundra etc articles into some sort of community that the categories don't go all the way to providing, and maybe help create community between similar articles for the region. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarrieIrons_a500.html" title="User:GarrieIrons">Ga</a><a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGarrieIrons_ba7c.html" title="User talk:GarrieIrons">rr</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GarrieIrons_2eb8.html" title="Special:Contributions/GarrieIrons">ie</a> 00:36, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>From what I can tell, the passage from the source is stating that LaVey is better known than Rand is (which I would assume is true; I've seen LaVey interviewed for documentaries on the SciFi Channel, The History Channel, and other TV documentaries, while Rand is mostly ignored by TV). This, if anything, justifies his inclusion, as he is a very well known individual and the most famous Satanist of the 20th century.</p>
<p>LaVey's influence from Rand was mentioned in an earlier version of the article, but has since been moved the the <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objectivist_movement.html" title="Objectivist movement">Objectivist movement</a> article (where LaVeyan Satanism is discussed as having spawned off the movement). Personally, I think it would be worth adding back into Rand's article, but Rand's fans are none too pleased with that idea.</p>
<p>And that is the main problem with editing Rand-related articles. Rand's followers are quite obsessed with supressing dissenting opinions (a quality they've inherited from Rand herself), and thus often delete anything that they find objectionable, source or no source. I have tried over the past year to get them to explain their edits, but they are very unwilling to do so, and when they do they rarely give a strong argument for them. Instead, they usually give a one-line weak justification or an illogical statement to back their POV edits.</p>
<p>The most difficult of these editors to deal with is <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELaszloWalrus_c9d2.html" title="User:LaszloWalrus">User:LaszloWalrus</a>, who, despite having violated various Wikipedia policies, is allowed to continue causing problems for those of us who are trying to keep Rand-related articles neutral. His blatant disregard for the NPOV rule causes the majority of the disputes, and no amount of sourcing ever convinces him to stop deleting info that makes Rand and her followers look bad. Although AOluwatoyin seems to be a large threat to the article right now, he is really only secondary to Laszlo's bias.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I would keep an eye on any of the pro-Rand editors, as they have often worked as a team to force bias into the articles, regardless of the policy violating of members of their ideology. Honestly, I wouldn't put it past them to have create AOluwatoyin as a sock puppet (they've used at least 2 sock puppet accounts in the past). -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 00:01, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for the links. I looked around their site, and it seems to be one of those Ann Coulter-style extreme right-wing sites. This would be quite appropriate for a Rand fan to write for, as Rand is often considered a right-wing extremist herself. Whether or not this Wikipedian is the same person, we know that he is Rand fan, and thus it is quite likely that he at least agrees with the opinions of this right-wing writer and might just be a fan of him. One article of his briefly mentions philosophy, and the Wikipedian claims to be a professor of logic (which is highly unlikely, as he fails to follow the most simple rules of logic, such as avoiding ad hominem). There may be a connection or there may not; I suggest confronting him about this, given that he may be in violation of <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUsername_0c30.html" title="Wikipedia:Username">Wikipedia:Username</a>. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 04:20, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The edit of mine that you refer to is not for MrVoluntarist, but for LaszloWalrus, a repeat vandal and violator of the NPOV rule. That comment was in response to his continued attempts to censor Rand's critics. It was not meant as a personal attack, but a serious plea for actual constructive editing from an editor who is known for unconstructive work. If the admins are not going to stop him from skewing articles in his ideology's favor (so far, the only admin intervention for him has been unrelated to Rand-related articles), I can at least ask him not to do so.</p>
<p>As for MrVoluntarist, he continues to make personal attacks against me in an attempt to avoid actual discussion of his edits. He constantly resorts to logical fallacies to support his opinion (usually strawman fallacies), and then makes personal attacks against me when I point out the lack of logic in his comments. He is, unfortunately, unwilling to realize the lack of logic in his actions (despite the fact that I gave him links to articles on the fallacies) and prefers to attack me instead of sticking to the article. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 20:06, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, no. I encourage you, AYArktos, to read the full discussion. Whenever I explained my position, LGagnon would misinterpret it, even after I explain it several times, and then start to browbeat me for trivial reasons, insinuating when I was lazy. Apparently, he doesn't understand the incivility of doing so, even and especially when people start doing that to him. My positions do not contain the fallacies he describes. <a href="../../../m/r/v/User%7EMrVoluntarist_23fd.html" title="User:MrVoluntarist">MrVoluntarist</a> 22:16, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I did not call him lazy. This is just another of his strawmen. What I did say is that he was too reliant on logical fallacies, and that if he could not give his argument without them then he has no real argument. This is not incivil; it is simply pointing out the fact that a non-argument such as his can not prove anything, and thus should not even be treated as an argument. This isn't rocket science, it's Logic 101. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 22:23, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've tried Dispute Resolution over and over again, and have only come to one conclusion: <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia_talk%7EResolving_disputes_2613.html#Dispute_resolution_does_nothing" title="Wikipedia talk:Resolving disputes">dispute resolution does nothing</a>, especially when it comes to Rand-related articles. The fact of the matter is, even an admin would be outnumbered by the pro-Rand faction that trolls Rand-related articles. They have a tyranny of the majority there, despite the fact that the real philosophic world is heavily skewed against them (as Randism isn't even a real philosophy from an academic view). Pro-Rand Wikipedians such as MrV and Laszlo don't care how much NPOV enforcement we have; they still edit how they want to, and since admins rarely ever takes action against them for it (one of the most notorious pro-Rand vandals took a whole year to get banned for his blatant violations of WP:NPOV), they get to override the NPOV rule. These articles are one of Wikipedia's greatest failures, as we have only once got an admin to help us with it and even then he stopped helping us before even half the problem was solved. It's this constant unwillingness to deal with the pro-Rand faction and to fix the massive neutrality problems of Rand-related articles that has made me unwilling to even bother with dispute resolution anymore.</p>
<p>And while I understand that I should assume good faith, I think at this point I have no reason to do so with the pro-Rand faction. If you've had experience with them (especially LaszloWalrus), you know that the whole group has had multiple NPA violations just for their comments on Rand-related articles. They've shown over and over again that they don't obey Wikipedia's official policy, especially WP:NPA, WP:NPOV, WP:Civility, and WP:Verifiability. Their ideology isn't even made to allow them to do so: they are taught by Rand to disregard others, never help another human being unless they can profit from it, and only work towards their own profit. Their ideology, unfortunately, does not train them in logic (Rand was very anti-academic), and they believe that ad hominem (personal attacks) is perfectly acceptable. Because they are rarely made to follow Wikipedia's policy, I don't see why there is a problem with me pointing out the fact that they are given a free ride by the admins. If I happen to point out that Laszlo's edits are almost always violations of NPOV and I'm right about it, I don't see why I should be scolded for pointing this out. If Wikipedia wants to be taken seriously by the outside world, I think we should avoid this sort of bully culture and actually stop Wikipedians from bullying their way into absolute control over articles. If we don't, then we might as well not even have official policies. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 22:20, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The above is a reason why I have a hard time assuming good faith in LGagnon. Look at these statements: "Pro-Rand Wikipedians such as MrV and Laszlo don't care how much NPOV enforcement we have;" So, I'm pro-Rand. This, despite my claim on the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Talk%7EAtlas_Shrugged_85e7.html" title="Talk:Atlas Shrugged">Talk:Atlas Shrugged</a> page, the the article was deficient in making Rand look <i>too</i> good.

Despite these, LGagnon seems to have no problem painting me as some Rand fanatic. He is not willing to genuinely listen to what I have to say, so it's hard to justify going through the effort of responding to much more of what he's said here or elsewhere. <a href="../../../m/r/v/User%7EMrVoluntarist_23fd.html" title="User:MrVoluntarist">MrVoluntarist</a> 22:27, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Edit Summaries</span></h2>
<p>Eh...without an account, there is really no need for descriptive edit summaries. As for makinng an account, I've had one and got really involved in Wikipedia to the point of being nominated for an admin. Around that time I got really burnt out and declined the nomination. I get the wiki-itch from time to time, hence why I'm here posting at nearly 4 in the morning. There is so much crap underneath the surface with people either elevating or downgrading your view based on what they <i>think of you</i> as an editor. I suppose that is what I like best about posting anon, you can either take what I say seriously or leave it. No worries. I also get a chuckle out of using this anon account since it's a wireless signal that I get at my apartment and coffee shop that must be receiving some kind of booster signal from a local office depot. For me, it's truly anon. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 09:45, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I too ran into Dunc on one page and after going round and round, finally gave up. You know the drill.</p>
<p>I stupidly allowed my true identity to be known.

<dd>The 2006 Lebanon conflict is a month old! I doubt there are many reliable sources that have discussed it in terms of New anti-Semitism. Certainly none of the many published books and papers that are currently referenced in the article. The Finkelstein book long predates it. The Foxman article doesn't discuss anti-Semitism (and he's <i>not</i> the author of <i>The New anti-Semitism</i>), etc. It's been a long, uphill struggle to get anything into the article at all; even now respected authors and professors who have been studying these issues for decades are being dismissed on the Talk: page as "conspiracy theorists" and "insignificant", with the notion of deleting the entire contents of the article. If you can find good stuff out there that discusses this issue in the context of this article, feel free to add it, but I'm baffled as to why you think this topic is being "ignored". <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 20:45, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
