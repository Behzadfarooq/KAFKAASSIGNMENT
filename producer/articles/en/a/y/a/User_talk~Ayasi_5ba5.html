<p>Can I delete my own comments on talk pages which are not directly related to the article, or my stupid comments? Or is it forbidden?<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAyasi_eb44.html" title="User:Ayasi">Ayasi</a> 19:27, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi, generally removing comments from talk pages is considered bad practice but there are some exceptions, can you give an example? --<a href="../../../k/f/p/User%7EKFP_849a.html" title="User:KFP">KFP</a> <small>(<a href="../../../k/f/p/User_talk%7EKFP_25da.html" title="User talk:KFP">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_KFP_62c1.html" title="Special:Contributions/KFP">contribs</a>)</small> 19:37, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>While there is no policy against it, it is often frowned upon. If the comments were clearly made in error then go ahead. If you change your mind, you can use &lt;s&gt; and &lt;/s&gt; to <s>strike</s> through your old comments. --<b><a href="../../../s/e/l/User%7ESelket_adc6.html" title="User:Selket">Selket</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../s/e/l/User_talk%7ESelket_51a5.html" title="User talk:Selket">Talk</a></sup> 19:38, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, those comments seemed quite harmless to me. If you change your mind about something, you can always strike out text or leave a new comment, or if the comment is clearly in the wrong place or inappropriate, you can delete it. Old comments can be <a href="../../../a/r/c/WP%7EARCHIVE_af20.html" title="WP:ARCHIVE">archived</a> "out of sight".

<p>Can a user make a personal attack against a vandal?

If someone is vandalising, you should place the appropriate <a href="../../../u/t/m/WP%7EUTM_f81f.html" title="WP:UTM">warning tag</a> on their user talk page. It is bad to issue personal attacks, regardless of the reason. If someone is issuing personal attacks, you could post the appropriate warning tag to their user talk page. If they keep issuing personal attacks, or if the insult reaches the level of a physical or legal threat, you might want to report that user to the <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">appropriate administrator notice board</a>.

<p>A vandal, probably from Turkey made a comment on an article. Another user changed the name of the comment as "Childish Turkish brain". Is it not a personal attack refering to Turkish nation?

<dd><i>Turks are Altai people. Hungarians are Urals with Altai mixture(Huns), they speak Ural language now, they do not use Altai, grammatically. Huns are also Altai people, so they use Attila name. Attila lived in 300-400's. In 1400's and 1500's, Turks and Hungarians made wars, some share of history started.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Hello. Well, certainly Hungarian and Turkish languages don't have many common older words because they weren't neighbors before the Ottoman empire. When Hungarians were subject to Ottomans, the situation was very different. I don't know how much there has been loaning of words between Turkish and Hungarian languages, but when Finland was under Swedish rule we got many loan words (and still afterwards). Linguistically, Finnish and Hungarian are related, but only very distantly. A bit like English and Hindi. Turkish and Uralic languages are not related, although they do resemble each other superficially (it would be great if the Ural-Altaic hypothesis was proved, but it doesn't seem likely).</p>
<p>It is also important to understand that linguistical relationship doesn't mean the peoples share common ancestors. Biologically Finnish people are much closely related to their neighbors than Hungarians, for example. This means also that "Uralic peoples" have no common ancestry, nor does the "Altaic peoples". Those terms mean ethnic relationship, which is a different thing. When Hungarians came to Hungary, they mixed with the local population, which in turn adopted the language from the original Hungarians. Similarly, the Huns were assimilated centuries earlier, so Hungarians have some "Hun blood" in their veins, if you like. The region which is today's Turkey has seen large number of different peoples coming and going, so current Turks are actually a mixture of several peoples. Same is true for Greeks and Middle-Eastern peoples and to lesser extent to all European peoples.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I think Finnish as a Ural language is somewhat similar to Turkish, because you write and read the same way, in both languages, for example.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>So is the case with Latin, which is an Indo-European language and therefore related to English. In fact, Finnish pronuncation resembles more that of Latin than that of Turkish. The way how the languages are written doesn't mean they're related in any way.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Why is not Finnish and Turkish related, whereas Indian, Persian, English are proven to be related?</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>By "Indian" you probably meant Hindi? There are literally hundreds of languages in India, many which are not related to each other. English, Persian, and Hindi are shown to be relatives, because they have several similarities like common "core words" (numbers, pronouns, words for relatives etc.). There are also other ways to measure a linguistic relationship, but I'm not a linguist so I don't know all the ways how it is done. In the case of those common words it is important to check that they are not loans. As an example, here's some common words between English and Persian: <i>brother/barādar</i>, <i>daughter/doxtar</i> and <i>father/pedar</i>.</p>
<p>I hope I understood what you meant correctly.--<a href="../../../j/y/r/User%7EJyril_fd2c.html" title="User:Jyril">JyriL</a> <sup style="font-size:x-small"><a href="../../../j/y/r/User_talk%7EJyril_4baa.html" title="User talk:Jyril">talk</a></sup> 01:46, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
