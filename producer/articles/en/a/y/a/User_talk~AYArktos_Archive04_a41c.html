<p>Yes, that's the site that I am following up; I have added the email to the Lilli Pilli talk page (should have done that before). It appears to be cut and paste from that site. Now, it may be that the person is the same one who took those photos and wrote that text, or they may really have got persmission (and therefore there is no problem), but (as yet) I have not received a reply from the site's webmaster, so the situation is still unclear. -- All the best, <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickj_5f86.html" title="User:Nickj">Nickj</a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickj_9875.html" title="User talk:Nickj">(t)</a> 01:27, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi AYArktos,<br />
Sorry for taking so long to get back, but a trip down to melbourne plus an electric storm cutting out our telephone for about a week has meant I haven't been on wiki for a while. Anyway, I don't know much about architecture so I don't really know what to be looking for, but I have some photos I took of sky scrapers in Melbourne which I'll get around to uploading fairly soon. I have started categorizing my photos, but mainly I've just been either adding to galleries or creating new ones and linking them off the article they illustrate. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFir0002_4967.html" title="User:Fir0002">Fir0002</a> 05:11, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think your nomination for deletion of these images is inappropriate. It is relatively clear from the context of the upload that these are the user's own images. They were uploaded before tagging became mandatory. You are not adding to the sum of knowledge but taking away; nor are you protecting the wikipedia from copyright issues. --<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a> 21:07, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>He appears to have licenced some images under creative commons though. My suggestion is perhaps instead of nominating them for deletion, you could offer to help tag these many good images appropriately, a constructive rather than destructive action to rectify the situation and probably taking no more time. Appropriate tagging to be discussed with Tannin. If he won't come to the party, I understand, but I can appreciate he uploaded many images before tagging was required and he has been a very long standing wikipedian.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a> 21:18, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi AYArktos, I just saw your comment on the AWNB when I felt like starting a new map project, and I have made <a href="../../../a/u/s/Image%7EAustralia_ive_been_everywhere.PNG_87d2.html" title="Image:Australia ive been everywhere.PNG">Image:Australia ive been everywhere.PNG</a>. There were <i>alot</i> of towns which I couldn't find after a quick look through my atlas, maybe you have a better idea of where the others are. I can easily edit the file to add more, and then reupload it, so I thought I'd upload what I'd done as a start -- <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrokey44_a15f.html" title="User:Astrokey44">Astrokey44</a><small>|<a href="../../../a/s/t/User_talk%7EAstrokey44_2cf4.html" title="User talk:Astrokey44">talk</a></small> 14:24, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yeah, I know it probably was a bit strong. Oh well, but it really did not show the mountain at all and insisted on describing the oval by some "local" name that I have never heard of.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>You recently removed a question I had posted on a "Help" page.</p>
<p>I can see that what I did is not how the help page is intended to be used. But can you suggest a different place I could ask that question?</p>
<p>Your comment said to use the "talk" page, but it doesn't appear that the "help" pages actually have talk pages.</p>
<p>Here is the page in question:</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for the welcome. I'm a little frightened about writing an article, but I imagine I will get around to it. I just want to get used to the site first. I don't think I will write an article on Marie Cowan, though, as just about all I know about her is that she adapted Waltzing Matilda to the version we know today. But I'm looking forward to getting to know the site.</p>
<p>By the way, I noticed you live in Canberra. I live near Canberra.</p>

<p>Docu's recreation of the article was out of process. If you don't like the result of a DRV (which is a discussion, not a vote) you do not summarily overturn it and recreate the article, and you certainly do not seek to fix the AFD to get the result you want. The second AFD was flawed from the beginning (not only from his attmept to fix the results), as he was voting on an already deleted article. So I moved the discussion to the article in question, which was in the Wikipedia namespace. Many votes were cast based on the article being there. There is no real way to get any sort of result from such a flawed process. The first AFD resulted in a consensus to delete, and there is no consensus to overturn the previous consensus; we do not overturn a consensus through the lack of another consensus. If you want to open an RFC, be my guest. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 22:53, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If I, for instance, go to the Yankees web site to get the 'official photograph' of Randy Johnson to put onto Wikipedia or Wikicommons, is that legal? How would I tag it? Would it be considered part of the 'press kit'?</p>
<p>Would a picture of a sports card be considered a sports poster?</p>
<p>Am I allowed to take the poster images from allposters.com?</p>
<pre>
Images are what confuse me the most about Wikipedia (I spend most of my time just fixing up articles), and it's hard to clarify all the legal nuances.
</pre>
<p>However, I think it's really important for Wikipedia's future for the website to have better graphics, images, etc. Over the long run, I think it will be difficult to attract a large amount of the public (many whom have never been to Wikipedia) without better graphics on this site.</p>

<p>Hi AYArktos, i noticed some of the place names you added you used a list of unusual place names as a reference. I dont think these should be used because there are hundreds of them on the internet and they have no content or explanation as to why the name is unusual.

<p>Good morning, I'm not sure I understand that I can draw a distinction between those two words that makes any sense to me. Although the word "pseudononymous" has an appeal that I will on occasion find hard to resist so I thank for you the suggestion. A pseudononymous person is by definition anonymous, until they are exposed, so I guess I'd say psuedononymous edits are a subset of anonymous ones, do you follow? That's certainly the way I see it. I understand your position which is that it is "fine" for anonymous users to edit, and who am I to say otherwise but I believe I am entitled to advocate a different position and that is that anonymous editors or pseudononymous ones if you prefer have a credibility issue to deal with. At least with me, and I note several non-anonymous editors take the same view. The response to all that is "judge me by my edits" but unless you know who is editing them I would find reaching that judgment difficult. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarrenRay_8cbe.html" title="User:DarrenRay">DarrenRay</a> 20:04, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You have discussed date links before. It seems that more and more people are becoming interested in the debate in many talk pages. I do not know if you have seen the discussion and votes at: <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EBots_fed8.html#Bobblebot" title="Wikipedia talk:Bots">new bot application</a>. Voting may have ended, so I am not soliciting your vote. But I thought that you might like to read what has been said by other editors.

<p>The article and edit war is certainly bogging me down. I mostly agree with your edits, however I think both sides are pushing limits at times. Arbitration may be called for, but I don't see a need for it whilst the contoversial editors are open to discussion, which they are at various talk pages. I'm not taking sides.

The Front of the Church has had an Office, Hall, and an enclosed entrance attached so could only get the door way as shown. Also the area is lined with trees fortunately the one on the rear has just recently been replaced, this enable me to get the overall picture below. I didnt know what you wanted view hope the selection is suitable. Also the Church is going to have an organ fitted in late march this year. and they have a web site www.stmarysouthperth.com</p>

<dd>If you don't have proof that it is copyvio, all the more you have no right to "prod" it. This tag is for doubtless cases. I wrote to several persons in wikipedia to verify this article. Also, I wrote to two Napoleonic societies. One of them ignored me, another answered they don't know. Among wikipedia's policies is <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>. While the text does look as copied from elsewhere, we do have several wikipedians who write in a pretty scholastic way. Aslo, after careful reading I noticed that the text has several stylistic defects hardly possible in a published book, thus speaking in favor of the originality of the text. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 19:18, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Greetings. I don't propose to untag, since I still suspect that there is a copyright violation in the article. I could be wrong - it's just a suspicion. But don't worry: the article won't be deleted or anything unless it can be determined for sure that it's a violation. This tag just tells people to be on the lookout. For instance, if someone is reading a book on the subject, they should look to see if our material is copied from that book.

<dd>P.S. I changed the version that I said is suspected of being a copyright infringement.

<p>Hi there</p>
<p>Re: Terra Nullius in the Australian architecture page... I didn't mean to imply that you were a supporter of the Terra Nullius argument, and didn't mean to cause offence - I was being a bit flippant whilst amending the text to sound less as though it *did* support the Terra Nullius argument, since I felt reasonably confident that no-one since about 1900 has serious supported it!

<p>You are doing a great job here. This is what I wanted to happen when I started all the State and Territory Scouting articles. I have never actually been involved in Scouting in Australia except for being Treasurer of a Group in the NT my kids belonged to. I was involved in Scouting many years ago in UK and I have tried to get some sense into their Scouting WP articles, particuarly their County articles. The problem is like here. Nobody takes a broad view. They want an article on their Group, so I help to delete those while saving a bit in the County article. Anyway, the ACT article is looking good.

<p>Again though, while I understand what you're saying, and do agree that the celebration is probably not wikipedia-worthy yet, at what point does it become so? International Talk Like a Pirate day was made up by two men in '93, and became well known after Dave Barry wrote an article. Does an article by Dave Barry count as a Primary Source, while a captioned image in a University Newspaper does not? If National Spooning Day is next year celebrated at 30 colleges but is not documented? What if my friends create 20 new web pages?</p>
<p>I just feel like if fake holidays are to be included at all, the documentation/celebration needs should be clarified.Cjhenck 03:03, 13 April 2006 (UTC)Cjhenck</p>

While one would have expected that after 3000 odd edits I would have learnt how to fix the large spaces in articles brought about by info boxes and the like, I'm afraid I haven't.

<dd>I don't appreciate your disparaging remarks about midget bands, lip-synching is a common practice amongst cover bands. For the record, I made no personal attacks, I merely pointed out what you had done, and how it appeared to me. Might I respectfully suggest that you spend less time trying to remove other peoples work? More time actually writing an encylopedia, and less time deleting one?

<dd>I was trying to undestand your motivation in removing material that was being actively worked on, and explaining what it looked like to me, so that you could, perhaps, temper the way you look to the outside world. We are not simply discussing content, but rather your behavior in deleting content.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I did mention that the "guards at the Buchenwald" were simply following procedures layed down by others without thinking them through for themselves. I was not disparaging the guards, or you, simply noting that otherwise moral and sensible people make surprising discisions when part of a policy process. I'm sorry you find that offensive, but again, I don't know how to discuss your behavior in a way that would not offend you.</dd>
<dd>You note that others "<i>have ... had difficulty with (my) <a href="../../../e/t/i/Wikipedia%7EEtiquette_76f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Etiquette">wikiquette</a></i>" - I presume that you are referring to the random accusations from a user, whose insistance that I should not edit a certain page was over turned the moment another editor got involved, and who was advised by another admin not to continue posting accusations on my talk page? Yes, that person did have "<i>difficulty with my wikiquette</i>". Sane people don't tend to though.</dd>
<dd>You accuse me of interpreting your actions as spiteful, on the contrary, as I have pointed out, I am sure you feel, like the guards we mentioned, that you are just doing your job. Might I humbly echo the suggestion of another editor to you, that you do a little more of your own research before deleting? Thanks, For great justice. 23:05, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Appologies - I was thinking of another deletionist - nobody that I am aware of told you to do more of your own research, and the person who did was talking to someone else who tried to delete the same article that you did.

This article, which you prodded last week, has been deprodded by <a href="../../../c/y/n/User%7ECynical_3d57.html" title="User:Cynical">User:Cynical</a> on the grounds of "churches are notable" - with which I disagree, so I have referred it to AfD.

<p>Please, if you want to become involved in disputes, make yourself aware of the issues. That user has been asked several times to stop beating a dead horse. The issue was resolved weeks ago, and it seems that they are interested in reviving a sterile debate that I have no interest in. Please do not encourage them to continue posting to my userpage. Thanks, For great justice. 23:46, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the nomination - I am loathe to nominate my own articles, but a lot of the articles I write I do because of some fact that I find pretty amazing - I was tempted to put an exclamation point after the 7 of top 10 place finishes in the 1920 Indy, but thought that wouldn't be very encyclopedic. Thanks again. <a href="../../../d/c/b/User%7EDcb1995_1d17.html" title="User:Dcb1995">David</a> 17:18, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
