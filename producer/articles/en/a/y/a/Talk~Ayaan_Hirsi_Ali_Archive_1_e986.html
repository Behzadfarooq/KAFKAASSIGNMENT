<p>I removed it. Lots of people say lots of things on this issue, and many say that young girls today mature much earlier than did young girls of premodern times. That debate can be characterized at <a href="../../../a/i/s/Aisha.html" title="Aisha">Aisha</a> perhaps, but not here. Here we are just discussing the statements that got Ali threatened with legal action, and perhaps the arguments of the players in that episode. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 18:26, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The argument of life-expectancy was exactly what players in that episode brought forwards. How about this compromise:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Critics of her statement pointed out that marriages occured much earlier at that time because the <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_expectancy.html" title="Life expectancy">life expectancy</a> almost 1500 years ago was less than half of that today <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dd>Babajobu, to be honest with you the whole passage is messy: "This referred to Muhammad's marriage to Aisha when she was nine years-old" is given as a fact without evidence or reference &amp; then we take back that statement in parenthesis: "(Other sources give her age as young as six or as old as fourteen)" And then we maximise confusion by a third sentence: "According to hadiths, she was six at the time of marriage and nine when the marriage was consummated." All this controversy should go into the <a href="../../../a/i/s/Aisha.html" title="Aisha">Aisha</a> article &amp; is quite irrelevant. Instead of all this confusion we should write "Muhammad's marriage to <a href="../../../a/i/s/Aisha.html" title="Aisha">Aisha</a> when she was alledgedly nine years-old" &amp; maybe reference to the age at marriage controversy section within the <a href="../../../a/i/s/Aisha.html" title="Aisha">Aisha</a> article. - I'll try to find that citation for you... <a href="../../../r/a/j/User%7ERajab_046f.html" title="User:Rajab">Rajab</a> 10:27, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hirsi Ali a muslim feminist?</span></h2>
<p>I' am missing a critical note on Hirsi Ali's claim that she is doing it all for the liberation of muslim women. Muslim women are rather offended by her actions than grateful, as she (1)declared herself a non-muslim; (2) is blaming islam as a whole for practises like female circumsision, suppression of women etc. and therefore rejects the way of emancipation within islam, whereas female circumcision is practiced only in some African countries by muslims, christians and animists alike, and a majority of muslim women argue that emancipation, liberation is possible based on koranic verses on women and sex-equality (for instance Amina Wadud, Riffat Hassan); and (3) she refuses to communicate with practicing muslims (whether male or female) about the issues she is raising. Therefore, her supporters are mainly right wing males and a couple of secular feminists.</p>
<p>She lately issued an article stating that even 'moderate' muslims are dangerous, because the simply didn't discover true islam, but will so soon. For Hirsi Ali there is only one islam, that of Osama Bin Laden.</p>
<p>Can anybody include this in the text in good English? Being Dutch, I consider my English not good enough. If necessary, I will look up references for the statements I made above. --<a href="../../../a/b/u/User%7EAbubakker_53c0.html" title="User:Abubakker">Abubakker</a> 16:08, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Speaking as a muslim woman, I can say that I know no woman who was ever brought up to believe she was "chattel" -- and I also know no woman who supports Ayaan Hirsi Ali. Trying to draw conclusions about the mindsets of women who oppose Ms. Ali based upon your own view of her as a reformer, rather than upon muslim women's stated points of contention with her, does nothing to further any discussion of the subject. --208.101.137.72 21:13, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Personally I believe that she is an arrogant fanatic she is not just a critic of Islam she hates Islam and muslims I really would like to see her helping a muslim woman even if she remains muslim.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Shortest ever</span></h2>
<p>This is the shortest intro of a person in Wikipedia I have ever seen. Nothing. Anybody who has not heard of Hirsi before, must go to the links to have any idea what she is famous for. Perhaps a quote from her blog would be enough, like this one:</p>
<p>'I do not seek to offend religious sentiment, but I will not submit to tyranny. Demanding that people who do not accept Muhammad’s teachings should refrain from drawing him is not a request for respect but a demand for submission.' <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielDemaret_b14d.html" title="User:DanielDemaret">DanielDemaret</a> 19:33, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>or perhaps</p>
<p>Ms Hirsi Ali wrote the script for Submission, a film criticising the treatment of women in Islam that prompted a radical Islamist to kill Van Gogh in an Amsterdam street in November 2004. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielDemaret_b14d.html" title="User:DanielDemaret">DanielDemaret</a> 19:35, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Radical Revision</span></h2>
<p>I'm going to revert the radical revision by C Mon, all the way back to the original version. It seems the page was cleared of all information before the C Mon revision. Although there is some new, good information, the organization of the page is such that it's a lot harder to find any given information in the article. Also, the category "incidents" just doesnt sit well with me. Its just so broad and imprecise. However, I hope C Mon or someone else (myself maybe) could incorporate the new information, such as her tribal heritage, into the older, clearer, format. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheKaplan_b62e.html" title="User:TheKaplan">TheKaplan</a> 03:46, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wow! It's strange that no-one has noticed before that the version was blanked. Thanks for noticing!</dd>
<dd>But I don't think it's cricket to revert a version to an earlier version, without discussion, because you think the new page is not set up well. Let's discuss the pro's and con's of the new organization, and try to merge the two versions in an organizational scheme that is based on some consensus.</dd>
<dd>Arguments why I organized the article like I did:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Biography: This is the basic set up I have been using expanding stubs of dutch politicians. I've never heard complaints about this scheme before. Unlike the current scheme it's structured.</li>
<li>Incidents: I'm willing to merge this with rest of the article. But in a discussion on the <a href="../../../r/i/t/Rita_Verdonk_268e.html" title="Rita Verdonk">Rita Verdonk</a> article I proposed making such a list to give a good overview of the political climate surrounding Verdonk. I though Hirsi Ali merited a similar scheme.</li>
<li>Prizes: I've merely integrated a paragraph into the articles structure.</li>
<li>Political View: I made my radical revision after I read Daniel Demaret's complaint that the article was very short. So I added a to be expanded "political views" segment. Maybe a bit broad now, but it was mend to be expanded to give an overview of Hirsi Ali's political views.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I hope we can come to some consensus about the organization of this article instead of reverting people's work, without discussion.</dd>

<dd>We should all be fans of Hirsi Ali. As a black woman who arrived in Europe under the conditions she did, to educate herself, then to rise to parliament, all before she was 35 years old, she certainly deserves praise. Then to have the courage to stand up against Islamic zealots who have threatened her life. Perhaps old Europe is not ready for someone as progressive as Ali. Now that she is leaving for the US, Europe can go back to being ruled by stodgy old white men who are afraid to take a stand against radical Islam. <a href="../../../d/t/a/User%7EDtaw2001_234d.html" title="User:Dtaw2001">Dtaw2001</a> 14:09, 17 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You relialise as a self-proclaimed atheist, and being claimed to be a progressive feminist by others, Hirsi Ali is going to work for a very conservative christian think tank? Apperently she isn't that progressive. And if you had followed the debate, and her points plus they way they were made, you would realise this. As for the usage of 'old europe'. That was used by Rumsfelt because the governments didn't ignore the opinion of its people in the Iraq war, as was done in his 'new Europe'. So the 'old Europe'-statement refers to that part of Europe that is too democratic for Rumsfelt. You want to use that statement?
<dl>
<dd>That VERY conservative Christian thinktank is VERY lucky to get her. But I agree with your statement of "old Europe." I think "Fortress Europe" is the correct term. Also, with regard to my use of the term progressive, I was using the dictionary definition. PROGRESSIVE: "Promoting or favoring progress toward better conditions or new policies, ideas, or methods." I think her critique of radical Islam and its treatment of women falls into this category. Progressive does not always equate with leftist or liberal.<a href="../../../d/t/a/User%7EDtaw2001_234d.html" title="User:Dtaw2001">Dtaw2001</a> 14:36, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe not in the US. But it is compared to Europe. Here in the Netherlands no one understands why AHA is going to this think tank. Also, a lot of her statements are too extreme for 'religion friendly' United States. AHA is anti-religion. She thinks Islam is a retarded religion. She believes there can not be a moderate Islam. She is against veils of any kind. She believes any sign of religion should be illegal for people with a public function. She is against religious education. Muhammed is a perverse man, Muhammed is a pedophile, Muhammed is a despicable person. Atheists have the right to offend religious persons, etc. The list goes on. America correspondents claim that if she makes these statements in the US she will no longer be taken seriously. I wonder if the AEI have actually read her books.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">dutch documentary (zembla)</span></h2>
<p>Tonight a documentary will be shown on dutch television which will give some more background of AHA before she came to the Netherlands. I'll try to put some of its points down here later, before they can be entered into the article. Intangible 16:47, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well the documentary showed some interesting facts. That Ali was a UNCHR sponsored asylum seeker in Kenia, and was thus ineligible for political asylum in the Netherlands at that time (Ali lied about coming from Kenia directly to the Dutch IND). Furthermore 3 people (brother, aunt, ex-husband) claim that Ali was actually present at her wedding. Her ex-husband even visited her in a asylum-seeker center in the Netherlands. Ali herself has responded that indeed her story to the IND was made up, that she deliberately used another name and different age when being interviewed, and that if she would tell the truth, she would have been sent back to Germany instead. In the media aftermatch, current minister of integration and immigration <a href="../../../r/i/t/Rita_Verdonk_268e.html" title="Rita Verdonk">Rita Verdonk</a> stated that she would have deported Ali, if she were to be minister at that time.

Intangible 15:14, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Also in Zembla: Ayaan was granted asylum in less than 5 weeks, a procedure which normally take months if not years. In her Zomergasten interview in 2005 she was insistently probed about the activities of her father in terms of income and profession by the interviewer Joost Zwagerman. <a href="../../../v/8/r/User%7EV8rik_a2ae.html" title="User:V8rik">V8rik</a> 23:33, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Contrary to what Zembla stated, it's not uncommon at all to be granted a status within a few weeks, especially if your position is 'politically opportune' regarding Dutch international policy. E.g. in later years Kurdish Iraqi's were given a status quite easily; often within a few weeks. It was part of Dutch international policy.</dd>
<dd>Let's not consider 'Zembla' to be authoritive on this issue. Although I believe they tried to offer an honest picture of Ayaan's history, they tended to make things appear slightly more spectacular then they actually are. Ayaan owned up to her lies years ago. The documentary offered no new facts at all. Let's wait untill this media hype has blown over and then decide if new facts should be added to the article. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBart_van_der_Pligt_fc60.html" title="User:Bart van der Pligt">Bart van der Pligt</a> 03:23, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That Irshad Manji co-signed the MANIFESTO is a good argument, eventhough I believe that a lot of Muslims wouldn't consider her a Muslim at all. The fact that she call herself a Muslim is what matters in this case. Still, though, if we can't find a anyone that oppose her, that call him/herself "Islamist", I find it strange that we identify the Muslims that has made threats against her as such. -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Meier_d697.html" title="User:Karl Meier">Karl Meier</a> 11:57, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I believe that the problem is not just original research, but also that it is not neutral to throw the label "Islamist" at Muslims that has never called themself "Islamists", or even accepted to be called that. Another thing is that I don't get your point about the general term 'Muslim'. Just because some other Muslims like Irshad Manji disagree with their postition towards Ayaan Hirsi Ali, doesn't make them "not Muslim" and I don't see that it in any way should be wrong to call them that. -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Meier_d697.html" title="User:Karl Meier">Karl Meier</a> 13:57, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Karl, it is very <b>wrong</b> to blanket refer to <i>Muslim</i> threats. Muslims the world over are as varied as ethnicities. Your initial logic in this regard is a bit like saying that <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> has to maintain a high level of security due to <a href="../../../c/a/u/Caucasian_race.html" title="Caucasian race">caucasian</a> threats. Rather ridiculous no? (A better line would be: <i>George W. Bush has to maintain a high level of security due to <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_supremacist.html" title="White supremacist">White supremacist</a> threats.</i>) Also your logic about what people refer to themselves relative to what <i>others</i> refer to them does not appear to demonstrate a reasonable grasp about how names and associations work. Do you think <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler.html" title="Hitler">Hitler</a> ever referred to himself as a genocidal killer? In terms of this discussion all that matters when writing Wikipedia articles is that verifiable and notable souces are cited using given terminology. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a> 14:21, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This makes it even more important to clarify the nature of the site.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Parlamentarial Debate</span></h2>
<p>The night of May 16 some of the most interesting pieces of political debate were displayed Dutch Parliament. The players were minister Rita Verdonk versus the rest.</p>
<p>Rita Verdonk, Dutch minister of Integration (and 'vreemdelingenzaken'=foreigners ...) and VVD party colleague of Hirsi Ali did not stay as consequent in a parlamentarial debate - which took 8-9 hours in three rounds today - as her nickname <b>Iron Rita</b> might suggest. Rita Verdonk turned around 180 degrees and is now willing to investigate which exceptional arguments might exists in order not to simply 'have to state' - without taking an appealable decision of her own - that Ayaan Hirsi Ali 'would have never actually rightfully received Dutch citizenship' as she wasn't fully correct about her name (please notice that her identity was <i>not</i> questioned) and date of birth. This sounded as lipservice to many of the parlamentarians who lined up to ask questions and question her credibility and the meticulousness of the investigation which was finalized within 48 hours. Some hours after the start of the debate, Verdonk astonished many by stating that Hirsi Ali <b>still had Dutch citizenship</b> until the end of 6 weeks. It was pointed out that this opposed diametrically earlier impressions given by Verdonk. If true, than there was no need for Hirsi Ali to resign from her position in Dutch Parliament. The main objection and criticism of Verdonk's way of dealing with the procedure was carelessnes and negligence.</p>
<p>The motion - supported by a very broad majority of the parliament - presented to minister Verdonk gave her explicitely the 'legal space' to investigate, which she denied to have for many hours of the debate.</p>
<p>The second round of the debate showed an incredible stamina of minister Verdonk to stay rigid and having no other choice than than that what the law imposed to her. Her answers to the many questions appeared evading and repetituous to political leeks, but didn't convice the faction leaders of (all) other party leaders either, including her own VVD. A third round of parlamentarial debate was required by coalition CDA faction leader Verhagen which started 2 o'clock midnight.</p>
<p>Verdonk's agreement to look into the matters again with the given 'legal space' of the parliament appeared to be driven by the wish to survive politically as she is a candidate for leadership in the next elections. She declared to reporters that she does not feel politically dammaged. While she might be elected by her own party as leader for the coming election as half of the votes are already given (the contender is M. Rutte) and cannot be changed, it is likely that the image of her party VVD is indeed dammaged. Verdonk's attempt to profile herself as strong 'macha' (female macho) who puts the rules over all other considerations might be counterproductive. Voters might not like persons who let prevail personal ambitions over the back and political lives of others (Hirsi Ali). A returning question was therefore whether Verdonk took the <i>very fast</i> steps to present the over-the-weekend investigation in public to the parliament for her own political ambitions. It was also pointed out (Femke Halsema) that the Parliament didn't want and needed to be informed that early or at all at this time (if it was only a constatation and not a decision) as Hirsi Ali lost her MP in consequence.</p>
<p>The issue started last week when Rita Verdonk issued an investigation about Hirsi Ali using an incorrect name and birth date during the immigration procedure a decade before. Minister Verdonk claimed only to have acquired knowledge about that fact after TV emission 'Zembla'. A large part of Dutch population was aware of that fact by Ayaan Hirsi Ali's own statements in her book and another TV discussion round several years before. Femke Halsema pointed out that Hirsi Ali's parlamentarial e-mail address is ...magan@..., whereupon party colleague Verdonk claimed (functionally?) angry and emotional never to have had e-mail contact with her. A minister does not only comprise the person fulfilling the ministership but also her staff and civil servants at the ministry. The ignorance appeared very incredible. (addition: Was there an investigation (by Halsema or other parties?) What was the outcome of this investigation? Was it limited to minister Verdonk's own e-mail account? Did it include other e-mail accounts of her ministry? <a href="../../../t/d/e/User%7ETDerz_e437.html" title="User:TDerz">Tommie</a> 12:33, 27 June 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p>This was an overwhelming display of support for Ayaan Hirsi Ali in Dutch parlament across all factions. The discussion culmulated about the correctness of minister Verdonk's constatation, which she didn't want to call an (appealable) decision. It disclosed the incoherence of her story. Within some hours the 'facts' changed from 'there was never an effectuation of Dutch citicenship' to 'Hirsi Ali still has the Dutch citicenship until the end of 6 weeks for the time limit of the appeal'.</p>
<p>For political leeks it is astonishing that minister Verdonk didn't (have to) resign, despite her constant display of stubbornness to understand the scope of the motion. During the 2nd round she still interpreted it as a mandate to <i>investigate</i> the availability of options and awaiting input of Hirsi Ali. She was repeatedly pointed to the fact (Verhagen a.o.) that Parliament explicitely <i>gives</i> her the options for doing a careful investigation on her own, independent of Hirsi Ali's input. During a break, Wouter Bos, PvdA leader pointed out that therefore not the full 6 weeks had to be used, it could also be earlier.</p>
<p>Ayaan Hirsi Ali returned her membership of parliament and will work several months earlier in a <i>think tank</i> in Washington. <a href="../../../t/d/e/User%7ETDerz_e437.html" title="User:TDerz">Tommie</a> 02:20, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>After the second debate: at the latest six weeks later, many followers of both debates have now been introduced to the legal concept of "<i>fiction</i>", which is expressed in normal language by phrases as "<i>deemed</i> never to have (had)" (received her Dutch citizenship). <a href="../../../t/d/e/User%7ETDerz_e437.html" title="User:TDerz">Tommie</a> 22:00, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>'The truth' doesn't exist. Everyone knows who Ayaan Hirsi Ali is. This could mean that it does not matter that the law does not know who Ayaan Hirsi Ali is. So what do you want? That what 'the truth' says, or that what the law, according to Verdonk's statement, a statement she has withdrawn to survive the debate, says?</dd>
<dd>It is actually very simple. Verdonk claims to have observed that Hirsi Ali, who is Dutch, and Hirsi Magan, do not match. And that therefore the real Ayaan Hirsi doesn't have the dutch nationality. The problem with this is that it is not clear if Ayaan can't use the name of her grand-grandfather, Ali, instead of the name Magan. It is her name, not the one of someone else. So if you interpret it this way there is no problem.</dd>
<dd>If there is a problem then, according to the Hoge Raad, Hirsi Magan never received the dutch nationality. But this is only true when special circumstances do not exist. Verdonk claims she had to ignore this statement of the Hoge Raad. No reason was given. The dutch parliament forced her to consider these special circumstances and she has accepted this. This means that the observation no longer stands.</dd>
<dd>As for special circumstances. There can be many. But which one count? The Hoge Raad did not say anything about this. This means Verdonk herself, or a judge has to consider this. Special circumstances can be the fact that when her dutch nationality is withdrawn she has no nationality left. This is in violation with international treaties. So this is not possible. Clearly a special circumstances. Another is that she has been threatened with deadly violence. Another is that she is was a parliament member. If it is decided that she never had the dutch nationality the parliament had only 149 members for three years. This is not allowed by the Dutch constitution. What this means exactly is unclear to me. It may mean that all actions of the parliament are also terminated. I guess this is kind of special also. The fact that she lived in the Netherlands for 12 years is also a special circumstance. The list goes on.</dd>
<dd>In the end it will be clear that Verdonk was wrong and that her nationality remains untouched. The reason for this will be political rather than legal. Just as the decision from Verdonk to 'observe' the lack of a Dutch nationality was also motivated by politics instead of by legal issues.</dd>
<dd>So what is the truth? There is no truth.</dd>

<dd>Heh i put 'the truth' between <i>for a reason, and I said it was relative, as to not fall in a philosophical discussion about there not being any truth etc. So I'm gonna avoid that. We shoud be talking about the nationality as it is legally defined. This is also what you use in your arguments. It's a political discussion yes and political arguments will count but the purpose of this discussion is to define the legal status of AHA, not any other status.</i></dd>
<dd>First of all you argue that Verdonk withdrawn her statement to survive the debate. As you can read earlier in this discussion and on the linked official Tweede Kamer report she did not do this.</dd>
<dd>Your statement about the special circumstances is true until a certain point. Yes there are possibilities for AHA to retain or regain Dutch nationality if there are special circumstances. However these special circumstances do not work like magic. This special clause will only come into effect if the minister decides so or the judges rule it. This has not happened yet and thus the observation of Verdonk still stands.</dd>
<dd>Please provide any sources if you still think the BBC news item and official tweede kamer report is wrong.--84.30.97.206 18:52, 17 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The motion adopted, both of them, tell Verdonk to reconsider. She said she will accept the motions. If she is actually reconsidering is unknown to us. We can only assume she is. This means she will inform us about the status of AHA in the near future. She has to do this within 6 weeks. If you read what Verdonk said in the first term of the debate and if you read the two motions adopted, both of which she claims she will accept, then these two contradict each other. This is a fact. And you know this. I don't have to supply sources. The question is if she will put deed by her word and execute these motions. So if you claim that AHA isn't dutch at this moment you need to give me a souce telling where Verdonk said that she will not execute the motion. If you can't there is no reason to assume Verdonk is lying.</dd>
<dd>This debate is pointless because we will know if AHA is dutch or not in a few weeks. Wheneter she is dutch at this moment in time is irrelevant. Wikipedia can report and decribe the conflict between the parliament and Verdonk.
<dl>
<dd>It's true that there were two motions adopted both of them urging rita to reconsider but hanging that reconsideration AHA is not Dutch. Neither of these motions claim AHA is Dutch at this moment. And there are sources, check out the earlier link to bbc &amp; the official tweede kamer debate record in this article. --84.30.97.206 23:01, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, but the important point is that Verdonk claimed she never considered something, that she never made a decision. She only made an obervation and informed the parliament. She defended this in the first term of the debate. Then two motions were adopted. She has claimed she will execute them. This means the observation she has made has become meaningless because she now will make a decision, a consideration. Verdonk won't admit that she has withdrawn her points in public because of her election as a party leader. But of course this is what has happened.</dd>

If you're dying to have it in, my suggestions, which you can take for what they're worth, would be (1) do a major, sourced rewrite for the english <a href="../../../g/e/e/Geenstijl.html" title="Geenstijl">Geenstijl</a> entry, so that we can see the extent to which it's an actual journalistic enterprise and not a blog; and (2) identify the specific author of the entry, so that we can see whether he or she fits <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Balance in this article</span></h2>
<p>I have had this page on my watchlist for a long time, but haven't been really involved in editing it. However, I would like to make one general point. At the moment, three quarters of the introduction to the article is about the recent controversy regarding Ali's citizenship, and consequent events. I think this is somewhat unbalanced. Wikipedia is not a news site; it's not so much the place where people should come to hear the latest news about Ali as where they should come, having read something in the news, to find out about her in full. As such, it's important that the introduction to the article cover all her important achievements and important events relating to her without being particularly taken up with what has happened most recently or what is in the news at the moment. I would suggest that if anything, 3/4 of the intro should be about Ali's background, work and achievements before this controversy, and 1/4 about this affair. Of course, the body of the article should cover the affair in full. <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 12:52, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with Palmiro. These details make the intro too news-dependent and therefore hard to maintain.

<dd>Ayaan will probaby continue to call herself Hirsi Ali. Her lawyer wants to fight against the fact that Magan can be her only correct name. Her lawyer claims that 'Hirsi Ali' is not a false name. Just as Magan, Ali is the name of one of her male ancestors. It is just one that isn't commonly taken according to Somalian tradition.</dd>
<dd>So Ayaan will continue to be called Hirsi Ali. Maybe her new passport, which she will get indefinitely, will bear 'Hirsi Ali' after all.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Support Moving</b> We should move the article. It is clear now that the real name is Magan not Ali. She lied about her name as quite a few other things. We cannot name an article using imaginary names. If an article should be named by considering what the person is well-known for (or s/he would like to be named as), Magan should be named as 'Liar' and this should be the name of the article (or 'Angel' respectively). As far as I know the naming convention in Wikipedia requires naming the articles by the real names of the people. If this is not a written rule, it definitely is logical and most resonable. We are technically able to redirect all the other names to this article. Noone will have trouble in finding her article. So there is no reason to debate about if it should be named by real name or an imaginary name. Changing her name most likely is a tactic. She tends to present herself with an Islamic name to sound more from an Islamic tradition than she really is. That definitely 'wow's people listening to her. But this is nothing to do with the ensyclopedic way of naming an article about a person. <a href="../../../m/o/k/User%7EMokotok_73fb.html" title="User:Mokotok">Mokotok</a> 05:36, 20 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"As far as I know the naming convention in Wikipedia requires naming the articles by the real names of the people." The opposite is true. The naming conventions require naming the article by the most common name. This doesn't have to be a real name. This can be a pseudonym (e.g. Bob Dylan) or the short version of the name. Or the name under which someone is best known. Whether that name is technically true is irrelevant. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis"><sup>Apple</sup></a><a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis"><sup>knocker</sup></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_Userboxes_0d05.html" title="User:Aecis/Userboxes"><sup>Flophouse</sup></a> 20:45, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I see that the category "Refugees" that I added was removed, and I care to question why.<br />
The way I see it, Hirsi Ali's fammily fleed Somalia and sought political assylum in Kenya, which makes them all refugees, and than she fled Kenya and sought assylum in Holland, which makes her a refugee twice over. Even if we accept that becuase she lied in her assylum rewuect her refugee status from Kenya should be regarded as invalid since (which I hardly see why), she is none-the-less still a refugee from Somalia.

<dl>
<dd>First, she did indeed lose her Dutch citizenship. Second, I don't see what that has got anything to do with it- once she fled her homeland of Somalia, she's a refugee from there, no matter what other new citizenships she might acquire in her lifetime. And last but not least, as article itself affirmes that fact, as seen in this quote: "Apart from a Dutch passport, Hirsi Ali does still have a Dutch residency permit (similar to a Permanent Resident Card) on the grounds that she is a political refugee."</dd>
<dd>Based on these grounds, I think I it's perfectly okay for me to re-insert the refugee category. Harvest day fool 21:51, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>She hasn't lost her Dutch citizenship yet. The Dutch government has announced that they <i>intend</i> to strip her of her Dutch passport. Hirsi Ali has six weeks to appeal, and she will probably do so. It will then be brought to the courts, who will decide on her citizenship. That will be a matter of years.

<dd>Ok, so you're saying that she admitted to <i>lying</i> on her asylum request in the interview she have to HP | DE TIJD? If that's the case then that'll need to be edited into the article because as the lead part of the May 2006 events section stands it has her admitting only that she used another name and birth date...

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hirsi Ali lied about her name, her status as a refugee and her birthdate, maybe NOT about her forced marriage</span></h2>
<p>Ayaan Hirsi Ali lied concerning her birth date and her status, it is true, since she didn't tell the Dutch authorities she did not come directly from Somalia but had found a safe sanctuary in Kenya already. However, it was not safe <i>for her</i> And claiming her name was "Ayaan Hirsi Ali" instead of "Ayaan Hirsi Magan" ist not really that much of a lie, since Somalis form their name through their father's names (...daughter of...son of...son of...son of...) and she picked the name of her grandfather, Ali, instead of that of her father, Magan. She was forced to do so because she did not want to enter that forced marriage with her cousin. Why did Ayaan Hirsi Ali prefer to go to the Netherlands instead of going to Canada? She know English already but Dutch she had to learn. So why did she not go to Canada but to Holland? Because she did not want to accept that forced marriage.</p>

<p><i>In recent days, bloggers and commentators have challenged Ms. Hirsi Ali's motives for fleeing to the Netherlands. She maintained that she wanted to escape a forced marriage with a Somali cousin, and while waiting to meet him in Germany, she secretly left for the Netherlands.</i></p>
<p><i>Defending her account, she offered a letter she received from Kenya, from her sister Haweya, in August 1992, after her arrival in a Dutch refugee camp. "Your husband in Germany is looking for you," the letter reads, "and the whole search is being coordinated by father here."</i></p>
<p><i>Referring to members of their clan, Haweya wrote: "Practically all the Osman Mahamud in that area are looking for you everywhere. Be warned."</i></p>
<p><i>Her detractors have also said she lied about her relationship with her father, Hirsi Magan Isse, a former politician who had to flee Somalia. They say she had nothing to fear and had a good relationship with him.</i></p>
<p><i>Ms. Hirsi Ali, underlining the duress facing her, agreed to release the last letter she said she received from her father — his curse.</i></p>
<p><i>In January 1993, after writing to beg forgiveness for her disobedience in refusing the husband chosen, she said she needed his blessing.</i></p>
<p><i>"Dear Deceitful Fox," her father replied. "You do not need me and I do not need you. I just invoked Allah to disgrace you, as you have disgraced me. Amen!</i></p>
<p><i>"This is the last message you will receive from me, as your letter was the last message I will accept from you. Go to hell! And the devil be with you.</i></p>
<p><i>"May Allah punish you for your deception," his letter ended.</i></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Pathological Lier</span></h2>
<p>Shes a great deciever. I don't care whether anyone will belive me, but Ayaan has never in her life stepped foot in Somalia. The places she has resided are Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia, Kenya and Europe. She comes from a well-to-do family that are untraditional and never forced her to marry, as she claims they did.</p>
<p>I'm pretty close to her family.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Article not up to Wikipedia standards: much too much Point of View</span></h2>
<p>There is much too much 'point of view' in this article on Hirsi Ali. The selection of information is absolutely partisan. One remark about "category: people using their mother's surname". That does not apply in this case. Her mother's surname is not Hirsi Ali. How about introducing a new category "women using a different year of birth". There are quite a few.</p>

<p>This whole citizenship business seems completely bizarre to me. Ayaan Hirsi doesn't come out of it very well. As I understand the entire affair:</p>
<ul>
<li>) Ayaan Hirsi appears on a TV program and says that she lied when applying for Dutch citizenship. She says she gave a false name and age and didn't reveal that she had been living in Kenya and Germany.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>) Rita Verdonk says very well then, then your citizenship should be revoked.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>) Ayaan Hirsi resigns from parliament and says she wants to move to the USA in any case. Among other things her neighbours haven't been very friendly (they wanted her kicked out of their apartment building because of the numerous death threats she has received).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>) International media jumps up and down, says the Netherlands is intolerant and is kicking out Ayaan Hirsi for being a troublemaker.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>) Dutch parliament says this is no good, Verdonk should reconsider.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>) Negotiation between Verdonk and Ayaan Hirsi's lawyer. Lawyer says she didn't really use a false name, because it was the name of her grandfather, and here are some statements from her relatives to prove it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>) Verdonk says, well that's OK then. We'll just get Ayaan Hirsi to sign this letter confirming this new fact and to make an apology for misleading me.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>) Ayaan signs the letter. Later she appears on TV saying she didn't really agree with it, she only signed it to get her passport back.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>) Dutch parliamnt says it isn't impressed with the actions of Verdonk. Opposition in parliament try to pass a vote of no-confidence against her, which is supported by D'66, but still fails.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>) Parliamentary faction of D'66 says it wants Verdonk to go. Cabinet doesn't agree.</li>

<p>As far as I know, Wiki being an encyclopedia requires neutrality and objectivity, and the fact that I can tell that this article was written by a Muslim (with disdain for Hirsi Ali) is a clear indication of its bias. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../2/0/2/User%7E202.156.6.54.html" title="User:202.156.6.54">202.156.6.54</a> (<a href="../../../2/0/2/User_talk%7E202.156.6.54.html" title="User talk:202.156.6.54">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_202.156.6.54_e48c.html" title="Special:Contributions/202.156.6.54">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>Okay. Thank You.</p>
<p>&amp;, I really do mean that; if my recollection is correct, then that would be the kindest message that you've ever sent to me. Although, I have seen you write kindly to others. &amp;, you've written many messages to me, &amp;, yet more, far more, about me. And I doubt ever calculating how many times that you've deleted me. I do perceive this as a real start. Have I ever complimented one of your messages previously??</p>
<p>Now, as to my original question: Is there a way to access the original photograph page? I do know that frequently those pages would include source-data for the other webpages, from whence the images had been derived.</p>
<p>Thank You.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Criticism section of Ayaan still missing</span></h2>
<p>Although Ayaan as a person is very controversial, her article doesnt have a general criticism section like most biographies of controversial figures in wikipedia. I propose to add a new section to her Wikipedia entry titled:</p>
<ul>
<li>Criticism of Hirsi Magan
<ul>
<li>Her history</li>
<li>Her Books</li>
<li>Opinion on Islam</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I would like to make a beginning with using the following <a href="http://www.salafimanhaj.com/pdf/SalafiManhaj_AyaanHirsiAli.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.salafimanhaj.com/pdf/SalafiManhaj_AyaanHirsiAli.pdf" rel="nofollow">article</a>.</p>

<dd>I disagree with the way the criticism section is going. I have two problems:
<ul>
<li>the inclusion of UNICEF is non-sensical. UNICEF did not critize Ayaan Hirsi Ali directly. Questions surrounding the practice of Female Genital Mutilation should be answered on the Female Genital Mutilation page. This is like including <a href="../../../b/j/%C3%B8/Bj%C3%B8rn_Lomborg_bb99.html" title="Bjørn Lomborg">Bjørn Lomborg</a>, a prominent environmental skeptic, on every green politicians article. Critics of Ayaan Hirsi Ali should be limited to those who critize her directly.</li>
<li>the critique of her personal history can best be included in her biography, because it is relevant information to the reader of her biography, that some of her statements are in dubio.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Furthermore I will include some criticism she has gotten in the Netherlands from several prominent proponents of multiculturalism.</dd>
<dd>I will implement these changes immediately.</dd>

<p>This article falsly claim that she was ex-muslim. There are lot of evidence out there that she wasn't a Muslim at the first place. Her father left Islam when he was living in the West. She was given a choice to pick any religion. Her brother picked Christianity, but she didn't any religion herself. She pretended to be a Muslim to get visa to Western countries since she is claiming that she is fleeing from a force marriage, and the West think Muslim treat women badly and she knew that and it would easy for to convince the Embassy if she was Muslim rather Christian or something. That's why she changed last name from Morgan to Ali and claimed that she is from Somalia but didn't mention Kenya in which she lived her most of her life for the embassy.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarikur_2e60.html" title="User:Tarikur">Tarikur</a> (<a href="../../../t/a/r/User_talk%7ETarikur_2a8c.html" title="User talk:Tarikur">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tarikur_7b65.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tarikur">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>I am reinserting the reference to the hadith. There is no interpretation required for these verses. If you had looked at some of the wikipedia articles on this you would already know what I am talking about, but because you haven't I will link them. <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/062.sbt.html#007.062.064" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/062.sbt.html#007.062.064" rel="nofollow">Here</a> (one of the many references in Bukhari's hadith) and <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/008.smt.html#008.3311" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/008.smt.html#008.3311" rel="nofollow">here</a> (a reference in the Sahih Muslim).</p>

<dd>First, please <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>! Do not call each action of an editor vandalism. I structured and wrote most of this article, I am not a vandal!</dd>
<dd>Second I will accept your edit for now, (although I've rearranged it to prevent linking away from wikipedia in the text according to AWB), but expect that some one will find your interpretation offensive to islam. Independent of whether it's spelt out in English translation of the Hadith, you can still interpret the passage differently. I would advise you to read <a href="../../../a/i/s/Aisha%27s_age_at_marriage.html" title="Aisha's age at marriage">Aisha's age at marriage</a> at wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>On a final note that the Aisha's age at marriage should be discussed there and not on the Hirsi Ali article. Happy editing! <a href="../../../c/_/m/User%7EC_mon_41ad.html" title="User:C mon">C mon</a> 09:59, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So if someone could possibly find something offensive to Islam, EVEN QUOTES FROM THEIR OWN HOLY BOOKS, WITH NO HINT OF PERSONAL INTERPRETATION, it must be removed. I see. It all makes sense now. You removed the piece of information that you apparently didn't know, which is that the Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim are the most highly esteemed hadith collections in Sunni Islam. I can live with that as most wikipedia articles not directly related to Islam suppress the names of the hadith, but I think your political correctness has run amok. And if someone removes something for no good reason, I consider that vandalism. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrow740_2a2c.html" title="User:Arrow740">Arrow740</a> 10:41, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>The introduction is not neutral. In the discussion about her citizenship only her letter to the New york Times is mentioned, not the objections of others to its contents. Her mea - culpa declaration is called a "dictate", not the arguments of minister Verdonk. The introduction is concluded by the sentence "Her prospective arrival in September 2006 was welcomed by U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick." Reads like an advertisement and is clearly intended to draw attention from something the speaker doesn't want emphasized, namely that she left parliament prematurely.<a href="../../../s/7/1/User%7ES710_4398.html" title="User:S710">S710</a> 13:32, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
