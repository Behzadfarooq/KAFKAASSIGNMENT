<p><i><b>Hello!</b></i></p>
<p>Thanks for uploading some pictures to Wikipedia. I wanted to make sure you were aware of some of the requirements and good practices for uploaded images.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Pick an image name.</b></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>When <a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" title="Special:Upload">uploading</a> an image, pick a file name that is descriptive, and unique. Remember that many images may be uploaded about the same topic, and remember that names are case sensitive.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Source the image.</b></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>On the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Help%7EImage_page_09d1.html" title="Help:Image page">image description page</a>, explain where the image came from. If you created the image yourself, then say so. If it's from the web, give a URL. If it's a screenshot of a movie or game, or a scan from a book, give the title.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Provide copyright and license information.</b></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>This part is a little bit trickier, but it's very important. The copyright of the image generally belongs to whomever created it.
<dl>
<dd><i>If it's a photograph you took, or an image you created</i> (modifying an image that already exists doesn't count) in software like <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photoshop.html" title="Photoshop">Photoshop</a> or <a href="../../../g/i/m/GIMP_b6ef.html" title="GIMP">GIMP</a>, then you own the copyright. To upload it to Wikipedia, you must agree to license it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a> (which allows anyone to use it, but requires that they give credit to the original author and requires that any further edit to the image be licensed under the GFDL as well) or release it into the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain.html" title="Public domain">public domain</a> (which allows anyone to use it for any purpose without restriction.) Do this by placing an appropriate <a href="../../../i/c/t/WP%7EICT_6197.html" title="WP:ICT">tag</a> on the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_description_page_4215.html" title="Wikipedia:Image description page">image description page</a>, like {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL_bb04.html" title="Template:GFDL">GFDL</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-self_86e2.html" title="Template:PD-self">PD-self</a>}}. Be sure to mention that you created the image. If you're using {{<a href="../../../p/d/-/Template%7EPD-self_86e2.html" title="Template:PD-self">PD-self</a>}}, you may also want to use {{<a href="../../../n/o/r/Template%7ENoRightsReserved_3537.html" title="Template:NoRightsReserved">NoRightsReserved</a>}}, since there is some dispute as to whether one may grant items into the public domain.</dd>
<dd><i>If you didn't create the image,</i> or the copyright somehow belongs to another party (like a screenshot, which you might "create", but the copyright belongs to the author of the movie or video game), then you need to find another <a href="../../../i/c/t/WP%7EICT_6197.html" title="WP:ICT">tag</a> that describes the copyright status of the image. Images used on Wikipedia need to be free for our use and the use of <a href="../../../f/o/r/WP%7EFORKS_ea13.html" title="WP:FORKS">sites</a> which reproduce our content. This means that images cannot have a restriction such as "only for use by Wikipedia", or "for non-commercial use only", or "for educational use". Images without a free license may be usable in certain articles under <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">fair use</a>, but such a use should be justified on the image description page.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Describe the image.</b></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>To another reader, the image may not be immediately understood. A caption in an article doesn't explain the image to a visitor who sees it on its image page. Put a brief explanation of what is in the image on the image description page, similar to what you might include in a caption on an article.</dd>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Damakjayadc0.jpg</b>.

<p>To RHaworth and mangojuice, thanks for watching my page. You both don't need to argue each other about this article to be published or not. If you think this page is spam or whatever, I will leave this wikipedia page and keep the article with me, because you both have more right in controlling wikipedia. Before that I would like to tell you something why do I want to keep this article which had been written by me and my mother (Asiarose) in wikipedia. English is not our mother tongue language, we are from Malaysia, and my mother is in Malaysia, while I'm living in USA with my own family. In 2003, in my website, I had tried to write article about this type of cake in English languague to introduce it to people, especially in Malaysia, and I notice the interest about this type of cake spreaded internationally. I did this because I want to appreciate my mother(Asiarose) who raise me and my siblings by making and selling this cakes, and also her teacher (Rabiah Amit) who taught her to make this cake. When I wrote this article, it was not a business matter because in our place, mostly people who booking cakes from my mother was not 'internet or computer person', they are not depend on internet, they just looking at my mama's business catalog. I did search at that time, and nobody wrote about Sarawakian Layered cakes online especially in English. So the article that me and my mother wrote was the first article onine that introduce and telling people the history of this cake. After I put the article online in 2003, I didn't check that website and I just left it without any updating. Recently I check the website and I found out in my website statistic that so many people looking information about Sarawakian Layered cakes in Malay language and in English language. Then, what upsetting me and my mother is, we found some cakes business websites, copying and stealing 100% the article that me and my mother wrote in English, without giving any credits to my mother (Asiarose), and the worse is, without giving any credits to the teacher (Rabiah Amit) who also her bestfriend, and they use that article for commercial to attract their customers, and they kept this article 'like' they are the 'original writer' especially they bought .com domain (while me and my mother only keep our article in free domain, which other people may think that 'we' 'copying' from that websites. We didn't want to make situation worse and argue with the websites owner, even asking them to write the credits and reference, thats's only being ignored by them. So I was thinking the best way to published the article and giving the credits to right person (Asiarose and her teacher, Rabiah Amit) is by writing the article in wikipedia. When I wrote the article in wikipedia, I was thinking to write the article only without any reference which link to the website. But it seem that in wikipedia format we should put the reference. When I put the reference or external link site which linking to my mother's cake website, you will see the webpage has written the same article where I wrote here. The website has many link buttons, included 'link button' to go to page where people can book the cake from my mother if they interested. This probably make u think that writing this article in wikipedia is advertising or spamming attempt, while my first intention is to write this article in wikiepdia for information or educational purpose. Actually I could remove the reference link if it is not wikipedia format. I mean, just keep the article without any link or reference but Im not sure if wikiepdia will accept that.</p>
<p>Well, thats all I can say. Anyway thanks for watching the article, I appreciate that...Itis ok if u delete it.. because u have right to do that.. (thanks RHworth for giving me full permission to write the article before).</p>
<p>Mangojuice, <b>by the way, if the article that I wrote make u think thatway, maybe <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunkin_Donuts_c30f.html" title="Dunkin Donuts">Dunkin_Donuts</a> , <a href="../../../n/e/s/Nestle.html" title="Nestle">Nestle</a> , <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starbucks.html" title="Starbucks">Starbucks</a> , <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walgreens.html" title="Walgreens">Walgreens</a> , and others (with reference and external link to business website should be consider to be deleted to because they 'attempt' to 'advertise' and 'spamming' in this website, and not to tell the brief history of their company.</b> Ayacantik 01:23, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Also, if in the future you create useful articles, keep in mind that <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_2592.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirects">redirects</a> can effectively give an article several different look-up points, and are far preferable to creating man copies of an article. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 18:55, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>So if you <i>I appreciate [my] work so much</i>, why did you blank your sandbox? -- <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> 08:52, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi RHaworth. I'm sorry, I didn't know why I do that. I just felt really bad and upset yesterday. Plus quite stress and tired because so many school works and home works that I had to do yesterday. I was thinking that the article will never be published. I just felt that my article was not good enough to be here. I was thinking to quit from wikiepdia. I really appreciate *your work taht helping me editing the article.I miss my mum and I felt I fail to save the article which me and her composed together longtime ago, and that article had been copied and stolen by other ppl without giving any credit to my mum.My mind was blank and in emotional when I click 'Save' after I blank my sandbox, and then I wakeup and realize I did a big mistake because I blank the sandbox with article which already being proofread by you (and not my original article with messy grammar). Oh my goodness! What did I do. I had no idea to get the article back. I'm glad to see the article here again today. And I hope you forgive me. And again, thank you very much for helping. You are a kind heart person. Ayacantik 04:53, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
