	    <p>Hi everybody, hi ArmanJan. I've modified this page because there is no conclusive and authoritative evidence as to where this incident occured. Was it inside Lebanon in Ayta al-Sha'b, or was it in Israel near Zar'it? We do not, and cannot know for sure. Therefore, both theories must be presented. I think that it would be useful to provide more reference links... The monstersandcritics.com article is not very detailled. Is there an official source we could cite, or at least alternate sources? There is this <a href="http://hyeforum.com/index.php?act=Print&amp;client=printer&amp;f=19&amp;t=14297" class="external text" title="http://hyeforum.com/index.php?act=Print&amp;client=printer&amp;f=19&amp;t=14297" rel="nofollow">forum</a> that paraphrases the Nasrallah claim, but forums aren't very authoritative...

<dd>I can put many more links. What you wrote is incorrect. As per wikipedia rules one does not put more links to prove the same thing. I will change the article stlighty. <b><a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmanJan_72ca.html" title="User:ArmanJan">ArmanJan</a> 19:19, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</b>

<dd>Sorry, my mistake for suggesting more links. However, I think that we could find a better source than monstersandcritics.com. Quantity isn't important, you're right, quality is. Can you find a better source for the Lebanese Police claim, and can you find a transcript of the Nasrallah speech? One last thing, we should use a more neutral term than "arrests" for describing the incident. What about "skirmish"?

<p>It appears that there are many different ways to transliterate Ayta al-Sha'b. Do you think that some of those other spellings could be added to the page? <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHernick_fa2a.html" title="User:Hernick">Hernick</a> 19:43, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>More spelling would only confuse people, imo just redirect everything to here. As for using a different term for "arrest", that is the tileral term used by the police and the Lebanese president on CNN. I changed the text a bit, also changed text under map, it is Lebanon's official stance that they were arrested in Chaab south-lebanon. <b><a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmanJan_72ca.html" title="User:ArmanJan">ArmanJan</a> 21:39, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</b>

<dd>Sounds good to me. Also, I like the yahoo news article much more than the old link. As for the Lebanese president talking about the arrests on CNN, do you have a source for that?

<p>This subject should be deleted. It makes no sense. The only attempt to prove that the soldiers were kidanpped in Lebanese soil (as well as the other 3 KIA and others WIA) is some article of some obscure Indian website whose only source is Hezbollah and "Lebanese Police". I believe that unless proof is given, such as showing the equipment abandoned inside Lebanon, or showing that the blown Humvees were inside Lebanon, this is not a possible claim but an outright lie and distortion of a fact. There is all the evidence needed that shows it was inside Israel: The WIA that were left, the bodies of the KIAs and the remains of the 2 Humvees. Additionally these was a patrol manned by reservists doing their annual duty, not exactly a Special Forces entering Lebanon covertly. I recommen summarily deletion of this topic unless proof is given ASAP as for reasons that could create a possible claim for the allegations that the Israelis were inside Lebanon as asserted.

<p>Including the Lebanese assertion is fair only as long as the mainstream assertion, and evidence of its acceptance by the UN, EU, &amp; G8 are included. Removing these sources serves to make the Lebanese claims sound more reliable than they really are. <font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">Tewfik</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../t/e/w/User_talk%7ETewfik_b384.html" title="User talk:Tewfik">Talk</a></sup></font> 15:33, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If we are going to include as a possible occurence, any time any leader of any organization asserts a claim, Wikipedia will run amok with numerous historical revisionism. I still think that this topic should be deleted until any claim by Hezbollah's Nasrallah can be backed with any sort of proof. The only attack that occured inside Lebanon, was the explosion of an Israeli Merkava tan, which rushed inside Lebanon, after the kidnappings, in an attempt to recover the soldiers which were kidnapped in Israel, with their comrades left wounded there along the wreckage. How can I have this topic sent to an administrator for possible deletion? Richardmiami 20:17, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You can't; this article exists as a claim made by Lebanon (and others), not as proof that such a claim is true. As such, it is factual: the claim has been made, ergo the article is legitimate. (Same as <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">Holocaust denial</a>, I suppose, though I think the latter is bogus while this article isn't, but that's just me.) +<a href="../../../i/l/i/User%7EILike2BeAnonymous_f872.html" title="User:ILike2BeAnonymous">ILike2BeAnonymous</a> 22:59, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So if IRA in Northern Ireland claims that one of their operatived infiltrated Buckingham Palace, then raped Queen Elizabeth II and made off with her underwear, we would claim it as factual, "that since a claim has been made, ergo the article is legitimate."???? C'mon, the source is Hezbollah. There is no "Lebanese Police". No evidence was given. They admitted they have been planning this. They even rocketed the area before as a diversionary tactic. Including this article cheapens Wikipedia and can put doubt into the trustfulness of Wikipedia. I say, delete it, until some sort of factual support is given, other than "Hezbollah said it".
