<li><b>Strong delete</b> I've argued for deleting this article for some time. First of all because Croatophobia is really only a term made up to deflect criticism, legitimate or not, of certain aspects of Croatian history and politics. By applying the phobia suffix it tries to imply that such criticism is irrational. Finally, it isn't a word in English and isn't used outside of Croatia. If it should be included, then the definition should be something like "term used by some media in Croatia to characterize criticism of Croatia, Croatian politics or aspects of Crotian history.<a href="../../../o/s/l/User%7EOsli73_41ba.html" title="User:Osli73">Osli73</a> 21:23, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: If this is a notable phenomenon, <i>the fact that no English word exists for it (yet) is not a deletion argument</i>, exactly because Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not a dictionary</a> and does not write about words in the English language but about concepts and objects in the real world. If "Croatophobia" is real, or there are notable enough allegations that it is, the English Wikipedia should still be able to write about it using <i>some title</i>, even if the only sources are in Croatian or other languages, and the entry has to borrow a foreign word to describe it (we do that all the time with, for instance, obscure theological concepts in Hinduism or Islam, that can only be described through borrowing words in Sanskrit or Arabic unknown to the average educated English-speaker). (I am still skeptical about this article from the point of view of the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> policy, and not really prepared to recommend to keep it, but I think some of the deletion arguments are faulty.) <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 09:30, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I respectfully disagree. I'm not saying that we should delete it because it's not an English word (otherwise, tons of entries would disappear from WP). I'm saying it should be deleted because you can't simply make up an English word and assume that it will eventually become the word to describe their topic, which is borderline <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENot_131e.html" title="WP:Not">Not a crystal ball</a>. The word itself is also strong POV and OR, considering there were 22 hits on Yahoo! for this "Croatian" word and many of them were Wiki related <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=Croatophobia&amp;sm=Yahoo%21+Search&amp;fr=FP-tab-web-t&amp;toggle=1&amp;cop=&amp;ei=UTF-8" class="external autonumber" title="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=Croatophobia&amp;sm=Yahoo%21+Search&amp;fr=FP-tab-web-t&amp;toggle=1&amp;cop=&amp;ei=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. This is no different than myself creating an article on TomCruiseaphobia and stating this is not a word yet but eventually will describe the public's tiring of his tabloid existance. --<a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtaricodfish_9ff7.html" title="User:Ataricodfish">Ataricodfish</a> 13:31, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think that <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> has a point here. If the word is actually used in other languages then it should still be in the English encyclopedia, or at least shouldn't be automatically deleted because we in the English world are unaware of it. The English Wikipedia should not be only about English and/or American concepts and ideas, but rather an English translation of ALL ideas. And if Croatophobia is a real sentiment in other cultures or languages I think we should know about it. I'm not sure the support is there from the other languages, but I agree that it shouldn't be so readily deleted. It is not the same as TomCruiseaphobia because nobody actually uses that term in any language. <a href="../../../n/o/e/User%7ENoeticsage_1b49.html" title="User:Noeticsage">Noetic Sage</a> 19:44, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The word is, according to article, not used even in Croatian, until some journalist coined it in 1999. It does not seem to be widely used word at all - croatian word gets about 10 hits <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=kroatofobija+&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=kroatofobija+&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. The article with similar title has been deleted from german wikipedia (<a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kroatophobie" class="external free" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kroatophobie" rel="nofollow">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kroatophobie</a> - notice that the link exist in google hits, so it was recently deleted). The main concern is not about the word (the title could in principle be changed to something like anti-croatian sentiment), but that it is a OR construction, which bases the "evidence" of the existence of the subject of the article on some web formums etc. - clearly a violation of NOR policy. Wikipedia is not a soapbox, after all. Rockie21 20:05, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Linguistic quasi-arguments are, essentially-laughable. Any significant hostility towards a specific ethnic/national group or ideological/"racial" construct is expressed, generally, by a Greek (sometimes Latin) neologism combining the name of a particular nation &amp; the suffix -phobia. Hence well known Francophobia, Anglophobia, Russophopia, Europhobia,...and probably less known Sinophobia, ...You can add words I'm not certain one can find in a dictionary, but are meaningful anyway: Hibernophobia, Albanophobia, Polonophobia, Brazilophobia, Negrophobia, ....As I see, the existence of the article is disputed, mainly, along two following lines: a) there is no such a word in English dictionary. Remark: since this word has been used at least once in a news article, it certainly <b>is</b> an English word- the fact that dictionary writers were too lazy (or, more realistically, slower in updates) to inscribe it as a "dictionary word", means nothing. Hence, IMO, "language argument" is worthless 2) the second objection would be that such a thing does not exist. Well, while I can, to a degree, sympatzhize with the 1st objection &amp; find a value in it, the 2nd objection I find personally offensive. Examples like <a href="http://www.srpska-mreza.com/Croatia/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.srpska-mreza.com/Croatia/index.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, <a href="http://www.suc.org/culture/library/genocide/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.suc.org/culture/library/genocide/index.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, speak for themselves-although, it would be even more visible if the Serbian academician Vasilije Krestić's <a href="http://www.srpsko-nasledje.co.yu/sr-l/1998/10/article-17.html" class="external text" title="http://www.srpsko-nasledje.co.yu/sr-l/1998/10/article-17.html" rel="nofollow">article</a> about "Croatian mustiness of the soul", or <a href="../../../v/o/j/Vojislav_%C5%A0e%C5%A1elj_a9fd.html" title="Vojislav Šešelj">Vojislav Šešelj</a>'s magnum opus, downloadable in Serbian Cyrillic <a href="http://media.srpskinacionalisti.com/knjige/Ideologija%20srpskog%20nacionalizma.pdf?" class="external autonumber" title="http://media.srpskinacionalisti.com/knjige/Ideologija%20srpskog%20nacionalizma.pdf?" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> were translated in English: here we read whole chapters on "Thousand years of Croatian barbarism" (p.486), "Croatian savagery in folk songs" (p. 495), "Animalistic urges of Croatian national being" (p. 529), "The Croat savage mentality is repugnant to the Italians" (p. 537), "Croatian people is guilty of Ustaša crimes", (p. 617), "Crime-the spiritual food for Croatian national being" (p. 627) etc, etc. Now- Šešelj's Radical party is <b>the</b> strongest party in <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbia_and_Montenegro_aebc.html" title="Serbia and Montenegro">Serbia and Montenegro</a> (ca. 40% of the popular vote) &amp; this is their leader and ideologue's masterwork. This is their opinion on the Croats. As far as examples of Croatophobia on wikipedia, one need not go much further: just check the "contributions" like the following ones: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/SradkaW" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/SradkaW" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/SradkaW</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Petrinja" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Petrinja" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Petrinja</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Purger" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Purger" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Purger</a> etc. etc. What's the purpose of these "contribs"-save the defamation of Croats &amp; all things Croatian&#160;? If these are not examples of Croatophobia, I don't know what the term stands for&#160;?

<li>As I have pointed out above, the fact that no English word is established for something is not a valid argument not to have an article on a particular topic, so I agree with you on that point. However, the problem remains that this looks like <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> in Wikipedia terms. You are referring to what you consider <i>examples</i> of croatophobia (and so is the article), while what you should refer to is someone who has written <i>about</i> croatophobia or whatever name s/he would chose to use for it. Some random Serbian contributors' purportedly anti-Croatian edits on Wikipedia, for instance, are completely useless as sources for a Wikipedia articles. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 09:48, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't quite follow your way of reasoning. It's not just me, but, I guess any mentally sane person's perception that statements like "The thirst for blood is the X-nation's ethnic being", "The X-nation is filled wirth hatred towards Y-nation" are examples of "X-nationphobia". It's no original research, but a simple consensus on what mental (in)sanity looks like. As for Croatophobic wikipedinas, I've referred to them simply as illustration of this mentality-not as a "proof" wiki should accept or cite. But, gloves off, for a moment: how would any rational person characterize an imaginary wiki contributor whose edits or "contribs" would consist, 90%, of the following stuff: they write on, say, American Negroes (I'll skip a PC term "African-American") by insisting that: Negroes are 13% of the US population &amp; over 50% of "American crime"; they score lower than whites at IQ tests; they have extremely high percentage of out-of-wedlock births; they are overrepresented in the field of violent crime; they ...And this imaginary contributor doesn't say a word on Negro contribution to American music, sports, literature etc. So-how would you characterize user whose edits are profiled in such a way&#160;? Would they be rightly dubbed Negrophobes&#160;? As are, without doubt, those Serbian popsucketeers I've mentioned earlier. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a> 14:05, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Yesterday I was going to argue for keeping the article, because - I must admit - I'm not radically opposed to the "we think that" type of OR. After all, articles on <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbophobia.html" title="Serbophobia">Serbophobia</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Bosniak_sentiment_89e4.html" title="Anti-Bosniak sentiment">anti-Bosniak sentiment</a> do exist, and they are mostly OR, too. Furthermore, I had already been accused of Croatophobia several times by Croatian users, so I assumed that it was already an established concept in Croatian. However, I changed my mind when I found out that on the whole Internet (judging from Google hits), there are only 5 real occurrences of "kroatofobija", 2 real occurrences of "hrvatofobija" and 1 real occurrence of "croatofobija". This means that the concept isn't established even <i>in Croatian</i> yet, let alone in English - it has been used just a couple of times, and you just can't define Croatophobia as including opinions X, Y, and Z, when almost nobody actually uses the word. Using wiki as a vehicle to create and propagate a concept is, IMO, going just a bit too far. On the other hand, if things like <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbophobia.html" title="Serbophobia">Serbophobia</a> and similar stuff are to stay, then I guess most of the current content of Croatophobia should be kept under a title like, say, <i>Perceived anti-Croatian prejudices and propaganda</i>. So I guess my vote would have to be something like "keep, but rename and change", or "delete, and create another article with partly similar content". Since the outcome of both would be the same, I am more or less:</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Hmmm....it seems to me that at least a part of the "deletionist" activity here is a pretty obvious example of Croatophobia. I don't care much about personal contribs, but-isn't it suspicious that all I can see about a "speedy delete" contributor is this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Rockie21" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Rockie21" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Rockie21</a> So-what can we deduce from this&#160;? What can we infer from the user's edits that are focused almost exclusively (ca. 10% of "other" edits are a tactical smokescreen) on Croatian-defamation activity&#160;? And other, essentially clueless users, only repeat the mantra on the google counts&#160;? So-what&#160;? Google is a god&#160;? Is this a joke&#160;? Is this kangaroo-voting (maybe I've invented a neologism, kinda) meant to reveal anything save the aggressiveness of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Serbia_0728.html" title="Greater Serbia">Greater Serbian</a> propaganda &amp; rather low level of comprehension capacity of "other" wikipedians&#160;? Or, maybe it's something more at stake. I'd say that failure of the moral nerve hides itself, as usual, behind paragraphs. If someone is not convinced by explicit qotes reflecting a politically widespread opinion (for veracity of the translation, it's easy to employ Serbian wikipedians free of pan-Serbian disease)- then, I guess, you bureaucrats (and I mean it in an old-fashioned, ordinary way) are beyond remedy. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a> 19:16, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>As for "irrational hostility"-is this a joke (I'm repeating myself, I know)? Do you think that quoted passages from Šešelj's magnum opus need a commission composed of specialists (social psychologists, psychiatrists,..) to determine whether the claims on criminal essence of Croatian national being etc. are examples of "irrational hostility" or not&#160;? I thought the good ole common sense from Locke &amp; the Declaration of Independence would unanimously decide that the irrational hostility is "self-evident" in the quoted passages. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a> 15:04, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's not a joke, in fact I think that it's very basic stuff. Nothing is self-evident if it's disputed (that's what NPOV is all about), and such situations are resolved by means of sources (that's what verifiability is all about). I'm sure that at least one person would disagree that Seselj's statements are irrationally hostile - namely, Seselj himself. Now, even if Seselj were the only sentient being on Earth espousing his own opinions, <i>we</i> aren't authorized to determine whether Seselj's POV or ours is the "correct" one and present that as the objective truth in an encyclopedia.</dd>

Upon taking a look at Seselj's pyromaniac rubbish, I see that both my statement and wiki's policy can seem, at first sight, to be an expression of idiotic pedantry; the problem is that in many cases (such as people disputing the existence of the Croatian language, which - for the record - I, personally, recognize), it isn't that obvious whether something is part of a "phobia" or not. --85.187.44.131 16:54, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I respectfully disagree. Unlike adultery, a part of the essence of language is that it is (more or less exactly) replicated. It's not enough for a word to be used once, by one individual, to become part of the standard language. It has to gain some acceptance first. Otherwise, it's still a proto- or neologism.

<dd>Secondary sources are available, and I've given the link to the book-the most comprehensive one-volume Croatian dictionary. Now, if this means that the "permitted" neologisms should have wide Internet circulation, I completely disagree &amp; don't see that it is in the definition of wiki standards. But, if read carefully, the above quote is contradictory: essentially, it says that a neologism can &amp; cannot be used in the wiki titles for articles-and that the editors's personal inclinations don't play the role in the selection processes. So, where we are&#160;? The ultimate criterion, what can be deduced from the above quote, is the <b>verifiable secondary source</b>. There are such sources, and they are eminent modern <b>Croatian dictionaries</b>, but <b>no</b> English dictionaries. And this is the core of the dispute: the phenomenon exists, it has been named in the language of the group it "deals with" &amp; has not yet percolated in the mainstream English lexicography. It's as simple as that. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a> 15:25, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How come it isn't used by other Croats online? There's apparently no tradition - each time they use it, it's invented anew, as in the 2003 article that FrontLine supplied as a reference&#160;: "Croatophobia is the irrational fear of a country and hostility towards its culture. Croatophobia <b>would be</b> (bi bila) irrational fear of Croats and hostility towards Croatian culture". In other words, this is a neologism that is occasionally and independently coined and that people give their own definition (the author of the article actually makes it include many <i>Croats</i>). The truth is that the editors of the article are defining Croataophobia in the process of writing it (OR).</p>

The sentiment itself exists, the term is widely used in Croatian end Ex-Yu literature, and it is NOT a neologism. A exhaustive encyclopedia should strive for more articles, not less, and this topic certainly deserves it's own article.

<dd>OK, Croatophobia may exist officially as an (very uncommon) word in Croatian, but that doesn't mean it's an established <i>concept</i>, commonly associated with particular facts. In fact, there's strong evidence that it isn't (the article with "croatofobija bi bila .../definition/", etc.). Thus, you can't go anywhere beyond a dictionary-style definition (and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>) without doing original research and inventing your own picture of what <i>you</i> think deserves being called so. Of course, the situation with Serbophobia is fairly similar, except that it is already a common concept - which doesn't mean that describing it without sources isn't OR that should in principle be deleted. But using Wiki to actually fashion and propagate a concept means, IMO, moving one step further from what is acceptable.--85.187.44.131 16:38, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If it exists, why are there no google hits? And the two newspaper articles that mention it, cooked it up for the purpose of the article - in one it means one thing, in other quite anoter thing. Like non-nationalist Croats who were branded "Croatophobes" for their lack of patriotism. And that is given as a reference for "feeling of hostility or hatred towards Croats". Come on. Give us a reliable <b>source</b> that the thing exists. Pointing to the alleged examples is original research. Pointing to sources that describe this supposed sentiment is quite different thing. There is no proof or even any indication that this is an established phenomenon. If web-forums are best you can come up with, excellent. Tom-Cruisophobia has better references than this.

<p>You sure have some points there, but you should realize that the fact that you do look a lot like a Serbian sock puppet (I could be wrong, but I'd say it with 99.99% certainty) doesn't add to your credibility. No offence meant. I was happy to discover that there are some very decent Serbian wikipedians (<a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">user:Duja</a>, for instance), but it should be obvious to anyone that all this extensive sock puppetry causes damage to the reputation of your country, creating the depressing impression that there is a huge amount of Serbian cheaters (whereas I'm sure that it's actually just one or a couple of people who happen to have a lot of spare time and an inclination to cheat). --85.187.44.131 17:27, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>May I remind you (and other editors) that <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> is a policy here. Also, it is strange that you have such concerns, as you edit anonimously. Balot stuffing and things like that can be considered cheating, and that is what Croatian editors here are doing, not me. Comment on the issue, not the contributors. Note that you being supposedly Bulgarian does not automatically make you neutral, as you also hold bias, possibly anti-Serbian.

<dd>I didn't attack you personally, I simply stated that you look like a sock puppet to me, and that sock puppetry is bad. You're right that the fact that you're probably a sock puppet doesn't mean you're wrong (since that is an ad hominem argument), but I'm sure many neutral editors are influenced by that fact nevertheless. Anyway, I'm glad I'm finally being accused of anti-Serbianism for a change. --85.187.44.131 15:16, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Eh...I'm not sure about the validity of this user's argument. The term "kroatofobija" is recorded in the most comprehensive one-volume contemporary Croatian dictionary<a href="http://www.sveznadar.com/knjiga.aspx?knjiga=58210" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sveznadar.com/knjiga.aspx?knjiga=58210" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, while I'm not sure about the term "srbofobija" (tho, I'm not conversant with current Serbian lexicography). So, as far as the recorded existence of the notion goes, "kroatofobija" is, to my knowledge, certainly more "established" than "srbofobija". As for Google-arguments, they've been dealt with. And, as for "the existence in the real world of Serbophobia"-this is a purely subjective opinion of this user, to put it mildly. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMir_Harven_99cb.html" title="User:Mir Harven">Mir Harven</a> 07:56, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Uh...This is how Serbophobia is more established, and it's probably not in the way that you think I meant. I didn't think I'd be explaining this to a Croat, frankly. "Serbophobia" has been a Serbian bogey for forty years. Serbian intellectuals spent much of the 1980s and 1990s wallowing in their own belief that Croats, communists, Montenegrins, Slovenes et al. were Serbophobes. Entire books were written on the subject -- see the writings of Vuk Draskovic, Dobrica Cosic, etc.. I most definitely do NOT mean that any of those peoples truly and deeply hated Serbs. But the concept's existence is beyong dispute, even if it is not directly comparable to other phobias. For the rest, I don't deal in Google hits. Mir Harven seems to me to be a Croatian inventor -- the notion of Croatophobia does not exist in its pure form nor in the form I describe for Serbs. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfnjm_f2dc.html" title="User:Profnjm">Profnjm</a> 12:28, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This is perfectly legitimate &amp; rational objection (although, of course, I find it narrow &amp; an example of pitiful workings of a bureaucratic mind.).
