<p>There seems to be nothing encyclopedic to say about this dish other than that it exists, i.e. the mundane fact that chicken meat may be cooked with curry powder in a variety of ways, none of which are individually notable as far as I can see. <small>(Come to think of it, might even be speediable under the letter of <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#A3" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#A3</a>, but seems too wordy for its spirit).</small> The main interest of the article's creator seems to be to exhort the world to mind the subtle differences between "chicken curry" and "curry chicken"... –<a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenning_Makholm_0024.html" title="User:Henning Makholm">Henning Makholm</a> 01:32, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Although some of your reasons for deletion may be thought about, The article has further been enhanced with a history section. In addition, your arguments for deletion also apply for various articles such as <a href="../../../r/o/t/Roti.html" title="Roti">Roti</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/o/Aloo_gobi.html" title="Aloo gobi">Aloo gobi</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/i/Fried_rice.html" title="Fried rice">Fried_rice</a> etc. This article has now some historical content. It seems the creator is a newbee, and thus It would be appropriate if we help the author by further adding to the article. I guess the best way is to, add the various cultural histories of the curry chicken dish. <b>In addition</b>, this article can not be added to the curry article because it is not a curry dish. This is a chicken dish, NOT merely a curry dish. In addition, the contents of this article is quite large, and it will become even larger when other lovers of the curry chicken dish from different culture backgrounds, add their own historical history of this dish.</li>

<dd>Just to point out, to verification of the distinction between chicken curry and curry chicken is simple. If you look for recipes of the two dishes, they are summed up by what the article says. Nonetheless, the article has historical facts that are sourced, and is not merely distinguishing between curry chicken and chicken curry. The distinction is just there, to clarify the two dishes.<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatopshotta_4554.html" title="User:Thatopshotta">Thatopshotta</a> 02:47, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>I like this article</b> As a native of India, I loved my chicken curry. As I travelled the world, I met many wonderful people. I got to taste this curry chicken dish, and I was extatic. The article has hit the point, about the subtle difference between curry chicken and chicken curry. But more than that, the historical section seems interesting. I will be doing research when I get the time, to find out some other culutural histories of curry chicken!!

<li><b>Keep</b> There is a distinct, legitimate point in that article. I have been to many countries, US, Canada, France, England, India, Pakistan, Jamaica..., working temp-work, mostly as a part-time chef. I have noticed for example that when I cook for a Hindu or Pakistan community, we create the dishes with very few chicken and mostly curry. This is spread over rice, and used like Dahl. However, when I have cooked for Jamaican, and West Indian communities, we/I have prepared chicken by soaking it in a special curry sauce, and so on. I am pleased to see that this article points this subtle difference in these two dishes, and I hope it can remain. I must say, I shall try that Ultimate Curry Chicken recipe on the link provided, looks fantastic!! GobtaNIndia 07:34, 28 February 2007 (UTC)GobtaNIndia

<li>I am sorry that your sorry, I think my explanation above gives reason what fried rice has to do with curry chicken. The point is, after reading these arguments above, saying "should be merged with curry article", then why is not "chicken tika masala" not merged with curry or masala. Why is "Garam Masala" not merged with masala. Why is "Aloo gobi" not merged with aloo, or gobi. That is the point. I say they should not be merged, and therefore this curry chicken should not be merged with curry. It deserves its own article, as those the articles stated in my statement.

It's a notable food, especially in the Caribbean where it is considered a major local dish not just in Trinidad, where almost half the population is Indian, but also in Jamaica, where the Indian population is small, and other islands where there has never been much of an Indian population at all. Merging it with <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curry.html" title="Curry">curry</a> would require a complete re-write of that article. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 13:20, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> This might be a stupid question but what notability guideline should apply to food? - <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDennyColt_8821.html" title="User talk:DennyColt">Denny</a> 14:11, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> There is certainly a major distinction between this dish and chicken curry, as the article rather haltingly states. It could do with a rewrite though, and probably a name change - after all it's not just chicken that's prepared this way. A merge into <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curry.html" title="Curry">Curry</a> would be misleading, but it could certainly find its way into an article on West Indian cuisine. <a href="../../../c/u/i/Cuisine_of_Trinidad_and_Tobago_9d75.html" title="Cuisine of Trinidad and Tobago">Cuisine_of_Trinidad_and_Tobago</a>, possibly? <b><a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliminatorJR_b0b2.html" title="User:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B">Eliminator</font><font color="#FF4500">JR</font></a> <a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EEliminatorJR_a208.html" title="User talk:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B"><sup>Talk</sup></font></a></b> 16:10, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, unique and interesting piece that could become more encyclopedic on Wikipedia than any other location if given the chance... <a href="../../../s/m/e/User%7ESmeelgova_a687.html" title="User:Smeelgova">Smee</a> 21:31, 27 February 2007 (UTC).</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Curry Chicken is an important part of many cultures around the world, and it will be discriminating if this article is not given chance to portray itself. Also, it deserves its own article and not be merged with curry. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanacomet_e545.html" title="User:Alanacomet">Alanacomet</a> 02:21, 1 March 2007 (UTC)alanacomet <small>— <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanacomet_e545.html" title="User:Alanacomet">alanacomet</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_alanacomet_9f58.html" title="Special:Contributions/alanacomet">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - i agree w. Smee, and the chef above. I think it's a decent article that has some singular facts. It could use more sources, but my vote is keep.--<a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDebsuls_76d4.html" title="User:Debsuls">Debsuls</a> 01:25, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Popular and varied dish. Also passes the Brittanica Test: If I see an article in Brittanica about this, I won't think, "why did they include this?". (Google tests aren't policy, but just a note: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=com.ubuntu%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&amp;hs=r0y&amp;q=%22Curry+chicken%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=com.ubuntu%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&amp;hs=r0y&amp;q=%22Curry+chicken%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> "curry chicken"] gets 436,000 results.) - <a href="../../../e/l/b/User%7EElbridgeGerry_ec17.html" title="User:ElbridgeGerry">ElbridgeGerry</a> <small><a href="../../../e/l/b/User_talk%7EElbridgeGerry_01d0.html" title="User talk:ElbridgeGerry">t</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ElbridgeGerry_a263.html" title="Special:Contributions/ElbridgeGerry">c</a> <a href="../../../b/l/o/Special%7EBlockip_ElbridgeGerry_58d4.html" title="Special:Blockip/ElbridgeGerry">block</a></small> 00:33, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - These articles that are being brought up maybe a part of a country's cuisine section. Also not everyone makes Curry chicken the same. Sure Curry maybe the most pronounced ingredient but there's various ways it can be prepaired. I also find it funny based on the bias on Wikipedia that someone would call this a "Mundane" article yet there's one on Spaghetti Sauce. I bet that same crowd would say *that* was a very importaint article. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaribDigita_7e23.html" title="User:CaribDigita">CaribDigita</a> 17:08, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You don't really have any basis to claim that just because someone says "delete" for curry chicken that they want the spaghetti sauce article to stay. In fact, one should remember that <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">inclusion is not an indication of validity</a>. In other words, just because something "mundane" like, say <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butter.html" title="Butter">butter</a>, has an article (a featured one at that) it doesn't mean that every food item deserves an article. <font color="#1874CD"><b><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo86_eb89.html" title="User:Leebo86">Leebo</a></b></font><small><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo86_8ca0.html" title="User talk:Leebo86"><font color="#B22222">86</font></a></sup></small> 17:21, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, I also see you believe that there is an "American Deletionist Cabal".
