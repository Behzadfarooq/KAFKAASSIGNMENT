<p>Australian Idol contestant who did not make it to the finals. Page history suggests article created by whoever runs his website. Serserse 17:15, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> A look at the Beyond Idols section clearly shows he hasn't done anything outside the show to warrant an article (at least not yet). If the songs he did on the show aren't in the Australian Idol page, they can be <b>merged</b>, but that's about it. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 22:12, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, not even good enough to get onto Idol? Sorry then, but you're not good enough to have an article about you. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankiveil_3447.html" title="User:Lankiveil">Lankiveil</a> 09:53, 24 September 2006 (UTC).</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, the fact is that the contestant WAS on Idol. That can't be debated. The article is as warranted as any of the other Idol related contestants' articles. It makes no false claims as to the achievements of the contestant. User:www.lindsaywest.net 9:32, 25 September 2006 (UTC). <small>— Www.lindsaywest.net (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWww.lindsaywest.net_d1ea.html" title="User talk:Www.lindsaywest.net">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Www.lindsaywest.net_5721.html" title="Special:Contributions/Www.lindsaywest.net">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, WHy delete it?It shouldnt be deleted. Its info about a celebrity who is trying to make it in the music industry. Dont delete it. <small>— 58.165.34.75 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_58.165.34.75_e2f3.html" title="Special:Contributions/58.165.34.75">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Regardless of whatever Lindsay's results were or were not on Idol, he is still a working musician within the Melbourne and Australian music industry and has just as much right to his place in popular cultural history as anyone else. So therefore, the article should remain. <small>— Bacibella (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bacibella_c9d7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bacibella">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Lindsay West is an Australian artist who is trying to make it in the music industry. He appeared on Australian Idol in 2005 and got as far as the wildcard stage, one stage before being in the finals. This article is not rude or innapropriate in any way - those are the ones that need to be deleted. All it is is a short biography on an Australian musical artist, who may not have a number 1 song, but who has done well and worked hard for his achievements. Surely this can be acknowledged in an article in Wikipedia. <small>— 61.68.231.124 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_61.68.231.124_8056.html" title="Special:Contributions/61.68.231.124">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
<li><b>Delete</b> -- not notable enough for inclusion. - <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> 06:26, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. <a href="../../../q/a/z/User%7EQazPlm_517d.html" title="User:QazPlm">QazPlm</a> 06:40, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Given some of the topics and subjects that currently have a page on Wikipedia, I can see no reason why this page should not be allowed to exist. Australian Idol is a show that generates a lot of talk, and thousands of people every year apply for a shot at the big time. The fact that Lindsay got to the final 30 entrants in 2005, and the manner in which he got that far, is surely reason enough to keep this page active. Itswin 01:01, 26 September 2006 (UTC) <small>— Itswin (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Itswin_250d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Itswin">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - If this artist were to be deleted, then ALL noteable Australian Idol contestants not reaching first or second place status would need to be deleted. Wikipedia is a resource, therefore isn't it in everyone's best interest to keep it as abundant in information as possible? And I see this artist's listing is clearly up-to-date and accurate. There are other vocalists who reached the same stage of competition in Idol (eg: Ngaiire Joseph) who are making their mark gradually, and we don't see them being unfairly deleted from discussion pages. West is a singer-songwriter first and foremost, and active in the Australian music scene in more than one capacity, and that's credibility enough to remain here, in my books. Every artist has something unique to offer, there's room for all. Surely you people have more pressing matters than to be as petty as requesting fatuitous deletions from websites! Really!!! Lahelia 07:45, 26 September 2006 (UTC) <small>— Lahelia (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lahelia_2e35.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lahelia">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - So Lindsay West is not a hugely famous recording artist (yet!!). But what he is, is a very talented singer-songwriter making a go of it out there in one of the worlds hardest industries. I fail to see any reason why his entry should be deleted. We should be getting behind such people and supporting them in their efforts to make something of themselves and share their talents with the world. Surely Wikipedia can assist him with this by including his article.Supporting Australian Artists 00:15, 27 September 2006 (UTC) <small>— Supporting Australian Artists (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Supporting_Australian_Artists_40b4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Supporting Australian Artists">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> -Hey now! What’s the dealio?? Im sorry but isn’t the purpose of Wiki (being an encyclopedia and all) to be used as a valuable source of information for individuals to go to and find out more on things?? Hmm.. I think YES!! So then, doesn’t this indeed mean that it should contain as much information for people to search specific subjects? I MUST say… I think deleting West’s page defeats the purpose of this site entirely! Why have the site at all if you’re going to go and delete pages that don’t count to YOU? What about all the Lindsay supporters? As a supporter of both Lindsay’s AND Wikipedia’s I am most outraged that the even thought of deleting such a great musician’s page has even been put across in the first place! What a JOKE! This guy works just as hard, if not, harder than any other muso out there… therefore I do believe he deserves to have his page kept! I bet if we were talking about a million dollar international artist, this “deletion” thing would never of even come up at all! He should most definately NOT be deleted. What about all the people who come onto your site to view his page! He is an interesting and inspiring person to many people, I really do feel it isn’t fair for his page to go! All I’ve got to say is “GO Lindsay! Keep rockin! You got loads of support!!” Cuddly giggles 03:31, 27 September 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: Cuddly giggles (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cuddly_giggles_d06d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cuddly giggles">contribs</a>) has made few or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></li>
