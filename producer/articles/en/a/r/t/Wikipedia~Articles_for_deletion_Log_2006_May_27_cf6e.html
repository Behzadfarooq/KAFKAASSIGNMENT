<dd>I have compared Spencer Clark's career to the WP:BIO guideline. I have compared him to the "living persons" section since he is not dead long enough for history to have recognized his contributions. In the sports section, he clearly meets "Sportspeople/athletes who have played in a fully professional league." The Busch series certainly meets the criteria "the individual is at a club of sufficient stature that most members of its squad already have articles" since almost all Busch series drivers have articles. Also, <b>EVERY Busch race is nationally televised in the United States</b> (since the 1980s), and serious (and even not so serious) NASCAR fans watch races from both series (the same applies to the Craftsman Truck Series). The drivers (as well as team members) in all three series are fully professional full-time employees in racing. The Busch series is far more well known than AAA baseball because of the higher exposure. Also, the high number of articles announcing his death clearly demonstrate that the "The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person" is clearly meet. <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalbroil_3602.html" title="User:Royalbroil">Royalbroil</a> 13:21, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Cardreader, The primary problem with the article as it is now envisioned is that it is <i>definitional</i> in nature and WP is not a dictionary. A previous incarnation of this article was deleted for similar reasons. This does not mean that the information is necessarily inaccurate, only that it belongs elsewhere or needs to be reformulated. Perhaps an article entitled something along the lines of <i>Current political and social disputes in India</i> could cover the material in which you have an interest while avoiding the mere definitional nature of the current one. Such an article would provide a place for descriptions of many serious disputes that need appropriate coverage in an encyclopedia.

<li><b>Reply</b> to deeptrivia: I understand your question here but we have only this one article to vote on at the moment. If you find the above listed articles to be candidates for deletion, then set them for an AfD and we can see what happens. From what I have read (I could be wrong, of course) WP has decided to <i>not</i> be bound by precedent in making decisions on disputes. At first this appreach bothered me then I realized it brought a necessary measure of fairness and flexibility while helping to prevent the admins (all of whom are volunteers like you and I) from painting themselves or later admins into a corner. The policy also averts needlessly legalistic arguments that can be quite pointless, particularly when WP dispute resolution is still in a nascent stage of development and Admins are not consistently available. I have seen some WP projects that attempt to regularize or standardize the editorial and organizational approaches to be taken regarding certain topics or areas of interest. Perhaps that might be something you would be interested in trying. Good luck. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAnde_B._3091.html" title="User:Ande B.">Ande B</a> 03:40, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: When did the term first first come into use?: That would need some research. In print, it definitely goes back to Jesse Helms' 1982 invitation to Dr. Chauhan. When India declared a state of mourning on the death of Winston Churchill in 1965, it was recalled that he was a critic of Indian National Congress, Gandhi and India as a new democracy, but I believe the term "India Basher" was not used then.</dd>

<li>Merging is one of the possible results of an AfD debate. In this case however, the result was not merge but delete, and any subsequent merge that was done was out of process, and therefore should not be used as a precedent.

<p>Content of this page is (or can be) sufficiently covered in the articles <a href="../../../s/e/i/Seinfeld.html" title="Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Seinfeld_%28character%29_8486.html" title="Jerry Seinfeld (character)">Jerry Seinfeld (character)</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/a/Elaine_Benes_f833.html" title="Elaine Benes">Elaine Benes</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Costanza_a481.html" title="George Costanza">George Costanza</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmo_Kramer_eef9.html" title="Cosmo Kramer">Cosmo Kramer</a>, or the articles for individual episodes, or it's simply not worth including. There's also a fair amount of unsourced editorial opinion, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>"George will go to any length to prove a point, no matter how minor."</li>
<li>"George is obsessive about minor details..."</li>
<li>"Elaine, though considered more intelligent than the other three characters..."</li>
<li>"Cosmo Kramer is the most mysterious of the four..."</li>
</ul>
<p>There are lots of "always," "usually," and "<i>(character)</i> thinks that," none of which are verifiable.</p>
<p>Finally, the nature of the article title is problematically vague; what constitutes a "gag" and not simply character development, what constitutes a "running" gag (several of the listed items, such as Elaine's bad dancing, occur only once), etc. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 02:52, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge</b> While this page in and of itself is inadequate, the intent to classify all of Seinfeld's running gags and quirks is an admirable one. This should absorb the "Culture of the Seinfeld Universe" articles as an index to the individual pages, and it needs a full re-write. Sgm 12:58, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Notability for the authors of erotica is probably harder to establish than for mainstream authors, simply because publishers are less likely to touch the genre. A Golden Clitorides award does suggest some notability, being a major prize on a significant online publisher (or distributor) of erotica. But is it <i>enough</i> notability? I'm not sure, so I abstain. <a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPaddles_deb2.html" title="User:Paddles">Paddles</a> 15:00, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Paddles. His argument sways me more than it might sway him/her, and I'd normally ignore this type of AfD, but considering the difficulty of erotica to have any significant publishing, it does no harm in having articles on the best of an overlooked lot. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28memes%29_35a0.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (memes)">WP:MEMES?</a>)</small> 19:17, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I would disagree with the premise that erotica doesn't have significant publishing outlets. Erotica publishing is a fairly big business. For example, Harper Collins recently created an imprint for erotica publishing<a href="http://www.harpercollins.com/press/display.asp?ACT=showid&amp;ID=414" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.harpercollins.com/press/display.asp?ACT=showid&amp;ID=414" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottW_8f9d.html" title="User:ScottW">ScottW</a> 17:44, 28 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm glad HarperCollins stepped up. Geared toward women, however, I'm not sure it demonstrates that it's easily big business, and I should have clarified in my original comment, erotica pulbishing isn't going to get a lot of mainstream press as a result of its subject matter. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28memes%29_35a0.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (memes)">WP:MEMES?</a>)</small> 20:21, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>How kind of you not to view this as <b>information for journalists</b>. You act like I live off words, not money! I need advertising from someone else, someone in control of the airwaves, not <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>, quite frankly. What makes you so powerful? I know of nobody that was obscure, and was helped by a Wikipedia article. Journalists in July will need to access this information all of a sudden, information about TTF-Bucksfan and the Fifth World Council, real world organisations, with real world people working for them, but if they make any comment about the information that is lacking, I'll tell them, <b>on national TV</b>, that <b>Wikipedia isn't really an encyclopedia</b>, and it isn't. It is just a bunch of envy-filled geaks that will talk about something when it already is, and thus they don't help democracy or global positive change in any way. They don't exist at all, for the purposes of democracy or positive global change through information, because the information you'll find there you can find elsewhere, and it is probably less biased. Wikipedia really doesn't deserve its nonprofit status. What makes a flat in Hurstville, Australia (read <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantium.html" title="Atlantium">here</a>), and that's all it is, more important than an Intercontinental Internet like the Cesidian Root, and the latter is just a corporation of my nation? Anyway, I won't give <b>nothing</b>, nothing at all to Wikipedia and its bosses, when I start that country out of thin air soon, and being a <b>Wikipedia Admin</b> won't get you a citizenship either! You won't be considered a <b>professional</b>, good enough to meet the standards of the Micronational Professional Registry, because if a professional information administrator thinks that the Cesidian Root doesn't deserve an article, but <a href="../../../o/p/e/OpenNIC_4d82.html" title="OpenNIC">OpenNIC</a>, a total joke, does, then <b>anyone can run a Wikipedia</b>, even I! I'm not breaking any rules here, or proposing articles that aren't already found in the Wikipedia, so if you are going to ax TTF-Bucksfan, then I demand you axe <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantium.html" title="Atlantium">Atlantium</a>, and virtually all the articles <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_micronations.html" title="List of micronations">here</a>. They don't have a more important nation. If you delete Cesidian Root, I'll demand similar treatment of the lesser <a href="../../../o/p/e/OpenNIC_4d82.html" title="OpenNIC">OpenNIC</a>. --<a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndigoGenius_daff.html" title="User:IndigoGenius">IndigoGenius</a> 15:33, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Wow, what a tirade - not exactly a way to gain sympathy or credibility in the eyes of the people who have - or haven't - voted on the AfD. A few things for your consideration: <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP is not a crystal ball</a> - it's not for storing information about entities that may become notable at some future date. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP is not for advertising</a>. WP is not for pushing agendas. In my view, your comments above <i>support</i> deletion of the articles, because you make it sound like you <i>are</i> using WP for advertising, to make a point, and are claiming future (not current) notability. If this becomes notable on or after July 1, then it'd be fine to have an article. Remember, however, that articles have to have a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>, and <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">you don't own the article</a> or control what changes are made to it; if people make changes you don't like, you basis for objection/changing them has to be because they violate WP criteria, not because it's not what you want to say about the subject. <a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPaddles_deb2.html" title="User:Paddles">Paddles</a> 16:07, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Further Comment</b>. I own the <b>Cesidian Root</b>, in the sense that I have the faith and good will of people working for it, and without profit so far, and I have access to their resources, in the form of servers internationally distributed. I own the operation, the organisation, not even its servers. I don't own true information about the Cesidian Root either. Newspapers, publishers own that, or they pretend to by charging a price for it. The Cesidian Root not only hasn't made a profit so far, but has actually lost money, principally my money. A great deal of money because I'm building more than just an <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_DNS_root_3904.html" title="Alternative DNS root">alternative DNS root</a>. I'm not trying to gain votes here. I'm a King, not a President (although I'm a President elsewhere), someone with responsibilities far beyond what most people can even imagine, and even I'm feeling a little overwhelmed now, and I have no secretary to help, but if the Cesidian Root has to be deleted, then I demand fair and equal treatment, and I have no sense that I'm getting it so far. I see an article about the <a href="../../../o/p/e/OpenNIC_4d82.html" title="OpenNIC">OpenNIC</a> here. We carry each and every one of their TLDs, they are absolutely nothing special, and they didn't even have the decency to reciprocate with us through their service. Does Wikipedia reward parasites, and keep truly decent entities and groups obscure? I don't know. I'm not God, although some people think I said that also. I'm a human being working his butt off to change the world into something better than what it is, and quite frankly any preconceived bias here works against the Wikipedia more than it does against me. You can't stop me, only God can, and he seems to be doing the very opposite. So I don't depend on Wikipedia for fame, although some micronations do. But I demand fair treatment. If <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantium.html" title="Atlantium">Atlantium</a>'s flat is newsworthy, and it is not, then the world's first intermicronational and international organisation, and an Internet more technologically advanced than ICANN's deserves even more space, not deleted articles. If the Cesidian Root deserves to be deleted, then the <a href="../../../o/p/e/OpenNIC_4d82.html" title="OpenNIC">OpenNIC</a> you could live without by just using our root deserves a delete even more. It seems to me you are all continuously judging things you know nothing or little about. At least have the courtesy to judge the information, not me. I'm a human being. Only God, not the Wikipedia, expects me to be perfect. At least do your research, and make a fair assessment of the articles and the information. I'm not seeing that here. All I'm seeing is a call for a delete, because we are not front page news material yet. If that is Wikipedia, then you are just a rebroadcast of already biased news sources. You are not an independent organisation that from time to time sees something positive, and decides to accept it as worthy of an article. Britannica will do the same, but some people think you are better.

And whether Wikipedia Admins help or not, the Root of Jesse's ensign will stand tall, nonetheless (Isaiah 11:10), and the whole thing will fall on top of you like a pile of bricks... Even Kings, and Presidents, and Prime Ministers will stand speechless before him, so you won't be any less stunned, trust me.

<li><b>Comment</b> I've got to agree with the foregoing sentiments. In addition to those who spend their lives educating chilbren or adults (and I'm one of them), I highly value those who have routinely <i>saved</i> the lives of children and adults, people who work as nurses, paramedics, firefighters... all of these people contribute more than their share to our wellbeing yet are pitifully represented not just in WP but anywhere in the media. Not to mention safety inspectors and those who represent neglected or abused juveniles. The list could go on, I suppose, yet I guess none of them are as "interesting" as a cartoon character.

<li><b>keep</b> not only is this not a hoax. or urban legend (I have seen competitions televised a couple of times on the bbc). but it does not originate from a 1995 article in harpers magazine. the first time I saw ferret legging was in the mid sixties. Sadly wikipedia in its reliance on google for references is unlikely to find any much before the nineties, because even the BBC didnt get its online act together much before the end of that decade. this is an activity that is pretty much limited to rural shows and fetes as such it probably wont ever be authoritatively documented. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidParfitt_fb4e.html" title="User:DavidParfitt">DavidP</a></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> This is an english wiki, perhaps these translations can be put on other language wiki's and then interwiki linked.

<li><b>Delete</b>, weakly. I created the article from material removed from <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hail_Mary_fc9e.html" title="Hail Mary">Hail Mary</a> mostly so that this discussion could happen before deleting it. It makes sense to have the English and the Latin versions in that article, but it snowballed from there, I guess. I do find it interesting, though. --<a href="../../../k/b/h/User%7EKbh3rd_5810.html" title="User:Kbh3rd">Kbh3<sup>rd</sup></a><a href="../../../k/b/h/User_talk%7EKbh3rd_3576.html" title="User talk:Kbh3rd"><font style="font-size:.7em;">talk</font></a> 23:04, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> strongly. I didn't realise the Lord's prayer article existed: that should be deleted as well. Simply put, if you want the Hail Mary in a different language,go to that relevant wiki. Hail Mary itself isn't English, so it can't be difficult to find. I may be an inclusionist, but there are limits. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> 17:24, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Simply put, the relevant wiki might not have been started yet, and even if the Wiki has, the relevant article might not have been started. The information should be kept on some Wikimedia project. We should identify the project before deleting the article. <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 00:58, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think you will find that all the languages that are on the page have their own wikipedias.

<li><b>Delete</b> most, <b>Keep</b> Cosmic Consciousness which is a perfectly good term having nothing necessarily to do with 'transcendental meditation'. It was coined, or at least extensively used as early as 1905 by a Canadian doctor, Richard Maurice Bucke, in his book <i>Cosmic Consciousness: A Study in the Evolution of the Human Mind</i> which was republished in 1942 and is currently still in print. Over the years those who I have met who have read the book consider the topic quite notable, although the current article does not really address anything.

<li><b>Delete</b> I would vote speedy delete, but I think claiming that your own band (the article is, of course, vanity) is "up-and-coming" <i>technically</i> is an assertion of notability, although I would argue that.

<li><b>Strongest possible keep and complete rewrite</b> Obviously, as this article stands now, it's a mess (although obviously written by one of his students, which is very sweet). However, the last phrase (which I'm typing correctly) is that he was a "silver medalist rower." This is true. A quick Google search of "Allan Whitwell" shows that said claim is true- <b>THIS MAN WAS AN OLYMPIC SILVER MEDALIST</b>. In fact, he's even listed at <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_at_the_1980_Summer_Olympics_2273.html" title="Great Britain at the 1980 Summer Olympics">Great Britain at the 1980 Summer Olympics</a>. Thus, Allan Whitwell obviously deserves an article; if not enough information can be found about him, then <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allan_Whitwell_ca90.html" title="Allan Whitwell">Allan Whitwell</a> should be a redirect to the above Olympics article.

<p>It is not vanity to survive 13 years in the peruvian market, it is history. Probably it is non-notable for the companies in the first world, but in Peru this is truly hard.

<li><b>Comment for Czevallos</b> First, first-person words such as "our" should be deleted <i>at all costs</i>. If an article has "our," it's advertising, which is not allowed. In addition, the article needs to be copy edited (for spelling, grammar, and whatnot). Third, and perhaps most importantly, some other external links or references would help. If there are any other sites that show why the company is significant or has given it an award, that would be extremely beneficial to the article (even if that web page is not in English). -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 18:18, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> software should be easy to find google hits for. A search for all of "PROFIT", "Tradewiz", and "technical analysis" found 11 unique google hits. Two of these 11 were on the company's site. That site does not have enough traffic for Siteadvisor to have bothered testing whether it is a good or spammy site. None of the remainders are <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. In addition to a lack of claim to notability, this is clearly not notable. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 00:25, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Just a wikipedia user comment. I was reading your text about technical analysis recently and ended up here. It seems hard to me to define a cut off criteria for a product to be kept or dropped from the pages without risking some appearance of favoritism. I can understand the idea of listing the most popular or a standard, but once other competitors are included, where the acceptability line is crossed can, at times, become fuzzy. I wonder, as a lay person, even about the legality (loosely applied) of such “endorsements” vs. rejections, on a public resource like wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my mind, either all but the “standard” are removed or simple references to available products are allowed to stay. As long as they are not long advertisements, with lists of features and blatant spamming language. If anybody is interested, they can always go and look for more information at the vendor's site.</p>
<p>I realize it’s a thin line between being an encyclopedia and a vendors catalog; still, coming to think of it, having a list of available software associated with a topic is a good complementary service to readers. And standards are usually expensive, so not all users are looking for them.</p>
<p>Again, just some food for though...Keep up the good work! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 12.208.110.77 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_12.208.110.77_1506.html" title="Special:Contributions/12.208.110.77">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd><b>Reply</b> If I have misunderstood the standards then my comment to that effect should not apply although the album itself does not appear to be notable in any way. I've been puzzled as to why inconsequential albums show up with their own pages when their rather inconesquential performers have bare bones coverage. Can you direct me to the page that expresses this preference? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAnde_B._3091.html" title="User:Ande B.">Ande B</a> 23:09, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not sure if there's a page that expresses the preference, it simply is the common practice, and one I personally see no reason to abandon here. The infoboxes on album pages alone contain a worthwhile chronology on the bottom that would be broken up by adding it to the band page, for example. There's certainly plenty we can do to expand <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helstar.html" title="Helstar">Helstar</a> without resorting to removing otherwise decent and useful stubs. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28memes%29_35a0.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (memes)">WP:MEMES?</a>)</small> 23:12, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

I know that this isn't policy, but <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Music_dac7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Music">Wikipedia:WikiProject Music</a> states that albums should get their own page.

<li><b>Keep</b> Although the article on Helstar is indeed woefully small, I don't think that invalidates the usefulness of the album article. It should be renamed, though, to <a href="../../../n/o/s/Nosferatu_%28Helstar_album%29_0cdb.html" title="Nosferatu (Helstar album)">Nosferatu (Helstar album)</a> as <a href="../../../n/o/s/Nosferatu_%28album%29.html" title="Nosferatu (album)">Nosferatu (album)</a> is already taken. And it looks like we need to create a disambiguation page for Nosferatu in general. GentlemanGhost 06:58, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I believe we inherited this from an old encyclopedia--possibly the 1911 Brittanica. It seems to be merely a collection of four largely unrelated anatomists who worked or studied in Alexandria at times centuries apart. <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandrian_school.html" title="Alexandrian school">Alexandrian school</a> is a common term, which is probably what led to this title, but that isn't what this article is about, and I can't find any examples online or in print of this term being used elsewhere. Galen and Herophilus have articles already, and I created articles for Rufus and Oribasius. Since the useful content is elsewhere already, and this article appears to be nothing more than an accidental collection (not to mention being a mess of florid and biased turn-of-the-century writing), I propose we get rid of this. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobth_3967.html" title="User:Robth">Robth</a><sup><a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobth_e82d.html" title="User talk:Robth">Talk</a></sup> 00:00, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Pure speculation. Other than a teaser trailer at E3, EA and Maxis have made NO statements even confirming any of this. The only statement from the PR department was that the expansion pack was not announced at E3 and it will be announced sometime after E3. The article contains nothing but guesses and has absolutely nothing credible on which to base itself. Which unfortunately doesn't seem to fit speedy deletion policy. Until such a time that Maxis confirms or denies an expansion pack this should be removed. Its also unlikely that even if they go with a pet theme that it will be called this. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 00:32, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>: This is an alledged expansion pack, and the article states that. However, we know that something <i>is</i> coming, so even if it isn't an expansion, but something more random (even though it blatantly is an expansion), then the article can be adapted. I don't think it should be deleted because it would only come back in a matter of days, so there is no point in doing that.
