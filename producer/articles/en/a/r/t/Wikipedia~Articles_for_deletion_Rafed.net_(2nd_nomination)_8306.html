<p><a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> states the following: Web-specific content[3] is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself. This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper and magazine articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations.</li>
</ol>
<p>In other words, if <b>Rafed.net</b> is the subject of more than one (1) non-trivial (2) published works (3) whose source is independent, then the site is notable per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. It clarifies that this includes <b>published works in all forms</b>, without giving restrictions. It does not demand that the other sources need to be (a) Notable (b) reliable or (c) neutral. This is indeed when writing an article, but not to establish notability of Rafed.net, all according to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.</p>
<p>As an example of this, i present <a href="../../../f/a/i/Faith_Freedom_International_34d4.html" title="Faith Freedom International">Faith Freedom International</a>, an anti-Islamic website created by Ali Sina. It has underwent <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Faith_Freedom_af74.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Faith Freedom">an afd</a> were it was deleted, but then it was recreated and underwent <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Faith_Freedom_International_b670.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Faith Freedom International">a second afd</a>. The result was no consensus. After all this process, <a href="../../../f/a/i/Faith_Freedom_International_34d4.html" title="Faith Freedom International">the main article</a> does not present one single (b) reliable source or (c) neutral source, in accordance to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.</p>
<p>As for this site:</p>

<li>Daniel Heradstveit, Helge Hveem in his published book <b>Oil in the Gulf: Obstacles to Democracy and Development</b> writes regarding <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Ayatollah_Ali_al-Sistani_7933.html" title="Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani">Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani</a>: <i>"several Iran-based internet sites, such as www.Rafed.Net, contribute to spread sistanis scholarship and legal opinions"</i> <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0754639681&amp;id=uOAkbzCwxvwC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;lpg=PA140&amp;ots=yR7puZl9cK&amp;dq=Rafed.net&amp;sig=W_LAn1y2uc7RyLePcwExWQsbLmQ#PPA140,M1" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0754639681&amp;id=uOAkbzCwxvwC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;lpg=PA140&amp;ots=yR7puZl9cK&amp;dq=Rafed.net&amp;sig=W_LAn1y2uc7RyLePcwExWQsbLmQ#PPA140,M1" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a published book using Rafed.net as a prime example of sites that spread Sistanis scholarship. Now, for those who do not know, Sistani could arguably be said to be the main leader of Shi'as around the entire world, following his equally well known teacher <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Ayatollah_Abul-Qassim_Khoei_f2e9.html" title="Grand Ayatollah Abul-Qassim Khoei">Grand Ayatollah Abul-Qassim Khoei</a>.</p>

Rafed.net, based in Qom, and other such sites, report that 45% of their traffic comes from the Kingdom. These sites are apparently banned, but the owners switch domain names often and users have developed techniques to get around the Saudi censor."</i> <a href="http://www.tau.ac.il/dayancenter/Teitelbaum.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tau.ac.il/dayancenter/Teitelbaum.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I would like to point out that Iran is specifically writing this site in Arabic, a foreign language to Iranians, in order to target Shi'as in Saudi Arabia! <a href="../../../q/o/m/Qom.html" title="Qom">Qom</a>, were the site based on, is the main Shi'a center for scholarship in the entire world and has a long history as such, back to 1503 CE, having a Islamic history back to 7th century.</p>

Now, this should not come as a surprise considering that the main audience of the site are arabs, easly seen by the fact that the opening page of <a href="http://rafed.net/" class="external free" title="http://rafed.net/" rel="nofollow">http://rafed.net/</a> is in Arabic.</p>

Now, after all this, if you still do not feel that <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is meet, i would like to remind that it is a guideline designed to establish notability, it is not law. In the end, you are free to use it as a guideline.</p>
<p>Now, considering that it has been mentioned as an example by (a) multiple scholars from universities and also by (b) two published books, (c) that it is baned in one country, (d) that the ban is discuses and that even though it is baned there, (e) it gets 40% of its traffic from there, (f) considering that it is affiliated with Sistani, the Shi'a leader with most influence in Iraq and the world and that Sistani reviews it on his own site, (g) and that it outrivals all other Shi'a sites except sistanis own site and the Iranian official site, can you with good conscience state that this site is non-notable? Does it hurt wikipedia do represent this site, with all this infomation, or does it become more informative internet site?</p>
<p>Also, the site is mainly in Arabic, and i could not do a better job proving its notability and presenting full reviews in Arabic, since i do not know Arabic. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> - <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStriver_9f65.html" title="User talk:Striver">talk</a> 03:02, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I dont understand. First you argue that FFI has a <i>better</i> relibale source, then you note that Rafed.Net is also included in <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/filtering/saudiarabia/SA-F.html" class="external text" title="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/filtering/saudiarabia/SA-F.html" rel="nofollow">that source</a>. How is the FFI a better source, if Rafed.Net shares the same source? I was not aware of the source, so thank you for presenting it. Now, you just characterized the <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/filtering/saudiarabia/SA-F.html" class="external text" title="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/filtering/saudiarabia/SA-F.html" rel="nofollow">law.harvard.edu</a> as a RS.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I don't think you can argue that the quotes in books are "non-trivial"; they give a passing mention to one of a number of sites they are describing. The Alexa and Google rankings are immaterial - as I've said before, popularity is not equal to notability. It's harder for me to judge the seestani.com review, but I'm worried by both its independence and reliability. You say that "close relations and being allies" isn't the same as dependence and that might be true, but it certainly does not encourage <i>in</i>dependence. You also say that reliability is not an issue (interestingly the primary notability criterion on <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> recently had reliability added to it) but I can't agree with that. By that logic, if <i>I</i> reviewed a website and posted it to my personal blog or homepage, that would qualify as a source - clearly absurd. So I'm still going to support deletion. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 13:33, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Bro, what i find it strange is that people demand notable sources, and when they get that from sistani, the top representative for Shi'a, then it somehow is not good enough. And when the sistani coverage is "too good", then it somehow does not count. Well, even if you consider that the page was owned by sistani, wich it is not, then that fact would make it notable. You seem my point? But in any case, the site is NOT dependant on sistani, and nobody has claimed it is. And by the way, if you wonder why some of those pages has poor layout, consider the state of IT-technology in some of those countries, for example, Iran only has pre-paid dial up internet, from what i have gathered. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> - <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStriver_9f65.html" title="User talk:Striver">talk</a> 20:09, 8 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm not bothered about the poor layout, it's the relationship between the sites that worries me. It isn't black or white whether something is dependent or independent (in my opinion), it's more of a sliding scale, and being closely related would tend towards the former. Would the comments about the website be objective? Doubtful I think, they'd surely be influenced by the relationship and shared ideals. To clarify, I don't think this deletion is clear-cut one way or the other, and you've done an excellent job arguing the case for keeping it. I still feel, though, that the articles will have length and sourcing issues, and will tend towards merely a directory entry. This looks like it'll end as "no consensus" anyway, so it probably won't matter. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 20:48, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
