<p>Already 45 kilobytes and growing. Someone put a lot of work into this, and it pains me to nominate it for deletion, but I fail to see the need for this list.

<dd>The redundancy is not merely "some", but total. Do you really mean we should list all educators even though the term "educator" is ambiguous? Consider that the number of educators include Academics (PHDs and Professors), lecturers, primary school teachers, kindergarten and preschool teachers, and various other other disciplines all over the world. They are all educators, that is why we have <a href="../../../e/d/u/Category%7EEducators_39b2.html" title="Category:Educators">Category:Educators</a>.--<a href="../../../e/z/e/User%7EEzeu_f517.html" title="User:Ezeu">Ezeu</a> 19:17, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Could you explain why in this case you feel this is a useful complement to a category? except for a few redlinks, I don't see this as exemplifying any of the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories%2C_lists%2C_and_series_boxes_edc0.html#Advantages_of_lists" title="Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and series boxes">advantages of lists</a>, and this seems to have the disadvantages mentioned.

<ul>
<li>Well, the storage of redlinks is one of the purposes of lists, yes, known as the <i>development</i> purpose. The list also provides for navigation and groups things together in a way that provides information. In essence, it serves a number of purposes, some of which can't be served by categories (i.e. development) and there's no real reason to delete beyond <i>I don't like lists</i> presented here at all. It's verifiable, encyclopaedic (and actually a half decent article). <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:00, 13 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Having read the material, I believe understand the theoretical advantages. However, in this specific case, I don't see them as applying in a substantial way. Do you have reasons why this specific list is practically more useful to a degree that outweighs the additional maintenance burden over categories? I have the impression this is more a general thing for you. Thanks, <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 19:06, 13 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I generally defend verifiable, encyclopaedic lists at AfD - I have no real specific attachment to this list. As for <i>the Burden of Maintenance" it's obvious to me that someone has taken that burden upon themselves, thus for the Wikipedia project as a whole, it's essentially zero maintenance. The list and category aren't redundant, so the existence of one doesn't argue for the deletion of the other, the category can exist in parallel, and do well what it does well, and poorly what it does poorly. To delete this when its in good shape just because</i> Well, one day it could become a problem <i>seems unconvincing. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 20:42, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</i></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as per nom. Good effort, but the page seems to replicate what category pages already do better. Visually, this page is much less user-friendly than the category pages. You could sort the names in a more spatially understandable way, but you'd probably just end up with something like a whole bunch of category pages stuck together. The only advantage I can think of is that you could do a name find across all the educator names on the same page, but sincec wikipedia already has a search engine this is redundant. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 01:32, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hi. As you can see from my (unanswered) question to you above, I gave more than a cursory glance, and am not yet seeing the mysteries you allude to. If you have an actual argument, please make it.

<li>I'm not really interested in pressuring participants - the point of responding to presented arguments is so that the closing admin will realise they're faulty - part of the concensus procedure. Transparently false arguments (such as lists being replacable by categories) need to be recognised as the fallacy they are and called on it.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Lists are useful when the set of items to be listed is strictly limited, and when there's some value in listing them even if they don't have an article. Neither of these appears to be the case here - as others have pointed out, there are a <i>lot</i> of preschool teachers in the US. Categories appear to be the superior solution here, especially as nearly all of the educators listed already have articles. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 03:59, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Lists with such broad subjects are almost entirely pointless, and have no place here. As <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">User:Zetawoof</a> said, lists should only be used with a reasonably limited set of items. "Educators" is a humongous category of people; there are tons of them around the world and throughout history that are not, and never will be, included in this list. There is no point in having such a list here, unless we plan on becoming a <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_pages.html" title="White pages">White pages</a> directory someday. Groupings like this are best left to the Category system. <i><b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">Warpstar</a></b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarpstarRider_25fe.html" title="User talk:WarpstarRider">Rider</a></i> 09:00, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Useful list, for all the reasons lists are ordinarily useful. Despite the claims that this is identical to the category, it's obviously not, based on the most cursory of inspections. No category presents all these names on one page for simple browsing; no category includes the redlinks that might tempt someone to develop an article. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 00:32, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>The issue for me is not utility alone, but the maintenance burden versus utility. Could you point us to some other very large list pages that you find useful and are well maintained? Thanks, <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 01:22, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure what you mean by the maintenance burden--how is it greater for this page than any other? Anyway, there are tons of large useful list pages, see e.g. List of anarchists or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_atheists.html" title="List of atheists">List of atheists</a> just from the A's. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 02:17, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Category pages are automatically maintained, while lists are manual; that seems like more work to me, especially if the categories already exist. Maybe I'm underestimating the number of anarchists or atheists out there, but those lists seem much smaller in scope than the domain carved out by a list of educators from <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socrates.html" title="Socrates">Socrates</a> to <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbie.html" title="Barbie">Barbie</a> (Teacher Barbie, I presume). I guess I'm still not seeing the potential for this article to be a gem. Thanks for the response, though; it was helpful to hear your perspective on lists. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 07:32, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The maintenance difference is overplayed; articles have to be added manually to both types, both have a page that needs to be kept free of vandalism, and both need to be watched for false entries. The last point is actually infinitely harder with a category since movement of articles in and out of a category cannot be watched, so far as I understand. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 13:35, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Interesting. I guess it seems like twice as much work to me then to maintain both. The watching of categories, though, is a great point, and one I hadn't considered.
