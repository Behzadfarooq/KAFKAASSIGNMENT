<ul>
<li>The FYC example is just a phrase that's repeated in the chorous, without any humor, and without particular emphasis (in that it seems to be more of a stand-in for "girl" than anything). The point is not to pick out any memorable chorous line, the point is to explain how These Four Phrases are notable in and of themselves, beyond what normal emphasis/italics or hints of irony can do to <i>any</i> phrase. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 16:35, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>My second sentence about FYC was a semi-joke, not related to the first sentence. I've seen them used in non-FYC contexts: they are certainly no longer tightly tied to 1066. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 18:58, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

In <a href="../../../1/0/6/1066_and_all_that.html" title="1066 and all that">1066 and all that</a>, a <a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_Thing_f477.html" title="Good Thing">Good Thing</a> is something of <i>historical</i> importance that is regarded favourably - with a clear bias.

<li><b>Neutral</b>. I'm undecided on this one. I got 350 Google results for "<i>yart yard art</i>" (yart has a few other obscure meanings as well, so I had to specify somehow). That seems low, but the subject matter of the article is at least minimally notable. Perhaps move it to Yard art with a redirect from Yart?

<dd>You have no idea what you are talking about. He wrote about a quarter of the new, and completely revised, edition. Plus he has been published multiple times in periodicals with a circulation of 5,000 or more (TPJ was 10,000). Plus, he is writing a third or more of Intermediate Perl (which will surely have a circulation of well over 5,000), and the new edition of Mastering Perl (ditto).

A service fraternity is different from a social club fraternity: the main purpose of this type of group is to do charitable work in the community. Nine chapters in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic makes it sufficiently large and stable. What makes this a weak keep instead of a regular keep is the lack of citations. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 05:15, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

It's a little confusing, but either way, I don't think the results are representative of the specific fraternity in question. I'm voting Weak Delete because I can't see any notability here. If the article adds some cited charitable work on a scale larger than "Car Wash" and "Candy Sale", then maybe. Otherwise, its only remote claim to notability is longevity. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 14:30, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Guys this is my first time making a internet page. I really dont now what exactly you want but just to clear things up. We are a Latin Faternity in a Little Island called Puerto Rico. In PR all fraternities are recuired to do things both charitable and social. All PR fratrnities and sororities are diffrent from the states yet we are recognized by the our and your goverment. When we were founded in 1957 the technology wasn't so advanced nor was the comunication and when we registerd the name Zeta Phi Beta at the time the goverment was required to look in PR registry only to see if anyone else had the name. Since no one else had it they registered it. Later we found out that Zeta Phi Beta was a Black sorority in the US. Years ago we met and decided that it was no ones fault and we could both keep the name since all was done acording to the law. i went to NY and met 2 sisters and they were more than happy to meet me and we hit it off pretty well. About our charities; all the money we get from selling candy, washing cars, etc... we donate to diffrent organizations for example: Cancer, Red Cross, Batterd Wifes, Youth in Trouble, Schools, Children of CREA (children of parents who are in prison), etc... One experience i personally had was my mother and Grandmother needed blood for diffrent operations, since i can't donate blood cuz of a tatoo i got when i was a frechman all my brother got togther and helped me out. Currently we have a few brothers who are making a websites so i can't give you one but as the "vanity" article reads; you can cantact me to clarify any doubts. you can alo contact the universities listed so they can varify any info. Currently the Politechnic Univ. and UPR - Mayaguez and Bayamon Campuses have Profesors that are fratbrothers. I really don't now what proof you need but i'm shure we can come up with something.

<li><b>Comment</b> — The reason that I listed Zeta Phi Beta 1957 up on the AFD is simply because the fraternity seems non-notable. While your frat donates to respectable charities, we respect that, but it still does no't make your fraternity notable. Perhaps if there were notable alumni who had been a part of the fraternity, but even then it may be stretching it a little bit. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKareeser_8b5c.html" title="User:Kareeser">Kareeser</a>|<a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKareeser_7817.html" title="User talk:Kareeser"><sup>Talk!</sup></a> 06:15, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Of corse we aren't notable in the states but in PR we are very respected by the community and other fraternities here. Personally i didn't find in the rules established by WikipediA that all fraternities added had to be known by people of the US or been established ther either. I do believe this website is a Free Encyclopedia and can be seen by all around the world and everyone who becomes affiliated with the site can add infromation cuz that is what this is about, contributing information. I could mencion a few names of some important frats but it's more than obviouse that none of you are going to know who the mayor of Carolina is, the singer Julio Cesar Sanabria, Rufino the owner of The New West, Antonio Rios the Head Manager of the Human Resorces Depatment of AEELA, Pujols the director of the Surveying Department of the Politecnic Univ of PR, the list is endless. To us a notable fratbrother isn't someone who is on TV, plays sports, etc... It's someone who through hard work and dedication has made a name of himself by growing profesionally. We've been around now for 49 years i think that makes a huge diffrence in comparison to other frats that only last a few years and then never hear from them again.

<li><b>Keep</b> - he is notable because he came out strongly against Harris and the federal Green's because, he says, they walked away from the Global Green Charter.

<p>So... am I supposed to move it to my own space, like this: Dabljuh/Circumcision/Dabljuhs_version? It started out as a kind of sandbox to allow constructive editing of the <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumcision.html" title="Circumcision">Circumcision</a> article as a whole, without every tiny change being immediately reverted by POV warriors. Since most of the article is now in the main article, I don't think it is really necessary anymore. What's interesting however is that you didn't AfD <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumcision_Old_version_0a8c.html" title="Circumcision/Old version">Circumcision/Old_version</a> as well, despite both of them almost always being linked to at the same time for comparison. Dabljuh 08:11, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Move'</b> to User:Dabljuh/Circumcision or somesuch. "Old version" wasn't as important to AfD because its name implies that it was consensus building version. Yours is exclusively yours. User specific versions don't belong in the article space whereas community rewrites and old versions arguably do for a period of time. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/i/m/Wikipedia%7ELimited_administrators_6c2e.html" title="Wikipedia:Limited administrators">?</a></sup> 17:08, 27 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're an idiot. Seriously. A consensus version? vs MY version? Don't talk about things that you don't know the first thing about. I've done a 'rewrite' in the main space to invite other users to help overhauling the article, a community effort so to speak, and the old version wasn't as much a consensus version as it was a POV piece forced to stay in place by a small troupe of POV pushers. The current mainspace version is a slightly edited variant of my version, should give you an Idea about what version is POV.</li>
<li>Anyhow, I don't see much sense in keeping either version around, the Old version can be viewed in the main article's history, and my version makes up 90% of the main article now. Dabljuh 11:44, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Heh. I confess to being geeky enough area codes do interest me. And, actually, there is an argument to be made that the subject is encyclopedic. There's actually an astounding amount time, effort, planning, and technology behind the scenes to make the system work so that it <i>does</i> seem like a trivial subject. And I could see some kid (like I did) wondering why we have a 212 on the East Coast, a 213 on the West, and a 214 in Texas and ending up doing a paper on NANP (which I couldn't have done as there was no easy reference at the time as to what on Earth was going on with those silly numbers &lt;G&gt;). <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkkbilbo_8d0f.html" title="User:Markkbilbo">Mark K.

<li>I don't understand why there's any objection to a merge. If it's neutral to have some kind of "balance" of information in the main article, fine. If it's neutral to have criticism predominate, fine. But this can and should all be done in the main article. It sounds from what I read above that this article was broken off precisely to <i>sidestep</i> reaching consensus on neutrality, by letting each of two sets of editors go their separate ways. <b>That's a POV fork.</b> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 02:49, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep or Merge</b>: eBaumsworld is a widely controversial topic on the internet. Particularly on large internet media sites such as YTMND, SA, Newgrounds and even 4chan. The community of these websites and their forums have taken a general consensus of mild despisal of eBaum's practices since eBaums conducted their first DDoS attacks on SA and even mildly before. When the flash animation&#160;: <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/276616" class="external text" title="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/276616" rel="nofollow">eBaums world dot com</a> appeared on newgrounds on Nov. 6th 2005 the controversy really flew off. Much of the content being hosted on eBaums was seen as stolen and posted up by the forum members of eBaums, which was then considered by the consensus of eBaums as freely available and held a philosophy of a copyright free internet, where the content could be taken, profited from and used on any website in the internet. Particularly eBaums. This article is incredibly important to the understanding of how much eBaums is despised by a large portion of the internet population. To say that their despisal is inexistant is wholly untrue. This article is incredibly important whether it be seperate or merged with the original, since I hold a stance against eBaums I won't edit the controversies page, but I do however think that it's incredibly important that this page exists.--<a href="../../../m/o/f/User%7EMofomojo_6e0e.html" title="User:Mofomojo">Mofomojo</a> 10:17, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>But here's the problem. What makes common misconceptions encyclopedic? I am not saying that the information is not worthwhile somewhere but what is the judge of what is a common misconception? How do we make this encyclopedic. Think of an article like Common misconceptions about Islam... it's just not an encyclopedic tone coming from that angle. The way it is discussed now makes this an FAQ. How can we make it an encyclopedia article with flowing prose and not a question by question basis? <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/i/m/Wikipedia%7ELimited_administrators_6c2e.html" title="Wikipedia:Limited administrators">?</a></sup> 17:04, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>There are ways to assess how common misconceptions are: one looks at the literature created by health educators, who document misconceptions in order to figure out how to combat them. Similarly the misconceptions are important because of their role in public health. I don't like the way the article is organised at present, but I don't think the article is a POV magnet in the way that a "Common misconceptions about (religion)" would be.

<dd>Note: I think it would be good to explain the problems specifically with this article as well. The speech is a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> problem, and possible copyvio (the author is still alive and writing for <i>Freemasonry Today</i>), and on top of that, it is out of context in this article. The speculative etymology (second section) is by its nature speculative and not fact. Thus it is inappropriate for an encyclopedia article. The third section is quotations, which are also speculative in nature, as these are guesses on word origins from individuals not trained in linguistics. So what's left to have an article on? <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 19:46, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>cleanup</b>. The claim that Freemasons use the word "Jahbulon" or "Jabulon" as the name of a deity, and discussions about its possible etymology, seem to be attested outside of Wikipedia; Google searches confirm this.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>Band certainly exists and has following. This group has been referred to in respectable Australian print media.

Also lack of information by author does not constitute falsity or informational worthlessness of article.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Put simply, I have found no way to even find if they've recorded a single original song or if they've ever played even at a bar somewhere.

I've successfully nominated bands for deletion that have had working home pages (this band's is apparently under construction and shows no info) and even small fan sites and a clear verifiable underground following. This band appears to have none of those so how can we justify deleting them while not deleting this one?

<p>This quote merely states that with any active recording musical group today, demos and CD's have been released, and that, as would be expected "rehearsal and jam session" recordings exist but are "difficult to obtain". This merely hints at the collectabilty of these recordings which the author probably should have described as "bootlegs" for clarity. Rarity of material, or limited pressings once again have nothing to do with supporting a claim for non-notability" in themselves, as even the Beatles, for example, could fit the above criterea. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 203.134.135.20 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.134.135.20_9275.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.134.135.20">contribs</a>) 18:42, 27 January 2006.</small></small></p>

<li>The prejudice you refer to is based on the fact that there's no mention of any legitimate full-length releases. Therefore, the references to "rehearsal and jam session" recordings sound like a poor attempt at asserting notability. As you said, every artist has rehearsal and jam session recordings - only you never hear about them because their legitimate work makes that unnecessary. If you removed the rehearsal and jam session recordings from this article - since they're not present for other musicians - you'd have almost nothing. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 19:52, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>What does the above author mean by "legitimate"? The use of this term is unclarified. There is no evidence in the article in question that suggests that the band's canon is either released illegaly, or that it is performed and recorded by a group other thatn themselves. These would be the only senses in which "illegitimate" could make any sense. Furthermore, this author seems to show evidence of some ignorance regarding the nature of bootleg recordings. These are in fact, HIGHLY collectable, revealing the artists in a "purer" and not "over-produced" form. Official releases do not diminish their collectability; in fact widespread commercial success and can often enhance public desire to obtain these recordings. It is suggested that the above author utilise the search function in a music related peer-to-peer network to research this phenomenon for him or herself. Finally, an article writer that was engaging in a "poor attempt" to assert verifibility would surely not mention these kinds of recordings - as is evidenced by the above commenter's reaction and attitude towards them. I presume the original writer included them because of their value to fans of the band and bootleg collectors. FInally, as mentioned above, this band seems to be a rare representative of a style of music that would be largely or wholly lost by Wikipedia if the article in question was prematurely deleted. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 210.50.36.15 (<a href="../../../2/1/0/User_talk%7E210.50.36.15.html" title="User talk:210.50.36.15">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_210.50.36.15_a6ed.html" title="Special:Contributions/210.50.36.15">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>, as they seem to be unsigned, are not listed on either [www.doom-metal.com] or [www.metal-archives.com] (and bands that have been listed on those sites have been deleted before!), and despite being a doom metal fan, I never heard of this band. They were mentioned in a previous incarnation of the article on <a href="../../../d/o/o/Doom_metal.html" title="Doom metal">doom metal</a> three times, and the three mentions were all contributed by the same guy who initially wrote the article on Darkage. Looks like vanity to me. Someone here claimed that they were cited on websites and in print press, but such a claim should at least be backed up with references... Moreover, the claim 'only Wikipedia representative of psychedelic doom style' by one of the anons here is nonsense: <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_Wizard_a23a.html" title="Electric Wizard">Electric Wizard</a> are a well-known band (by doom metal standards, at least) playing this style. <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJoost_f177.html" title="User:Joost">Joost</a> 11:10, 30 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Keep - above comment re: <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_Wizard_a23a.html" title="Electric Wizard">Electric Wizard</a> is NOT factual; a perusal of this band's article will reveal that the term "psychedelic doom" is not used once, and furthermore that the even more general designation of "psychedelic" does NOT appear at all on the page. An examination of Wikipedia indicates that "psychedelic doom" is essentially associated with <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darkage.html" title="Darkage">Darkage</a>. A general check on the internet (with sensible search keywords) will predominantly direct browsers to this band. Users who are ignorant about the history and current state of Heavy Metal, and of music in general, will obviously tend to fail to use appropriate keywords when ustilising search engines to validate this (and similar) articles on Wikipedia. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 203.134.135.11 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.134.135.11_179b.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.134.135.11">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> As stated frequently above (even by those voting to delete) this band has a following, especially in Australia / New Zealand. Perhaps the influence of this band is somewhat regional, but it would be inappropriate to judge the value of Wikipedia articles with a pro USA / European bias - this is surely against the universal ethos of Wikipedia. I personaly doubt that the article in question would be attracting as much pro-delete commentary if the artists in question were American; Print media is obviously more difficult to obtain and reference in isolated and lower population regions such as Australia. (The USA has approximatly 1000% the population of Australia for example, and New zealand is even samller). It seems unfair and discriminatory that users in smaller countries are deprived of information that is important to them, and that therefore, by extension, ought to be seen as valuable by the wider global community. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 203.134.135.11 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.134.135.11_179b.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.134.135.11">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>. Plenty of Google hits; you can buy their album from Amazon.com; record label seems legit enough.

<li>No. Because deletion means the article disappears, keeping with plans to rewrite means a necessary article stays.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Being badly written and needing cleanup isn't an appropriate ground for deletion. Otherwise Wikipedia would be down to a few thousand articles. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 14:49, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reply</b> Badly written content is one thing, inappropriate content (e.g. an OR book review) is something different. To <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a>: deletion means the poor article disappears. It does <i>not</i> preclude a better article with the same title and decent content being created at a later point in time. <a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid">Zunaid</a> 15:20, 30 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>if the article isn't there, some people might not even bother cleaning it up. I'd never think of creating this article, but I can do what I can to clean it up. If you delete it, there's nothing there anymore. Poof. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small>(<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_Meme_3185.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff/Meme">WP:MEME?</a>)</small> 15:22, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><s>Point taken. However I still feel my point - that too many articles survive AfD because of some future promised rewrite - is valid. Anyway, I'm off, will check back tomorrow to see what's transpired in the meantime. <a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid">Zunaid</a> 15:33, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</s></li>
<li>Actually, the point you make has a <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_fallacy.html" title="Logical fallacy">logical fallacy</a>: even if a page gets deleted, the fact that it went through AfD means it existed for at last 5 days and will have been read by at least 10 pairs of eyes, including keep voters. That's long enough for someone to clean it up. Anyone who feels strongly enough could always make a copy in their user space and clean the heck out of it and resubmit the better article at a future point, even if it were to be deleted. <a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid">Zunaid</a> 12:33, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The original content wasn't a book review, it was a summary (rather lousy) with some NOR/NPOV-violating commentary. If that was a deletion criterion, about 80% of the pop music album articles would be deleted. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 15:34, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>French-language website with no particular claim to fame. Added here by one of its main contributors, who keeps opposing the deletion procedure on the french-language wikipedia with the question “Why should we delete it when it's ok on en&#160;?”. So I thought I ask you what you think…</p>

<p>Please, do not consider the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fr:Wikip%C3%A9dia:Pages_%C3%A0_supprimer/Wikiberal" class="extiw" title="w:fr:Wikipédia:Pages_à_supprimer/Wikiberal">french voting results</a> about this article&#160;!<br /></p>
<p>Deleting this article <i>«&#160;because it lacks <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a> in an encyclopedia in english&#160;»</i> is a good reason, but keep in mind that this is not true in a french ones, which doesn't improve this article being considered for deletion in french wikipedia too...<br /></p>
<p>First of all, I'd like to say that I'm <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fr:apolitique" class="extiw" title="w:fr:apolitique">apolitique</a></i> (I'm sorry, but I don't know the english word for this french ones: it means I'm not affiliated to any kind of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_party.html" title="Political party">political party</a> or political tendency, and that I'm not a <a href="../../../m/i/l/Militant.html" title="Militant">militant</a>).<br /></p>
<p>One of the reasons this article is being considered for deletion in french wikipedia is that there are persistant <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutral_point_of_view.html" title="Neutral point of view">Neutral point of view</a> problems about political subjects here (yes, as you <s>probably</s>surely noticed, I'm french: my english can't lie&#160;;-) ).</p>
<p>On one hand, articles on <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://fr.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">fr.wikipedia.org</a> dealing with <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">Communism</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">Anarchism</a> or anything dealing with the <a href="../../../l/e/f/Left-wing_politics.html" title="Left-wing politics">left wing</a> are widely approved and encensed, while bad things about them are silenced, or unsaid.</p>
<p>On the other hand, those dealing with <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberalism.html" title="Liberalism">liberalism</a> or anything dealing with the <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right-wing_politics.html" title="Right-wing politics">right wing</a> are frequently subject of a sort of persistent <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denigrate.html" title="Denigrate">denigration</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">vandalism</a>.<br /></p>
<p>Ok, I'm a bit exagerating, but that is mainly true. So, this is the reason why you shouldn't consider the french voting result about this article, and vote considering the notability in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org</a>.</p>

<p>For the record&#160;: there are indeed serious problems with articles about communism on the french wikipedia. Sadly for the people who accuse me of listing Wikiberal for deletion because of my personal political bias, I'm actively dealing with these problems right now (see <a href="../../../../fr/h/i/s/Histoire_du_capitalisme.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Histoire_du_capitalisme">fr:Histoire du capitalisme</a> and the associated pages). This thing about bias and POV on fr is just one big straw man argument used by a bunch of people not willing to acknowledge that this website is clearly non-notable. Incidentally a number of them suddenly re-activated their wikipedia accounts after a post on a forum associated with the website in question. <a href="../../../g/l/_/User%7EGL_0685.html" title="User:GL">GL</a> 10:05, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're misunderstanding POV, I think. An opinion is POV, but the existence of an opinion by an individual is a verifiable fact, and hence NPOV. The same holds for the possession of a belief by a <i>body</i> of people. As long as inclusions on this page are circumscribed by this criterion that "a significane proportion of English speakers will find the name of interest" we have a NPOV page. <a href="../../../s/p/-/User%7ESP-KP_2816.html" title="User:SP-KP">SP-KP</a> 17:02, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>No, I'm not misunderstanding NPOV. What is 'interesting' is ultimately POV. Of course the existence of a opinion as to what is interesting could be a <i>verifiable</i> fact - but that isn't possible here. As to 'a significant body of English speakers will find thisof interest', how do you propose to verify that? If would become an opinion on what a 'significant body' would find intersting - and that again is POV. You could arrive at a consensus - but that is effectively a survey of wikipedians, and would violate <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>.

<dd>Reading the above, I can't understand why you aren't suggesting that virtually <i>everything</i> in Wikipedia is ultimately opinion and should be deleted — we could always find somebody somewhere to disagree with much of what Wikipedia says. To achieve a sensible balance, we have to accept that the Wikipedia editor community will make collective <i>judgments</i> based on their opinions (e.g. it is clearly possible for a collective judgment to be made on the questions you pose above) and that these judgments, whilst POV, result in our best efforts at producing <i>content</i> that is NPOV. I think few editors would agree with you that the Wikipedia editing process is inherently a breach of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, which is in effect what you are saying, if I've understood correctly. In an ideal world, we'd make it clear everywhere that this is they way Wikipedia is edited, but in the real world we have to make compromises (otherwise we'd have article titles like "[[A view arrived at by some volunteer editors who may or may not have been following the proscribed editing process on what material is relevant for a Wikipedia article on the subject of the Battle of Hastings, at this point in time, subject to the possibility that vandalism may have taken place on this article]]") <a href="../../../s/p/-/User%7ESP-KP_2816.html" title="User:SP-KP">SP-KP</a> 20:07, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It seems pretty reasonable to me. The maths looks correct, where it refers to existing technologies it is correct. I see this as reasonable material in an encyclopedia entry.

<dd>Ok, perhaps you can list which facts are unverifiable? When I read through the article it certainly contains lots of statements such as 'other particles are baryons', or 'A nuclear reactor generates 5 times more heat than electricity'. These statements seem quite verifiable to me (by looking at the page on baryons or fission reactor respectively). Are you just asking for each line to have a link to an article that details the fact? This seems quite doable, and a weak reason for deletion.</dd>
<dd>Or, do you mean the general concept of using photons to accelerate a spaceship is unverifiable? Or that we can't build nuclear reactors? I really don't understand what you mean by unverifiable here - we're not talking about introducing some new physics, merely detailing the calculations giving upper limits on a plausible technology.<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENathanHurst_9ea1.html" title="User:NathanHurst">njh</a> 23:44, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Most of what I find comes right back to Wiki <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Nuclear+photonic+rocket&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Nuclear+photonic+rocket&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>. Does it exist? If not, is it a widely accepted theory? If someone can provide legitimate sources and makes a good case for the subject, I might reconsider. <a href="../../../p/j/m/User%7EPJM_3604.html" title="User:PJM">PJM</a> 18:04, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>(Now <b>no vote</b>.) <s><b>Delete</b> as original research</s>, lacking credibility as well as sources. For example, why bother converting the reactor power into electricity (with the attendant reduction in efficiency) if, as the article admits, you can just pipe out the coolant and use the thermal radiation directly? Another point is that at white-hot temperatures the glowing filament (tungsten or graphite) would evaporate and form a blackening deposit on any containment vessel or reflecting surface - which would then reduce the reflectance progressively to zero. Without proper argument and sources this article just doesn't ring true. It also lacks of any mention of the "nuclear photonic" rocket's principal competitor (the <a href="../../../i/o/n/Ion_engine.html" title="Ion engine">ion engine</a>), which is a proven technology. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliggy_825f.html" title="User:Sliggy">Sliggy</a> 18:23, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Not original research; this is an article about blue-sky thought experiments that were popular among physicists and lay readers of science magazines in the 1950's and 1960's. Folks like <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freeman_Dyson_c83a.html" title="Freeman Dyson">Freeman Dyson</a> used to turn these sorts of ideas out by the metric tonne. Agree that article is in dire need of references. -Ikkyu2 21:09, 27 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>An interesting point, but where is the evidence for this interpretation? I agree there were (and are) thought experiments, such the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_sail.html" title="Solar sail">solar sail</a>, <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_thermal_rocket.html" title="Nuclear thermal rocket">nuclear thermal rocket</a> etc.. With references, OK, I could agree that it's an improbable blue-sky idea; without references it is purely and simply <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">something made up at school/college one day</a>. The physics/engineering doesn't make any sense. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliggy_825f.html" title="User:Sliggy">Sliggy</a> 00:20, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, whether it's published somewhere or not isn't dependent on whether this article has appropriate references - i.e., absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence. I agree that the physics seems ridiculous - the thing would have to be hotter than a sun to provide any appreciable propulsion, and then you'd have to attach a spaceship. But other thought experiments, like <a href="../../../p/u/r/Pure_fusion_weapon.html" title="Pure fusion weapon">pure fusion weapon</a> and Dyson's <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_Orion_604a.html" title="Project Orion">Project Orion</a>, do have decent articles. I'd argue for the conservative "Keep" until we have better proof this is a hoax, under <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume good faith</a>.

<dd>I have downloaded the article which is referenced now; my university apparently subscribes to this. If you like, I will mail it to you. Among its assertions are "It should be noted that the development of photon engines for space flights is an old dream of the mankind. This concept was always associated with the nuclear reaction of annihilation or fusion, however its space application has not been invented to date, and in any case it would be very expensive (Lenard et al, 2000)." The Lenard article is cited: Lenard, R.X., and Lipiniski, R.J., "Interstellar rendezvous missions employing fission propulsion systems," in <i>Proceedings of the Space Technology Applications Int'l Forum</i>, 2000. I believe this dispels the concerns about OR; the idea is being talked about at space technology meetings. -Ikkyu2 20:11, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I have no investment in keeping or not keeping this page. It's existence is solely for the purpose of providing further information for the term "pre-verbal insult" mentioned on other mood disorder pages. I was asked independently by two different administrators to aid in the wholesale clean up of all the psych pages. That said, I was under the impression that our collective goal was to provide information. I had assumed I was providing that service. As for the blanking, I did not know that a humble user could not take off a deletion notice. I did not blank the page, I only removed the deletion notice.

<li>May I apologise, I shouldn't have given a {{blanking}} for this. This was a simple error I made, and if I didn't make this error I'd have assumed good faith in the first place.

<li>Further, the call for deletion is uninformed. As noted, the premise of the nominator for deletion is flawed in that s/he is not qualified to question the term, as far as I can tell. I expressed the opinion that this is an exercise of ego on his/her part and I stand by that surmise. Finally, I suggest you take a poll of medical professionals and see who doesn't recognize the term.

<ul>
<li>Robert Scaer, known for his earlier book on somatic trauma "The Body Bears the Burden" puts forth the thesis that trauma covers a spectrum which includes not just dramatic events, such as accidents, abuse and environmental disasters, but also medical interventions, preverbal trauma and intrauterine events, dilemmas in bonding and institutionally or culturally sanctioned traumatic stress. It is the cumulative result of these over the life span which determines the person's adaptation to a particular near-term trauma, such as car accident, robbery, or loss, and this accumulation is literally embodied in the way the brain, nervous system, neuroendocrine system and autonomic pathways are shaped and organized by each traumatic adaptation. Scaer does an especially good job at delineating the medical conditions which arise out of traumatic stress adaptations, and gives trauma a central place in understanding medical practice. He also gathers the emerging understanding of <b>neonatal and preverbal insult</b>, bringing embodied, senori-motoric forms memory into the foreground and helping us see how this is reflected in somatic symptoms, bodily experience and orientation to the world and others. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/j/f/User%7EMjformica_ed24.html" title="User:Mjformica">Mjformica</a> (<a href="../../../m/j/f/User_talk%7EMjformica_0cab.html" title="User talk:Mjformica">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mjformica_4e20.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mjformica">contribs</a>) 18:34. 27 January 2006 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Wikiquette issues aside, as long as Google has no hits for "preverbal insult" and "pre-verbal insult" my vote will probably stay 'Delete'. Just as <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> a slang dictionary, Wikipedia is not a dictionary of terms used only by academics. Basically, this is still a term that a select group of people use instead of "something that upsets a baby". I view the sentence "Typically, this terminology is used by psychoanalytically trained psychiatrists and object relations theorists" the same way as I do "Dis word is used by da <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welney.html" title="Welney">WELNEY KREW</a> holla". Ignoring the wording, both sentences basically say the same thing: "This sentence is used by a single group and no-one else". I.e. slang, albeit posh slang. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Malthusian</a> <small><a href="../../../l/a/s/User_talk%7ELast_Malthusian_5d5c.html" title="User talk:Last Malthusian">(talk)</a></small> 02:31, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

I didn't know each Party had it's candidates page then, but now I put Charette at Bloc Québécois candidates, 2006 Canadian federal election, so his individual page isn't needed. I'll delete the other Hull-Aylmer candidate not notable enough too. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERed_Star_e338.html" title="User:Red Star">Red Star</a> 17:33, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Per <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>, I'm going to ask some admin friends to take a look at this, and see if it can't be made Wikiworthy. I don't know if it can be, but it won't hurt to get some experts to take a look at it. Pending the outcome, I'd like to request we put a hold on this particular AfD. I figure we'll have a consensus on the copyright/Wikiworthy issues in less than 24 hours.

<li>This article as it stands is completely unencyclopedic. A brief article describing the "Math trail", indicating who erected it and why, and what the reactions/results/effects have been, particualrly if it can cite independant media coverage, might be encyclopedic.

<li><b>Wait.</b> Keep this on AfD so I remember to investigate this.

<p>Borderline notable computer programmer and book author. Possible vanity concern.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>. I am nominating the article, but only find it a weak delete. The article is a slight vanity piece, given its creation by the subject (but anyone who knows me knows I don't take <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> as broad dogma). His 1998 book seems to bring it to borderline notability, but unless he has other publications, I think it falls below the threshold.

<dd>The subject of this article apparently has the incorrect belief that my nomination of this article on AfD has something to do with an editing disagreement he and I may have had on an unrelated topic. The merit of an article on Doug Bell is completely unrelated to any editing either he or I may do on Wikipedia; moreover, I urge voters to put the <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> issue in perspective: a subject's notability is not affected by whether they contributed to their (auto)biography; there is merely a heightened concern that the article meet <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> in such cases (IMNSHO).</dd>
<dd>Looking at notability guidelines at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html#People_still_alive" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO#People still alive</a>, the book authorship is an explicit factor recommended in consideration of notability. Job titles as software developer or project lead are not explicitly considered there, though I think someone like <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Tridgell_7958.html" title="Andrew Tridgell">Andrew Tridgell</a> should certainly be considered notable even if he had nothing other than his software development projects (which is still the main focus of his article). While the biography subject may be <i>most proud</i> of things other than book authorship, that does not necessarily mean that readers find those things most notable. That said, as written, I see no <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> concern with the <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doug_Bell_d069.html" title="Doug Bell">Doug Bell</a> article, only a possible notability theshold concern. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 23:28, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For what it's worth, pointing people to the games I developed has nothing to do with what <i>I am most proud of</i>, but rather what I am most well known for. The book sold somewhere between 12,000 to 15,000 copies in the U.S. and the games had combined sales in over a dozen countries of <s>a couple</s> several million units—back when a million units was almost unheard of—so as you can see, there would be a somewhat larger exposure to the games than the book. There are still (amazing to me) quite a few active fan/clone/derivitive sites devoted to the <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dungeon_Master_cc69.html" title="Dungeon Master">Dungeon Master</a> series nearly 20 years after the game was first released, but as far as I know, none devoted to the book. There was, and to a small degree still is, a major cult following of the game that lasted well past its market dominance (and again, no cult following for the book ever materialized). I was interviewed for scores of magazines and even appeared on a few TV shows for my involvement in designing computer games, but other than a couple book signings, I didn't get any publicity for the book. All of the games were at one time or another a number-one selling game, and in the case of Dungeon Master, a seminal work in the history of computer games; the book, alas, set no sales records, and while well-received, would not stand out in a collection of books on designing computer games. Anyway, I'm not here to lobby as I'd rather this is decided on its own merits without regard to the fact that I happen to be active on Wikipedia, but it is just kind of curious that nobody has apparently done the type of research that I see on other bio AfDs. – <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug Bell</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a><b>•</b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Doug_Bell_cc6b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Doug Bell">contrib</a></sup> 10:19, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The difference, to my mind (and probably in the mind of the writers of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>), is that when you read a book you are prominently and conscpicuously presented with the author's name. Book in hand, it's logical to wonder "who is this author?" When you play a video game, you generally do not see the names of creators; I guess some have some "credits key-combo" to reveal some screen of this information, and maybe it's in small print in the manual. A million-selling video game deserves its own article, but its creators are semi-anonymous (though I suppose there are special industry forums where game developers are discussed, given awards, etc). Likewise, my "Black-and-Decker 8" Flat-Head Screwdriver" probably sold 50 million units, and <i>somebody</i> designed it (there's probably a lot that goes into choosing and testing materials and processes, quite likely patents involved). But this person who developed my screwdriver doesn't get an article on that basis (though s/he may well get industry-specific awards, reputation, etc). <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 18:35, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I don't want to be drawn into responding on this page as I don't think my participation here is appropriate and in my opinion I've already been drawn into crossing a line I'd rather not have, so I intend to make this my last addition to this page unless there is some exceedingly good reason to do otherwise. I will only mention that the computer game industry is much more like the movie industry than the tool industry, and similar to the movie industry some people are interested in who makes the movies and some people just watch the movies. (For that matter, some people care who wrote the book and some people just read the books.) Lulu, if you want to discuss any of these issues with me further, please use my talk page. – <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug Bell</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a><b>•</b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Doug_Bell_cc6b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Doug Bell">contrib</a></sup> 01:57, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The analogies among industries Doug Bell makes might be roughly correct (or might not be). I'm not part of either industry, nor part of e.g. the hand tool industry. I <i>do</i> sometimes marvel at how clever some little bit of industrial design is (or at how stupidly it was done), and sort of wonder who was behind it). But there seems to be a prominent notability distinction among where authorship is prominently assigned and where it is not. For example, someone copy-edited, and someone else bound/printed Doug's book. The book would not exist without those steps either; yet those people are not judged notable by <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. I can't really say what "some people are interested in", but try to follow the guidelines in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> in determining notability. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 02:49, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Though the author insists he has no commercial interest in this, it's still basically an ad. Claims of notability are that it's important to the New York salsa dancing community. Well, everything is significant to someone. My local bingo hall is important to my local bingo community, and I wouldn't expect to find that in wikipedia. And performing at the pre-party for the New York Salsa Congress is hardly an olympic-caliber event. This is just one of several million commercial interprizes in the US. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 20:38, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I disagree. Many articles on Wikipedia do not affect millions of people, yet they are not instantly deleted. I think you should reconsider this decision.

<p>I would also add that Wikipedia's many biographies, including many for professors or others who have written obscure books, offer fairly little in the way of content.

Okay, he won two Emmy's, but only as a member of very large teams (one with 11 people, one with 7 people), and he won an Annie Award (which I've never heard of, but that doesn't mean much) on a team of 3 people. Now.. I think Emmy's are of course a big deal but I don't know how well they apply to large teams in terms of Wikipedia notability.

<li><b>Comment (more of a rant, actually):</b> (p.s. this probably belongs somewhere on an AfD process discussion page) I've always had a philisophical problem with "keep and rewrite" votes, and I guess it goes to the heart of what AfD actually is supposed to be. IMHO what people are basically saying is that an article on the subject has a right to exist, but that <i>this particular article in its current state</i> isn't it. Do closing admins take that into account? i.e. if the article isn't improved by the time the AfD discussion closes are those votes counted as "delete"? The reason I ask is because there are many <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flashget.html" title="Flashget">poor articles on good subjects</a> that <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_FlashGet_1f74.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/FlashGet">survive AfD</a> purely based on "keep and rewrite" votes, <b>without the rewrite subsequently taking place</b>. This leaves those articles in the poor state they are and virtually immune to future deletion (based on it having survived AfD already). <a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid">Zunaid</a> 08:30, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

The fact that nobody here probably even knows where Capalaba is does not make it unnotable (last time I checked Brisbane is probably notable, sheesh), and for this deletion to be logical all references to bus stations in Australian cities would have to be deleted. I find it very irrational for example that the Eastern Region's less important bus station, <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Point_Bus_Station%2C_Brisbane_c899.html" title="Victoria Point Bus Station, Brisbane">Victoria Point</a> has no vote for deletion.

<li><b>Comment</b>, the way I see it, that list of bus routes does not belong here, compare it to a phone directory if you will, but I'm fairly sure none of them have any claim to notability. What if everyone wanted an entry for their bus routes? They belong in the bus schedule. However, I see it's huge undertaking, it would be a bad thing to delete all of the related articles&#160;:( <a href="../../../o/b/l/User%7EObli_4ce1.html" title="User:Obli"><font color="#FF0000">O</font></a><a href="../../../o/b/l/User%7EObli_4ce1.html" title="User:Obli">bli</a> (<a href="../../../o/b/l/User_talk%7EObli_47c1.html" title="User talk:Obli">Talk</a>) 10:45, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. If you all insist on deleting, then why not delete everything else? What is so abhorrent about Capalaba? By your logic, you should delete every <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Brisbane_railway_stations_e4c7.html" title="List of Brisbane railway stations">railway station</a> e.g. <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traveston_railway_station%2C_Queensland_826c.html" title="Traveston railway station, Queensland">Traveston</a>, which only has a bus stop sized platform and gets two trains a day. What is so notable about that? I also refute any claim that Capalaba or Redland Shire is not notable - it has a detailed <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redland_Shire%2C_Queensland_66b5.html" title="Redland Shire, Queensland">article</a> of its own. That fact you don't know where it is is irrelevant. I've probably never heard of the vast majority of places in the world that have their own articles. I have cited several precedents to establish the validity of this article. If you delete this, delete everything.

<p>This item of ultra-obscure-numismatics cruft, created by a banned user, lets us know that a BFPO postal order may have been sold somewhere. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> most certainly applies here, namely "indiscriminate collection of information", "soapbox for personal opinion", and the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifability</a> policy too. <a href="../../../k/i/a/User%7EKiand_8457.html" title="User:Kiand">Kiand</a> 23:47, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge</b>. I recommend moving this information into <a href="../../../p/o/s/Postal_order.html" title="Postal order">Postal order</a> until a narrower article, if appropriate, is created. This one is definitely too narrow in scope. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELogophile_6192.html" title="User:Logophile">Logophile</a> 00:40, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> - however, it seems like there are some similarily narrow articles in the stamp collecting category. Also, I took a look at why the author's talk page, it looked like he was banned for being a jerk, but he still appeared to be quite knowledgeable about this subject. I suspect that if he wasn't banned, he would have probably been able to have offered citations to help with the verification. -<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENortonew_82d5.html" title="User:Nortonew">Nortonew</a> 01:27, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Postal orders are not technically an interest of stamp collectors, but are part of nimismatics, as mentioend by Kiand. There are some very poor articles on the collecting of postal orders. I hope an interested editor improves those articles, creates new ones, and eventually puts this article in its appropriate place. For now <a href="../../../p/o/s/Postal_order.html" title="Postal order">Postal order</a> looks like the best home for this information. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELogophile_6192.html" title="User:Logophile">Logophile</a> 03:52, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
