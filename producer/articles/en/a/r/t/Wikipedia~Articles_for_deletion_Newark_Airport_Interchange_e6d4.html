<li><b>Keep</b>. This article is likely as noteworthy as any other article about a big complicated road and motorway junction used by many thousand vehicles each day.

<dd>I agree with much of what you said. I never said that the article was <i>about</i> a neologism. There are two separate problems with the article as it is currently written: (1) The article title is a neologism - which isn't cause for deletion, but something that needs to be changed if its kept, <i>and</i> (2) most of it seems to be original research.</dd>
<dd>As an aside, this article is <i>not</i> about Interchange 14 on the New Jersey Turnpike. It's about the interchange just west of there between I-78, US 1/9, etc. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 22:48, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On second thought, perhaps the confusion on whether or not Turnpike Exit 14 is included indicates that <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> <i>does</i> apply. To quote the article itself, "Interstate 95/ Turnpike <i>may not</i> be involved." (emphasis added) By the same logic that would include the Turnpike - that the ramps all feed into each other, and there's no clear boundary between the two interchanges - we should include where the Airport entrance actually interchanges with US 1/9 south of I-78, but then those ramps weave in and out of the ramps to <a href="../../../r/o/u/Route_81_%28New_Jersey%29_bfa9.html" title="Route 81 (New Jersey)">Route 81</a> south of the airport, and Route 81 is just a whole big mess of ramps that are indistinguishable from each other all the way to Turnpike Exit 13A. But 13A is by definition a totally separate interchage from 14...</dd>
<dd>Basically what I'm saying is maybe this article <i>is</i> about a neologism that's poorly defined. It's true that the "complex" shares many things in common with notable interchanges, like the <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Los_Angeles_Interchange_6cd5.html" title="East Los Angeles Interchange">East Los Angeles Interchange</a>, but IMHO it's missing the two most important things: a name, and defined boundaries. The first link NE2 cites calls it a "complex project", but doesn't necessarily mean that it's meant to be viewed as a single interchange complex. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 04:56, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The NJDOT does call it a "confluence" in that court case, and includes the Turnpike. Someone with New York Times access could check <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10911FA3D5915768FDDAE0994D0405B858BF1D3" class="external autonumber" title="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10911FA3D5915768FDDAE0994D0405B858BF1D3" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. And I suspect, but can't be sure, that there is a common name for this - "the airport", as in "I-78 is backed up to the airport". --<a href="../../../n/e/2/User_talk%7ENE2_13fa.html" title="User talk:NE2">NE2</a> 11:53, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I would think that "the airport" would refer to <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newark_International_Airport_32ca.html" title="Newark International Airport">the airport</a>, not any specific roadway junction near the airport. The word "confluence" to me indicates merely that a bunch of roads are flowing into each other, but doesn't necessarily indicate that they're flowing together in a single complex, and does nothing to define boundaries.</dd>
<dd>Surely if this interchange had a valid name and defined boundaries, there would be a better source than a decades-old court case that doesn't even mention I-78 (although likely only because it wasn't completed at the time). -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 22:12, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Articles are retained based on satisfying criteria of notability. The fact that this is not mentioned in your nomination might well have been indicative of an apparent failure to understand that fact, which is why I stated so in my explanation. Your response makes it clear that you have indeed ignored issues of notability. The rationalization for deletion is simply not valid, and no reference to the existence (or non-existence) of other crap was made. Creating running arguments with each person differing in opinion is not going to help your case, not that it matters. If you have an issue with the title, propose an alternative name for the article and let's discuss it.

According to the only semi-reliable source that's been offered, Exit 14 on the Turnpike <i>is</i> part of the interchange, if not the interchange itself, which makes everything in the current version of the article factually incorrect. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 04:47, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The SLDs verify only that the routes mentioned all flow to a single point. They don't verify that those routes form the "Newark Airport Interchange", which according to NE2's sources, they don't, since the NAI is Exit 14 on the Turnpike – and according to the article, the Turnpike <i>isn't</i> part of the NAI. They also don't verify that the main use is to access the Airport (which seems like common sense, but if Exit 14 is part of it, maybe the main use is to access the Holland Tunnel instead?) and to access the ports (which definitely isn't common sense). The sentence about the many lanes, twists, curves, etc., being a "problem for motorists" besides being unencyclopedic, is original research.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>As I said before, the only source we have so far about the <b>interchange</b> (not SLDs of the individual routes) contradicts the article regarding the inclusion of the turnpike. The only thing left after removing the original research is a single sentence about each highway that belongs in the individual highway article – and in most cases that sentence is already there. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 20:42, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>You can repeat it as many times as you want: The sources support the existence of a "Newark Airport Interchange" going back fifty years, which you insist violates <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>. The content is based on material available in public sources that supports all of the statements made in the article. Despite the fact that all the necessary sources have been added to the article, not one of the skeptics has stated which material constitutes original research. Repetition does not make it so. Whatever arguments have been made have been rather poor and don't stand up. You have not made your case to me, or to anyone else, and I stand by my original vote. Give it up already.

<li>So let me get this straight: We hear a complaint above that "The article has been up for deletion since Monday and no one has put in the sources as now." Now, a full business week after creating the AfD, we're finally seeing the claims of original research? Please attack someone else.

<ul>
<li>The sources from 50 years ago supporting the existence of an NAI are talking about Turnpike Exit 14, a completely different interchange. Thus using it to describe I-78 Exits 57-58 <b>is</b> a <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologism</a>.</li>

<dl>
<dd>You claim that "not one of the skeptics has stated which material constitutes original research." Interestingly, that's <i>immediately underneath</i> where I specify which statements are OR, and right after I tagged those statements in the article. Now that you've removed those statements, maybe you can see that all that's left is a single sentence about each individual highway. And since the term is a neologism, those sentences are best placed in the articles on the individual highways.</dd>
<dd>And by the way, changing the words "Newark Ports" to "Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal" does not make that statement not OR.</dd>
<dd>Also by the way, <i>absolutely no one</i> has attacked you.

<li>So now we have acknowledgment that we have a fifty-year old source, but the article is not what it's really about.

As I stated "Now, a full business week after creating the AfD, we're finally seeing the claims of original research?" You waited, day after day after day, and after repeated requests you finally marked the article with your claims of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, all of which have been addressed. The statement that you insisted was [{WP:OR]] "The main usages of the interchange is to provide access to <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newark_Liberty_International_Airport_4761.html" title="Newark Liberty International Airport">Newark Liberty International Airport</a> and the <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Newark_57f0.html" title="Port Newark">Newark Ports</a>" was changed to "The interchange provide access to <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newark_Liberty_International_Airport_4761.html" title="Newark Liberty International Airport">Newark Liberty International Airport</a> and the <a href="../../../p/o/r/Port_Newark-Elizabeth_Marine_Terminal_2092.html" title="Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal">Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal</a>." I'm not sure what it is about the amended version that "does not make that statement not OR". I'm not sure what the source is of this tag team effort, but I have been convinced to change my vote from <b>Keep</b> to <b>Strong Keep</b>. You have made tour case; I have made mine.

<li><b>Comment</b> The <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> argument has been long demolished; the sources go back over 50 years using the term, including a dozen or two uses in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_York_Times_8b14.html" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i>, three of which are included in the article as references. The article needs to be addressed based on its content, not its long lost creator who hasn't touched the article in over two months, and the article has been extensively expanded since his departure from the scene. The original research issues have been addressed as raised, and the last artifact of tagged <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> has been removed.

<li>Despite the partial rewrite, portions of the article (particularly <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newark_Airport_Interchange_f1ef.html#Routes_involved" title="Newark Airport Interchange">#Routes involved</a>) still refer explictly to I-78 Exit 57-58 excluding the Turnpike, which makes the <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> claim still valid, since all those sources are using the term to describe explicitly NJTP Exit 14. I've tagged an additional two sentences as <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. (Does it provide access to the Marine Terminal? I thought it was 13A that's signed Port Elizabeth.

<li>As fast as you have tagged <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> issues, they have been rewritten or removed.

But I think that we're well past the <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> argument. It's clear that the term exists and has been used -- and documented -- for several decades. When the Newark Airport Interchange was created, there was no I-78, and there was direct access from the Turnpike to 1&amp;9. Now that I-78 exists, what happened to the interchange that it no longer exists? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 07:08, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: <i>Edit conflict</i> -- But is this a term that NJDOT uses?

For instance, with the <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kennedy_Interchange_c2e5.html" title="Kennedy Interchange">Kennedy Interchange</a> in Kentucky, there have been references by KYTC towards its naming -- however, I can't find a NJDOT doc that uses it yet. I guess my weak case for OR stems from this -- "The interchange is one of the largest and most complex interchanges in New Jersey." -- however, that isn't really much OR as just an uncited or unverifiable statement, so I'll retract my OR comment above. <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeicer_9e78.html" title="User:Seicer"><b><span style="color: #B33C1A; font: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 10px;">Seicer</span></b></a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeicer_8d2f.html" title="User talk:Seicer">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Seicer_6c61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Seicer">contribs</a>)</small> 06:27, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I agree that the exclusion of the Turnpike from the interchange as described in the original text of the article was a major mistake. This mistake has been long corrected. As constructed, the Newark Airport Interchange connected the Turnpike to US 1&amp;9 and on to the airport, with NJ 21 and US 22 intersecting as well. Nothing has changed since 1952, other than adding I-78 into the mix as the connector between the Turnpike and US 1&amp;9. The sources more than adequately document that the term exists; <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> is irrelevant. Are you now arguing that 1) the Newark Airport Interchange never existed, 2) it existed once, but doesn't exist now that I-78 was constructed, or 3) it exists, but it only refers to Exit 14 of the Turnpike. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 07:42, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Where are the sources from NJDOT that <i>explicitly</i> state that the interchange along Interstate 78 is the 'Newark Airport Interchange'? Or that it is the 'largest' interchange or one of the most 'complex'? It's not a NJTPK interchange, its one thats maintained by NJDOT... <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeicer_9e78.html" title="User:Seicer"><b><span style="color: #B33C1A; font: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 10px;">Seicer</span></b></a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeicer_8d2f.html" title="User talk:Seicer">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Seicer_6c61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Seicer">contribs</a>)</small> 12:54, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Wikipedia requires sources. Reliable and verifiable sources regarding the interchange are provided. What does what the NJDOT calls or does not call it have to do with the notability of the article? Statements regarding relative size and complexity of the interchange had been removed well before your reply was written. Please remember that the article is not static. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 13:10, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
