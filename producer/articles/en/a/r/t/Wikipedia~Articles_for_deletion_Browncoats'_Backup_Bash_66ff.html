<li><b>Delete</b>: Non-notable event, without actual independent news sources, just self-produced blogs and postings. I was a fan of <i><a href="../../../f/i/r/Firefly_%28TV_series%29_5a5c.html" title="Firefly (TV series)">Firefly</a></i>, but such material is best kept to fan sites. While events like this may be important to particular group of fans, they are not appropriate for an encyclopaedia. As noted at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28companies_and_corporations%29_0e74.html#Criteria_for_clubs.2C_societies.2C_and_organizations" title="Wikipedia:Notability (companies and corporations)">WP:CORP</a>, "<i>The club, society, or organization has been the subject of <b>multiple non-trivial published works</b> whose source is independent of the club, society, or organization itself.</i>" Even the still-under-discussion proposed <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28fandom%29_04fc.html#Conventions" title="Wikipedia:Notability (fandom)">notability guideline for Fandom</a> states, "<i>Generally, a regional convention would only be considered a major convention if it had 1000 or more members each year</i>" This one claims (without any verification) attendance of "approx 375".

<li><b>Delete</b> Send this out in to the black - this shindig wasn't notable.

<li><b>Keep or Merge</b> Disclaimer and disclosure: I was at the event. In the main it's curious to me that the criteria I see most often for deletion on this item is size, with second place seeming to go to a lack of mainstream media coverage. I can't control consensus, but notability shouldn't be restricted to the size of an event. That a planned event of 500 people gets cancelled at the last possible moment and is replaced by a fan-organized substitute, also at the last moment, seems notable from an everyday standpoint. <i>Serenity^3</i> wasn't notable in that sense because it was a planned event which happened as planned. The B3 was different, and therefore notable. As for verifiability, my complaint there is probably more as to flaws in that policy overall than with the concept -- e.g., if the mainstream doesn't notice something, there should be a way to still consider it verifiable, such as the existence of dozens of first-hand reports from attendees, who aren't at fault if no acceptbly-mainstream source has bothered to verify an event.

<li><b>Keep</b>, the unique nature of this event coupled with continuing media coverage in two major publications in addition to the major blogs already listed compell me to vote keep.

<li><b>Comment</b>: "Unique" is not a criterion for inclusion. Also, where is the media coverage?

<li><b>Keep or Merge</b> into Firefly fandom. While it sounds like it was a great party replacing what would have been yet another fan convention, what's notable about it is how it came to be, as a self-organizing event, and as that it should be remembered. People doing good things is usually not considered to be newsworthy, btw; the cancellation would have gotten press (probably did, in fact) but that was lost in the success of the Backup Bash. While it's surely not policy to "reward" good behavior, deleting the article, rather than merging it, is surely punishing it. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtterSmith_4321.html" title="User:OtterSmith">htom</a> 20:50, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Imagine you prepared for a group trip to Europe. You paid for your air, hotel and entertainment. Depending on what your itinerary, you pre-paid anywhere from $1000 to $5,000 up front. The trip is sold out, which means the organizer (who has a good reputation and has put together this type of event many times before) has been paid for everything. You get on the plane and when you land, you find out that other than the air and hotel that you are paying for directly, nothing on the itinerary has been paid for. You and a group of 500 people are milling around the hotel lobby not knowing what to do. There is no one there to help you and from what you understand, the company that booked the itinerary does not have the money to refund you.</p>
<p>There was a fan convention where 500 people from around the world paid for a weekend of socializing with actors, directors, writers, musicians and other Industry folk connected with the series Firefly/Serenity at the Burbank Hilton. People spent anywhere from $1000 to $5,000 including air, hotel and the convention itself. At the last minute, actually in the afternoon prior to Day One, while most people who were coming from outside of Southern California were in the air or in their cars driving down, the convention was canceled, with no refunds in sight. Seems even the studio people and the Hilton were left in the lurch, w/o being paid thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>The California Browncoats put together a Booster Backup Bash (the company's name was Booster Events) and entertained the attendees from Friday through Sunday on a shoestring. Most of the Industry folk came to hang out with the fans for free, Clare Kramer (Glory in season 5 of Buffy) and her husband opened their new Hollywood Blvd restaurant (La Cantina) 2 weeks early so we could have a party (again where the Industry people joined us), people and companies helped us with getting locations to have the daytime events (the Hilton would not/could not release their convention rooms to us) and paid for tour buses so we could move over 350 people (some people didn't come at all, others arrived and left -boy were they pissed they left). Cash donations totaling $6500 came in from Browncoats around the world to help pay for the non-convention. In other words, we made lemons out of lemonade.</p>
<p>So now imagine that same group trip I wrote about at the beginning. While the tourists are in the lobby crying about their ruined trip and how they saved for this special event, strangers start to show up in the lobby. They help you with contacting friends and family. They tell you they will, out of the goodness of their heart, make a substitute itinerary for you for the weekend, keep your group busy seeing the sites, meeting people, playing games, transporting you around, even hosting a major party in a fancy restaurant at no cost to you since you're already out thousands of dollars. And other strangers donate money to a site to help towards paying for the new itinerary and transportation. Strangers. And after you have a weekend that although wasn't what you paid for ended up being more fun during, those strangers wait around until the last person is on their way back home.</p>
<p>Do you think strangers would do that for strangers? As a cohesive group? Of course not. The Browncoats did.</p>
