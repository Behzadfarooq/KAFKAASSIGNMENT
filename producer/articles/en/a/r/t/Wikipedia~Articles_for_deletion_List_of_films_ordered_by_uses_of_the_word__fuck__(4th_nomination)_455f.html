<li><b>Comment.</b> So where are the reliable sources for this article? (a couple of forum posts and a list made by Mr 5intheface are surely not <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a>!) If you mean someone can watch it and count, this surely goes against <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">No original research</a>. Original research is material <b>that has not been previously published by a reputable source</b>. It includes data. I'm confused, as there seems to be a strong consensus to keep, but these issues have not been addressed on <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_films_ordered_by_uses_of_the_word__fuck__bb86.html" title="Talk:List of films ordered by uses of the word &quot;fuck&quot;">Talk:List of films ordered by uses of the word "fuck"</a> as far as I can see? <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 22:59, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have re-read the article, and have changed my mind. A bit of table fomratting would not go amiss, though! <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 07:51, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep but clean up</b>.

However, in that case we have a list that <i>has</i> to rely on original research. This article, on the other hand, references the Family Media Guide website, which (while perhaps not always accurate) does have the quoted statistics and sets the guidelines that this article was formed around. (Remember, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> says we're aiming for "verifiability, not truth.") What we need to do with this article is eliminate <i>any</i> word count NOT provided by FMG's research. This means the "Fuck's" column needs to go and the "FPM" column needs to be revised to reflect the FMG research. If the movie hasn't been researched by FMG, get it off the list. With this done, I think it should satisfy WP guidelines just fine. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">HumbleGod</a> 01:24, 11 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Before I forget to mention this....Having been shown this page in the other AfD, I've been cruising the talk page over the last few days. I had suggested finding another source for the other word counts that FMG did not provide, but the only steady one I could find is IMDB. The problem there is that Premium members of the site can submit trivia, where the Fuck count is located, and I wouldn't be surprised if these members were using WP as a source! Around and around it goes. Thus, the only easy solution I can find is to just stick with FMG results and ditch the rest. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">HumbleGod</a> 01:32, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> the list, and delete the nominator.&#160;:) The list has survived 3 snipe attempts already. Wikipedia is supposed to be uncensored, so quit trying to censor it. The nominator is obviously offended by the subject matter of the list. But so what. <i><b>KEEP!</b></i>. I've seen most of the movies on the list and found the comparison enlightening. The list is anything but arbitrary. How much swearing is in a movie contributes to its tone and intensity. The list is the <b><a href="../../../r/i/c/Richter_Scale_65ff.html" title="Richter Scale">Richter Scale</a></b> for movies, and gives a rough indication of how much each movie will shake you up! Knowing the movies' level of swearing can help you pick what to watch based on what you are in the mood for. The list is innovative, informative, fun, and a perfect example of why Wikipedia stands apart from all other encyclopedias. You won't find anything like this in the Britannica. It's a keeper. <i>Put the list on your watchlist guys, 'cuz they'll be gunning for this one again.</i> --<a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrinity_Skyward_84af.html" title="User:Trinity Skyward">Trinity Skyward</a> 05:13, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I think it's worth mentioning that this article has improved after every AfD nomination to date. The first nomination led from the Guinness-like "record" page to the current "list"; the second established a consensus that verifiability could be met; the third provided a good resource for so doing (FMG). And I'm hoping that this one will lead to my recommendation, the elimination of all non-verifiable (i.e. non-FMG) records in the article. In other words, even though I think this article should stay and I suspect it will, I'm glad it was nominated again. The only thing bugging me is that its biggest problems were being discussed and worked out on the article's Talk page when this was nominated. But if the AfD discussion pushes it forward, all the better. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">HumbleGod</a> 06:28, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I am not in the least bit offended by the list, but I maintain that it has no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> and is thus <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, among other things. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/i/User_talk%7EStifle_2330.html" title="User talk:Stifle">talk</a>) 09:03, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I went ahead and changed the chart (thank goodness for sleepless nights) to remove all non-FMG content and reorder appropriately. The downside: far fewer entries. The upside: as far as I can tell, the list no longer threatens to violate <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Other notes:
<ul>
<li>Fucks Per Minute count still relies on old data and will have to be recalculated (by someone else, I'm done with it!)</li>
<li>I removed the ranking column temporarily to make it easier to adjust the chart; however, as one user noted on the article's Talk page, it may be better this way, as it's easier to maintain and add more entries. I'll leave this decision up to others.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>If anyone objects to the change, feel free to revert. But I have to say that IMO this change really helps this article's chances of meeting WP guidelines. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">HumbleGod</a> 07:25, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
