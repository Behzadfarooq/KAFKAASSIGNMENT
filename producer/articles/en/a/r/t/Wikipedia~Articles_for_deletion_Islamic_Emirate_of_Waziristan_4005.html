<p>The article violates wikipedia's cardinal content policy of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>. Moreover it is also a duplicate of the <a href="../../../w/a/z/Waziristan_accord.html" title="Waziristan accord">Waziristan accord</a> but with the twist that a newly coined term i.e. 'Islamic Emirate of Waziristan' has been used in order to give the uninformed reader the illusion that there is some newly formed independent state which has been set up in the tribal areas of Pakistan. The fact of the matter is that the tribal areas or <a href="../../../f/a/t/FATA_c9b8.html" title="FATA">FATA</a> have always been out of the bounds of the central government and even though the <a href="../../../w/a/z/Waziristan_accord.html" title="Waziristan accord">Waziristan accord</a> binds the government to remove newly constructed security check points in the region; it does not call for the total withdrawl of government presence and creation of some separate state, as has been implied here. As such this article is a total work of fiction and is based on false foundations. The references are weak, to say the least, and thus this article needs to be removed.

<li><b>Additional comment</b> The only reference, out of all the <i>neutral</i> references provided, which even mentions (and very briefly) this fictitious term of the 'Islamic Emirate of Waziristan' is the one from Newsweek. All the other references are about the <a href="../../../w/a/z/Waziristan_accord.html" title="Waziristan accord">Waziristan accord</a> or its ramifications. I won't comment on the Press Trust of India report as it is an Indian goverment mouthpiece and does not fall into the sphere of a <i>neutral</i> source when it comes to topics pertaining to Pakistan. Thus just writing up a new wikipedia article based on a term which has only been mentioned by one news outlet in only one of their reports is, in my opinion, not something which can be called a verifiable piece and hence will go against wikipedia's <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> policy according to my judgement.

<p>Despite Red aRRow’s unsupported assertion, this article does violate the principle of verifiability. Quite the contrary; the article is rather well footnoted. Red aRRow need only refer to footnotes one and two to verify the article’s introduction. As such, Red aRRow’s insertion of verification needed edit is clearly erroneous and borders on vandalism (as does the entire attempt to delete this article). The fact that a publication has printed facts which contradict an official state policy (of any government) does not render that publication irreputable.</p>
<p>Second, Red aRRow’s assertion that this article “is also a duplicate of the <a href="../../../w/a/z/Waziristan_accord.html" title="Waziristan accord">Waziristan accord</a>” is simply incorrect. One need only compare the two articles—both their content and their citations—to discern the difference. However, one correction should be noted with respect to the article and the term “Islamic Emirate of Waziristan.” The author of the article states that "The Islamic Emirate of Waziristan is the name <b>given by some commentators</b> to an area of Waziristan, Pakistan that they say gained de facto recognition from the Government of Pakistan on September 5, 2006 as a result of negotiations between Islamabad and local tribesmen to end the undeclared Waziristan War.” (Emphasis added.) Actually, the Islamic Emirate of Waziristan is not what “some commentators” have termed this de facto autonomous region; rather, it is the name coined by the Pakistani Taliban for their new “state.” (See <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13990130/site/newsweek/" class="external free" title="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13990130/site/newsweek/" rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13990130/site/newsweek/</a> at ¶ 2.)</p>
<p>Third, whether or not the Islamic Emirate of Waziristan exists as a de facto state is irrelevant to its validity as an article. Contrary to Red aRRow’s unsupported assertion that the article is “a total work of fiction,” the article is fully verified and factual. Unlike Red aRRow, the author makes no assertions of opinion, and also unlike Red aRRow, virtually all of the article’s facts are cited to legitimate and reputable original sources.</p>
<p>Red aRRow is obviously passionate about the Pakistani government’s reputation in light of the peace treaty recently signed with the Taliban in Waziristan. Nevertheless, Nationalist passion—however fervent—should not be allowed to dictate which articles remain in Wikipedia, and which are deleted. A review of Red aRRow in existing Wikipedia pages reveals a singular concern for maintaining Pakistani honor, which is perfectly legitimate as long as the arguments are factual and based on violations of Wikipedia policy. In this case, they are not.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as the article fortunately documents, the Pakistani government has essentially stated that it would like to have the article deleted. Nationalism is not a basis upon which to delete an article. Indeed, the irony of Red aRRow’s and the Pakistani government’s arguments is that to delete the article would itself be a violation of Wikipedia policy.</p>
<p>I would respectfully disagree with Sandstein’s two arguments. First, as pointed out above (and by Sandstein himself), the article is verified.</p>
<p>With respect to the neologism argument, I would say that while perhaps technically true, a neologism is not fatal per se. Moreover, given how recently it was “created,” the disputed nature of its status, and its geographic and cultural remoteness, to say the Islamic Emirate of Waziristan is a neologism doesn’t mean a whole lot—it’s somewhat of a <a href="../../../t/a/u/Tautology.html" title="Tautology">tautology</a>. Likewise, given how underreported this region is, to wait until a vague “mainstream use” is attained offers no benefit other than denying the reader the opportunity to educate himself and seek out original sources. Finally, the article should not be deleted until “such a state is actually founded.” The point of the article is its “founding” according to the Pakistani Taliban, and arguably according to the terms of the peace treaty between Pakistan and the Taliban. If an entity is deserving of an article only if it has widespread international recognition, then shouldn’t the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transnistria.html" title="Transnistria">Transnistria</a> article be deleted as well? And for that matter, the Islamic Emirate of Afganistan should as well considering the fact that only a couple of countries ever officially recognized it.</p>
<p>Finally, the phrase “<a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Emirate_of_Waziristan_b3b3.html" title="Islamic Emirate of Waziristan">Islamic Emirate of Waziristan</a>” has historical and contextual significance. This new entity was founded/is attempting to be founded by the same people who founded the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Emirate_of_Afghanistan_b03f.html" title="Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan">Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan</a>. The article should remain.

If the Wikipedia Managment does not take the necessary steps to stop the influx of biased and Anti-Pakistani arctles, then we will take the necessary steps to red flag this website in Pakistan and tag this website to all Pakistani Journarlists to stay away from.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> As an encyclopedia the website has the right to keep this article in place, and as an independent article too i.e. not to be merged with Waziristan accord. The fact of the matter is the "Pakistani Taliban" have termed this name to their region. Their is no writ of the Government beyond Mir Ali and Miran Shah, and there never had been any government authority in the 7 Tribal agencies in the Federally Administered Tribal Area (FATA). The author has not put his personal opinion in the article but have collected the reports of reputed journalists who have expertise in reporting the matters related to Afghanistan/Taliban. To name one such journalist is Syed Saleem Shehzad of Asia Times Online, who has been working on the subject since 9/11. A number of other press resources has been conforming with Syed Saleem's reports eversince he unvieled the story in December 2005. It has been verified from a number of resources including BBC (off and on) that Taliban have the practical control on the both sides of the Pukhtoon belt i.e. in Waziristan and the Southern Afghanistan and it is believed that sometime in coming months Mullah Omer (Taliban Supreme Leader) is expected to announce the re-emergence of Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. This is the covert reason behind the Waziristan accord, Musharraf's visit to Kabul and US's unpleasant watchul comments. Both Islamabad and Kabul feel threatened the way Taliban have re-emerged. Both capitals are trying every best in their own way to stop the strong rise of Taliban, this is why Pakistan has signed the accord with the Tribal elders so that they withdraw their support for the "Pakistani Taliban". So on grounds of not having personal opinion of the writer, factual reporting on behalf of different Press sources and as an Independent credible story, the article should be kept in Wikipedia. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 203.81.213.157 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.81.213.157_e7d1.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.81.213.157">contribs</a>).</small></li>

</ul>
<p>Regarding the claims that wikipedia is becoming "infested with indians", please take a look at the primary contributors to this article. I am not Indian. I am a 6th generation Irish American from the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midwest.html" title="Midwest">Midwest</a>. <a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer">Osgoodelawyer</a> is a Canadian law student. Inkan1969 is not Indian as far as I can tell -- his edits suggest he's a fan of <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microstate.html" title="Microstate">microstates</a>, flags, and national anthems worldwide.</p>
<p>Take a look at the two main news sources underpinning the article, <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia_Times_Online_fb87.html" title="Asia Times Online">Asia Times Online</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newsweek.html" title="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>. Asia Times Online is based in <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>. Newsweek is based in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">US</a>. Neither have any stake in the India/Pakistan conflict. Take a look at the reporters who have provided us thes articles. Mr. Syed Saleem Shahzad, the Pakistan Bureau Chief for Asia Times Online, appears to be Muslim, not Hindu, if his name is any indication. The Newsweek reporters, Ron Moreau and Hussain Zahid, also lack Hindu names.</p>
<p>I am dumbfounded by the claims we are "Indian teenagers", "devious indians", and that our edits evidence Wikipedia is "increasingly infested with indians". How could anybody come to that conclusion? You've given me quite an education as to how high passions run on this topic, and how these emotions do not require an basis in evidence. It discredits you severely, if I can be frank. I thought the periodic insanity on the <a href="../../../t/i/b/Talk%7ETibet_6ce7.html" title="Talk:Tibet">Tibet talk</a> page was the epitome of irrational, emotional outburst, but by comparison it's a model of cold scientific reason...</p>
<p>On the topic of bias, I just took the time to check the user contributions of everyone who has voted "delete" so far in this discussion. Silly me, I took the time to check up a bit on who is saying what here. Save <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">User:Sandstein</a>, who votes "weak delete", I observe that none of you has made a single edit on any topics besides the topic of Pakistan or India/Pakistan conflict (that's Red aRRow, 82.31.151.203, 62.31.20.122, 203.82.48.56, Dizasta76, and 132.161.221.18 -- all monotopic contributors). (Not quite zero actually -- one of the IP addresses made a single edit to adjust the Muslim population quoted on the demographics of Thailand page). So you guys are not exactly the model of unbiased contributorship. I also observe the eldest of you, Red aRRow, has only been contributing since July. Prior to his involvement in this article (he is the one pushing for this VfD), his edits have been limited entirely to topics pertaining to the <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan_Navy_09e4.html" title="Pakistan Navy">Pakistan Navy</a>...</p>
<p>I can't help but connect a dot or two. This past week the Government of Pakistan publicly stated they will take "immediate notice" of this article on Wikipedia. I'm not sure what that means, but it comes to mind that perhaps a few of you are employed by the Government of Pakistan. Nothing at all wrong with working for the <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government_of_Pakistan_b365.html" title="Government of Pakistan">Government of Pakistan</a> and contributing to Wikipedia, but it does seem suspicious that the long-time Pakistani Wikipedians are silent from this dispute, while all these newbies are crying "lies!" and "fiction!" and repeatedly attaching POV and VfD flags to the article, without bothering to provide a single verifiable source to counter the references put up by the Wikipedians outside south asia.</p>
<p>Changing gears, let me add a few more points to the thoughtful contributions made above in defense of this article:</p>
<ul>
<li>1) The text of the <a href="../../../w/a/z/Waziristan_accord.html" title="Waziristan accord">Waziristan accord</a> is secret. The press in Pakistan is regulated by the government. The area in question is remote and very dangerous, as Mtclvrt points out. Combining these conditions, it is unrealistic to expect the same level of news investigation we expect for stories unfolding in the US or Europe. When we get two independent and unbiased sources, such as we've got here, uncountered by sources to the contrary, we should take the story to the bank. Note that domestic Pakistan news organizations are not likely to take the lead in uncovering the details of an accord the Government wants kept secret. Not good for business. My personal interpretation of the Dawn News article, which reproduced most of the Wikipedia article verbatim, is that the Islamabad journalist was are keeping their readers informed by letting Wikipedia do the speaking, meanwhile keeping his head down by letting the Pakistan Foreign Office have a free swing at discrediting it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2) Two independent sources attest to the existence of the Islamic Emirate of Waziristan. No verifiable source claims contrary. While I realize that few sources have the broad knowledge of the area required to conclude no such organization exists, we are fortunate to already have input from the organization best suited for understanding the situation, the <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government_of_Pakistan_b365.html" title="Government of Pakistan">Government of Pakistan</a>. When the <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_News_01a3.html" title="Daily News">Daily News</a> brought the Wikipedia article to the attention of the Foreign Office, it would have been easy and natural for the Office to trivialize this group if the group did not in fact exist. Fantasies! However, the Foreign Office did not take that opportunity. Instead it only maintained that it did not cut a deal with the Taliban. Oddly enough, the Wikipedia article did not claim the IEoW was the Taliban. Somehow the Foreign Office considers the IEoW to be the <a href="../../../t/a/l/Taliban.html" title="Taliban">Taliban</a>. That's a fact in itself. How is it the Foreign Office could know this independent fact about the IEoW, if the IEoW didn't exist?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>3) For those of you that don't keep a close eye on current affairs, note the Musharraf government is in the midst of a major spin effort regarding the <a href="../../../w/a/z/Waziristan_accord.html" title="Waziristan accord">Waziristan accord</a>. One of his Brigadier Generals told <a href="../../../a/b/c/ABC_News_2f7d.html" title="ABC News">ABC News</a> the accord would give sanctuary to <a href="../../../o/s/a/Osama_bin_Laden_a745.html" title="Osama bin Laden">Osama bin Laden</a> under certain conditions. The general apparently confused the domestic message on the accord (civil war is over, forgive everybody) with the international message (war on terror is important). The <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blogosphere.html" title="Blogosphere">blogosphere</a> went crazy. Musharraf now has to pull out all the stops to reconcile what is inherently unreconcilable. All of which makes it very hard for fact-finding anywhere near this radioactive topic. All the more reason to listen carefully to any outside journalists who are able to make contact with the players in Waziristan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, on <b>merge</b> vs. <b>keep</b>: <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom harrison</a>'s suggestion to merge the Islamic Emirate of Waziristan with Waziristan Accord is not an unreasonable one, if we take a certain view of what's happening. That particular view is that the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Emirate_of_Waziristan_b3b3.html" title="Islamic Emirate of Waziristan">Islamic Emirate of Waziristan</a> is important primarily in light of the <a href="../../../w/a/z/Waziristan_accord.html" title="Waziristan accord">Waziristan accord</a>. That view probably has the best odds of prevailing in the end, but it is not the only view out there. Another view, and this argues for <b>keep</b>, is that the Islamic Emirate of Waziristan is essentially a branch of the Pakistan Taliban, and it has impact and influence apart from this accord. The very name "Islamic Emirate of Waziristan" has strong Taliban overtones, as 203.81.213.157 points out (it directly evokes the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Emirate_of_Afghanistan_b03f.html" title="Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan">name the Afghanistan Taliban used for itself</a>). If the Pakistan Foreign Office statement is taken at face value, the Islamic Emirate of Waziristan is a Taliban organization which was not party to the accord. If so they were not partty to the accord, they should not be consolidated onto the accord page. <a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETechnopilgrim_d7d3.html" title="User:Technopilgrim">technopilgrim</a> 22:51, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Sorry, but as far as I see it only the <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newsweek.html" title="Newsweek">Newsweek</a> article is mentioning this term of 'Islamic Emirate of Waziristan'. Both the articles from <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia_Times_Online_fb87.html" title="Asia Times Online">Asia Times Online</a> do not even mention this term and definitely do not support the assertions which this article is making about some sort of a <b>State</b> or <b>Emirate</b>. The <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia_Times_Online_fb87.html" title="Asia Times Online">Asia Times Online</a> articles are related to the 'war on terror' generally and the <a href="../../../w/a/z/Waziristan_accord.html" title="Waziristan accord">Waziristan accord</a> specifically.

<dd>As for your assertion that since the text of the <a href="../../../w/a/z/Waziristan_accord.html" title="Waziristan accord">Waziristan accord</a> is a secret plus, in your opinion, the press in Pakistan seems to be regulated by the government (a claim which I personally reject as anybody with an internet browser and an internet connection can see by going over to the websites of Pakistani publications and see the blasting they are always handing out to the government e.g. here is what I found in 1 minute flat <a href="http://www.newsline.com.pk/NewsSep2006/editornotesep2006.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newsline.com.pk/NewsSep2006/editornotesep2006.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://www.dawn.com/herald/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dawn.com/herald/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>....doesn't seem to be 'regulated' to me) do not hold true as a justification for this article to be stamped as verifiable and be given a place on wikipedia. In fact this should serve as a basis for deletion because until and unless more <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> evidence has been found regarding this fictitious <i>Emirate</i>, this article is unverifiable and violates wikipedia's cardinal policy.</dd>
<dd>Moreover, speaking of being in touch with current affairs, I don't know which General you are referring to when accusing the Pakistanis of a spinoff, but as far as I see it there is no free pass for Osama bin Laden or other targets of high importance as a result of the <a href="../../../w/a/z/Waziristan_accord.html" title="Waziristan accord">Waziristan accord</a> as you can see at the following links. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5320116.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5320116.stm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003247161_pakistan07.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003247161_pakistan07.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> - Red aRRow 10:37, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am referring to the press laws imposed in 2002 that caused the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Federation_of_Journalists_5e0a.html" title="International Federation of Journalists">International Federation of Journalists</a> to write<a href="http://www.ifj-asia.org/page/ifj_protests_against_new_press_laws_in_pakistan.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ifj-asia.org/page/ifj_protests_against_new_press_laws_in_pakistan.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>The International Federation of Journalists, the world's largest journalists' organisation, representing over 500,000 journalists worldwide, is deeply concerned over the recent adoption of three new press laws that it believes will seriously impact on the freedom of the press in Pakistan.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>According to our information, the Pakistani government adopted the new press laws on August 31 2002 that increase the penalties for defamation, impose a system of prior authorisation for the news media, and create a government controlled press council, despite objections from Pakistani journalists.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>We understand that the new defamation laws allow for penalties ranging from a minimum fine of US$800 through to prison sentences. We also understand that the Press Council is not independent of Government, with four representatives, including its president, appointed by the Government.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This constitutes government regulation of the press by my standards, if not by yours.</p>
<p>Regarding the general who spoke to ABC News, my mistake, he was not a <i>Brigadier</i> General. He was a <i>Major</i> General, which would be one step up from Brigadier General I'm guessing. This is not the first time my memory for detail has failed me. It was a <b>General Shaukat Sultan</b> who told ABC News on Tuesday, September 5th, that bin Laden would not be taken into custody "as long as one is being like a peaceful citizen".

Double standards, anyone? The article doesn't mention it is a state as a matter of fact, but just that some call it so, therefore it should be kept accordingly or merged with the peace accord article.

<li><b>Comment</b> Your accusations are unfounded and baseless. The casualty figures needed to come from a <i>neutral</i> source and as you can see now I have added one. Although Fox News is a vehemently right wing media organization and is known for propagating the American <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-con.html" title="Neo-con">neo-con</a> agenda, still I have left your 'contribution' to the article which is sourced from that biased media organization.

<dl>
<dd>"Neutral" sources are hard to come by on a regular basis given that what appears to be neutral to one person may be contested as "a vehemently right wing media" by another. For all you know the one (DW link) you have added only adds half baked information which you haven't fully read yourself. If you had done that then you would probably have noticed that the 400 casualty figure mentioned in the Deutsche Welle source is for one year only and not the full duration of the conflict. I have now added the original source for the casualty claims for both sides. Further the casualty quotes I provided came directly from eminent Pakistani authors, which you removed twice before some sanity prevailed. <a href="../../../i/d/l/User%7EIdleguy_eb71.html" title="User:Idleguy">Idleguy</a> 06:28, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>btw, the FOX news article doesn't come from them. It is syndicated from Associated Press and a similar story ran in Pakistan's Daily Times.
