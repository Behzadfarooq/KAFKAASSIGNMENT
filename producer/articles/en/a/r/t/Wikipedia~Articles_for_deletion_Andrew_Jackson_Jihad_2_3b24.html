<li><b>Strong, speedy keep</b>- The article has been rewritten (it is not a "re-creation of previously deleted material" because of the new content), because it meets OTHER criteria of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> besides the album releases and charting requriements, which if you'd <a href="../../../o/s/t/WP%7EOSTRICH_1864.html" title="WP:OSTRICH">bothered to read the article and the talk page</a>, you would have discovered. The band has received more media coverage and awards since the last AfD, which I have cited in the new article.

<li>I don't see reliable sources meeting <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. A Phoenix weekly paper (note: article link doesn't work) supporting an unreleased album isn't enough for me, sorry.

<li>I can't get to the <i>New Times</i> article, sorry. Note that the ASU page (user: <i>nopass</i>, password: <i>nopass</i>, courtesy BugMeNot) is a university newspaper. From my point of view, a weekly article and a university article fall far short of the other criteria -- particularly, two albums. I think <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> is a little uneven that way.

<li>Local bands get local press mentions. An article, in a national magazine, would be more fitting.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I am holding my vote too. This article is well referenced and written, but I am unsure about their notablity. Although there's no result of the band on <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Music_3ac6.html" title="All Music">All Music</a>, but from the band's official website, they seemingly do go on national tours in a sense which should meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. <font style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva; font-size:15px;">AQu01rius</font> <small>(<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAQu01rius_9358.html" title="User:AQu01rius">User</a> | <a href="../../../a/q/u/User_talk%7EAQu01rius_1acc.html" title="User talk:AQu01rius">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAQu01rius_Websites_b470.html" title="User:AQu01rius/Websites">Websites</a>)</small>&#160; 00:48, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong delete</b> I still see nothing that passes <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. Every newspaper mention is from that of some college where they played with the exception of the Phoenix New Times, which doesn't appear to be the most reliable of sources. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 02:14, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There seems to be some dispute over whether or not the ASU paper, the Arizona Republic, or the Phoenix New Times are reliable sources (they are), but what cannot be disputed are the awards, nor the talk of the band in <a href="../../../h/e/a/HeartattaCk_5399.html" title="HeartattaCk">HeartattaCk</a>, a very notable zine. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 17:10, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The claims to notability are unsourced with reliable sources, and therefore don't satisfy <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. Citing <i>New Times</i> as <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> is laughable, especially for a Phoenix native. <i>I've</i> been mentioned in the <i>New Times</i> for nothing much, and the story misquoted the other interviewee, too. The <i>New Times</i> is not a good measure of anything, and it's certainly not reliable. That and a blog and a student-written college paper (and it's an <i>interview</i> where they mention <i>themselves</i> offhandedly that they went on a tour): none of these are reliable. And after reading the article, <i>I still don't know if they're even signed to a label</i>. They're not even on allmusic. Nothing here meets <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, and Parsssseltongue's been spamming this AfD to boot. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 07:31, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It would be spamming if I went to a bunch of editors and said "PLEASE COME VOTE KEEP ON THIS AFD!" As I mentioned above (does anyone on Wikipedia actually bother to READ anything or anymore, or do they just work off assumptions?), I alerted editors to the article and the AfD to get their opinion, I didn't try to sway it one way or another. You claim to be a Phoenix native, one that has been in <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenix_New_Times_0639.html" title="Phoenix New Times">Phoenix New Times</a> even, so you should know who AJJ is. And it doesn't matter that they're on a label or not, that is not the end-all be-all of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. What too many editors on here are clearly missing is that other <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criteria has been met, as noted in the article and on the talk pages, with reliable verifiable sources (whether Dmcdevit has a grudge against them or not). <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 17:01, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Dmcdevit does not have a grudge, but actually his opinion is based on sound reasoning. But thanks anyway for your insinuations. (Oh, and I "claim to be a Phoenix native". Nice.) The bottom line is that you have no reliable sources here, so no inclusion guidelines can be met. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 20:12, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I am just curious why someone who claims to be from Phoenix and implies they are well-versed in music and media in the area would refute New Times as a legitimate publication, as well as refuting AJJ as a legitimate band. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 20:27, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Sorry, but this is completely different situation - I haven't heard of them, their biggest gig was supporting Flogging Molly, hardly a huge band in themselves, there doesn't seem to be anything supporting a national or international tour (individual shows in different states IMO don't really count), nothing non-trivial, and they don't have CDs for sale on Amazon or anywhere in my country. 172 hits on Google, 126 listeners on last.fm, they don't seem to pass WP:MUSIC, so this is nn and probably vanity - albiet a well written vanity page. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 12:18, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>It would be vanity if I were a member of the band.

Nevertheless, while there are <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criteria this article DOESN'T fit (radio play, album releases), the talk page will direct you to the criteria it DOES fit, and the sources are cited within the article. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 17:10, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I did state probable vanity - I didn't say it /was/ vanity. I checked the talk page. Specifically, I don't think they've done a full national tour, I wouldn't describe the competition as major, I don't think the articles are in major publications and the band doesn't establish a new notable style for a city (well, one that's /itself/ established enough to itself be notable and varifiable). -<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 18:56, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>To answer: the article is not vanity. You not feeling the competition is major doesn't make it not major. The articles are in major publications.

They aren't MTV, put it that way. The whole thing goes against the spirit of WP:MUSIC. The fact that the article was written "with WP:MUSIC in mind" makes me stroke my chin and wonder if WP:MUSIC is a little too broad, and if people want to scrape the barrel they could get any local band's articles kept. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 13:38, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's kind of misleading. I mean, every band is from SOMEWHERE, every band is a "local band" in some town. It's not like AJJ hasn't toured. And give <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> another read - a band who is prominent in their hometown is still under consideration for notability. I think the problem now is some editors in this AfD are horribly misjudging the reliability of the sources, and I'm not sure what that stems from except a failure to recognize anything from <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arizona.html" title="Arizona">Arizona</a> as notable because it's not <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> or <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">L.A.</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 19:05, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

The eCollegeTimes is a longer article, but I can't establish notability of the site (there's only 50 unique hits on Google). StatePress seems more like it, but is still an article in a local University newspaper. As for Heartattack, I'm unsure of its notability or contents, but even if we count that, it doesn't count as "multiple", and even those articles that do count are still marginal at best. -<a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 21:11, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. As for reliable sources, I really don't see one. The ASU article is expressly out per WP:MUSIC: "Has been featured in multiple non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media (excludes things like school newspapers, personal blogs, etc...)." The AZ Night Buzz is a blog. And the College Times? Definitely not something I would consider reliable. The article in the Phoenix New Times is not displaying for me, so I am unable to judge the content of the article itself, but the publication as a whole is a local paper for a large city, but it is still not a far reaching paper, leaving its value rather limited as well. Even if these articles were considered to be reliable sources, the next question is, would this band meet WP:MUSIC? They have not gone on a national tour. They have toured a portion of the U.S. They don't have two or more albums on a major label, no major music competition, no major award, they aren't getting radio time, and they don't have any independently notable members. As for "Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city...", I see nothing to support that argument, even with the sources given. So with or without the sources given, I believe this band does not meet WP:MUSIC and should be deleted. --<a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelnuneb_b3c1.html" title="User:Maelnuneb">Maelnuneb</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/e/User_talk%7EMaelnuneb_aa13.html" title="User talk:Maelnuneb">Talk</a>) 16:35, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
