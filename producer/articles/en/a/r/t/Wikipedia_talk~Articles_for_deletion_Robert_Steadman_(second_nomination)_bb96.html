	    <p>So the subject of this article is notable and anything else is irrelevant? Flouting the policies of Wiki is to be rewarded?</p>
<p>He is <b>SO</b> notable that it appears that he had to create his own article. Surely, someone notable enough for Wikipedia wouldn't have to do so? This article is little more than an extension of the subject's website.</p>
<p>As I said, the acid test of his notability would be to delete the article and see whether anybody apart from the subject has enough knowledge and interest to create a new one.Crusading composer 19:45, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wasn't going to comment but as you are both trying to smear my name here whilst triumpanhtly libelling me on TES <a href="http://www.tes.co.uk/section/staffroom/thread.aspx?story_id=2200686&amp;path=/Opinion/&amp;threadPage=&amp;messagePage=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tes.co.uk/section/staffroom/thread.aspx?story_id=2200686&amp;path=/Opinion/&amp;threadPage=&amp;messagePage=1" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> I feel I should pass comment on your behaviour and this nonsense.</dd>

<p><b>Libel</b> is a very strong word. Which of the TES users do you think I am and what has <b>anybody</b> said on that particular thread that is libellous? I can't see anything. Everybody seems to be taking great care as to what they say about you - what with your history of threatening legal action.Crusading composer 16:06, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You really don't get it do you? Even if the sock puppet accusations were correct, which they are not - <b>I have NEVER used a sockpuppet</b>, the article was fundamentally written well before vhjh became involved as far as I can tell (take a look at the history) and did robeaston99 EVER edit the article or did I miss that?</dd>

<p>Yes you did. It was Mr Easton? who added the section about the crusading composer. Perhaps you also missed the fact that the article was initially created and developed by one editor who has only ever edited articles involving you, your work, your school and your homne towns.</p>
<hr />
<p>Have you thought about my suggestion? We let this AfD take it's course - I doubt if your article will be deleted - although I believe that a tag should be added staing <i>possible</i> vanity article; I won't mention you again and you don't mention me again? I will curb my occasional impulses to show you up and you curb your impulses to blame me for everything? I will stick to editing articles that interest me and leave you to edit those articles that interest you? What about that?Crusading composer 16:03, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You have a bee in your bonnet because of our disagreements on TES - you then harassed me and stalked me there and now you have been stalking me here. This, as several others have pointed out, is a bad-faith nomination by someone who has totally lost the plot. I do hope someone decides to take a look at your behaviour and asks whether you are a sound person to be editing on WP. Robsteadman 21:17, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I thought that you were on a break? I have been very careful to use the word <b>IF</b>. I personally have no evidence that you have lied for the last couple of months. I am merely pointing out that if Wikipedia is satisfied that you have, then they should act accordingly. As for your assertation that I am stalking you on 2 sites, I don't know what evidence you have to back this up? Stalking is strong word. As I have said before - just because some editors or administrators have said this is a bad faith nomination, it doesn't make it so. I have presented my reasons for the nomination and they are valid. I welcome any investigation into my conduct. Actually, Mr steadman, as far as I am concerned this is the end of the matter. I have already said that I have no interest in editing your article any further. I am merely proving a point. Editors that are alleged to have been your sockpuppets made the same claims about being fixated, having mental problems, stalking etc in November. Really they should have been blocked then. All I am doing is showing the Wiki coimmunity that I was right then and I am right now. Perhaps if those 'editors' had not smeared my name then, I wouldn't feel the need to clear it now?Crusading composer 21:56, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm satisfied that what I have said exonerates me. Why not just let the matter drop? I won't have anything more to do with you, your userpage, your contributions, your articles - I can't say that I have any interest in them now that I have said my piece, and you stop trying to smear me and blame me for every misfortune that happens to you?Crusading composer 21:56, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Could you both please take the outside dispute back outside of Wikipedia?

<dd>I totally agree Jareth. The thing is I have no dispute if CC stopped stalking me on various internet sites. Robsteadman 19:45, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>so, we agree then? You stop referring to me, and I will stop referring to you? I have archived all references to you on my talk page and asked for a change of name.Crusading composer 19:49, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
