<p>I speedily deleted this page as a repost of deleted content. The article creator objected, asserting that the new article addressed the objections raised in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_T14_df57.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/T14">the previous AFD</a>. Therefore I am bringing the new version here. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnottygobble_915d.html" title="User talk:Snottygobble">Snottygobble</a> 05:51, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: I am the author of the most recent version of this article. The first article was deleted because it was not sufficiently verifiable and because of suspected sockpuppetry during the original AfD debate. I have added a number of reliable sources to confirm that this is not simply a "neologism" and hope that this debate will avoid another descent into sockpuppetry, which I think really distracted people from the merit of the article the first time around. Even the person who nominated the last T14 article agrees that this version merits inclusion. I welcome any suggestions for further improvement. --<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheapestcostavoider_7826.html" title="User:Cheapestcostavoider">Cheapestcostavoider</a> 06:03, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: do you know when the term was created? It seems very unlikely that there would be no change in the rankings year after year besides movement within the top fourteen. By the way, some of the links don't work. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 11:05, 4 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b>: I've just tried to fix the links; they should be working now. No, I don't know when the term was created, but the US News rankings date back to (I believe) 1987. The point isn't that the rankings don't change, but that the top 14 have been the same schools in every edition of the rankings. The reality is that the rankings do change quite a bit, which is why the fact that the same 14 schools have remained on top each time has struck so many people as noteworthy. --<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheapestcostavoider_7826.html" title="User:Cheapestcostavoider">Cheapestcostavoider</a> 18:22, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> unless there is some verification of mainstream use of this term in this context. In all the links I found no evidence that T-14 is a common or notable term. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin1243_1326.html" title="User:Kevin1243">Kevin</a> 12:37, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> for the same reasons people voted delete in the last AfD. References and sources in the <i>new</i> article which supposedly addressed previous objections are links which in several cases don't work, or make no mention of T-14, or if they do mention it, its done only in passing and present no evidence which convinces me of it being a notable term. -- <a href="../../../i/40/n/User%7EI%40n_586b.html" title="User:I@n">I@n</a> ≡ <a href="../../../i/40/n/User_talk%7EI%40n_406b.html" title="User talk:I@n">talk</a> 13:18, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> "Legitimate" meaning it's a term that probably actually exists; "notable" meaning it's a term that's important enough to have it's own WP article. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 20:52, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The sources seem to establish its notability. It also gets 10K+ hits on Google. It's very widely used among law students and the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Leiter_38e8.html" title="Brian Leiter">Brian Leiter</a> sources seem to verify this. -<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparklemotion_f79f.html" title="User:Sparklemotion">Sparklemotion</a> 16:40, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, article establishes notability via published sources and assertion that prospective students use this list to pick the best schools. Maybe could use renaming (Top Fourteeen Law Schools). Nothing links to the article, though, so that probably ought to be fixed. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElkman_Esperanza_be6e.html" title="User:Elkman/Esperanza"><font color="green">E</font></a><a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElkman_f6c6.html" title="User:Elkman">lkman</a> - <sup><a href="../../../e/l/k/User_talk%7EElkman_bf81.html" title="User talk:Elkman">(talk)</a></sup> 17:02, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, really no substantial change from old version. The sources don't convince me that this is not a neologism -- every neologism is used <i>somewhere</i> -- that doesn't mean they are notable. In the end, a slang term used by some people involved with the law school admissions process shouldnt be included in this encyclopedis. Wikipedia is not a slang dictionary. <a href="../../../x/o/x/User%7EXoxohthblaster_a00a.html" title="User:Xoxohthblaster">Xoxohthblaster</a> 18:03, 4 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't think you can really call this "slang" so much as a colloquialism. A related term that has been deemed notable enough for inclusion is <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Ivies_fe2e.html" title="Little Ivies">Little Ivies</a>, which is actually much less well-documented, widely used or clear as to what schools it includes. --<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheapestcostavoider_7826.html" title="User:Cheapestcostavoider">Cheapestcostavoider</a> 18:22, 4 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I really dont see much point in getting into a debate over the meaning of the word "slang" .... Wikipedia is also not a colloquialism dictionary. Moreover, the fact that one potentially non notable topic has not been deleted is not a justification for keeping articles on other non notable topics -- that kind of reasoning could quickly become a slippery slope to a wikipedia littered with non-notable content. <a href="../../../x/o/x/User%7EXoxohthblaster_a00a.html" title="User:Xoxohthblaster">Xoxohthblaster</a> 19:41, 4 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b>: Well, putting aside the semantic debate over what kind of word you want to call it, there's no question that that numerous similar terms have been found notable. It is absolutely proper to use past AfD debates and uncontroversially included articles as precedent in determining whether or not to keep an article. The fact that <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Ivies_fe2e.html" title="Little Ivies">Little Ivies</a>, which again, has a much weaker case, has been kept weighs strongly in favor of keeping this. It's much more dangerous for the deletions to be made arbitrarily and inconsistently than to use precedent to determine community views. --<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheapestcostavoider_7826.html" title="User:Cheapestcostavoider">Cheapestcostavoider</a> 22:43, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, reluctantly. Normally, there are not articles about these things. For example, things called "<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_three.html" title="Big three">big three</a>" just have an entry in a disambiguation page (except <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Three_%28universities%29_42f1.html" title="Big Three (universities)">Big Three (universities)</a>, people love articles about their schools). There are no "big three (automakers)" or "big three (American brewers)" articles. I commend Cheapestcostavoider for his documentation, though. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 02:40, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Minor tweaking and a few sources does not make a non-notable neologism appropriate for wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptaintruth_4f96.html" title="User:Captaintruth">Captaintruth</a> 14:22, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> or at least <b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_School_Rankings_f16b.html" title="Law School Rankings">Law School Rankings</a>, where it is already mentioned. This is widely-used by law students and admissions professionals. I think the other people here probably don't fit either of those categories and feel that the term should be deleted just because they are not personally familiar with it. 128.59.181.59 18:09, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It has been pointed out before that in the entire existence of US News &amp; World Report, there has never been another school to crack the top 14 then these ones. That at least gives credibility to it as at least a creation of snobbery and arrogance. Although I disagree with the principle of placing 14 schools into a certain group on the grounds of prestige, they no doubt have been, and a section titled <b>Controversy</b> should likewise be included in this article. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 168.159.213.36 (<a href="../../../1/6/8/User_talk%7E168.159.213.36.html" title="User talk:168.159.213.36">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_168.159.213.36_47ee.html" title="Special:Contributions/168.159.213.36">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: People seem keen on the argument that those voting delete are simply unfamiliar with this term. I, for one, am quite familiar with it. But my familiarity with it does not equal notability...and I agree with the argument that this is a non-notable neologism. Also, note that the last two keep votes should be heavily discounted, as one was from an unregistered user and the second was unsigned and from an unregistered user. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptaintruth_4f96.html" title="User:Captaintruth">Captaintruth</a> 02:11, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Response</b>: I think it's far to widely-noted to be considered a neologism. Even purely on its incredibly widespread use on discussion boards, it would probably qualify as an internet meme. But of course it doesn't have to rely on this argument. And I don't think it's consistent with the idea of "not biting the newcomers" to categorically disregard reasoned opinions that come from unregistered users (it's not a vote, anyway). For one thing, I wouldn't be entirely opposed to the idea of a merge &amp; redirect to <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_School_Rankings_f16b.html" title="Law School Rankings">Law School Rankings</a> as an alternative to keeping the current article. Of course, I think keeping it would be better, because I think the sources make it clear that the term is widely-used and understood by nearly everyone involved with law school admissions, even the people who don't think it should be as important as it is. -<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheapestcostavoider_7826.html" title="User:Cheapestcostavoider">Cheapestcostavoider</a> 03:10, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
