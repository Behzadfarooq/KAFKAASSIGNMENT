<li>I think it's good enough. I don't see any substantial claims that are not covered by the pertinent literature. (Mind you I'm not a development economist, all my knowledge of the subject is from academic contact with colleagues who are, so I at best have a broad understanding of the major ideas in the field). It's decently sourced, and the link I provided should fill the gaps. If the hangup is the word "latitude", as I said latitude is one of the proxies used, "climate" and "North-south" are others, but from my understanding "geography" is the preferred term. But that's something that can be solved with a page move request.

<li>On the contrary, there are many grounds for deletion. A google search ("Sir Thomas Pocket") turns up nothing, another ("Thomas Pocket") turns up something about pocket watches on its first result, and yet another ("+Thomas Pocket" +inventor) turns up nothing relevant to anyone named Thomas Pocket, let alone a member of the OBE. Further, the books don't seem to exist in any library. This tells me that there are no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, and his existence cannot be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a>.

This is a technical nomination as the deletion review closer, but I will comment. Original deletion rationale was "Page is superfluous as University of Wisconsin is now a redirect to UW-Madison. Per consensus on the talk page, the article can be deleted and the relevant information placed in the specific articles as history of the various universities."

<li><b>Comment</b> As a resident of the state, and a graduate of one of the associated institutions, I'm painfully aware of the "brand confusion" that the current organization causes. As per the page, I'm torn between this page adding more confusion, or serving as a concise usage note that clarifies for people that these are in fact separate institutions. I think two things are needed -- a better explanation of the relationship to the System on the UW-Madison page, and a clearer explanation on the System page. On the other hand, it's certainly cleaner to have just one dab link at the top of each institution's page. -- <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 02:32, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>.

Most people should never see this page, but it will reduce the length of the hatnotes on the listed articles. On the other hand, I completely agree with <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">User:Trialsanderrors</a> that the survival or deletion of this page is a separate matter from where <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Wisconsin_76d5.html" title="University of Wisconsin">University of Wisconsin</a> should point.

<li><b>Keep</b>. There can now be no doubt (if there ever was) that the term <i>University of Wisconsin</i> means different things to different people. There are in fact strong POVs in two different directions, resulting in edit wars and repeated listings at <a href="../../../r/m/_/WP%7ERM_0e45.html" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a>, and making an already confusing situation still more tangled to the outsiders who need the term disambiguated. Attempts to delete the page, or to reduce it to a two-way disambig to justify this deletion, seem to either be part of these POV promotions, or to stem from misunderstandings as to the function of a disambig page. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 16:24, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, per Dekimasu and Andrewa. I lived on Washington Street on Madison's Isthmus for a while, and knew the name was used a couple of ways, but I'm still surprised by the way this has become virtually a POV war. Given the third meaning of the term at <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Wisconsin_%281956-1971%29_c91d.html" title="University of Wisconsin (1956-1971)">University of Wisconsin (1956-1971)</a>, and the demonstrated variety in users' expectations, this is worth the pennies-a-year cost of a dab page compared to hatnotes.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Hmmm? It's neither flagged as a <i>stub</i>, nor does it seem <i>vague</i>, have I missed something? It's short, certainly, with plenty of scope for expansion. The problem with a <i>merge</i> is that it's not obvious which way to merge. Someone who graduated from Green Bay before 1971 graduated from the <i>University of Wisconsin</i>, but they didn't graduate from UW-Madison (obviously), nor from the UW System as it didn't yet exist. Probably we'll have strong opinions on both merge options if we try. Why fix what ain't broke - especially as all possible results seem pre-busted?

<li><b>Comment</b> My thinking on this is that the 56-71 institution is not fundamentally different from the U of W System, so merge in that direction. What is missing and needed, though, is an article History of the University of Wisconsin that covers all of this. It should all be explained in one place. -- <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 10:54, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Agree on the need for a History of the University of Wisconsin article, and also a more general one on the history of the State University systems of the USA. I have previously <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=State_university_system_%28United_States%29&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=State_university_system_%28United_States%29&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">started</a> a general article on these systems, but even the history section of this article remains a very basic stub - it would be a candidate for deletion as a sub-stub if it were a separate article. I have also previously suggested creation of the history article you suggest, but even the inclusion of a history section in the UW-Madison article was resisted, apparently by alumni of the institution. It's been an interesting discussion. Contributors of content to the articles seem a lot thinner on the ground than those to the debate. That's the basic problem IMO.

<li><b>reply to comment</b> - Because a lot of UW-Madison people, in particular, feel that that would be inaccurate and misleading.

<li>I'm puzzled, Trials. Why do you use such terms as "foul" and "worse solution" for a simple dab page? There's no particular stigma attached to dab pages, and they strike me as useful objects.

<li>I firmly believe that any Pareto-type effects are a direct result of the legislature voting to lump everything under one name, not any POV or bad-faith editors. These are bad enough for current/propsective students, but multiplied for us as we need to address the evolution of the term with some accuracy and utility. I believe a two-way hatnote solution only addresses the current name problem, and gives the historical name problem no help, as one has to search for the explanation. I would also throw more than three objects into the dab page, i.e. all the campuses, because while locals can certainly distinguish between UW and UW-M (see, that's Madison and Milwaukee, respectively) and UW-<i>X</i> and UW-Centers with some ease, out-of-staters need a little help. -- <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 11:06, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete BUT</b> only because there are three items in the category, which can easily be placed at the top of the largest/most important article as "University of Wisconsin redirects here, for the more specific Madison, or for ... etc".

<li><b>Keep</b> (as I have not actually&#160;!voted before). My arguments above suffice for the reason this is needed between the "at least two" articles we already have, but one must realize there are innumerable institutions associated wtih one or more of the campuses that also bear the name. My proposed revamp of the page to handle the entirety of the disambiguation problem, geographical, categorical and historical, is at <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_Sandbox_University_of_Wisconsin_%28disambiguation%29_ef97.html" title="User:Dhartung/Sandbox/University of Wisconsin (disambiguation)">User:Dhartung/Sandbox/University_of_Wisconsin_(disambiguation)</a>. It's just a first draft and could be prettier or have better wording, but I think it's helpful both to navigate the different things with the name and to get some idea of their relationship to one another. The Site Map concept, call it. Yes, some of this is available by clicking through, and some of it is on templates for the various campuses, but none of it is currently in one place. -- <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 11:43, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> While Dhartung's proposal is more lengthy and more detailed than typical disambig pages, it appears much more helpful. Normally Kopf1988 would be correct, but we have already seen in previous discussions that his "The only problem is ..." brings strong arguments from both sides that shouldn't be dismissed. The situation calls for more clarification than WP needs even for generally similar cases like the SUNY system. Dhartung's proposed page puts all the related links in one place that can be used when "found by accident". Putting a hatnote on two of the many articles would help only a fraction of the readers looking for information. Putting all these details into a "history of" article wouldn't be quickly useful to most readers. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 13:44, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Kopf1988 was in fact my inspiration. There are far more than three distinct "things" with the name! That's when I realized that this entire debate wasn't about whether we needed disambiguation -- that much is clear -- but on how many bins we're putting things in. Particularly given there are a number of items that don't fit easily in <i>either</i>, not to mention the things that are often confused with the university (like Concordia, or the Medical College of Wisconsin) or loosely affiliated with it.-- <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 14:51, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Good lateral thinking. My three-way attempt was partly motivated by the desire to get a stable long-term solution, and at that it was obviously a miserable failure. There is a grammatical sense in which any <i>University of Wisconsin - XYZ</i> is a sort of University of Wisconsin, and we should remember that not all users (or even editors) of English Wikipedia are <b>native</b> English speakers.

<li><b>Keep</b> Deleting articles just removes the work and research by those that started the article. What a waste of time. I agree some articles need to grow, but just deleting them does not help. People need someplace to start, and creating stubs, ideas, and other elements let Wikipedians work off of something. When you delete you leave nothing to work with. I view it as highly disruptive to the project. I know it is harder to create than destroy, but I hope you can be a creationist. Good luck to you. 13579create 06:29, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

If someone actually wants to create a useable article on the subject - to the degree anyone bothers, because the entire series consists of similar stubs at best - more power to them, but since this stub was created, it (and the other related stubs) hasn't been touched in nine months.

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge/redirect</b> There's no official policy on game module articles as far as I know, but this does seem to be a notable product from a significant publisher. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 19:51, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'll address a lot of the comments here in one. My point is, while it is notable, yes, I agree, but there's no information and no one I know on Wikipedia has the knowledge or willingness to expand them. I'm suggesting to delete them for now, and recreate when we have more information in a new list that I'll create in a little while. Right now, though, it's completely useless, and there's no point in keeping an article such as this. A very wise, wise person once said, "The proliferation of mediocrity is never its own excuse." Take that to heart, please. <i><b><a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoomsDay349_6323.html" title="User:DoomsDay349"><font color="darkblue">Dooms</font></a><a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoomsDay349_7ac1.html" title="User talk:DoomsDay349"><font color="lightblue">Day349</font></a></b></i> 20:42, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Compromise</b>. I realize where this is leaning. Therefore, to compromise. Take the images and put them on the List of Dungeons &amp; Dragons modules, and then redirect the articles there. Is that an acceptable resolution? <i><b><a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoomsDay349_6323.html" title="User:DoomsDay349"><font color="darkblue">Dooms</font></a><a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoomsDay349_7ac1.html" title="User talk:DoomsDay349"><font color="lightblue">Day349</font></a></b></i> 20:56, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The thing is, there's no reason to delete them simply because "I'll create a better article later" as the contents of the articles, while minimal, are nonetheless valid. So, the worst that happens by leaving them up is a few kilobytes of disk space. Big deal. This discussion alone is probably using up more time and energy on people's part than could possibly be saved by deleting them. And to counter your proverb another wise person once said "Don't fix what ain't broken" .

<li>I see your point. I just feel like there's something better than can be done in transition for these articles until I can improve them.

<p><b>Comment'</b> For all the arguments as to notability, the fact is, this was a product of a notable gaming company, and part of an unquestionably notable series. (If you need proof that Dragonlance is notable, just ask yourself if something not notable would have over 100 books involving it. I'm sure somebody could tell you the sales figures and such, but I don't think there's a reason to try). This is, and the other modules which have been nominated, were part of the initial series that introduced Dragonlance to the world. Thus some coverage of it is appropriate, even if it were just to mention its name and a brief description in a discussion of Dragonlance products or the adventure series it was in. I'm willing to say there is a valid question in how best to cover the subject of this article, however, outright deletion, is not the best way. There are other options. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 14:52, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't see the point in overzealous deletionism, if you don't want to read about this topic don't come here. The only <b>Compromise</b> I would see as acceptable is to <b>Merge and Redirect</b> <i>with other modules in the original DL series</i> (Not a general Dragonlance modules article but specifically the intial series of 14), with a section in the article for each of the modules. This would allow each module to be re-created as it's own article when the combined article got too large, and would also mean that there is then a good summary article for the series refering to each individual article. Merging or putting images into List of Dungeons &amp; Dragons modules is not a good idea as this article is long enough already and does not need to be expanded (That it is why it refers to individual module articles). I think there are better things to spend effort on than a merger and redirect, but if someone realy wants to spend the time and do it properly it would be acceptable, provided no information is lost from existing articles. - <a href="../../../w/a/z/User%7EWaza_937d.html" title="User:Waza">Waza</a> 22:39, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's not the point. The point is that a claim was made that the article will improve over time. I'm questioning the basis for that claim, being myself unsure how one can tell by a casual glance at an article that it is destined to be improved. My casual glance says that except for the couple paragraphs thrown in specifically in response to this AfD, no one's touched it and there is nothing to suggest that anyone else is likely to do so. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 18:11, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, I don't know why they think it will eventually be improved, but I think it's because that's what happens with wikipedia articles. As far as nine months going by, that doesn't seem like a long time in the scope of what wikipedia is trying to do. There are tons of D&amp;D stubs, and not that many D&amp;D editors. It's going to take years to finish them all, I would imagine.

<p>Indiscriminate list. There's nothing notable about playing a Nazi character and there's no reason why actors such as Brando and Will Ferrell should be grouped together just because they happened to have portrayed a Nazi at some point in their careers. Saikokira 01:40, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Not "very" similar, unless you consider playing a generic Nazi character as significant as playing the President of the United States. This list is many, many times worse than that one. Saikokira 06:54, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, I consider one type of role about as significant as another for the purpose of lists of actors who play them. I couldn't care less what significance the role plays in a particular actor's career. What's significant is how actors play those roles, and to study that or even have an interest in that would, I think, be the purpose of a reader coming to this article. I think that's a serious purpose well served by a Wikipedia article. I would break up the list at least into categories of "Comedic Nazis", "Menacing Nazis" and "Other". You could probably have a thousand lists of types of characters actors play. Good thing Wikipedia isn't a paper encyclopedia. Too bad this article looks like it's a goner. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 17:01, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> "Comedic" Nazis. Do you mean "Comic" Nazis? That is going far. Comic Nazis have practically always (I cannot think of an exception just now) been the result of "a play in the play". <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bourvil.html" title="Bourvil">Bourvil</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_de_Fun%C3%A8s_bfe6.html" title="Louis de Funès">Louis de Funès</a> in <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Grande_Vadrouille_a467.html" title="La Grande Vadrouille">La Grande Vadrouille</a> are supreme examples of this.

(<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dirty_Dozen_f3bb.html" title="The Dirty Dozen">The Dirty Dozen</a>). "Other Nazis" is even worse. There is nothing exclusively German or exclusively "1933-1945"-ish about Nazism. Who is to stop my POV from including <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wayne_22ff.html" title="John Wayne">John Wayne</a> for his role in <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Berets_ef40.html" title="Green Berets">Green Berets</a>?

<li><b>Delete</b> - actors can play dozens or hundreds of roles in their careers. There's nothing significant about playing a Nazi. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 03:31, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as Otto said "a Nazi" is not a special highight of a career. List of actors who played Adolf Hitler <i>might</i> be comparable to the US President role.

<li>Strong <b>Delete</b>. Apart from being useless, there are a few other problems. Who is to say that Erwin Rommel and other anti-Hitler conspirators like Stauffenberg and York were nazis? Some of them changed their political opinion. What about Standartenführer Stirlitz? Actually, what the author was thinking of was "List of actors who once played a role which involved wearing a German WWII uniform." Silly. But add the word "black" before "actors" and it becomes less silly, of course. --<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Gerwazy_8ca1.html" title="User:Pan Gerwazy">Pan Gerwazy</a> 15:02, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, because it's an indiscriminate list: any prolific film actor would probably be cast as a Nazi at some point. I wouldn't be opposed to a list of actors who have made a specialism of playing Nazis. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Blacketer_4423.html" title="User:Sam Blacketer">Sam Blacketer</a> 17:01, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, because other lists, such as one of actors who play presidents have been voted as keeps, and also because Nazis are one of the most influential and therefore significant groups of the 20th century, regardless of their wickedness, and therefore readers of Wikipedia, whether historians, or just people interested in films, are really likely to check out such useful and relevant articles as this one.

<p>Just a list of 8 characters from a 2000 Sci-Fi Channel series called <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Invisible_Man_%282000_TV_series%29_1bde.html" title="The Invisible Man (2000 TV series)">The Invisible Man</a>, and this list already exists at the main article. Usually I would just change this to a redirect, but the title is ambiguous, considering the infinitely more well-known H.G. Wells original and many other TV series with the same name, so it would be better just to delete it. Saikokira 02:13, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Merge</b> into <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Invisible_Man_%282000_TV_series%29_1bde.html" title="The Invisible Man (2000 TV series)">The Invisible Man</a></i>. The list article seems to have more content than what's in the main article, so I wouldn't just dispose of the information. But there's certainly no reason it needs to stand on its own in a separate article. Just make the list article a section within the show's main article. Per Saikokira, no redirect. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 02:49, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> for now into the TV series article. I understand the intention here -- to create an article similar to the one created for character from <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heroes_%28TV_series%29_e274.html" title="Heroes (TV series)">Heroes</a> for example, but there really isn't enough material in both articles to support two articles. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 05:14, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep both, on condition of cleanup and a probable merge</b> - I think we should discount the point on WP:MUSIC - this is NOT a debate to make value judgements on individual bands and whether they are notable - that can be made on an individual article basis with AfDs if that is to be the case. The "List of Australians in music" is a useful article as Australia has a wide and varied music culture, and the musicians involved in it are just as important as the music itself - and it could easily have criteria, Peta, if we did some work on it (which no one is keen to do). It is not easily replaced by a category, either; let's think about the alternatives to deleting this list: the alternative would be an article on Australians in music, not a category: and it would be an article where someone would have to make value judgements on who is and is not able to be included; a list can encompass more people and can be maintained and pruned accordingly. Let's not just go deleting lists because we think they overlap with categories too much (as I think is being done quite rashly at the moment) - let's fix them up first and improve them instead. If that includes a name change, setting down some criteria of who should and should not be in the list (eg (just a suggestion), you could have people who have made it onto various notable music charts in the top 100 or something??), and some major culling, so be it, but let's not waste the good work done by several editors encompassed in this list - it's already a good start and should be improved upon, not consigned to the dustbin simply because a couple of editors think it's superfluous. <a href="../../../j/r/g/User%7EJRG_cdbe.html" title="User:JRG">JRG</a> 12:31, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete both</b>. JRG's suggestions are reasonable, but I don't think these lists as they stand are necessarily helpful starting points to create properly referenced List of Australian top 40 performers, which would have tables listing group/artist name, single title, album title, and dates or List of ARIA Award nominees with artist, award nominated for, year, and nomination (if it's for a song or album). These lists may need to be moved to user or <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Australia_0645.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Australia">project</a> space for a while to use as references, but the blue links should eventually end up in (subcategories of) <a href="../../../a/u/s/Category%7EAustralian_musicians_f6b9.html" title="Category:Australian musicians">Category:Australian musicians</a> (or related for the non-musicians "in music"), and the red links get filtered for vanity links, but then added to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Australia_To-do_b327.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Australia/To-do">Wikipedia:WikiProject Australia/To-do</a> until an article can be created. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 14:24, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No it's not. Lists and categories are different things and they can co-exist. I think editors here need to realise that.

<dd>Lists and categories are different things, and therefore their strengths lie in different areas. Lists such as these that have vague or hugely inclusive criteria are not useful. Lists with well-defined and tractable membership that identify the membership as notable and contain additional information are different to categories that contain alphabetic-sorted lists of people with articles only. This means a number of lists with loose criteria were created in the early days of the project as aides-memoire. These are no longer needed or appropriate as the project has evolved. Many "good" lists have associated categories. So do many "bad" or obsolete lists. Some of these are being cleaned up. You appear to show up at every discussion and claim that if it was cleaned up, the list would be OK. Most of the ones being considered are so far from being a suitable list that it would be better to start afresh with proper references, if they could ever be made suitable.

<dd>If it is about cleaning things up, why won't anyone help out? Everyone's so mega-keen to delete anything, yet no one can be bothered to put in the good work and actually do some cleaning up and create some useful Australian lists. Why can't we keep these here so we can actually know what we need to improve on. Wikipedia is not about having every article perfect -it's also a work in progress, and these sort of articles help us to understand where we need to clean things up.

<dd>Most of the lists we're looking at are not getting nominated, so you don't have to advocate in a deletion debate for most of them. Since you sound like you think it's personal, here's some evidence that we are helping too.

<dd>None of us (you included) get to these edit counts without doing <i>something</i> good for the project! Sometimes it's adding content, sometimes cleaning, tidying and formatting, and sometimes it's putting the rubbish out. The deleted lists are like cleaning up and putting out the recycling. I don't want the place full of lists that attract vanity edits. An article about the person can stand in its own right to demonstrate notability. If there is no reliable reference <i>for the list</i>, it is usually better as a category. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 13:50, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Well ... after having gone through the first several of them, they are either posts from a bulletin board, articles where he is named as an arrested protester, articles about someone else where he is quoted speaking about the article's subject or (in the first case) where he isn't mentioned at all.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Go ahead and get rid of the entry if you insist-- I am relatively new and perhaps I don't comprehend the criteria well enough. Let me just point out that first you wanted to strike the entry because you claimed the items didn't pertain to Unti. Discovering you were wrong, you now offer another set of reasons based on triviality. He's one of the top officials at the largest animal group in the country. If someone wants to ever start reading about the issues they are going to run into his work. He's an encyclopedist himself if you look at the DAH and encyclopedia entries he authored.Schweizerbueb 12:47, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>In general, I would prefer the sources being left inside the article for everybody's so that everyone can easily check for themselves whether they pertain and if so, whwther in a more than trivial sense. That being said, I also do not see the in-depth coverage of Unti as required by teh notability criteria for persons cited above. As much of his work and publications seem to be either about the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humane_Society_of_the_United_States_79a0.html" title="Humane Society of the United States">Humane Society of the United States</a> (HSUS) or related to or performed in in his role as Policy Adviser of the HSUS, I would suggest to (slightly) <b>merge and redirect</b> there. <a href="../../../t/i/k/User%7ETikiwont_2b2d.html" title="User:Tikiwont">Tikiwont</a> 13:45, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't think so. The "Israeli criticism of HRW" is about the same length as the current article. If the whole criticism article could be cut down to say 4 paragraphs, as I tried to do <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Human_Rights_Watch&amp;diff=66914335&amp;oldid=66907642" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Human_Rights_Watch&amp;diff=66914335&amp;oldid=66907642" rel="nofollow">here</a>, then maybe we could merge it back in. But not as it currently stands. Of course the criticism article is larger now and so couldn't focus solely on Israel. - <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">Francis Tyers</a> <a href="../../../f/-/m/User_talk%7EF-m-t_cc17.html" title="User talk:F-m-t">·</a> 09:13, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Ashley: please keep in mind that occasionaly, <i>criticism of...</i> is an important part of an issue. Criticism of HRW cannot be concluded from the given facts (unlike, say, an unjust war or some controversial governmental policy which is bound to go both ways), but actually adds to the description of HRW — as an NGO, they step on many feet, and cause reactions which influence their work — one way or another. <span style="color:red">★</span>čabrilo<span style="color:red">★</span> 00:03, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> — Perhaps <i>Criticism of...</i> articles are not always good, but in this particular case, criticism that HRW faces is a big part of their daily functioning and, if I may say, identity. NGOs are always under scrutiny from one place or the other and we would miss a big part of the large picture if we didn't get into describing the systematic criticism. <span style="color:red">★</span>čabrilo<span style="color:red">★</span> 10:14, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>So many of these names sound made-up, and <i>every single one of them</i> is unsourced. Nerd stick? Sex drive? Geek whistle?

It is attracting as much editing action as the main ANS article, and by having it separate from the main ANS article, it is keeping both relatively stable.

In a month (or so), things will have calmed down and more may well be known (the autopsy and the CSI story are yet to come).

<li><b>Delete and Merge</b>. While she was a celebrity, Anna Nicole's death did not contribute anything to American law, to Bahamian law, to drug testing, or anything that isn't really self-contained. If her death had touched off a larger scale change in the status quo, then I would be for keeping it. I feel a decent amount of what's on this article currently can be condensed successfully; let's merge it back into the ANS article until such a time arises when a) the ANS article becomes too large, b) the information regarding her death becomes more relevant to a larger story. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakazette_79d5.html" title="User:Freakazette">Freakazette</a> 23:43, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge and Delete</b> This is not Wiki News. The fact that it is a current event is irrelevant. The creation of a free standing article was premature. Her cause of death has not even been determined, yet. Editors need to be disciplined enough to confine the truly encyclopedic content into the subject's biography. The free-standing article has become a platform for tabloid, non-encyclopedic material. If Anna Nicole was, in fact, murdered and a trial ensues, then a free standing article, akin to the <a href="../../../o/2E/j/O.J._Simpson_murder_case_9e04.html" title="O.J. Simpson murder case">O.J.

<li>That the cause of death hasn't been determined is irrelevant. That there has been no murder trial is irrelevant. Notability is assigned to whatever people choose to pay attention to. If she was murdered, and there was a trial, but it received little attention and we therefore had few sources to work from, then it would probably be inappropriate to create a separate article. If all she had done was stub her toe, but people chose to pay an enormous amount of attention to that for some reason, then it would be appropriate to create a separate article for that. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 16:56, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>If there's an imbalance, the solution is to write more on other subjects, not delete notable information about this subject.

<li>The key phrase there is "notable information." As Arkyan correctly cites below, massive quotation lists and 911 transcripts do not remotely qualify. No doubt there's a 911 transcript from whomever found Elvis dead (for instance), but we don't need to clutter the article with it. Exactly what about Smith's death <i>is</i> notable? The allegations of suicide or foul play are inappropriate pending official reports, so all that is notable is that she (a) died young, (b) had a post-mortem custody controversy and (c) had a post-mortem burial controversy. All of that could have been handled in two or three paragraphs. Wikipedia is not wastepaper. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 17:44, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

As an encyclopedia there is no reason to editorialize every minute detail connected to her death. In any case keeping it would justify creating a "Death of" article for every famous person, and that's unecessary duplication. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 16:23, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>That the subject of her death has been covered extensively and is extremely notable is beyond doubt. I'm certainly not questioning whether the article passes inclusion criteria, just the necessity of a standalone article. Granted this is my own opinion, but I think it could do without the massive quotations, transcripts of 911 calls and other extreme detail that to me feels less like informative content and more like fluff. The section about the paternity dispute of the child is something that was only triggered by her death and really isn't a topic that should be covered under it. My point is that, according to my views of what makes for a good article, enough content can be removed from the article without actually hurting the integrity of the information that it could be safely merged back in to the parent article. Feel free to disagree, and whichever way consensus goes I'm happy to abide by. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 17:08, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>A New Type of Wikipedia Article?</b></p>
<p>Folks, I wonder if we have invented a new type of Wikipedia article with the Death of ANS. On the one hand, the story is more than the daily (or even weekly) WikiNews. On the other hand, as things settle down, the article will eventually be condensed and merged into the main ANS. This suggests that our new invention is a time-delimited article, probably of two months, at which point a call for Merger would almost automatically kick in. With this new type of article, there would be no need for <b>every</b> Wikipedia article to be seen as "permanent" -- whatever that means in the world of Wikis and the Internet. <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBellagio99_a908.html" title="User:Bellagio99">Bellagio99</a> 02:01, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't think we've invented anything new. We have a (rather common) case of editors who seem to feel there's a prize for being the First To Make The Edit conflated both by a lack of judgment as to whether information is timeless or trivial and by the certitude that whatever drum E! Tonight is thumping on any given week Must Be Of Vital Importance. I'm sure many of you have seen that in the fields you follow, recent or immediate news gets as much space in articles as all the previous history of the subject combined. Unfortunately, the only way this syndrome will be corrected is with time. The Wikipedians of five years from now will trim these bloated, superficial articles down. I doubt we'll be allowed to do so. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 13:50, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - it is quite reasonable to have a news story as a separate article while the story remains current. Whenever there is a newsworthy event we get lots of new readers who might stay and start editing. As a separate article it makes it easier to find the information and it stops the main article from being overloaded. When it stops being current then a keep/merge view can be taken. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerriersFan_e633.html" title="User:TerriersFan">TerriersFan</a> 04:08, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>No doubt it's <i>possible</i>, but it's not desirable. People who want to read about this stuff will be disappointed by Wikipedia's deliberately restricted coverage. "Oh, yeah, we used to have more information about that, but then we decided our readers don't really need to know it." I don't think that is remotely the spirit of Wikipedia. Having less information on this does not help anyone at all. Being able to cut things down is not a virtue. Being able to write good intros and summaries is a virtue, but not when it means the exclusion of detail. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 06:38, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Part of writing an encyclopedia is summarizing and being selective as to what information is included.

There is a pretty big difference between "all college journals are not notable" and "not all college journals are notable". Secondly, while the independence of the journal may give it the right to a separate article, continued existence on wiki is still contingent on editors establishing its <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>, and furnishing sufficient <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">references</a> from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> to support same.

<dd>The historical record is much, much larger than what the Wikipedia readership can easily access-- pure and simple. And that is one good reason for exercising a soft hand with deletion and such discussions, rather than having a procedurally focused 'thought police' (yes that's perjorative!) who scour the Wikipedia-space looking to remove articles that don't fit their particular subjective perspective on what is notable. The 'notability' criterion, to have significance, must be applied <b>objectively</b>. Practically, this means that as contributors and editors, the responsibility lies on each of us to make good faith efforts to determine the "truth of things"-- whether a particular article is 'notable,' etc, based on evidence we can find-- and to consider the limitations of our own subjective perspective.</dd>
<dd>That said, RGTraynor's particular arguments thus seem in violation of the Wikipedia ethics: to gloss another FAQ, its not up to the community to educate users, its up to users to read the governance FAQs and documentation, educate themselves, act in accordance with the semi-consensus model, and not "grind axes!"</dd>
<dd>Somewhat OT, the publication requirement has IMHO also reached the limitations of its 'scope' in a case like this; we're asking a higher standard of "volunteer" editors that than the NYT asks of reporters. Yes, I can cite examples; the point is, I don't have to!</dd>
<dd>Finally, "PS," there's a direct historical connection between the Williams Record and the Daily Cal, and if we delete the Record, we will risk "falling down a slippery slope" where we have to delete the Daily Cal-- which seems to (but may not) meet the 'notability' requirement. In such a case, there are two options (forks): delete both, or revise our sense of 'notability.' I beleive the community will have to do the latter.
<dl>
<dd>Footnote: Note most of the evidently 'independent' references to the Daily Cal in other media are the result of Daily Cal personnel moving to other publications and making those references-- this is also true of the Williams Record (historically). And from my (subjective) POV it is trivial to assert that the Record is more 'notable' than the Daily Cal (argument truncated for now).</dd>
<dd>Footnote comment: There is currently no Wikipedia article for the Russellville, KY publication 'News-Democrat,' which, from a presentist perspective, is less notable than the Williams Record. The fact that the archives of the ND are only accessible in microfiche in Russellville should not obscure the fact that the ND published early articles from William Jennings Bryant and Robert Penn-Warren; just the opposite. A "stub" should not be deleted simply because of the lack of the Wikipedia community's research or the difficult of "verifiability:" it should be preserved to remind us of the tasks to be accomplished, else we succumb to the perspective limitations our media. (Again, this challenges the scope definitions and limitations of the {POV} policy (as expressed), which is itself a <b>historical</b> construction with it own self-referential "{POV}" problems. In short: the {POV} policy derives from the Wikipedia encounter with physics "kooks" and has scope applicability problems when applied outside that defined context. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenThomas_647f.html" title="User:KenThomas">KenThomas</a> 23:16, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Great, there are a number of links which we can't access. Are any of them <i>about</i> the Record, as is required, as opposed to so-called "trivial mentions" of it? No one is disputing that the paper exists, but heck, I'm sure I could come up with otherwise non-notable community leaders that have been quoted by local newspapers more than seven times in thirty years. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 15:56, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>First of all, by <i>we</i> you mean <i>you</i>. I'm sure a large number of wiki readers accessing from a decent school can access the articles. Second, a large number of these articles use The Record as a primary source for their article and as such, give it proper attribution. If the argument is that this is "a low circulation journal not known outside the college," these repeated mentions in the <i><b>New York Times</b></i> and <i><b>Boston Globe</b></i> are evidence to the contrary. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESERSeanCrane_d75c.html" title="User:SERSeanCrane">SERSeanCrane</a> 23:13, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Merge</b> Non-notable. References seem sketchy and terse. WP:Local seems the best reference for this:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>If enough attributable information exists about the subject to write a full and comprehensive article about it, it may make sense for the subject to have its own article. If some source material is available, but is insufficient for a comprehensive article, it is better to mention the subject under the article for its parent locality. If no source material, or only directory-type information (location, function, name, address) can be provided, the subject may not merit mention yet at all.:</dd>
</dl>
<p>So basically, we have some newspapers that may reference it but there isn't enough info to merit a full article. I say merge and start a Publications header in <a href="../../../w/i/l/Williams_College_d6ab.html" title="Williams College">Williams College</a> like in <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swarthmore_College_d010.html" title="Swarthmore College">Swarthmore College</a> (where they also mention independent publications of the school so I don't see the objection about merging). <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChevinki_c5c7.html" title="User:Chevinki">Chevinki</a> 04:09, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Their first product will be launched on April 1st, so the statement that they have "no product" is misleading. They are self funded, and looking for additional seed capital, so the statement that they have "no money" is also incorrect. Would you consider waiting until after April 1st to delete this?</p>

<p>Article for a webcomic. It asserts notability, so it's not a candidate for A7.

<p>A pastor. He ran a church. Er, that's about it. The only external source is a news report about an accusation of child molestation. Appears to exist solely to cast aspersion on fundamental Baptism, which is understandable (I don't think much of the fundies either) but not a good reason to have a substantially unsourced negative article on a living individual. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 09:05, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

The only problem here is that this kind of dance is being performed as well as patroned by the masses. Most of the Wikipedians belong to the elite class of Tamil Nadu, and hence may not have heard about this. As per the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="WP:N">Guidelines</a>, <i>Subjective evaluations are not relevant for determining whether a topic warrants inclusion in Wikipedia. Notability criteria do not equate to personal or biased considerations, such as: "never heard of this", "an interesting article", "topic deserves attention", "not famous enough", "very important issue", "popular", "I like it", "only of interest to [some group]", etc. Notability is not judged by Wikipedia editors directly. The inclusion of topics on Wikipedia is a reflection of whether those topics have been included in reliable published works. Other authors, scholars, or journalists have decided whether to give attention to a topic, and in their expertise have researched and checked the information about it. Thus, the primary notability criterion is a way to determine whether "the world" has judged a topic to be notable. This is unrelated to whether a Wikipedia editor personally finds the subject remarkable or worthy.</i> <span style="border:1px solid #000;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMariano_Anto_Bruno_Mascarenhas_f6b6.html" title="User:Mariano Anto Bruno Mascarenhas"><font style="color:#ffd700;background:#000;"><b>&#160;Doctor Bruno&#160;</b></font></a></span> 08:49, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> See <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohiniaattam.html" title="Mohiniaattam">Mohiniaattam</a> That is a form of dance like the subject of this article. That article does not have any references. But that has not been listed as OR or called unencyclopedic. The reason is because Wikipedian editors know about that dance and hence do not ask for a reference. But this form of dance is being practicised by the Illiterate masses. Hence this immediately becomes "unencyclopedic". When references are cited, it will become "non-notable" while Mohiniattam will continue to be both encyclopedic as well as notable..... This is what is called as <a href="../../../c/s/b/WP%7ECSB_93c9.html" title="WP:CSB">Systemic Bias</a> My comments are just to highlight the fact that we have not still eliminated the Systemic Bias from Wikipedia, and even though this is considered to be an Encyclopedia, Wikipedia is turning out to be the domain of "few selected people". And this trend is not good for the project and will be detrimental to the Wikipedia in long run <span style="border:1px solid #000;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMariano_Anto_Bruno_Mascarenhas_f6b6.html" title="User:Mariano Anto Bruno Mascarenhas"><font style="color:#ffd700;background:#000;"><b>&#160;Doctor Bruno&#160;</b></font></a></span> 08:59, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. When I created this article back in 2005, there weren't many references online for this cultural practice. Now that there are, I hardly think it qualifies as <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> or <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. I have deleted the Steps section since I myself felt that was more like a how-to than a neutral description. As a former frequent editor of the article, I feel this cultural practice is notable enough to be documented. However, I do see recurring problems with the article in that it tends to become more of a how-to, written for a narrow audience comprised of people who have lived in <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chennai.html" title="Chennai">Chennai</a> at some point.

<li><b>Comment</b>. (I'm too closely involved in this to render a decision.) On the one hand, we do have tons of articles on actors and acresses, and they typically have a list of works, as they should; start-class articles also commonly feature some kind of staff/cast list. On the other hand, our other featured articles on meda works only list the most significant cast and staff. Will this thing ever evolve beyond a list of staff? And what then happens with all those start-class articles on works that mainly consist of staff and cast/character lists? Does the information somehow stop being unencyclopedic when the article grows? The avenues for keeping I see now are
<ul>
<li>Either become innovative with this list and make it a featured staff list in some way.</li>
<li>Making this article the "Production of RahXephon" article, necessitating more prose content.</li>

<li>The main issue with this article is that it tends to promote Womadhism as opposed to describing it. However, this could be easily fixed with a few simple edits.

Indeed, I can find no evidence whatsoever that such a centre exists, let alone sources that document it (even unreliable ones). The domain name given is <i>not</i> the domain name of such a centre.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Actually at many universities there are two status, emiritus or retired, the first is an honor with benefits, the latter is not.

<dd>Well, that may be so, but it doesn't change the fact that simply being emeritus is not especially notable.

<p><b>Comment</b> For the benfit of contributors from the US who may not be aware, in the UK the title 'professor' is far more important than an American professor which seems to be synonymous with any university teacher (we would call that a lecturer). A UK professor is usually equivalent to head of a university department (see <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professor.html#Most_other_English-speaking_countries" title="Professor">Professor#Most other English-speaking countries</a>) So, being a professor is notable, and the award of emeritus, granted by fellows, is more so. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 13:38, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Oh, we're aware of it. Nothing in <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROFTEST_d942.html" title="WP:PROFTEST">WP:PROFTEST</a> accords automatic notability to department chairs, either; it just isn't notable in of itself. Really, the issue at stake here is simple: is he widely regarded as a significant expert in his field? If so, it should be easy to provide sources backing that up. If sources attesting to his notability <i>don't</i> exist, then it seems he isn't all that widely regarded after all. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 14:26, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> probably a borderline case but I want to note that being an emeritus professor or having written a bunch of reviews (!) is clearly not sufficient. The key question, which supporters have failed to address, is whether there exist sufficient third-party coverage of his work to built an article in line with <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>: <a href="../../../j/s/t/Jstor.html" title="Jstor">Jstor</a> shows that Kirk has written a number of journal articles, not just reviews. He has also written a few books, and it is a priori extremely unlikely that somebody publishing books with publishers such as <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clarendon_Press_9e4f.html" title="Clarendon Press">Clarendon Press</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/u/Routledge.html" title="Routledge">Routledge</a>, as Robert Kirk has done, will <i>not</i> be reviewed in the leading journals. Jstor also finds some reviews:
<ul>

<li>Kirk's <i>Relativism and reality: a contemporary introduction</i> (London: Routledge, 1999), was reviewed by John Greco in <i>The Philosophical Quarterly</i>, Vol. 50, No. 201 (Oct., 2000), pp. 552-553, and by Gerald Doppelt in <i>The Philosophical Review</i>, Vol. 111, No. 1 (Jan., 2002), pp. 142-147.</li>

<p>This was tagged with prod, but I'm not so sure it fits that definition. 500 career games and being in the hall of fame seem to imply notability, if sources can be found. <strike><b>No opinion</b> yet on retaining.</strike> <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankiveil_3447.html" title="User:Lankiveil">Lankiveil</a> 12:55, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Having the most wins of any football coach is sufficiently significant enough to merit retention in Wikipedia. I worry that the nomination for deletion was motivated by someone loyal to a school which plays agains Mr. McKissick's teams.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The image is a copyright violation, and the image page states that it was photoshopped as a hoax. Additionally, while three of the references exist, several others do not.

<p>On the surface, this looks like a legit article, until you realize that this is a 20-year old who's only claim to fame is writing in the local press about his High School sports teams, and a soon-to-be-published book about, yes, his High School football team. This appears to be a vanity bio, given the history of who's edited it, so I have <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> concerns as well as notability concerns. It might be a candidate for userfying, but until this "journalist" is published a bit more widely, the ariticle doesn't seem to meet our notability standards. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 14:01, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>The book has nothing to do with my own high school football team. I didn't play high school football. It's an objective book about the Dynasties of Long Island high school football and the first of its kind. The bio on wiki fits the criteria and is better than half of the bios that are not credible at all. Who are you to say that what I've done is not credible, at 20, I'm more successful than most of the people that age. CRV338 15 March 2007

If your book gets published, and highly reviewed, then you might be an appropriate subject for an article, but let someone else write it. For example, I myself have published a book, and it even has multiple non-trivial reviews. But, you won't find my writing about it or myself, as that would be inappropriate. I have mentioned it on my user page, which is exactly where you should be mentioning yours, hence my suggestion in the nom to userfy. <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 15:34, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Here is what he writes back... "He's not listed in the Biography and Genealogy Master Index, which indexes the standard biographical sources. Quinton published a couple of books, Maximes sur la guerre which has been translated into English as Soldier's testament: selected maxims of Rene Quinton [he is supposed to have died from war wound], L'eau de mer, milieu organique: constance du milieu originel, comme milieu vital des cellules a travers la serie animale and L'eau de mer en injections isotoniques sous-cutanees en pavillon des debiles de la maternite; the last two apparently have not been translated. None is particularly common. There's also what appears to be a biographpy, Rene Quinton: origines marines de la vie, lois de constance originelles. I found one article, Loi generale de constance originelle du milieu vital des cellules in Revue des idees, 1904."</i> Nice bit of research proving him non-notable. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Cuerden_a555.html" title="User talk:Adam Cuerden">talk</a></sup> 17:04, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm sure every school claims they have the most beautiful grounds, and Aquinas College (which is in Salter Point) is notable, this AfD is about the above article which is just a copy paste of part of the original article for no real reason <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielT5_5528.html" title="User:DanielT5">DanielT5</a> 09:26, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>But according to WP:N - "notable if it has been the subject of published material and is independent of the subject, reliable, and most importantly, attributable" - this article has ~ten inderpendant sources stated in reference section. 07:46, 17 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, "the <b>subject</b> of published material". It has to be published material whose <i>subject</i> is Aquinas College Salter Point Campus. The subject of the westcourt website is Christian Brothers' Schools and Ministries (incidentally that site does not appear to support the assertion that you've referenced with it). The subject of the <i>City of South Perth Municipal Heritage Inventory</i> is the heritage places of the City of South Perth. The subject of <i>Peninsular City</i> is the social history of South Perth. The subject of the <i>Mount Henry Peninsula Management Plan</i> is the Mount Henry Peninsula. The fact that these sources mention Aquinas College Salter Point Campus does not confer notability upon it. And that's why Aquinas College is notable, and Aquinas College Salter Point Campus is not. <a href="../../../h/e/s/User_talk%7EHesperian_5634.html" title="User talk:Hesperian">Hesperian</a> 10:22, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

When someone wants to write about the character in a way which meets the relevant policies and guidelines, and which is too big to fit in the list, that's the time to split it out into a separate article. The nominator can redirect or merge the material even if the AFD results in a keep decision, and probably should. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 01:35, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is a defunct publication, that was, in-fact, a publication by an RV dealer, for the benefit of that dealer. Since the publication is gone, was a small publication, and was, very much a vanity publication. I think this article fails to meet Wiki standards for being useful and/or informative.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Hi, I'm the articles original creator. The article that was deleted was not nearly as expansive as this one. This one, if I do say so myself is amazing. yes, it is about an internet cartoon, but this internet cartoon is quite popular, and the page is not just a small piece on it: it is full coverage. So no, this article should not be deleted. It is not written like an advertisement, has a lot of information, and is just such a large coverage of the topic. No, again, it should stay. As for the guidelines, well, the article is not written like an advertisement, rather, like an encyclopedia. The site is well enough known I believe, and that is that. Please post here if you disagree.--<a href="../../../s/c/a/User%7EScabloo_3cc2.html" title="User:Scabloo">Scabloo</a> 23:24, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Kudos to the animation. It really <i>is</i> hilarious. But at this risk of getting "totally added" to the sign . . . the fact remains that unless someone can spell out what these awards are, so we can evaluate their importance, I'm afraid I just don't see how any of the criteria listed in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> are met. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 00:45, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b> As has been noted, the article is much more expansive than the one that was deleted last time. Also, I don't see how it's not notable. It won some awards and has a decent sized user base.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Once again, I ask: exactly what are these awards that it has won? Heck, I can actually truthfully claim that I'm an award-winning playwright. Am I notable now? (The award was best parody of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest_a2b3.html" title="The Importance of Being Earnest">The Importance of Being Earnest</a></i> in my high school English class in 12th grade.) If these awards that the web site has won are legit, then by all means share and that will certainly influence my opinion, and probably others' too. But as long as no one is willing to name them, that seems pretty suspicious to me. And if the awards are not legit, then what criterion of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> does this site meet? <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 19:00, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>'<b>Comment'</b> - Even so, it is obviously fairly popular. The forum has 669 members, 223708 posts and 4740 topics.

<li><b>Answer:</b> I'm not aware (correct me if I'm wrong) of it appearing in any publications outside Wikipedia. I assume that if it did this page would contain links to it.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Because it is fairly popular, and it *has* gotten some daily awards on newgrounds. The creator also says he won an award at a local college.--<a href="../../../s/c/a/User%7EScabloo_3cc2.html" title="User:Scabloo">Scabloo</a> 19:14, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Then I suggest you add the awards to the article. Though winning an award at a local college does not make it noteworthy, I think.

<li><b>Comment</b>. There would probably be no harm in having a Wikipedia article about my niece's pet hamster, either. That doesn't mean there should be one. But the important thing is that at least we're acknowledging that the only <i>real</i> arguments anyone is presenting for keeping are <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/g/WP%7EBIGNUMBER_dfb6.html" title="WP:BIGNUMBER">WP:BIGNUMBER</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/h/WP%7ENOHARM_b472.html" title="WP:NOHARM">WP:NOHARM</a>. For the reasons put forth in their essay sections, I can't say I find any of those arguments particularly compelling such that they'd justify making this an exception to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I can't imagine that's anywhere near what <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> has in mind for a "well-known award". But again, it's just my opinion. And of course <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is a guideline, not a policy, and thus is more apt to be subject to exceptions than are policies. <i><b>I</b></i> don't personally feel this site should be given such an exception, so I still say, without hesitation, to delete. And I'd note that of the four who have thus far argued for "keep", one is the article creator and two of the other three are <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">SPA's</a>. But all of that said, others are certainly free to have a differing opinion, and if the article ultimately remains, as much as I'll disagree with that, it's probably not exactly going to make my Top 10 list of "Wikipedia articles with which I have a problem". (If it is deemed notable enough to stay, though, and if I'm featured as a Wikipeida villain in the next animation, then I'm going to try to press a claim of <i>inherited</i> notability and create an article for myself.)&#160;;-) <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 00:32, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - well, an award is better than none. Also, even though he can't prove i on the internet, the creator of the animation says he won an award at a local college. I know it probably doesn't count (It would be pretty crazy if it did), but i might as well mention it.Anyways - yes, 2 people who voted for Keep are SPAs, but it isnt like they are saying "Fred The Monkey FTW! Keep da Article m@te!" they posted a reply in, in my opinion, an accountable way. Finally, going back to your nieces hamster, in comparison, most likely no one publically knows, or really cares (no offense) about it. Here however, people do know, and care about the article / animation.--<a href="../../../s/c/a/User%7EScabloo_3cc2.html" title="User:Scabloo">Scabloo</a> 00:47, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Let me be clear that I didn not mean to suggest, even for a moment, that a SPA cannot contribute to the debate in an intelligent manner. I only bring up the point because it does at least call into question one's neutrality on the subject. I absolutely assume that all contributors to the argument are making their contributions honestly and in good faith, SPA or not. But I would argue that if a person hasn't done anything else or much else on Wikipedia besides work on Fred the Monkey, then it's at least possible that their perspective on whether that article should be kept may be a bit biased. Especially if the arguments they cite for keeping it are not supported by any Wikipedia policies or guidelines. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 20:20, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> So it appears a bunch of the keeps are SPAs. I've contributed to Wikipedia quite a bit in the past, just never made an account. All I'm saying is that it'd be a shame if the article was deleted again. So much was put into this one and it's so much better than the one that was deleted before it. Also, as has been noted, the site does have a pretty large following. The forums, while not as large as say IGN, they've still got a decent number of users and a ton of posts. The toons have been on newground.com and have won a few awards over there. So yes, they may not be the most well known awards, but shouldn't the fan base speak for something, too? <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstoc_cccb.html" title="User:Astoc">Astoc</a> 00:50, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I agree. Just because someone appears to have only contributed to the Fred the Monkey article doesn't mean that that's all that they have done.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Everyone should remember (and I've now added the template at the top to serve as a reminder) that this is <b>not</b> a vote. The decision will be made by the merits of people's arguments, <b>not</b> on the basis of how many "votes" each side has. It is perfectly acceptable for an IP to offer arguments for consideration. In this case, even those voting to keep seem to acknowledge that the site doesn't meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.

<li><b>PLEASE DELETE!!!</b> Alas I have had to come on here and I must point out that I have come on here only because this debate/discussion is about me, I have no intentions of using my sign in name/ID whatever, for any other purpose. This is a waste of my time, but as they say, necessities must. I would much rather be enjoying a walk in the countryside, which I love. Computers and Internet can waste so much time and are so artificial, that is why I love nature.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I would very much like the article Baron Barrymore Halpenny to be deleted. I never asked to be on this website or listed here and the first I knew about it was from an e-mail to me from Mr. Goldburg. I now find it through Google when checking my Websites. I appreciate Mr. Goldburg’s intentions and maybe he’s right and maybe he’s not, but as I made clear to him in an e-mail (part of which he put on here and I was a little annoyed as the e-mail was to him only), I would much rather people come to my website if they want to know about me or my art.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I’m very angry that on Google, this website called wikipedia appears when “googling” my name and has detrimental and damaging references to me regarding being “not notable”, deleting etc. this for something I had nothing to do with. Before this wiki thing came onto the scene, my name brought a clean list on Google for my websites, making it easy for people to access my material etc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As it is, I want the article about me deleting as it serves me no purpose being on here and I have explained my reasons. As to being notable? If only you really knew, but I’m not saying here as I know Mr. Goldburg would use it to list me again and that would defeat my object of getting the Article removed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I encountered from an early age, jealousy and bitterness. People who did not know me had already made up their minds about me. I was brought up not to be jealous and to be open-minded. All coins have two sides and before you open your mouth look at both sides.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So I actually set out to control as much as possible, what’s written about me when I was in my late teens. This is why I don’t do interviews now (if I did do one I would have to have the right to vet it), and why information is funnelled through my websites that I control.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I will have an art agent for my commercial work and galleries that deal with my paintings. And I like it this way.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have done a few book covers for my father and for other people. I have also done illustrations for books. I love cartoons and use pseudonyms for certain ones. I enjoy my art and you may well have seen my work without knowing it. It is my Art I want you to see, like and enjoy. I want you to know my Art … not me.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don’t really want to come on here again, so I don’t want to see these annoying references on Google again. So I would very much like an Administrator to REMOVE the Article about me and also all these daft references of deletion etc and stop Google and other search engines picking them up. Thank you!</dd>

<li><b>YOU HAVE TO KEEP</b> Well I seem to be left a bit alone on this one. But I know that I am right. The problem is that the other editors are too lazy and rely on Google too much. I can understand Baron Barrymore Halpenny’s point and I am deeply sorry for helping to bring about the unwanted statements by editors on the Wikipedia. I never intended this. But with all due respect to Halpenny, and I admire his work very much, he is notable and should be included in the Wikipedia for the Work he has done, if not for his paintings which I know will become more well known, but certainly for his illustrations and book cover designs.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>A thought</b>. If we are all going to just use Google and rely only on Google then why do we need the Wikipedia? Encyclopaedias are built up using many sources for reference. If your form of research is just Google, then it just shows how poor and lazy you are for doing proper serious work. If Google disappeared, then so would 95% of the editors on Wikipedia. I think this debate is showing how weak the Wikipedia is in how the editors research. The Wikipedia to be a truly independent Encyclopaedia must stand on its own two feet and focus on hard facts and reality. It maybe on the Internet, but it should not rely on the Internet for its information and certainly not google! Nor should it remove an article that is neutral in content, just because the artist would like it to be. But like I say I can understand that the unwanted statements have probably swayed the artist’s opinion.</dd>

</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>KEEP?</b> Things seem to have changed since I last stumbled on this area, and from what I can gather we are on a second debate? I was asked by Goldburg to provide a list of books that I know Baron Barrymore Halpenny has worked on, though I note the Ghost Stations have already been listed. He has as well done illustrations in most of his fathers books and others. In <i>Wartime Poems (Paperback)</i> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 978-0907595694</a>) he has done all the illustrations as well as the book cover. He has done quite a few book covers and not just his fathers books and has a significant body of work that I believe is to the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Actually if you google the books of Bruce Barrymore Halpenny, you will inadvertently google the work of Baron Barrymore Halpenny as he has most likely done the Artwork and this I feel would be the same for the books he does for other authors. So really his artwork is right across google, just his name isn’t.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don’t know much about art as it does not interest me, but I can verify the work of Baron in his father’s books, if that helps in this discussion? Anyone can if they just get a copy of the books, esp. Wartime Poems. <b>In this discussion that is as far as I can go.</b> I would just like to say that Goldburg has put a very good case here and is right in a way.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, if the artist himself does not want to be here and I should say he is doing very well without being on here, would it not be best to close this chapter? Baron Barrymore Halpenny is a talented young man and obviously knows what he is doing. But then as his work does become better known, if not by Goldburg, then certainly someone else will once again list him. I’m unsure whether to remove or maybe wisest to just leave the stub, which at present is pretty neutral?</dd>

<li><b><s>Delete</s></b>. <i>Ol' man car, he jes' keep rollin' along</i>? Actually, a better version of this might be worth keeping (and <b>moving</b> to old person's car). The reviews do suggest that the phrase "old person's car" has some currency; and we know intuitively what they're talking about. But speculating about what qualities make an old man car strikes me as trying to catch a moonbeam in a jar, especially considering it relates to elusive questions of style and image. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 19:17, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b>. It might actually be possible to flip this around, and write it not from the standpoint of "which cars are old people cars", but from the standpoint of "which automobile advertising campaigns have been targeted towards young people, or towards old people?", since at least some literature profs study that sort of thing. Otherwise I don't see Wikipedia ever being able to pin down a firm definition of "old man car", or ever using anything but flimsy references that mention "old man" in anything but a offhand and arbitrary way. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 21:33, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</s>

<li><b>Keep</b> after Uncle G's excellent rewrite.

<li><b>Merge</b> - touching. However, my grandmother died after a two year struggle with cancer. She had the profund courage to not let it affect her relationship with her grandchildren, nor bring down the family's spirits when she was around. She had outlived two husbands and a child, and had the "spiritual" courage (if that's really what you want to call it) to never become a human being so deeply entrenched in her own pathos that she failed to resonate with those around her. However moving, profound, and "inspirational" (ugh) her story may be, it is not worthy of a Wikipedia article. There is really nothing, outside of the context of her husband's death, that I could say about Mariane Pearl that would be <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> - and so, since she cannot be divorced (no pun intended) from her husband's claim to fame, it makes little sense to divorce mention of her from the article about her husband. Once stripping away the padding, the article is basically, "Ms. Pearl was born on &lt;date&gt; in &lt;location&gt;. Her parents are &lt;location&gt;. She now lives in &lt;location&gt;, doing &lt;occupation&gt; for a living. Her husband was beheaded by terrorists. She wrote &lt;book&gt; about &lt;aforementioned incident&gt;, which is currently being made into a movie which stars &lt;actress&gt;." - nothing which can't be a subsection of the <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Pearl_f170.html" title="Daniel Pearl">Daniel Pearl</a> article. At the risk of sounding completely caustic: If one really needs to know her spiritually, morally profound and courageous story, he or she can read the <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Pearl_f170.html" title="Daniel Pearl">Daniel Pearl</a> article whilst imagining that he or she is Pearl's wife. --Action Jackson IV 19:07, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

We would never have known about her if it had not been for her husband. B) we don't accredit her for her seperate career which is proficient enough to warrant her an entry as far as I am concerned(not a fan of her work though). c) we forget that she wrote a best selling book about her problems and her situation, a book that is now being made in to a hollywood movie featuring some heavy names in it.</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> She's got a major feature film about her life coming out. Once the massive publicity wave is shoved down our throats for this Oscar-bait movie and Jolie and Mrs. Pearl are everywhere we look, the article will have much more info on it. Her story is notable enough now but apparently, no one here (myself included) has read the book so no one has yet to add more detailed info on her. But this article is inevitable. A few months from now, we will all know this story. <a href="../../../m/r/b/User%7EMrblondnyc_7b00.html" title="User:Mrblondnyc">MrBlondNYC</a> 07:35, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm sure you checked, I do the same thing. I think in the case of it being verified, I would still only be in favor of a merge to the group's entry; I don't really think unreleased albums should get separate articles unless there's a strong reason for that, like a controversial reason why it wasn't released. <a href="../../../z/a/h/User_talk%7EZahakiel_da59.html" title="User talk:Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">◄</span></font></a><a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel"><font color="indigo"><span style="text-decoration:none">Zahakiel</span></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zahakiel_b87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></font></a> 20:21, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Even if we assume this <i>was</i> an album officially considered for release, it's tough to determine where the bar of inclusion lies with unreleased material, as they tend to not get the reviews and coverage that released albums get. Some of them do achieve a sort of legendary status, as in the Beach Boys' <i>Smile</i> album and Guns 'N' Roses' <i>Chinese Democracy</i>. I notice Prince's <i><a href="../../../c/a/m/Camille_%28album%29.html" title="Camille (album)">Camille</a></i> and Space's <i><a href="../../../l/o/v/Love_You_More_than_Football_ebee.html" title="Love You More than Football">Love You More than Football</a></i> have articles, while Pet Shop Boys' <i>Relentless</i>, for example, does not. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 20:45, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Agreed, although it's interesting to note that neither of those two that <i>do</i> have entries cite any sources or make any claims of notability either. The difficulty in establishing these two criteria (verifiability and notability) for the inclusion of unreleased/unpublished material does, I would have to say, make perfect sense. In the case of the AfD here, <a href="../../../w/a/x/WP%7EWAX_2720.html#What_about_article_x.3F" title="WP:WAX">other bad articles</a> don't justify the presence of this one&#160;:) <a href="../../../z/a/h/User_talk%7EZahakiel_da59.html" title="User talk:Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">◄</span></font></a><a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel"><font color="indigo"><span style="text-decoration:none">Zahakiel</span></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zahakiel_b87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></font></a> 21:17, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. So the artist should perhaps have an article if this is all true. But "Funism" does not appear to be notable, nor is the information provided encylcopedic in tone. A wikipedia article should not read as a manifesto and should not be original research. If this is based on your thesis, it may violate the latter and you would need to adopt a more neutral tone of writing. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshacconci_f743.html" title="User:Freshacconci">Freshacconci</a> 20:44, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I don't think the issue is whether <i>art movements</i> are notable, but whether <i>this</i> one is notable. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshacconci_f743.html" title="User:Freshacconci">Freshacconci</a> 20:52, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I checked each of the links he sent prior to posting them here. I certainly feel this artist deserves his own page but right now am more interested in the funism entry. Should I create a page on the artist? Should his one of his dealers create this page? Should he? Thank you for your polite discussion, I appreciate it. Andreammoss 21:29, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Actually, his dealers definitely should not create the page. That would be a conflict of interest. If it's something that interests you, I would suggest you create it. If all the references and links are accurate (and I'm only saying "if" because I haven't looked at any of them myself), then the artist would appear to be notable in his own right. A very brief mention of "funism" could be included. This has happened before when an artist who was notable had an article on his/her art movement merged with the main artist page (see <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guity_Novin_0065.html" title="Guity Novin">Guity Novin</a> for an example of this). <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshacconci_f743.html" title="User:Freshacconci">Freshacconci</a> 21:52, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In 1983 I opened Bridgewater Fine Arts, one of the early galleries in the East Village. Sometime around 1988 a young artist, Norm Magnusson, came to me and explained that he and a number of friends were developing an art movement he described as "Fun-ism." The idea, creating art that was both relevant, and fun. Along the lines of Dada-ism, it poked fun at established orders, while making comment on environmental, social and political issues. My partner and I followed his work for a number of years and upon his return from a hiatus spent living and working in France, we decided he was finally fully developed and ready to show. In 1994, Bridgewater/Lustberg, now in Soho, began a seven year relationship, resulting in five one person exhibitions and inclusion in innumerable group exhibitions, always with an emphasis on "fun" and relevant commentary. Throughout his travels and showing in France, New Zealand, and throughout the United States, the term Fun-ism has been applied and re-asserted in both Museum text, catalogues, reviews and conversation. Not one of the Museums or collectors that have acquired his work, including MOMA, The Springfield Museum, The Anchorage Art Museum, Kate Spade or Laurence Rockefeller, once disputed the validity of his claim and use of the expression that his art was "Fun-ism" itself.</p>

<p>Bumping this up from a speedy because notability is asserted. I'm not sure it's verifiable; a web search doesn't seem to turn up anything relevant for a skater by that name. (Please note when searching that there are several other people by that name who might be notable, including an actor and a photographer; this is not, as far as I can tell, any of those people.)

<p>Originally created back in June, this article was created as a self-promotional vanity page by <a href="../../../p/e/b/User%7EPebs96_42e0.html" title="User:Pebs96">User:Pebs96</a>. It's unreferenced, and any Google hits that I've been able to find are either web pages created by <a href="../../../p/e/b/User%7EPebs96_42e0.html" title="User:Pebs96">User:Pebs96</a> or wikimirrors on the topic. The applicable information has been merged into <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullfighting.html" title="Bullfighting">Bullfighting</a>, and when I redirected the source to <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullfighting.html" title="Bullfighting">Bullfighting</a> per the GFDL, I was accused of vandalism. There was a lengthy discussion on the Conflict of INterest noticeboard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest/Noticeboard&amp;oldid=111009197#Bloodless_bullfighting__.28history.7CWatchlist_this_article.7Cunwatch.29_.5Bwatchlist.3F.5D" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest/Noticeboard&amp;oldid=111009197#Bloodless_bullfighting__.28history.7CWatchlist_this_article.7Cunwatch.29_.5Bwatchlist.3F.5D" rel="nofollow">here</a>, where all of the claims to sources were laid out, and it finally came to light that there were no credible third party sources and that it would be better suited for AfD.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm sorry, but although I think this is a notable topic, the sourcing is horribly intermingled with the commercial relationship and original research of the main contributor. Until we have better, coverage as part of <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullfighting.html" title="Bullfighting">Bullfighting</a> is appropriate.

<p>Clearly a promo-piece for a British singer songwriter. It was uncategorized so I figured I'd just stubify it and find a few sources one might work with.

<p>Article does not assert the notability of the subject. Besides being the current president of a midwestern University, how else is he notable?

<li><b>Keep</b>. The president of an accredited university is usually notable both as an academic administrator and as a scholar. In this case, Goldfarb passes <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> as the author of several textbooks which have each been through multiple editions. --<a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEastmain_2651.html" title="User:Eastmain">Eastmain</a> 01:08, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Looking at <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>, I don't see that being "the author of several textbooks which have been through multiple editions" is one of the criteria. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 14:34, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Widely used textbook" is one of the criteria in numbered item 1 of <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>. Several editions is evidence for the widely used part. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Eppstein_0880.html" title="User:David Eppstein">David Eppstein</a> 14:55, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, it's not a criterion, it's listed as an "example"; and it says "An academic who has published ... a widely used textbook ... <i>is likely</i> to be notable as an author (see WP:BIO)" (my emphasis). I think this is generally wrong; however in this case we don't have to argue about whether it's wrong in general, because it just says "likely" to pass WP:BIO so we just have to check whether in this particular case WP:BIO is satisfied. So the question here is, have his books been the subject of "multiple independent reviews" as suggested by WP:BIO? <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 15:25, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>In case the above sounds like wikilawyering, I just want to add that the question here, as always with authors, is whether there are sources that are about him or about his publications, that are independent of him and of his employers and publishers, so we can use those sources to write a verified NPOV article. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 15:34, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Contested Prod (which, in the interests of full disclosure, I added just under 5 days ago). The subject of the article is a "rising motocross star", who appears from a Google search not to have actually risen far enough as to be notable. Some of the article seems to be a cut-and-paste job from a local newspaper or something along those lines, but the only sources I can find are those indicating the man's existence, although there was a fake link to a Wikiquote page on him at one point. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:14, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The result was <b>keep/no consensus</b> Opinion is certainly split. On the one hand, per trialsanderrors, there are claims of importance made, presented neutrally, and attributed. The counterargument to this seems to be failure to meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. There are assertions made here that aren't well-countered that this is more than a mere mailing list, so <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> may not apply. I put "keep" first because I think the keep arguments are the stronger here, but there <i>certainly</i> is not a consensus strong enough to delete this article. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><span style="color:orange"><b>juice</b></span></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 17:15, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Addendum: The claim of notability isn't backed up. Per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, <i>Trivial coverage, such as (1) newspaper articles that simply report the internet address, (2) newspaper articles that simply report the times at which such content is updated or made available, (3) a brief summary of the nature of the content or the publication of internet addresses and site or (4) content descriptions in internet directories or online stores.</i>. So, mere mention of the mailing list or inclusion on a list of "things related to India" is not a justification of notability (most of the "references" to the mailing list seem to just mention this trivially). --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 23:17, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Has ANY academic publications made <b>non-trivial</b> mentions, discussions of this mailing list? Thousands of mailing lists are reported trivially in research papers -- those one-line mentions do not make them notable. The article claims it has been mentioned by academic journals - yet a look into those "references" show no more than a single line mention of the list, most likely under the "links" sections.</li>
<li>Several links/references in the article appear to be to fraudelent, pointing to nameless webservers rather than the organizations they are supposed to be. For example, a reference "Department of Entomology, American Museum of Natural History, New York, USA", points to a server hosted at 144.16.65.194 <a href="http://144.16.65.194/" class="external autonumber" title="http://144.16.65.194/" rel="nofollow">[30]</a> (which is an Indian organisation), the reference 9 therefore points to <a href="http://144.16.65.194/hpg/envis/doc97html/wwwnh.html" class="external text" title="http://144.16.65.194/hpg/envis/doc97html/wwwnh.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a> rather than an actual website of the American Museum of Natural History. The page too seems to be a list of links from an email archive. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 23:28, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>The "claim" that the Journal "Indian Birds" cite it is also dubious ... my search of the reference (8) shows a single link "NAT-HISTORY INDIA: vivek@ee.princeton.edu" (sic) to the name ... without even a one-liner mention!! --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 23:30, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i>For those interested in the natural history of the Indian subcontinent (Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and other neighboring countries) there is a subscription electronic bulletin board called, "NATHISTORY-INDIA".

To subscribe send a request to vivek@EE.Princeton.EDU and he will sign you up.</i></dd>
<dd>Such trivial mentions are made to thousands and thousands of mailing lists, but that isn't really a "cited by journal", and hence the claim is dubious. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 23:33, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>RESTORE / DO NOT DELETE / KEEP:</b> This article is about something more then a mailing list, it is often referred to as the <b>"NATURAL HISTORY NETWORK"</b> of India or South Asia, it also serves as WILDERNESS TELEGRAM SYSTEM of sorts, the subject of this article has become an <a href="../../../n/g/o/NGO_9dc2.html" title="NGO">NGO</a> in itself helping its members many of whom are grassroots workers in the fields of Nature &amp; Wildlife Conservation, students, scientists, prominent members of other NGOs, many "News Makers" in these field report directly to the NETWORK, simultaneously or before commercial news channels report on the matter, discoveries, poaching, habitat encroachments, proposed government protected area notifications and the unfortunate de-notifications, illegal wildlife trade observed, wildlife trade seizures, Endangered Tiger &amp; Panther etc. etc. bone and skin seizures, proposed government policy changes affecting the environment before they come into effect, proposed dams which will submerge large chunks of the last remaining pristine forests etc are just a few things reported and debated by this NETWORK many a times bringing corrective action in time. This is a list dealing with issues faced by Indian Naturalists, conservationists, and NGOs who network on it thankfully, including members of related Government institutions, IT CAN ONLY BE COMPARED WITH OTHER LISTS OF THE REGION dealing with similar issues and it stands head and shoulders above the rest, most of the top people in the field in the region are subscribers or know of its reputability.

The earlier deletion debate suggested <a href="../../../l/i/n/LinuxChix_c14c.html" title="LinuxChix">LinuxChix</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/y/FlyLady_29da.html" title="FlyLady">FlyLady</a> as notable because the founder/list was mentioned in a couple of magazines, while it has been argued that postings on this list have been cited in newspaper articles, but the list itself has not been the subject of any books/secondary sources. In the absence of a clear policy that takes the personal interpretations out and avoids systemic biases, I vote <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../s/h/y/User%7EShyamal_ed48.html" title="User:Shyamal">Shyamal</a> 01:39, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>We <i>have</i> clear guidelines that take the personal interpretations out and that avoid systemic biases. You're explicitly choosing to not follow them, for entirely fallacious reasons. If you want to learn the fallacy of "Books about websites are perhaps very few.", please visit a good quality bookshop, where you will find quite a few books that document web sites. Ironically, it is your argument above that exhibits bias and personal interpretation, boiling down as it does to "I doubt that sources exist for mailing lists and web sites, but I personally like this one and want to include it anyway.". I suggest that you actually base your arguments upon finding and citing sources, rather than your personal biases. (It's surprising what is documented. One simply has to pull one's finger out and look.) Sources are good arguments here at Wikipedia. "I like it." is not. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:05, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comments</b> nothing much to say and no longer interested in debating this in isolation. The debate has two parts (1) Mailing lists - can they ever be encylopaedia worthy&#160;? If that is so, then we need to re-look at (2) Notability criteria for mailing lists. As it stands from a basic reading - ALL items without exception in <a href="../../../m/a/i/Category%7EMailing_lists_cfaa.html" title="Category:Mailing lists">Category:Mailing lists</a> should be deleted. Software for running mailing lists should be under something like mailing list software or <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_software.html" title="Social software">Social software</a> or such like.

<li><b>Comment</b> I sympathize with your views on the notability of <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linux_Kernel_Mailing_List_566e.html" title="Linux Kernel Mailing List">Linux Kernel Mailing List</a> and note that you have taken significant interest in protecting it from the AfD and finding "proof" of notability. I am unable to find any mention of a "book with a chapter about the mailing list". An amazon review merely adds a keyword. Many items of the article are merely making use of pointers to the Linux Kernel which <b>is</b> definitely notable. Other trivia such as the information about the logo of Linux being decided is questionable given that wired magazine has serious doubts about the author.<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,42209,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,42209,00.html" rel="nofollow">[31]</a> The Kernel Traffic newsletter is no longer maintained but that makes a "reliable secondary" source. To you the statement that the list is a "bazaar" makes it notable. If popularity and numbers make it notable, then so be it. But then admins cite the guidelines only when it is in your favour. Why was <a href="../../../b/i/g/WP%7EBIGNUMBER_dfb6.html" title="WP:BIGNUMBER">WP:BIGNUMBER</a> not mentioned in the LKML afd which passed.

And someone lower down has exemplified systemic bias by pointing out that this is a narrow subject dealt with in one (unknown I suppose) country. I understand that the new breed of admins are trying to make wikipedia into another Encyclopaedia Brittanica. Remember that all these arguments would have ensured the absence of very useful articles of the <a href="../../../t/o/i/Toilets_in_Japan_7bbe.html" title="Toilets in Japan">kind</a> that set wikipedia apart. I understand that each admin has their own subject of special interest and knowledge, but that doesn't entitle anyone to belittle other topics. Remember also that unlike programmers, there are people in other disciplines who are not spending time blogging, making websites <i>etc.</i> and creating a whole load of google hits. I hope you understand that you are ultimately making a subjective decision. To make it you do need to have some feel for the subject in question. If it is truly objective, which is unlikely, then there should be no selective amnesia about WP:guidelines and policies. <a href="../../../s/h/y/User%7EShyamal_ed48.html" title="User:Shyamal">Shyamal</a> 01:49, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

And I couldn't find any sources for "a lot of legislation happening through this network". As about LKML, if you feel it's non-notable, please nominate it again for AfD. Unlike Windows/Solaris/Mac OS, the Linux kernel development doesn't take place in a company office -- LKML is <i>the place</i> for it.

<li><b>Delete and merge</b>&#160;: Since all this is leading to nothing constructive may I suggest here something that is hopefully a win-win situation. The information here can go into the article on history of conservation in India (yet to be created, but already proposed at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Protected_areas_of_India_Checklist_92cb.html#History_of_Conservation_in_India" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Protected areas of India/Checklist">WP:PAI</a>). The content here can come into a section on the role of the Internet in conservation. I suppose it is finally the information that matters, not the existence of the article in a particular form and hopefully a topic like the history of conservation in India will not be considered a non-encyclopaedic subject by the kind folks here.

<dd>Hi Atul, from what I can see the article on nathistory India cannot possibly ever make for encyclopaedic content. However there is a way to incorporate and highlight the role of the group and the ideal place would be to place it within the History of conservation in India article as a section on the contribution of the Internet era.

<dd>Hi Shyamal, You are welcome to change your Vote&#160;:), but it is only one vote, there is no need to panic, you might want to save a work copy of the article though in case it is deleted and hidden again. As for me I believe it is encyclopedic, I will like the article to stay as it is. But you have a very very good point, you can also always do what you propose above, great and a fitting idea in itself. So I suggest NO Delete And Merge, <b>Keep</b> the article as it is, yet have a section on the contribution of the list in other major conservation articles on India and elsewhere. Exactly as you say it should be also mentioned in the Contributions of the Internet Era to the Natural History and the Conservation of the region. As for me I firmly believe it is encyclopedic in itself to have a article on this <b>South Asian Natural History Network</b>.

The assertion that it's "something more then a mailing list", "Natural History Network of South Asia", "Wilderness Telegram System" is entirely based on perception of the editor (apparently, the creator of the mailing list mentions himself as "<a href="http://www.google.co.in/search?q=%22Vivek+Tiwari%2C+Coordinator%2C+South+Asian+Natural+History+Network%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.in/search?q=%22Vivek+Tiwari%2C+Coordinator%2C+South+Asian+Natural+History+Network%22" rel="nofollow">Co-oridinator, South Asian Natural History Network</a>" in endorsement of a book). <a href="../../../s/h/y/User%7EShyamal_ed48.html" title="User:Shyamal">Shyamal</a>'s assumption that the article on <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linux_kernel_mailing_list.html" title="Linux kernel mailing list">LKML</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/n/LinuxChix_c14c.html" title="LinuxChix">LinuxChix</a> exist because of "systemic bias" or lobbying by Linux users is flawed.

<li><b>Comment</b> As pointed in comments above. If prediction of an earthquake on the list, report of a new species, references to the list on journals and newsletters and newspapers is not enough for notability, fine with me.

<li>Mailing lists of this sort are very important in the academic world generally. All small groups of scholars use them, and they have ben as important means of scientific communication since Usenet days. The size of a particular list is irrelevant--what is necessary is that the list be notable in its own field. Its own field is the study of the subject it covers. What is necessary is that it be a principle method of communication for the specialists in the subject.</li>
<li>This is demonstrated by the use made of it, and the references made to it.</li>
<li>It is time for WP to recognize the conventions of the medium which is the substrate for its own existence. The people who work find references to the (virtual) places at which they want to work on the web, They do not find them in printed books or journals; they do not even find them in on-line journals. They learn about them from their use by other comparable web places. The distinctive characteristics of most of these places is that their editorial control is relatively weak but not non-existent. Usually it's there. almost all serious mailing lists have a moderator (In this instance it's Vivek Tiwari. Most are published from a major academic institution. In this case it's Princeton. Usually the good one have established their reputation with time. This one has been going for 12 years now.</li>
<li>How do we judge whether they should have articles on WP? The same basic way as anything else, RSs, the presence of encyclopedic content, and some indicators of importance. The sort of indicators we use for other media are such things as number of books an author has published and where he has published them, number of recordings a musician has produced, and so on. We look for number of users--considering the size of the subject, the almost 1000 members is very respectable. We look for the importance of contributions to it (some have been demonstrated). We look for references and recommendations to it in other sources (some have been demonstrated). <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 20:49, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Like Shyamal has suggested, the article content can be incorporated in a new article (probably Natural History of South Asia).

<dd><b>Comment.</b> Two things. First, I would feel more comfortable if you maintained a user page. The idea of the red link to nowhere is disconcerting. Second, it is the Natural History of South Asia that is encyclopedic; not the mailing list addressing same.

<p>I’ve done a Google search for Osiris Games and it reveals 655 results <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Osiris+Games%22&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Osiris+Games%22&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[58]</a>, for a notable game company that doesn’t seem enough. Further more, the article lacks sources. I can’t find many reliable sources for them. The games Chart Wars and Bestseller don’t seem notable, there’s big questions over their notability as well. The main Osiris Games article is created by Damien Russell, which to quote the article is one of the four members Osiris Games so it also looks like vanity. The other creators of the articles also have very little edits.</p>
<p>Myrtilus Games is the baby company of Osiris Games so god knows how small they are if Osiris Games has only has four members and that seems to be the parent company.</p>
<p>Myrtilus Games also has a page about it’s game Insider Tabloid Magazine, which also seems none notable.</p>
<p>Due these serious questions about notability, probable vanity and lack of independent sources, I am bring this up for AFD. Based on the lack of evidence I’ve found, my vote is <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEnglishrose_b44b.html" title="User:Englishrose">Englishrose</a> 22:21, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Keep</b> I disagree.. of cause. Osiris Games and Myrtilus Games (baby company?) are two of the fastest growing freeware gaming companies on the web. The website (especially Osiris Games) registers hundreds of hits per day, and if the article's werent being looked over; why is everyone editing 'Bestseller'? If you have Bestseller, you need the Osiris Games, and Myrtilus Games articles. Chart Wars is also THE biggest freeware music simulation game on the internet. As for Insider; if you feel you must, fine.. but I still think there is nothing wrong with any of those articles and I would like them all to stay.Damien Russell 04:26, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Delete</b> I did a cursory look for any verifiable sources and found none that were reliable. Damien Russell, despite the <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a>, I'd suggest that your best bet to keep these articles up is to source independant, third party coverage in major news outlets. Staff reviews by places like IGN, Gamespot, 1UP.com, and other major gaming sites would help immensely as well. If sources exist, source the article. If they don't the article fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a>, probably has <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> issues, and according to those two policies must be deleted. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Cheers, Lankybugger</a> 13:40, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are no reviews from such places as IGN, Gamespot or 1UP.com because the games are not published to such a broad audience. They are indie games, and Osiris Games and Myrtilus Games are indie developers. Please see the websites for more information, but other than that, the site is mentioned and linked on other sites (freeware gaming sites, and download.com of cause) - but no major review sites (because they only review major releases). Look, fine; if you want to remove these articles from wikipedia then go right ahead, but you better be willing to remove every other indie-developer's page on wiki as well. I mean look at the links up for removal; all Osiris Games related articles.. why are these up for removal when theres a whole list here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_independent_game_developers" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_independent_game_developers" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_independent_game_developers</a>, that are happily being accepted?

<p><b>Keep</b> .. This is an indie company. The articles have been cleaned up remarkably since they were first introduced and people are continually trying to update it when new attributable sources are available. There is an interest in the game, and those who are wishing to learn more about it, and the companies, would benefit from having these articles on Wikipedia. To say that the fact that the articles were created by people who haven't had a long history of edits on Wikipedia is not only unfair, but a very slippery slope to start down. Subjecting your decision to a "Google" search and saying that Chart Wars nor Bestseller don't seem notable indicates your obvious lack of knowledge in these genre of games and their popularity. Perhaps maybe you should nominate your "Furniture (band)" article for deletion. I see no sources on there and I certainly haven't heard of them. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecandido_01f7.html" title="User:Secandido">Secandido</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Secandido_cac0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Secandido">contribs</a>).</small></p>

Just because you may <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">like something</a> doesn't mean it fits the requirements for notability. It doesn't matter if you like it or not, what matters if whether it fits the definitions of notability. Osiris Games and Myrtilus Games would both have to be improved with reliable sources proving their notability as outlined at <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, while Chart Wars, Bestseller and Insider Tabloid Magazine would have to be improved with reliable sources proving their notability as outlined at <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Cheers, Lankybugger</a> 19:15, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Given that there has been a substantial tidying-up of the article within the past 24h, I think the G1 speedy deletion (as nonsense) is now inapplicable. There certainly seems to be a genuine topic behind this, although the article was pretty meaningless at the time of nomination. Given that we now have a reasonably coherent article, it all boils down to one question—is the subject <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>? I will therefore leave this nomination open so that this issue may be settled.</dd>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> but possible rewrite. Snowman Hunters is a cult hit on youtube.com and google videos. As one of the top comedian shows on youtube.com it counts as a significant entertainment show given its high viewership. Similar in some aspects to Trailerpark boys in its breaking of stage rules (talking to the audience and such) it is a vulgar satire of American paranoia and attitudes towards outsiders. Some are considering it for deletion because they do not understand the new entertainment media of youtube.com and because they have not heard of the show. I would be embarrassed for wikipedia.com for not including this show. The entry does need some more information and better writing however this show clearly merits inclusion due to its scope and the newness of its contribution to video short entertainment on the Internet.

<li>This completely unverifiable. Ryan Neisz isn't found on IMDb with writing or crew credits for any of the listed shows (and its "Battery Park" not "Batter Park"). If he did participate on those sitcoms at all , it was in a very minor role and fails to confer any notability. Minor celebrities on YouTube is a bit of a reach, 691,551 all time views (for their "most popular" video) is a blip in the YouTube world. Even if fans were to come and "improve" this article - they would be unable to provide any sources, and blow by blow plot summaries of each video won't help the situation one bit. <b>Strong, strong delete</b> unless a a reliable source magically appears very soon. - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/s/User_talk%7ECosmicPenguin_ed60.html" title="User talk:CosmicPenguin">Talk</a>) 02:44, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>To answer Haemeo:</b> I'm sorry if I've not IDed myself correctly per WP guidelines. This is my first serious exposure to being a part of a WP article, and I'm unfamiliar and trying to learn quickly as I go. I believe with this re-edit I've gone back and signed the answers I've provided today. As to the forum mention, I put that up today when one of our fans stated they had created a WP entry and I saw it was flagged for deletion. I'm sorry if this is against a WP guideline. It thought the WP community simply weren't familiar with us, and thought those interested in having a WP entry should let their voices be heard. I apologize if this is against a WP policy as you point out.</p>
<p>I am trying to abide by WP practices/guidelines (even while trying to get work done today. lol) which is why I have not edited the article itself or corrected inaccuracies within it. Zanzibar19 I'm sorry, I don't yet know how to time-stamp my signing.</p>

As a former journalist (don't laugh now) I understand the need/value of independent information (which is why it would have been a kick to have a WP entry if it plays out like that) rational discussion and the difference between a popularity contest and a reasoned evaluation. I hope the sources I provided clarify that, and ask that my missteps (admitted) be seen in these lights. Thanks everyone.

<p><b>Comment</b> First let me state that a cursory viewing of the forum associated with the production company Zanzibar19 will show that one of the moderators of that forum has the same username as the one I use here. That is because we are one and the same person. I do not have any other association with that company and am only a moderator because of my knowledge of running a forum. When my expertise became known to the owners of the company and their production schedule would not permit an active involvement by either of them in the running of the forum I volunteered to help out and moderate. My total involvement as a moderator is to delete offensive posts i.e. spam, porn. I recieve no compensation for this service and therefore there should be no conflict of interest. If you beleive there is please contact me and explain why you believe so.</p>
<p>Having said that, I would like to add to the discussion. I agree with James Love's comment above that this entry is about a hit cult video and as such deserves to be included here. There is a real need to stay abreast of current fast paced changes in the entertainment industry. Viral videos have an ever expanding presence in the marketplace on the internet as evidenced by Google's purchase of YouTube. This article is about one of the first hit shows on that medium and as such will provide some historical insight into the phenomenon for future researchers. In the past two days the article has been vastly refined and will no doubt improve as more research on the subject is done. If there are any improvements/refinements that should be made in the article I would welcome the input as this is the first one I've worked on. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveoutdoorrec_cfbe.html" title="User:Steveoutdoorrec">steveoutdoorrec</a> 14:37, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, the initial posting raised red flags on whether this should be included because insufficient information was provided. I've added some stuff for them and gotten folks to add some of the necessary references to merit inclusion. It's obvious that they have a following. I enjoy their irreverent humour on youtube and given the awards, others do too. They are not a flash in the pan since they are working on their third season, so let's get over the initial submission mistakes and move on. jamesarthurlove 14:39, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> To Chucky Rice &amp; Action Jackson IV: I call your atttention to <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>. "If the rules prevent you from improving or maintaining Wikipedia, ignore them." In the age of the internet newsgroups and discussion forums a redefining of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> must and should take place. In fact this redefining of notarity is under discussion at this time at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_71e3.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability">Wikipedia_talk:Notability</a> and, by the look of the archives, has been raging for quite some time. It is possible for something, a new sport, viral video or other youth oriented phenomenon, to become notable without any hard copy articles being written about them. The article under discussion here is exactly that, a phenomenon with a following growing by word of mouth at colleges and high schools around the world and in discussion forums. The only difference between the Snowmen Hunters and <a href="../../../l/o/n/Lonelygirl15.html" title="Lonelygirl15">Lonelygirl15</a> is that the latter caused a self serving publicity blitz by admitting that the character was a fake and not an actual 15 year old girl. Yet [Lonelygirl15] has an article with mutiple links to other paid actors character's websites included and as far as I can determine was not flagged for any reason. One must ask if a self serving publicity move makes one "notable," which gives it the right to have an article included here, why is this article not concidered to be a form of spam? Inclusion here only generates more hits to their websites for possible purchases of branded merchandise. Take a look at the articles and internet interview show now cited in the recent updates to article under discussion and you will see that there is some independent verification that Snowmen Hunters are gathering some interest in an admitted non-conventional media.<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveoutdoorrec_cfbe.html" title="User:Steveoutdoorrec">steveoutdoorrec</a> 00:07, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>How nice of you to <i>admit that the topic under consideration is not notable</i>. If it's not notable under the current guidelines, then it's not notable.

<li>And yet you seemed to have been able to miss the point of my post completely. No where did I “admit that the topic under consideration is not notable.” My point is that there are other articles on similar subjects that did not have to pass through a gauntlet to be accepted. Of course I will be making an argument on the notoriety discussion page on that subject. Here I am just pointing out that while the initial posting on the Snowmen Hunters was simplistic it was there to start the process of inserting a full-blown article. Over the last 48 hours much has been done to flesh the article out to meet the standards set and I’m sure that more information will be included as the show grows and matures. To stop its inclusion because some people seem to refuse to check out the supporting interviews and written articles is unconscionable. Yes, there is a written article in the Chico News and Review in case you were wondering.<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveoutdoorrec_cfbe.html" title="User:Steveoutdoorrec">steveoutdoorrec</a> 04:02, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If it's that notable, it shouldn't be difficult to add sources, should it? Yet there still aren't any decent ones in the article. (As an aside, from the talk page: "But to delete the first article on their early efforts would be tantamount to shredding Tolstoy’s first attempt at War and Peace"). <b><a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliminatorJR_b0b2.html" title="User:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B">Eliminator</font><font color="#FF4500">JR</font></a> <a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EEliminatorJR_a208.html" title="User talk:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B"><sup>Talk</sup></font></a></b> 13:44, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Response</b> As to the quote from the talk page used above; it was used to defend the original posting of the article. As I’ve said before the original was amateurish, at best, and was only intended as a place holder to start the process of fleshing out the actual article. That fleshing out has been done with input from people around the world.</li>

<dd>o Also please refer to my post of 00:07, 17 March 2007 (UTC) where I stated, <i>“It is possible for something, a new sport, viral video or other youth oriented phenomenon, to become notable without any hard copy articles being written about them.”</i> My point being that in this fast paced age of the internet there are other ways for a subject to become “notable” then being seen in the print medium that is rooted in the 19th century. To ignore this, what many believe to be, alternative process of becoming notable would be wrong.</dd>
<dd>o At this time I would like to also address CosmicPenguin’s post of 02:44, 16 March 2007 (UTC) and his assertion that “<i>Minor celebrities on YouTube is a bit of a reach, 691,551 all time views (for their "most popular" video) is a blip in the YouTube world.</i>” What he chose to ignore, or just did not know, is that Snowmen Hunters is also on many more websites such as: <a href="http://www.ifilm.com/profile/Zanzibar19" class="external text" title="http://www.ifilm.com/profile/Zanzibar19" rel="nofollow">ifilm</a>, <a href="http://www.gofish.com/my/videos.gfp?gfid=26-63416" class="external text" title="http://www.gofish.com/my/videos.gfp?gfid=26-63416" rel="nofollow">gofish</a>, <a href="http://videobomb.com/users/submittedvideos/Zanzibar19" class="external text" title="http://videobomb.com/users/submittedvideos/Zanzibar19" rel="nofollow">videobomb</a>, <a href="http://www.vsocial.com/user/?d=37153#pagekeep::p,profile::b,ProfileContext::g,1" class="external text" title="http://www.vsocial.com/user/?d=37153#pagekeep::p,profile::b,ProfileContext::g,1" rel="nofollow">vsocial</a>, <a href="http://zanzibar19.multiply.com/" class="external text" title="http://zanzibar19.multiply.com/" rel="nofollow">multiply</a>, <a href="http://clipshack.com/Zanzibar19" class="external text" title="http://clipshack.com/Zanzibar19" rel="nofollow">clipshack</a>, <a href="http://www.tagged.com/mypage.html?uid=4323508" class="external text" title="http://www.tagged.com/mypage.html?uid=4323508" rel="nofollow">tagged</a>, <a href="http://www.vidilife.com/index.cfm?f=profile.main&amp;intUserAccountID=787432" class="external text" title="http://www.vidilife.com/index.cfm?f=profile.main&amp;intUserAccountID=787432" rel="nofollow">vidilife</a>, <a href="http://www.vsocial.com/user/?d=37153#pagekeep::p,profile::b,ProfileContext::g,1" class="external text" title="http://www.vsocial.com/user/?d=37153#pagekeep::p,profile::b,ProfileContext::g,1" rel="nofollow">vsocial</a>, and <a href="http://www.flukiest.com/user/Zanzibar19" class="external text" title="http://www.flukiest.com/user/Zanzibar19" rel="nofollow">flukiest</a> to name only a few to be found <a href="http://www.zanzibar19.com/snowmen-hunters/links.php" class="external text" title="http://www.zanzibar19.com/snowmen-hunters/links.php" rel="nofollow">here</a>. This list does not take into account the many facebook and myspace accounts of fans that have one or more of their videos embedded there by the owners of those pages who want to share them with their friends. Using the raw number on a counter of one website is not a suitable way to judge how many people may have seen one particular video. Every viewing on each website may generate many more viewings as a particular video is passed around by email or shared on any one of the many myspace type websites. That is why they are called viral videos and can create notoriety in a new way.<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveoutdoorrec_cfbe.html" title="User:Steveoutdoorrec">steveoutdoorrec</a> 20:24, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>But Wikipedia doesn't require written sources. Online ones will do. Surely a notable viral video would generate verifiable, reputable, secondary online sources? <b><a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliminatorJR_b0b2.html" title="User:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B">Eliminator</font><font color="#FF4500">JR</font></a> <a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EEliminatorJR_a208.html" title="User talk:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B"><sup>Talk</sup></font></a></b> 00:26, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Thank you. That’s my point. Some here have said that the subject is not “notable” due to there being no verifiable secondary sources. No amount of links to interviews and online, as well as one off line, article seems to satisfy them. It would look to an outsider as though they had looked at the original post and none of the refinements. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveoutdoorrec_cfbe.html" title="User:Steveoutdoorrec">steveoutdoorrec</a> 00:43, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

The cool thing is Smith was informed this week that his was chosen as one of the 20 finalists (among them a video from Andy Dick), which will now go to a popular vote with the chance of winning $50,000 to make his own pilot. Smith filmed the video, entitled <b>Snowmen Hunters</b>, with his cousin Ryan Neisz outside of Lassen Park as part of a series in March of this year. The premise focuses on a couple of yokels named Sherman and Everett (played by Neisz and Smith, respectively) who have a disdain for men with eyes of coal, carrot noses and stick "appendages." It seems Everett has never been the same since he caught his wife plowing the snow. It's pretty damn funny, too.”</dd>

<li>I'd say that we've covered everything that is needed to have the article included here. One development that occurred today is that the Snowmen Hunters videos have been nominated by YouTube as one of the Top Ten video series for 2006. With all the video series that were uploaded in 2006 to be in the top ten is the definition of notoriety. Case settled IMHO <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveoutdoorrec_cfbe.html" title="User:Steveoutdoorrec">steveoutdoorrec</a> 01:03, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm afraid I remain unconvinced. You've got one trivial mention in a paper. The interview is better, but it doesn't appear that the source qualifies as reliable. And the award you're talking about doesn't appear to be a significant award. It's not being awarded by YouTube, from what I can tell. It's just a user driven thing.<a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChunky_Rice_06d5.html" title="User:Chunky Rice">Chunky Rice</a> 02:28, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>These YouTube awards are official. Believe me, I understand if people don't enjoy/like/understand/get SNOWMEN HUNTERS, but it seems the notability portion of this discussion is settled. If some "just don't like" SNOWMEN HUNTERS, fine, but I'm not sure that's any more germane than the "I like it" reasoning so correctly excluded by Haemo above. If 'I like it' doesn't apply, neither can 'I don't like it.'</dd>

<dd>Maybe those asking for the inclusion of SNOWMEN HUNTERS were simply 5 days premature in advocating an article in WP. I don't concede this, but hypothetically let's say until yesterday the deleters on balance were right. The facts have shifted significantly just in the last 12 hours. A weekly online video show nominated by the largest online video site in history is by definition noteworthy. With this latest development, I think it's fair to say HUNTERS should be included in Wikipedia, along with other 2006 YouTube Award nominees for best series like WILL IT BLEND, ASK A NINJA, LONELYGIRL15 and CHAD VADER, all of which have WP entries.</dd>

Whatever is decided, I thank everyone involved in this discussion, even though it's made me cry like a baby at times (We can joke here, right? I mean, if I were joking. Because in reality I cried puppy tears. It was thoroughly embarrassing). Zanzibar19 04:41, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Leuko, if you check the YouTube 2006 Awards Direct link, check the BEST SERIES link as indicated above, HUNTERS is there with the other 9 shows nominated. I've more than simply proven the awards exist, but proven HUNTERS was nominated. If you want to say it's only significant if HUNTERS wins (which won't be announced for a week) I'd respectfully submit the definition of notability you offer is remarkably tortured. By any normal notability standard, this more than qualifies. As for HUNTERS not being mentioned in the CBS/BBC/Post links above, those stories were written this moring based off a YouTube press release announcing the awards and before the nominations were revealed. The links were provided here to answer Chunky's questioning of the awards legitimacy. Just how is it that the awards are legitimate, the articles on the awards are legitimate, but those nominated are not? Didn't <a href="../../../x/d/a/User%7EXdamr_c318.html" title="User:Xdamr"><span style="font-family: Times"><span style="font-size:140%">X</span><span style="font-size:110%">damr</span></span></a>, who opened this discussion, amend his comments to say notability was the only question remaining? If you honestly don't believe this qualifies, okay, but it seems a fair reading of all the notability arguments and links above run counter to your <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> proposal and the events of today.

Believe me that I've argued for deletion of stuff I really liked, so it's not about that. If it is as you say, and the page gets deleted, just come back when the show has won an award or gotten some media attention and ask for it to be restored.<a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChunky_Rice_06d5.html" title="User:Chunky Rice">Chunky Rice</a> 05:19, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you Chunky for clarifying. I didn't mean to imply you specifically were making this personal. I was trying to address what seemed to be the general notion that HUNTERS advocates were simply relying on the 'I like it.' It seems my writing of that came across more muddied than I'd intended. ('Say, how muddy did you intend...')Since you seem to be taking this fairly seriously and weighing it with a fair mind, I have to ask, does nomination really denote no notability? It would seem to me, at a certain level, even a nomination denotes significant notability. If this awards contest was from ObscureVideoSite.com, I'd understand. But this is YouTube, THE premiere online video site of the Web 2.0 era, and this is their first annual awards. Specifically, how does that not qualify as noteworthy?Zanzibar19 05:35, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I like to address Chucky's assertion that the interview on Veho is from a source that, in his words, “doesn't appear that the source qualifies as reliable.” By using a popular internet thing called <a href="http://www.google.com" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com" rel="nofollow">Google</a> (you may have heard of them) to do a search for Veoh Networks, Inc, the owners of the program in which the interview was done, the second hit in the search produces a press release with the title, “<i>Time Warner, Michael Eisner And Spark Capital Join Shelter Capital To Complete $12.5 Million Strategic Series B Investment In Veoh Networks</i>.” There seems to be a lot of unknown people throwing some serious money into this unreliable source. How did I ever find this out you may ask? I just looked at the bottom of the screen where the interview was, right after Copyright 2007 and there it was.</li>

<dd>I'd like to think it's not personal but on your profile page your stated "goal is to source and clean up geek articles (board games, comics, etc.)." When I look up <a href="../../../g/e/e/Geek.html" title="Geek">geek</a> the first line is, "A geek is an individual who is fascinated by knowledge and imagination, usually electronic or virtual in nature." If so count me as one because I too am facinated by knowledge and imagination. With them we wouldn't be having this descussion because there would be no online much less "a multilingual, web-based, free content encyclopedia project" <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveoutdoorrec_cfbe.html" title="User:Steveoutdoorrec">steveoutdoorrec</a> 12:23, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, that's correct. I like to improve geek-hobby articles so that they meet Wikipedia standards. And from that, you've concluded that I have some sort of personal vendetta against this article?</dd>

<dd>Because I'm not an asshole, I'll still tell you that if this AFD resolves in the article getting deleted, you should seek a deletion review with the argument that significant improvements were made to the article after the debate began and that it should be relisted so that all voters can have a chance to consider the new information. They haven't swayed me, but others may have different opinions.<a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChunky_Rice_06d5.html" title="User:Chunky Rice">Chunky Rice</a> 16:18, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for the help in spurring us on to refine the article and for the suggested recourse if it is deleted. I would hope that all the voters would look at the article one last time before voting to see where it was when deletion was suggested and where it is at this point in time. They may then see that signigicant improvements were made in a very short time. Chucky without your input the article would not be in the shape it is in.

I'm not sure how it will come out, but I'm satisfied that between Haemo's, Chunky's and the other persistant posters on the delete side of this, along with the entries from the HUNTERS supporters like <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveoutdoorrec_cfbe.html" title="User:Steveoutdoorrec">steveoutdoorrec</a> and a few of my own entries, this question has been thoroughly examined. I'd like to offer my sincere thanks, and a hope that the things said in the heat of argument didn't sting unduely. Seems like some might, and that's too bad. I apologize for whatever part I've played in that. Suggesting another course of action was a stand-up thing for you to do Chunky, and I really do appreciate it.</li>

Here's a complete listing of schools that have received a Blue Ribbon award: <a href="http://www.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/2006/2006-schools.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/2006/2006-schools.pdf" rel="nofollow">2006</a>, <a href="http://www.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/2005/2005-schools.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/2005/2005-schools.pdf" rel="nofollow">2005</a>, <a href="http://www.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/2004/2004-schools.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/2004/2004-schools.pdf" rel="nofollow">2004</a>, <a href="http://www.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/2003-schools.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/2003-schools.pdf" rel="nofollow">2003</a>, <a href="http://www.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/list-1982.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/list-1982.pdf" rel="nofollow">1982–83 to 2001–02</a>. I don't think each of these schools deserves a separate entry. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkipSmith_e48d.html" title="User:SkipSmith">SkipSmith</a> 01:30, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>I think the estimate of 6,000 schools is about right. The <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Ribbon_Schools_Program_4a5b.html" title="Blue Ribbon Schools Program">Blue Ribbon Schools Program</a> article points out that that's 6,000 out of a total of about 133,000 schools of all types in the United States (although some schools have won in multiple years, so that cuts down the number of winners). If there were a total of say, 5,000, that would mean one school in every 26 has already received the award. I'm neutral. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 01:57, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - so the School is in the top 4%; that seems notable to me. We are in danger of applying higher standards to schools, that are public institutions and have a permanence, than to the thousands of article on transient poupular culture - virtually every commercial CD has an article, many of which are little more than a track listing, take <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Erections_a755.html" title="New Erections">New Erections</a> for example. Which article enhances WP the more? <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerriersFan_e633.html" title="User:TerriersFan">TerriersFan</a> 03:37, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. D'oh! I should have just read <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Ribbon_Schools_Program_4a5b.html" title="Blue Ribbon Schools Program">Blue Ribbon Schools Program</a> more closely instead of doing all that detective work! <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkipSmith_e48d.html" title="User:SkipSmith">SkipSmith</a> 02:25, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b> In its current form, subject is not sufficiently <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> IMHO, although this is a close call. Whether it is d'd or k'd, it needs a proper citation to these awards. Depending on the citations they come up with, Messers. A or TF just might swing my vote on this one. --<a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButseriouslyfolks_e848.html" title="User:Butseriouslyfolks">Butseriouslyfolks</a> 01:48, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - In addition to a Blue Ribbon award, this school has been particularly active in a number of initiatives. The test for inclusion in WP is whether there is likely to be sufficient interest in the school to justify an entry and that seems to be the case. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerriersFan_e633.html" title="User:TerriersFan">TerriersFan</a> 02:44, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> No matter how you slice it, the <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Ribbon_Schools_Program_4a5b.html" title="Blue Ribbon Schools Program">Blue Ribbon Schools Program</a> is the highest level of recognition awarded to a school in the United States, along with its state's highest level of recognition. Notability is clearly established. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 12:07, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The school has some notability, and TerriersFan makes a good point that it's a public institution with some permanence. It also has the interest of a Wikipedia editor, which is important. And the article looks good. Worth keeping. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 23:45, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Notable as a Blue Ribbon School award winning school, multiple third party sources are available as well. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Yamaguchi%E5%85%88%E7%94%9F&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Yamaguchi%E5%85%88%E7%94%9F&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">Yamaguchi先生</a> 05:50, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
