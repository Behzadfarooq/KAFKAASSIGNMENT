<li>"Don't delete"- i like DTF.....</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>This band is junk, the first song they played didn't even have instruments! - ZJ</li>
</ul>
<p>---It didn't have instruments because it was a barbershop quartet! They wrote out all 4 parts with no help, tabs, score-sheets or anything - just a pen and paper! You don't even know what you're talking about buddy.</p>
<ul>
<li>---Well nobody wants to see it at a rock show, who likes Phish anyway?!</li>
<li>"who likes Phish anyway?!"&#160;!?!?!? Phish is the hugest band next to Led Zeppelin and DTF, idiot.</li>
<li><b>Don't Delete!!!</b> DTF are the next Amon Düül II!!!! (although I do concur Halfway is a superior musical entity in everything but breeding stock)</li>
</ul>
<p>I jus't thought that I would point out the hypocracy here. All of these wikipedia members are arguing that we should get rid of this DTF page because it is not relevant and simply trying to promote the band. The funny part is that all of these people on the message board have a page written about themselves. THAT seems completely relevant to me. So it is alright for all of you to have a page about yourself, but not alright for a new band to post some RELEVANT and TRUE information about themselves?</p>
<dl>
<dd>...what are you talking about? -- <a href="../../../c/y/r/User%7ECyrius_3685.html" title="User:Cyrius">Cyrius</a>|<a href="../../../c/y/r/User_talk%7ECyrius_ef50.html" title="User talk:Cyrius">✎</a> 07:39, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Dont Delete!</b> This is completely relevant! Some people are researching information on the popularity of unknown teenage bands. The fact that DTF may not be as well known as some other bands does not mean that it does not have potential. DTF is worthy of a spot on the Wikipedia encyclopedia. There are many people interested, as you can see it has had a lot of viewers. I, myself, am a DTF fan. Please do not delete this page! It is gaining popularity to a wider range of people using Wikipedia by drawing attention to the encyclopedia. It is no harm to anybody!</p>
<p>Dont Delete! "What am I talking about?"...well, I am talking about the fact that you (for example Cyrius) would like DTF's page to be deleted because you find it to be irrelevant and for the purpose of self-promotion, yet you happen to have a page on wikipedia for yourself, describing yourself as "just some guy". Why should it be alright for you to post a page about yourself, but not alright for a new band to post a page about themselves? Personally, I do not have a problem with either.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Those are not encyclopedia articles, those are user pages. Anyone who signs up for an account gets a user page. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 22:38, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Alright, sorry for my confusion. I still think that DTF should be allowed to keep this page, because they are a talented band that will make a name for themselves one day. I do not think that we should discriminate against bands because they are not as well-known as others. Every band has to start from somewhere.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is not "discrimination", this is common sense. An encyclopedia documents famous and notable things, not every single minor thing that ever happened in the world. We have a set of consistent standards we apply to every article: see <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. When DTF becomes successful, you can write an encyclopedia article about them then. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 14:45, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I will restate the fact that DTF has signed a deal with British record label Delerium to promote their EP in the United States, Continental Europe and Israel, and they have taken it upon themselves to deal with domestic distribution. That in itself is indicative of success, no?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I chose my words poorly. Good for them on being signed, and this is a measure of success. However, most editors of Wikipedia do not consider merely being signed as enough to merit an encyclopedia article. Please see the guidelines at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> for what most editors of Wikipedia consider the standards for inclusion here. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 22:13, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Maybe they will make it big one day - for that, I wish them luck. However, I'm not convinced that you're being totally honest. A small quote from Delerium Records website: "<i>Delerium records is no longer active and the website is now on-line for information purposes. There will be the occasional Delerium re-issue or limited edition.</i>" Over the years I've seen hundreds of bands that their record labels claimed would be huge, only they never did. Wikipedia doesn't really cater for speculation, and to say that they will be huge in the future is just that: speculation. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamyskis_2c95.html" title="User:Jamyskis">Jamyskis</a> 13:02, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would just like to say.....DTF rawks the kazbah. My name is Regina Felangi, and i am a very important business woman in the business world. I know when a band is going to make it big. Just this morning, while i was in board room A, I was discussing with my fellow workers, the potential that said band had. Wikipedia is not being harmed by this link, that is my business perspective.</p>
<p>Dont Delete!!!!! DTF is my favorite band! They have the hottest guys ever! Have you ever seen Jacob Fox? His last name is there for a reason. HE certainly is a Fox. A really fine one. I'm sure that if everyone on this forum saw him, they would immeadiately change their mind about deleting this. Did I mention that he is also an AMAZING lead guitarist? He is.Wow.</p>
<p>Dont Delete!!! I love Jacob too! Even more than her!</p>

<p>Dont Delete! But I must disagree with that other fan. Ben is definitely the hottest band member. Seriously. He is gorgeous. DTF for life!</p>
