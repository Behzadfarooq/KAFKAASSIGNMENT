<li>Wikipedia is where I learned what skeet means. It has good encyclopedic information that can't be found by traditional means, but it also is a good resource for current pop culture. I was surprised to not see an entry for this when I got here today. -- neoalec 19:48, 24 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Skeet has an article because it is used worldwide and has been used for many years. However, "Crumbelievable" is only used by fans of Stephen Colbert. Many Americans do not watch Colbert's show, and it's not broadcast in multiple countries. The major two differences betwen "skeet" and "crumbelievable" are:
<ol>
<li>"Crumbelievable" is very localized and only used by people who watch a certain television show while "Skeet" is used prominently in at least three different nations, by people of all social groups and hobbies;</li>
<li>"Crumbelievable" is a recent ("neo" = "new") term and may never be used again, whereas it is fairly certain that "skeet" will continue to be used. <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b><font color="green">S<i>rose</i></font></b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(<b>talk</b>)</font></a> 19:54, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>.

<li><i>Colbert is making a joke. By taking him seriously, you risk becoming a part of the joke. Of course, if people generally take him up on the joke, then he will verify his own cultrural significance, and we'll also need an article.

<li>Please tell me that wasn't something Colbert said (again) to attack Wikipedia (again)?...If it is, sounds like he's asking for fans to make articles for him. <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b><font color="green">S<i>rose</i></font></b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(<b>talk</b>)</font></a> 21:00, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - is the above a complete non sequitur, or do you actually believe that the existence of other bad articles justifies the existence of another one? Why not get rid of AfD altogether, as a supporter of any "bad" article can simply cite the existence of Pokemon cruft as justification for anything? <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoffspear_16b0.html" title="User:Geoffspear">Geoffrey Spear</a> 17:47, 28 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I believe the point of the argument is that there are wikipedia stubs for advertisment campaigns and slogans, and this fits under that category. Explain how you feel this is a "bad" article because I have yet to see anyone that has done that yet without merely resorting to the emotional response the name "Stephen Colbert" evokes on wikipedia. — Robre 20:10, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Note: Anyone who can read can verify that this term was <i>not</i> invented by <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Colbert_e40e.html" title="Stephen Colbert">Colbert</a>, but instead by <a href="../../../k/r/a/Kraft_Foods_3f68.html" title="Kraft Foods">Kraft Foods</a>. As such, it's an <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_campaign.html" title="Ad campaign">ad campaign</a>, and not something Colbert made up. This doesn't make it notable, but the product probably has some degree of notability. The article should probably be redirected to an article on the product, should it exist (which it doesn't). Anyhow, continue to argue as you please, but do note this isn't a Colbert invention. --<a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeitei_af28.html" title="User:Keitei">Keitei</a> <span style="font-size:75%">(<a href="../../../k/e/i/User_talk%7EKeitei_ced4.html" title="User talk:Keitei">talk</a>)</span> 07:06, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
