<li><b>Strong Save</b>:First of all, this game was invented by me in the year 2002. I searched the web high and low to see if anybody else had thought of this prior to me, I found no entries on this. Recently the game has been gaining much momentum as a result of myspace.com and other networking sites. A page on Wikipedia, the site that started it all, is what I think could give it the boost it needs to become successful internationally. Also, it was given a patent 2 days ago which I filed for in 2003. I just didn't put it on Wikipedia untill I had the (assumed) security of a US Patent. -- <a href="../../../d/27/b/User%7ED%27Brickashaw_5d40.html" title="User:D'Brickashaw">User:D'Brickashaw</a> 04:05, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Save</b>: It does have notability, just not yet INTERNATIONAL notability, it is extremely popular and well known in the three Eastern states of Australia. <a href="../../../d/27/b/User%7ED%27Brickashaw_5d40.html" title="User:D'Brickashaw">D'Brickashaw</a> 04:19, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I will have to look up whether this game received a trademark or a patent (the article is ambiguous on this point), but <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">my user page</a> has a list of 18 other versions of this exact game which were created by other people. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 04:29, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as non notable. Also, as far as I understand patent law, one can only be granted a patent for a physical object, or at least the idea of one. A patent can't be granted for actions, which this would fall under. The creator may mean they received a <i>trademark</i>, which is a completely different thing, and would only cover the name, not necessarily the game itself. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalie_Erin_58a7.html" title="User:Natalie Erin">Natalie</a> 05:00, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Having done a little bit of research, this is not eligible for patent in the United States, as is claimed above. US patent law only covers "any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof". Before you ask, this does not appear to count as a process as I understand it. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalie_Erin_58a7.html" title="User:Natalie Erin">Natalie</a> 05:32, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Just a piece of advice, rather than telling us that this game is notable in Australia, prove it to us.

<li>I don't know where you could get a copy of it, but Australian Schools Magazine ran an article on it in the November 2005 issue, mentioning my name as well as the game itself. It was also featured in the December 16th 2005 section of connect in the Daily Telegraph Newspaper which also credited me as the creator. <a href="../../../d/27/b/User%7ED%27Brickashaw_5d40.html" title="User:D'Brickashaw">D'Brickashaw</a> 06:05, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>As well as this, PC World ran an article in it's September 2006 issue about Wikipedia Random Article Games, that quoted. "A concept that was made popular in Australia in 2002 with the advent of Connect-A-Pedia has now turned into an internet meme with thousands of copycats all over the web." This did not mention my name, but it did mention the name of my particular game and the relative location. <a href="../../../d/27/b/User%7ED%27Brickashaw_5d40.html" title="User:D'Brickashaw">D'Brickashaw</a> 06:23, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> <i>Wikipedia</i> itself wasn't popular in 2002, how amazing that this game transcended the popularity of the site to become so well known in the eastern states of Australia! Even more amazing, it's an internet meme with <i>no mention on the internet at all</i>. The <i>PC World</i> "reference" is obviously bogus - the first 40 pages of the magazine consist of a review section called First Looks - they would not have an article on "Random Wiki Games" on page 29. Connect is published in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> every Wednesday, yet your copy is dated 16 December 2005 which was a Friday! --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 22:57, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Definite Keeper</b> I am reading the article the creator was talking about in the September 2006 PC World right now and it all checks out. Besides this, the article seems to be factual, well-written, and by the evidence in PC World alone it is notable. <a href="../../../b/a/m/User%7EBamkazam_d41f.html" title="User:Bamkazam">Bamkazam</a> 05:57, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Worth-Saving</b> - In my opinion articles like these are good to have, they help to make Wikipedia, more unique, user-friendly and universal. I don't understand why everytime an article that is a little alternative to the usual, people call for it to be deleted. There is room for everything on Wikipedia, people should just cut the nonsense. And if what Bamkazam said is true, it seems notable to me. <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaximum_andy_9b92.html" title="User:Maximum andy">Maximum andy</a> 06:07, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Lets not be hasty</b> First of all, I am a deletionist, but I think this is notable as I know for a fact that one of the sources checks out. I work for the Sydney Daily Telegraph and decided to look in the archives that are not available to the public, these contain everything. To my surprise this was mentioned in the December 16th 2005 issue of connect. At first I wanted this deleted, but now I have totally changed my tune. PS Canley, throughout late 2005 and early 2006 we did run Connect on Friday and Wednesday. <a href="../../../j/o/j/User%7EJojodeletionist_8a64.html" title="User:Jojodeletionist">Jojodeletionist</a> 06:31, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Fuck Connect-A-Pedia</b> - Delete this fucking thing, it is pure bullshit.

<li><b>Comment</b> Hmmm. Very convincing argument, is that the way you treat people who you slightly disagree with, you are quite the skilled linguist and debater. <a href="../../../d/27/b/User%7ED%27Brickashaw_5d40.html" title="User:D'Brickashaw">D'Brickashaw</a> 06:50, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well now, isn't this charming ... the only three editors to agree with Mr. D'Brickashaw and a convenient punching bag, all four new accounts created within a twenty minute span of one another.

<li><b>Delete</b> It's a nice idea but should have been speedy deleted - no evidence of notability at all. However the comments of Goshuckurself are quite inappropriate and volation of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> <a href="../../../n/b/e/User%7ENBeale_6ecb.html" title="User:NBeale">NBeale</a> 07:01, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. NN, as mentioned above, and while I'm doing my best to assume good faith here, it does seem a little fishy that a patent became a trademark, that this trademark/patent hybrid has not yet been included on a relevant site, that even if there was a trademark there'd still be no automatic notability, and that an article in PC World which would at least scrape the bottom of the notability barrel can only be found by two accounts with a very similar cadence. Meh. --Action Jackson IV 07:14, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
