<li><b>Comment</b> - I looked up the webpage on NESARA that is located on Quatloss. It is directly related to the article <a href="../../../n/e/s/NESARA_bc4d.html" title="NESARA">NESARA</a> however, not related to this conspiracy theory which is, <a href="../../../n/e/s/NESARA_conspiracy_theory_ff93.html" title="NESARA conspiracy theory">NESARA conspiracy theory</a>. It does not support any of the information located in it, but talks about the "law" that the NESARA article itself discusses, not the conspiracy this article discusses. Perhaps later I will add it to the NESARA article as a source, however it does not support the ideas of any conspiracy nor even discuss a conspiracy. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 16:22, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Of the 12 references, at least 5 are reliable news media or alternative news media (such as <a href="http://www.quatloos.com/NESARA.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.quatloos.com/NESARA.htm" rel="nofollow">the Quatloos article</a>). That article notes the <u>real</u> NESARA concept, but is over 2/3 about the conspiracy theory (including some commentary by the people behind the real proposal). Even if you were to exclude that, it's over half about the conspiracy/hoax. <i>That</i> being clear, I'm forced to <b>conclude</b> this is a bad faith nomination. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 17:07, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>More harrassment, you already stated long ago you assume bad faith in everything I do, and magically found your way here. Now I have treated you with respect, and I ask you do the same. More then half of the soruces are not WP:RS, news doesnt mean some random person reported it as such. The WP:RS source is Tacoma as pointed out below and is a local paper, leaving the issue of an entire article sourced to one place, and it not meeting WP:N, since it doesnt have multiple non trivial sources, just a single source of information. Others can easily review the source if they feel I am wrong. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 17:23, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I hope that people do indeed take the time to review this source, as you are quite obviously wrong. Can you please clarify, did you just read the first sentence of this article or the whole thing? Did you read the second paragraph which begins "Scam artists often latch on to something that sounds good to relieve suckers of money...", or the third paragraph which begins "The NESARA proposal is currently being used in just this sort of a scam...", or the fourth which begins "The scam artists pitching the NESARA scam claim that the 'True NESARA Law' was already adopted by Congress in 2001, but that Congress has been keeping it a secret all this time..."? This article is about the hoax and further substantiates notability. - <a href="../../../s/e/d/User%7ESednar_f2f1.html" title="User:Sednar">Sednar</a> 03:18, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Is Quatloss not using the Tacoma paper as its source? I am being generous in all honesty since much of the links its using to make its case are blogs and non reliable sources, bringing into question what its reporting on. However since it mainly uses Tacoma, and it seems to be the only reliable source in the group, it seems its still just a local issue and fascination. Apparently I am not the only one that feels that way, your friend and someone you commonly agree with Tom, Morton etc all seem to feel you are wrong, anyway it seems concensus is speaking. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><s><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a></s> 21:25, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - It's notable and fascinating. The sources are The Tacoma Tribune (several articles), the documentary (if you haven't seen the movie you can verify the info in the numerous articles about the movie), quatloos, and the conspirator's sites. How does it lack references? If you see a fact in the article in need of a reference, why don't you put a citation needed tag. Also, this article on the conspiracy theory is more notable then the legal proposal ("legitimate version") because it's more well known and almost all the references you find will refer to the conspiracy theory. Although the exact phrase "nesara conspiracy theory" may not be used in the page, even a cursory glance will verify that. Go ahead and look at the first 10 google matches yourself, 9 of them are speaking about the conspiracy theory and not the legal proposal. I don't see any language in the article being used to promote the hoax or spread misinformation, do you? Where? It seems pretty clearly refering to it as a hoax and discussing it as a hoax.

<li><b>Comment</b> You're citing a single of the sources - just about the shortest one - and saying "althought it has some links...", but anyone who looks at the article and starts looking through the sources - just the ones in reputable sources discussing it as a hoax - will find that there's many, many hours of reading material there justifying its notability.

<li><b>Keep</b>. There is a strong anti-conspiracy bent among some editors, a belief that since "no one in their right mind could believe this," these theories could not possibly have enough adherents to make them notable. Thus, even an entry for a plainly notable "conspiracy theorist" like Ted Gunderson can get deleted. So we have comments about "a group meeting at KFC once a week," when the article makes it clear that this is just one group of believers. Unfortunately, even theories as outlandish as this can find believers. The WP:V and WP:RS arguments are unconvincing; the Tacoma "local paper" has been disparaged as a non-notable RS, but it is a RS. Furthermore, this article is not promoting the theory; it clearly presents the case against it. --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice"><span style="color:indigo; border:thin solid cyan; background:aliceblue">Groggy Dice</span></a> <span style="border:thin solid gold;"><a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGroggy_Dice_aa9f.html" title="User talk:Groggy Dice">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Groggy_Dice_610a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Groggy Dice">C</a></span> 16:01, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I admit that the Tacoma Tribune is a reliable source. I believe that this story should only be kept if it meets the requirements of WP:HOAX, i.e. that it fools a lot of people; it needs to be a notable hoax. This fact I believe is not established by the current sources. Arguments that 'Some people claim this..' and 'Some people claim that..' don't seem very convincing. The total documented extent of the hoax (from the Tribune article) is that one person was scammed out of $10,000 (this is so far just a claim filed with the attorney general) and 'possibly much more' (a speculative extrapolation). <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 15:47, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Another concession, another objection put up in its place... But this one doesn't stand up to scrutiny either. You mention one of the articles, and the fact that it only refers to one person who had money taken, but again this is selective reporting on your part (perhaps unintentionally). In the rest of the Tribune's articles on the subject, and in the documentary film on the subject, and in the articles about the documentary film, there are many more people quoted and interviewed, who may not have given money, but who definitely profess a belief in it. The sheer number of blogs and web pages devoted to NESARA (and its supposed imminent announcement and "wonderful changes it will bring about") demonstrates the number of people that believe this. Thousands? I'm not sure, but many hundreds is clearly evident. "'Some people claim this..' and 'Some people claim that..'" are all backed up by the sources provided, including the documentary film about the subject, and it's simply a matter of reading them all to verify this. I've challenged people to put citation needed tags in the proper place on the article where they feel that there are unsourced statements, so far nobody has done this. I've been puzzling over the hostility towards this article, and I think I understand the real issue... I've noticed that a number of people wanting this article deleted have also edited 9/11 articles, and I see that someone put this article in the "9/11 conspiracy theories" template. So I think the real issue, which nobody is bringing up, is that people feel that this is not a prominent 9/11 conspiracy theory. I agree that it is not particularly notable as a 9/11 conspiracy theory (especially when there is only one other theory listed in the template). But I think <b>removing this article from that template, which I would support, is the proper response, and not throwing the baby out with the bathwater by deleting the entire article</b>. - <a href="../../../s/e/d/User%7ESednar_f2f1.html" title="User:Sednar">Sednar</a> 03:13, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. For the following reason - NESARA may have started out as a minor aspect of a larger Confidence Scheme but through the tireless promotion of the concept by Dove of Oneness and others who truly believe in it, it's started to pop up in the writings of other major conspiracy theorists. You'll see talk of NESARA in with David Icke, The New World Order, The Trilateral Commission, and yes, 9/11. NESARA seems to "feel" right to folks looking for another reason to balme 9/11 on anyone but the Hamburg Cell. Yes, the article needs some work, but a basic description of what the term means, how it originated, it's incorpration into the Con and then its extension into New Age conspiracism should stay.<a href="../../../l/i/s/User%7ELisapollison_fe0d.html" title="User:Lisapollison">LiPollis</a> 18:49, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
