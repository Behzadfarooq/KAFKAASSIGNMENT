<p>Previously deleted as NN,copyvio, spam. Later recreated, speedy was contested, claiming it was a little different; someone changed it to a redirect, which was later diverted. At this point may be best to post here for review. May need to be protected if it does wind up as speedy or redir. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanbeg_28d2.html" title="User:Sanbeg">Steve Sanbeg</a> 16:08, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Currently no sources are cited in the article. The article claims that the show's format has been copied in other countries. I would say that if sources could be found to verify that and some other claims; then notability would be established. As for the copyvio concerns; the talk page of the article says that the show's staff wrote the page the article was copied from, and that they are the same ones contributing the article. The source website doesn't have any sort of copyright notice, so my guess is that they are agreeing to the GFDL by posting it here, negating the copyright worries. The thing that that leaves me with is <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest concerns</a>. However, <b>if</b> they can source their information to reliable published sources, then POV problems can be cleaned up later. Assuming the article evolves during the AFD to be sourced, then I see no reason it shouldn't be <s><b>kept</b></s>. ~ <i><b><a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn"><span style="background:#0cc;color:#fff5ee">ONUnicorn</span></a></b></i><sup>(<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">Contribs</a>)</sup> 16:35, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>(The following comment copied from the AFD talk page)Many of the facts posted in this wiki we are posting from our own memories although there is an article written by the Daily Camera ( local newspaper) about Basementalism that contained many of these facts as well, though they were given to the reporter from us over the course of interviews.</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> The article has changed somewhat from the original version. It now cites some sources (though the citations are not in line), at least one of which can be considered a reliable source which is independant of the article subject. However, it only cites 3 sources total, and one of them is still the history on the Basementalism website. I'd like to see more independant sources cited. I've gone over the article and tried to reduce the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">point of view</a> problems, copy-edited it, and wikified it; but it still needs more clean up. I'm not sure why this AFD's still open; usually they are closed after 5 days and it's now been 8. The concensus seems to be at this point to <a href="../../../m/e/r/WP%7EMERGE_94d1.html" title="WP:MERGE">merge</a> the information into the article about the radio station, and if you can't find more sources that are independent of the show and station themselves, then that's what I would recomend doing at this point. ~ <i><b><a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn"><span style="background:#0cc;color:#fff5ee">ONUnicorn</span></a></b></i><sup>(<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">Contribs</a>)</sup> 20:33, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I would urge the two of you who said are pushing for a deletion because it's simply a "radio show on a university station" to read the entry a little more thoroughly. Basementalism is also a record label and promotions company.</p>
<p>Also there is no school paper linked as a ciatation. The Daily Camera is a Colorado newspaper, as is the Westword. Neither one of them are affiliated with the University Of Colorado. They are both reliable sources. If you like, I will remove the citation of the Basementalism website. Although the website's history section contains much of the same information found in the other two articles.</p>
<p>I don't think that adding all of the Basementalism info to the KVCU page is a good idea because KVCU has several specialty shows and should they all decide to start making entries it will create a logjam on the KVCU entry that is probably not all that worthy of multiple entries and links. We started the Basementalism entry not to promote the radio show but to give a history on Basementalism's place in the hip hop community in Colorado, the United States, and beyond. Calling what Basementalism is now "something that we just made up in school" is insulting, a.) because we, the people working on this entry did not make it up and b.) it has become far more than just a college radio show.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your input and I look forward to working with you.</p>

<dd>Comment: The <i>Daily Camera</i> is a <b>local</b> newspaper (Colorado Springs) and <i>Westword</i> is a (local) free alternative weekly, so they're not much of a cut above college newspapers. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 01:33, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually the Daily Camera is based out of Boulder, but that's neither here nor there.</p>
<p>And aren't most newspapers local papers? Does each article have to be from USAToday or the AP? It doesn't say that in the rules anywhere. I have to be honest I'm very suprised that so many of you want to delete this entry. The articles do explain the history of the station as well as the show and the facts that are explained in the entry, what does it matter if the papers are based out of the same state?
