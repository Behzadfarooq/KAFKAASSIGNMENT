<li><b>LOL</b>, Actually i found it funny that this page was put for deletion so fast. First i'd like to point out that votes for deletion of user pages is suppose to be done "in excessive or stubborn cases" as is stated on <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>, the comment on my user page was left after the VfD. I will try to work on the page, and probably remove the "list" of other users. It is sad that i wasn't given a chance to do so. <a href="http://eng.anarchopedia.org/index.php/User:beta_m" class="external text" title="http://eng.anarchopedia.org/index.php/User:beta_m" rel="nofollow">Beta_M</a> <a href="http://eng.anarchopedia.org/index.php/User_talk:beta_m" class="external text" title="http://eng.anarchopedia.org/index.php/User_talk:beta_m" rel="nofollow"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beta_m_affc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beta m">|<sup><b>contrib</b></sup></a> (<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Beta_m_520d.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Beta m"><small>Ë-Mail</small></a>)</li>
<li>I have changed the page. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">RickK</a>, if you could please answer what i've written to you on <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">your talk page</a> (and on <a href="../../../b/e/t/User_talk%7EBeta_m_5271.html" title="User talk:Beta m">mine</a> as a responce to your post), it would be greatly appreciated. As the page is now i don't see how there can be any objections to it, i won't remove {{vfd}} so if either you or somebody else would do that it would be appreciated.

<li><b>Keep</b> for the moment. This listing appears to be in violation of the current <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion policy</a> in that the user was not contacted first.

Solution: Talk to the user; if that doesn't work, come back here.</i> You seem to have jumped straight to the second table, <i>Problems that may require deletion</i>, but the instructions clearly say <i>Read the following <b>two</b> tables to find out what to do with a problem page</i> (my emphasis).

<li><i><b>I</b></i> think that policy is pretty obscurely-located. I never knew it existed, and when I read it when you first posted, I went right past it. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 00:14, Feb 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - and not that it really matters but I only give no reason for deletion when it has already been stated by multiple users, or when the article really doesn't need a reason. Maybe I should just stick in a pun every time to keep you happy. <a href="../../../x/e/z/User%7EXezbeth_c481.html" title="User:Xezbeth"><font color="red">Xezbeth</font></a> 16:25, Feb 3, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Um voting without giving reasons is very stress-inducing because the vote and the voter are then unknown quantities. If someone wants to answer reason for deletion, maybe by providing evidence or improving the article, they don't know how or if there would be any point trying. Maybe the article doesn't need a reason, but they can't tell if the vote is about the article, or the topic. If a reason been given, it's not to hard to say "delete per (username) is it"? <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 19:32, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> in present form. I don't see why this should have been listed on VfD in any case. Agree that it did violate the "no personal attacks" policy. But this could have been handled in other ways. For example the page itself could have been edited, with an edit comment and notes on its Talk page. Suggest in any case that the page be moved to "Deletion<b>o</b>holic" to conform better with the spelling of alc<b>o</b>hol.

<li>I'd say it can't, as I don't consider myself a deletionist. I vote keep on "fancruft" all the time, for example. <a href="../../../x/e/z/User%7EXezbeth_c481.html" title="User:Xezbeth"><font color="red">Xezbeth</font></a> 20:14, Feb 3, 2005 (UTC)

<li>There's nothing wrong with listing people who <i>identify themselves</i> as deletionists. There's quite a bit wrong with applying such a label to someone else.

<li>Comment: The original of this page was over the top and consituted a personal attack IMO, and would have been a possible <a href="../../../r/f/c/RfC_1260.html" title="RfC">RfC</a> candidate if it hadn't been withdrawn.

<li>My above comments aside..... I'm a little queasy about the idea of voting to delete someone's personal user page, short of ad hominem attacks or discriminatory or vulgar text. I happen to find the practice of making these sorts of "hit lists" personally distasteful but I'm not sure I'd vote to delete one of them on someone's user page. So I have to say, while holding my nose, <b>keep.</b> <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0">Katefan0</a> 20:40, Feb 3, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I believe Beta M should have been contacted first. Listing a user page in VfD without doing this may sound like an aggression itself. But I do think that list should be deleted. It's unpolite to categorize people this way, associating them with a Wikipedia "philosophy"; let they categorize themselves if they want. I ask Beta M to remove it. <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a> 04:46, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><s>???? This is not intended as an attack or a rhetorical question, but I <b>don't</b> see that you've "removed the list."

I believe it is "legal" but inappropriate to have this in your user space and I think it would be wise for you to remove it.

<li>I too see the list has returned, after being deleted. I think those on the list should feel free to remove their names, if they wish, and if added again then they can proceed with some sort of arbitration. I was actually thinking of adding my name. I've never actually been called a "deletionoholic" (just an old fashioned alcoholic, though that isn't true either), but if "frequently votes delete" (for shame, RickK, for <i>shame</i>!) is all it takes then I guess I fit the bill. I don't consider myself "deletionist", mostly because I think it's a stupid word. In fact, this whole thing is stupid, and I'm not going to cast any official vote, just my suggestion I mentioned. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 14:12, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Comment: I'd recommend commenting on the <a href="../../../b/e/t/User_talk%7EBeta_m_Deletionoholics_15d2.html" title="User talk:Beta m/Deletionoholics">talk page</a> instead, we are creating a terrible precedent IMO if we all start updating user pages without the user's permission. If you <b>do</b> update another user's page (and that's what a Wiki is for), please be very careful not to impersonate them, even accidentally. As an example of this, if you check the history, you'll see that the list was actually <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ABeta_m%2FDeletionoholics&amp;diff=9946955&amp;oldid=9913558" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ABeta_m%2FDeletionoholics&amp;diff=9946955&amp;oldid=9913558" rel="nofollow">restored</a> by another user, and of more concern they also restored the personal attack at the same time. You'll also see that the page move by the user broke the links here, partly as a result of the person who listed this on VfD not following the instructions (<i>please</i> read them). I think I've fixed it all now. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 21:09, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Preliminary <b>Keep</b> under the general principle of giving users broad leeway and control over their user space. I agree that inflammatory personal attacks are not acceptable, but I don't think this qualifies. (Expressing POV about other users does not IMO equate to attacks.) Even if it did qualify, though, I agree under this principle that the user should be asked to change it first. - <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">Keith D.

<li>Comment: Ironically, this attack if it was one was a lot milder than what several of Beta m's accusers regularly get away with, IMO. But two wrongs don't make a right. No change of vote. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 23:24, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep. Although I agree that at the time RickK made the nomination, this page was just personal attacks and deserving of deletion. Now it's just an example of illiteracy. BTW, I've voted Delete hundreds of times--why didn't I make 'the list'&#160;:/ . <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 19:42, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I see no evidence of abuse on this page within user space, nor in its history log. GRider\<sup><a href="../../../g/r/i/User_talk%7EGRider_a2d7.html" title="User talk:GRider">talk</a></sup> 18:51, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
