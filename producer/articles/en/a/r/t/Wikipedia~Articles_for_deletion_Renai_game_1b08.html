<p>This article is a duplicate of the subject of <a href="../../../d/a/t/Dating_sim.html" title="Dating sim">dating sim</a>. Please do not close this AfD simply saying we can keep both articles, because we cannot have two articles about the same subject! I recommend Wikipedia choose the term "dating sim" simply because the titles of Wikipedia articles are not meant to reflect fandom jargon, but rather the most commonly used term. A brief overview for those who don't know:</p>
<ul>
<li>The term "dating sim," meaning a video game focused around romance, has been in use in English since the 1990s. It is an English translation of the Japanese term 恋愛ゲーム <i>ren'ai geemu</i>. Dating sims have overlap with <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishoujo_games.html" title="Bishoujo games">bishoujo games</a>, meaning Japanese games involving cute girls, and <a href="../../../v/i/s/Visual_novels.html" title="Visual novels">visual novels</a>, a medium similar to text adventure.</li>
<li>The term "dating sim" is commonly used in video game literature to describe any kind of romantic game, regardless of whether it is a simulation or text adventure, because that's simply the term commonly used in English. For example: <a href="http://news.google.com/news?q=%22dating+sim" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com/news?q=%22dating+sim" rel="nofollow">Google News</a>, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22dating+sim" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22dating+sim" rel="nofollow">Google Book Search</a>, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22dating+sim" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22dating+sim" rel="nofollow">Google Scholar</a></li>
<li>The term "ren'ai game" is a neologism. It is not Japanese; that would be "ren'ai geemu." It is not English; that would be "romance game." And it is not used in reliable English sources <i>at all</i>. <a href="http://news.google.com/news?as_brr=0&amp;tab=pn&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22ren%27ai+game" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com/news?as_brr=0&amp;tab=pn&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22ren%27ai+game" rel="nofollow">Google News</a>, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22ren%27ai+game" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22ren%27ai+game" rel="nofollow">Google Book Search</a>, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22ren'ai%20game" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22ren'ai%20game" rel="nofollow">Google Scholar</a></li>
<li>The <b>publishers</b> of romantic bishoujo games in English refer to them as "dating sims," even if they involve neither dating nor simulation, because "dating sim" is the term most commonly used in English. For example, <a href="../../../k/a/n/Image%7EKana_cover.jpg_db14.html" title="Image:Kana cover.jpg">Image:Kana cover.jpg</a>, <a href="http://jbox.com/" class="external free" title="http://jbox.com/" rel="nofollow">http://jbox.com/</a>, <a href="http://www.peachprincess.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.peachprincess.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.peachprincess.com/</a> (click through to front page - NSFW)</li>
</ul>
<p>So, I recommend this article be deleted as a neologism, or at least redirected to <a href="../../../d/a/t/Dating_sim.html" title="Dating sim">dating sim</a>. The main content of this article is some stuff I wrote in the <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime_game.html" title="Anime game">anime game</a> article which was recently moved here by other people without my knowledge; I recommend it be moved somewhere else before deleting. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">(tock)</a> 17:40, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> -- isn't that pretty much always what we do with apparently redundant articles?

<li><b>Keep</b> -- <i>The Pickup Game</i> on Newsgrounds is considered a dating sim in engish but wouldn't be considered a "ren'ai game". Also, The Pickup Game is actually about teaching guys how to pick up girls. It makes mention of the "3 second-rule" which is a term that orginates from the <a href="../../../m/y/s/Mystery_Method_fa65.html" title="Mystery Method">Mystery Method</a>. The Mystery Method is a part of the <a href="../../../s/e/d/Seduction_Community_12c9.html" title="Seduction Community">Seduction Community</a>. Counter Arts 00:12, 24 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have no idea what you're talking about. Could you cite some reliable sources, such as printed publications, for your uses of the term "dating sim" and "ren'ai game" in the context of the "seduction community"? Also, how does this invalidate the term "dating sim"? <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">(tock)</a> 00:53, 24 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Can you cite a reliable source on the definition of the term Dating Sim, that it must have romance? You might be able to say how popular a term is by google results but you can't say what defintion it has by those results. The Pickup Game is not focused on romance. It is focused on picking up girls. Counter Arts 02:47, 24 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So, which reliable source calls it a dating sim? <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">(tock)</a> 03:15, 24 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, that game has over 1 million views on newgrounds alone. It also recieved an daily third place award on that site. It is listed as "dating sim". In my opinion, a lot of other people consider that a dating sim as it teaches how to pick up girls. Counter Arts 03:49, 24 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If the Badger Badger movie were referred to as a "dating sim" on Newgrounds would that invalidate this AfD too? (my roundabout point being that Wikipedia is supposed to reflect reliably used terms, not new definitions created by websites) <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">(tock)</a> 04:25, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>"Dating Sim" is not a reliably used term.

<li>It is reliably used both in gaming publications, in published books, and by the licensors of the dating sims themselves, c.f. <a href="../../../k/a/n/Image%7EKana_cover.jpg_db14.html" title="Image:Kana cover.jpg">Image:Kana cover.jpg</a>. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">(tock)</a> 21:28, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Hm... The example of the cover of Kana is odd, since my copy doesn't contain the word "Dating Sim" at all. It's missing that flag at the bottom mentioning it. (See the cover on g-collection's site.) A quick survey of my collection shows Peach Princess using the term "Dating Sim", G-Collections using "Erotic Bishoujo Adventure", Hirameki using either "Interactive DVD", "Visual Novel", and whatever they're calling Piece of Wonder, LIBIDO using "dating game", Okashi Studios using "ren'ai game", and JAST-USA using "Love-sim". I personally think there's a distinction between "dating sim", which describes a mechanic, and "ren'ai", which is about content. <a href="../../../p/y/t/User%7EPytom_91d0.html" title="User:Pytom">PyTom</a> 22:44, 24 January 2007 (UTC)
