<dd><b>Comment</b> First, WalterWalrus originally did not sign his comment and stated that he had not voted, which was a lie, as he had already "voted" (and, in fact, created the article). Second, AfD is not a vote- the person who closes the debate will consider (and, if necessary, give weight to) all comments. Third, the above user was very obviously referring to the fact that "minute" is misspelled "minuet" multiple times in the article; perhaps its original creator, who claims to not have voted, should copyedit it. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 03:42, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please dont insinuate who I am <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attack removed</a>. I signed my merge about seven seconds (a rough estimation) after i made the merge comment. I have no idea who any of these single accounts are, theres one from a seperate ip adress, so that couldnt possibly be a sock puppet. I never claimed that i "voted" before, though i didnt, and lastly, would appreciate if you would stop picking out any spelling errors, as that isnt a proper reason to delete an article. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalterWalrus3_7bee.html" title="User:WalterWalrus3">WalterWalrus3</a> 04:03, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not saying that you're a sockpuppet; I certainly don't believe that Gonzo883 is the alias of another user trying to stack votes. However, the {{<a href="../../../s/p/a/Template%7ESpa_94ad.html" title="Template:Spa">spa</a>}} tag applies, and only claims exactly what it says. The tag notes that you have few contributions to any articles besides this one, which is true. Your comments are not necessarily less valid than anyone else's, but it should be known that you have contributed to this article and few others. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 03:59, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My thought was that the rationale for voting merge in a deletion debate was to make sure that a worthwhile topic does not drop of the map with the removal of the article (i.e., someone would merge the content before it was deleted). Here, I kind of think that the article should be deleted first, while the debate on inclusion is taken to the page on the school. Perhaps that's not a good way to do things, though -- I'm not very experienced here. --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 04:11, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I reverted your talk page after you deleted two warnings you received about vandalism. As anyone can see who looks at your talk page, those were not the last warnings you received either. I tend to feel that the deletion of said warnings gives newer visitors to your talk page the impression that you have not received said warnings in the past, and is intended to be deceptive. But, as I say, that is only my opinion. ---<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoldanarchist_24ab.html" title="User:Theoldanarchist">Charles</a> 04:36, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete.</b> One argument that's useful in AfD discussions is the "I could make five hundred articles like this one easily." Maybe it's more like five million.

<li>No, she is not a unique teacher. Gifted, talented, inspired - almost certainly, but not unique. And the entry is not well-written unfortunately.
