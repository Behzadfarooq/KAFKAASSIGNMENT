<p>Can't be bothered to read the whole thing, but it looks like original research to me. Been listed on cleanup for ages. Some of this could probably be merged somewhere, but I have a feeling if the votes go that way no one will actually do it. Less than 100 google hits for "South African Art Music", but some of those are hits on "...South African art, music, etc...". -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 05:48, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>OK, Iasson, so by your interpretation of the rules which don't exist, one would need 30 or 31 votes for any valid result. Well, about the only article on VfD that's going to reach that quorum is your List of Active Vfd Voters. Without that list we need 10% of nothing, which I think is nothing. So we're back where we started. Listen, VfD is already overburdened with things that should be speedied but are left here for 5 days because people are afraid to go ahead and get rid of them quickly. Having 30 votes on every piece of crap that's listed here is a completely moronic idea, and completely arbitrary. If you want your stupid idea to be policy, there's a procedure you can go through, but I advise you not to waste your time because it stands little chance of passing. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 16:33, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>:What you dont understand is that I may propose 10% minimum participation <b>for this poll</b> (as long as my proposed minimum participation policy may differs for another Vfd poll) but you and another one can propose 1% minimum participation. For this hypothetical case if we use 2/3 majority (strong majority) the minimum participation for this poll will be defined to 1%, or if we use the average method the minimum participation will be defined to 4%(=(1+1+10)/3). <b>Is it clear now? I am not imposing my 10% minimum participation POV, like you and the rest admins are doing for your 1% minimum participation POV or for your 0%(equals to no_percentage) minumum participation POV</b>. So stop accusing me, and let me speak and vote freely. <a href="../../../i/a/s/User%7EIasson_c21f.html" title="User:Iasson">Iasson</a> 11:54, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC) <i>(comment moved above Andrewa's for clarity by <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 13:50, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC))</i>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b>. The point is that there is a policy currently in force that applies to <i><b>all</b></i> articles proposed for deletion - i.e. that a minimum of one vote is cast and the result of the poll is valid as long as the article remains substantially similar to the form in which it was voted on. Whether you agree with this or not, you (nor anyone else for that matter) cannot suggest, impose, recommend, demand, and/or implement etc, a different policy for an individual vote. IM(H)O your proposal would be akin to a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_elections_bb15.html" title="United Kingdom general elections">general election</a> in which the vote in one <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constituency.html" title="Constituency">constituency</a> required a minimum of 10% participation of those voters who have voted in a local election in the past year for validity and the winner being elected for 5 years, while the adjacent consituency required a minimum participation of 40% of the eligable voting population and the winner being elected for 4 years; with each stipulation being <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unilateral.html" title="Unilateral">unilaterally</a> declared by the first person to cast their vote. Such a system is (IMO) unworkable. If you want to propose that the existing policy is changed, then do so in the apropriate place (see links in my earlier comment) not here. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 13:50, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b>. Thank you for your answers. So the vfd policy regarding the minimum participation percentage applies to all vfd polls and it is 0%+1 vote. Where is this decided? Where is this written? Can you point to a poll that has been used in order to take such decision? I have also questions about the decision method that is used in order to extract the decision from <b>all vfd polls</b>. I asked some admins about that, and I received different answers. One said it is unamimity minus one, another said simple majority, another said consensus(?), and another said the only thing that matters is administrator's judgement when he/she performs the deletion. Is there any common decided decision method that applies to all vfd polls? Where is this written? Where is this voted? <a href="../../../i/a/s/User%7EIasson_c21f.html" title="User:Iasson">Iasson</a> 15:01, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b>. As I understand it (I've not been here a month yet myself) the votes for deletion has always opperated in this manner. Prior to your attempt to set up a list of active voters, there was no such list of people who had voted in polls. As such a percentage of voters was neither known nor knowable (x as a percentage of y is unsolvable when the value of y is not known), meaning that a validity based on a percentage of (active) voters impossible. The only other option for validity then is an absolute number of votes. The figure chosen is 1 vote (not 0%+1 vote, just 1 vote).</li>

<dd>Whether or not an article is actually deleted or not is the decision of the administrator. This decision is based on the votes and comments on the votes for deletion page. Where a consensus (which I personally define as "all or the vast majority of voters agree") has been reached then the administrator will go with that consensus to delete or keep (or merge, etc) - e.g. consensus (by my definition) has been reached in <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Boris_Johnson_839a.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Boris Johnson">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Boris Johnson</a>, <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_List_of_Active_Vfd_Voters_dcb1.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of Active Vfd Voters">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of Active Vfd Voters</a> and <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Ariel_Ortega_5447.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Ariel Ortega">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Ariel Ortega</a>. "Unanimity minus 1" is an alternative definition of consensus.</dd>
<dd>If consensus hasn't been reached, and no clear majority exists then personal judgment by the administrator will probably be used. This can also happen in other situations, e.g. if the article was improved part way through voting, the administrator might chose to disregard votes cast before the improvement; I exepct that the decision to keep or delete in the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Olb_5441.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Olb">Olb</a> case will come down to personal judgment. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 16:13, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>This personal judgement method admins are using in order to decide what to delete is very funny&#160;! As Dr_Zen said it: "<i>They call for a vote and they finnaly ignore the outcome!
