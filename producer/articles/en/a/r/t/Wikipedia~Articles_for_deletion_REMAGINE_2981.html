<li>First off this AfD does not care if it reads like and AD or not. Secondly user Stargate007 is a possibly sockpuppet of user:Remagine. Note how they misspell "AD" as "ADD": From REMAGINE's Talk Page: "Note This article was updated to avoid conflict with it looking to much like an add. It should now correspond with wikipedias rules and regulations. Remagine 00:13, 8 January 2006 (UTC)" and the above comment of Stargate007: "It no longer looks like an add.".<a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOnthost_efee.html" title="User:Onthost">Onthost</a> 02:30, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>I am a developer at Remagine, certaintly not a sock puppet of user Remagine, although he is my good friend Ian. We would like to list our company history and clients here. I believe there is some informational value and we will make sure it conforms to wikipedia guidlines for corporate listings. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew.d.stone_5c1e.html" title="User:Matthew.d.stone">Matthew.d.stone</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Matthew.d.stone_b2b6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Matthew.d.stone">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>I would like to also note that Stargate007, matthew.d.stone and Remagine are either one of the same person or work together for this Remagine comapny and therefore contain a large bias in the comments. <a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOnthost_efee.html" title="User:Onthost">Onthost</a> 02:48, 8 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thank you, that was very helpful. I see your concerns, but I believe that Remagine meets the requirements of WP:CORP specifically because articles have been written about Remagine authored by entities other then Remagine itself. For example, the westner new england college wrote an article about the enterpreneurialship of the founders, and can be viewed here: <a href="http://www.wnec.edu/communicator/snapshots/2004_grinspoon/B7EB2838.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wnec.edu/communicator/snapshots/2004_grinspoon/B7EB2838.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. I can also assure you that I am a completely different person then user Remagine, as you can tell by my other wikipedia entries. I'm not sure who Stargate007 is.

<li>One University Newspaper article does not fullfill the nobility requirements, sorry! You need to show more proof, as in actual articles not just naming news papers and magazines. <a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOnthost_efee.html" title="User:Onthost">Onthost</a> 02:56, 8 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There was also an article in the Springfield Republican which is not available online, unfortunately. I believe the above is a subjective call on Onthost's part. Can anyone explain exactly how WP:CORP is not satisfied by multiple articles written about Remagine?
<ul>
<li>This was not taking from a university paper. It came from the Springfield Republican, the hard copy resides at that link. As I stated in the discussion page, the site has under gone a face lift as of Friday, it will take the next 3 days to complete at the same time I figured to make a wiki entry. If you want figures, I will post all of the data. Please read the discussion page, this has been going on all day.Remagine 03:06, 8 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>First off you have shown no proof of these articles existing, and the only article you posted was from a university and was 3 pictures. You need to show that your company"has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself." and as of yet you've not shown this. <a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOnthost_efee.html" title="User:Onthost">Onthost</a> 03:09, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yeah, getting a university award for existing makes this company <i>less</i> notable in my mind.

<ul>
<li>To be fair, it's not completely irrelevant; I looked the trademark up and it consists of the word "REMAGINE". So there's at least one verifiable detail in the article: its title. Not enough, but still. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 03:35, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well yes that is true that any one can have a trademark, anyone can have alot of things. It's a live trademark. Can I ask you something, why are you so angry onthost?

<li><b>Delete</b> Nothing about this article indicates anything notable or tangible. They can't even spell Massachusetts correctly. If they need Wikipedia so desperately to promote their company, that alone might be proof of the lack of a legitimate entity. Their "web presence," if you haven't checked it out, consists of all non-functioning links, a stock photo of the Springfield, Massachusetts City Hall, and contact information that consists of two phone numbers and a PO Box. Googling the companies in the client lists seems to indicate that most of these are Web sites they have designed for themselve or their friends.

<li>I would like you to stop making edits to Wikipedia until you have nominated for deletion every article about a company or organization with a misspelled word, since that is obviously one of your criteria for notability. "Their web presence"...I don't know where to begin. Let's start with reading the previous discussion about it. Then show me where in <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> it says that a web site is required for notability. Do not tell me that I am being incivil as I have called into question only your statements, not you.

<li><b>Comment</b>. It looks like User:Remagine has created Neohorizon which I've since listed for deleted and redirected here, since this is simply the prior company (an IRC chat network).

<li><b>Delete</b> non-notable company. A check of their website (www.remagine.net) reveals a shell with no content. To paraphrase the website intro: "Lao-Tzu, a wise man, once said... 'A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step.'"

<li><b>Comment</b> The person behind the user name Remagine is a college student. As a fellow college student I can understand how he might not have a ton of time to juggle his business, his studies, his website, and the fact that the entire Wikipedia community has been <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">biting him</a> from the first minute he came here. The nomination by <a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOnthost_efee.html" title="User:Onthost">Onthost</a> is, IMO, highly incivil. The fact that the nominator felt it necessary to back up the nomination with personal attacks on the article's creator for a typo makes me think that it was in bad faith, however much I agree that the article doesn't currently meet the requirements. The continued attacks regarding the state of their website disgust me. It has been explained in multiple places on site and to various concerned editors through email. What part of "working on it" don't you understand. It has no bearing on their notability. The fact that you all continue to harangue it shows me that you feel that the other arguments aren't strong enough. Argue the nomination on its own merits, not on totally unrelated facts. I currently agree with the words of the nomination if not the spirit. This article doesn't currently meet the requirements. However, I'm abstaining currently to give the article's creator time to add that which is missing. The conduct of some parties led the article's creator to email me, saying, "Everyone is ganging up on me." Remagine felt attacked and I believe that he was. I would like to remind everyone to be <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">CIVIL</a>. To paraphrase a Wikipedia policy: "Wikipede, a wise Wikipedia mascot, once said...'<a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICK_0b34.html" title="WP:DICK">WP:DICK</a>'<a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWAvegetarian_a804.html" title="User:WAvegetarian">WAvegetarian</a> <a href="../../../w/a/v/User_talk%7EWAvegetarian_1514.html" title="User talk:WAvegetarian"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> <small><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_WAvegetarian_f393.html" title="Special:Emailuser/WAvegetarian">(email)</a></small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WAvegetarian_0ea5.html" title="Special:Contributions/WAvegetarian"><sup>(contribs)</sup></a> 07:06, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Comment: Exactly what personal attacks did I leave for him? All Ive ever said is his article is still an advertisement and quoted the sections I felt were advertisement material, said it was still not NPOV since a company insider is the one writing the article, and said that the company does not meet the nobility requirements stated in WP:CORP. <a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOnthost_efee.html" title="User:Onthost">Onthost</a> 18:27, 8 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sorry, I misread your comment regarding add. I found the capitalization choices in your nomination to be questionable. I will also note that not being NPOV is not a criterion for deletion. Nor do I feel that it is impossible for someone to write an article which is NPOV on a subject they are deeply familiar with. You also seem to be on a personal crusade against this article given your high level of involvement. Not that I find anything wrong with sticking to your beliefs and continued watching of articles you have nominated for AFD, but fully 25% of your edits, at the time of my writing, are about the article in question, starting with it's nomination, or to related articles. You also placed a sock tag on <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStargate007_1086.html" title="User:Stargate007">User:Stargate007</a>. I removed this as you provided no evidence. Please replace it using the EVIDENCE link (emphasis <b>not</b> mine) to link to your evidence. You have just over 100 edits, so I expect that this was an honest mistake. I will take OwenX's advice, as you have done, and chill out.

<li><b>Comment</b> My comments about the content and quality of the company's web site are important, I think, because the web site is presented as evidence for the significance of the company. If there is no substance on the site, it's difficult to judge whether the company is notable. Regarding the poor quality of the article, I think that's also relevant, because if it is indeed a notable company based in Massachusetts, I would expect they would be able to spell the name of the state corrrectly. Particularly since they claim to be in the communications field. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 15:53, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

The article includes multiple citations from mulitple newspapers. "Non-trivial published work" refers to the article, not the newspaper, as noted by the sentence quoted above. That means that this company meets the minimum criterion established in WP:CORP. Any delete nominations that do not address this, or simply reference the nom, must be called into question as they do not take into account that information meeting the criteria of WP:CORP has been added. There are only two ways around this: claim that WP:CORP is merelly proposed and therefore not worthy of citation (in which case the nomination is invalid), or that WP:CORP should be changed to keep what are non-notable companies (I feel that this is one) from getting in.

<li>Please, to all, give me a break with the whole spelling of Massachusetts. Are you telling me you never overlooked typos when typing an article really quickly? I also had to spend all my time defending myself in the discussion which caused me overlook items in the article. As you can see, Mass is in more than one location on the page. As for the website, I explained its situation numerous times in other posts, can you drop it?! If you want to see the web site prior to Friday’s new upgrade use a cache system or web archive site.

<li><b>Comment</b> That misspelling was just one indication of the lack of viability of the article. Yes, everyone makes typos, of course (the article was, and still is, full of them). The point was that the combination of a poorly-written article, lack of evidence of anything particularly notable and nothing to meet the demands of WP:CORP were clear indications for my Delete vote. The point of this discussion is to determine whether to keep or delete the Remagine article and it's the article that's in question. I did not intend to make it personal. I was commenting solely on my viewing of the article, its substance and the claims it makes and trying to compare those to WP policy. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 20:09, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

He was excited about how Wikipedia worked. He had wanted to understand more about the project but got pulled into this ugly business about his adverticle. (Huh, I kinda like that neologism.)

<dd>This is a constant problem. A lot of people start by creating articles on themselves or their companies; AfDing them is the correct thing to do in terms of policy, but still looks like biting the newbies. This is sad. I have recently started to userfy such things and leave a nice note ont he user page, but even this is taken amiss by some. You can't win. In the end, my delete vote stands, and I support the statements of others even if they could have been more tactfully put. Lesson to learn: explain <b>in detail</b> on the Userpage of a new user who creates an article on themselevs, their firm, their club, whatever, why this is a bad idea. All of which takes time.

I just get really pissed off when people leave the project over disputes and hostility, be it Essjay or a newbie. <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWAvegetarian_a804.html" title="User:WAvegetarian">WAvegetarian</a> <a href="../../../w/a/v/User_talk%7EWAvegetarian_1514.html" title="User talk:WAvegetarian"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> <small><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_WAvegetarian_f393.html" title="Special:Emailuser/WAvegetarian">(email)</a></small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WAvegetarian_0ea5.html" title="Special:Contributions/WAvegetarian"><sup>(contribs)</sup></a> 22:02, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Kenpo0110 may have put a CVU template on his user page, but his <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kenpo0110_ba2b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kenpo0110">user contributions</a> page shows no evidence of him ever reverting a single instance of vandalism. Indeed, it shows no evidence of him ever showing any concern about any article whatsoever except for REMAGINE. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 22:07, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I wasen't going to mention it either, plus Kenpo and Remagine were the same person. <a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOnthost_efee.html" title="User:Onthost">Mike</a> 22:49, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please note "One more newbie..." Also note that said person was busy trying to defend himself and this article and didn't really have a bunch of time to work on other things. The inlcusion of that on his userpage shows an interest in the project. I feel that the particulars of this case are not really the issue here anyway. I think that we should stop discussing this article or its contributors as it is going to be deleted and the user has left. What's more important is looking more broadly at what first impressions we give to new users. There is a very relevant story on the talk page of <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>. <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWAvegetarian_a804.html" title="User:WAvegetarian">WAvegetarian</a> <a href="../../../w/a/v/User_talk%7EWAvegetarian_1514.html" title="User talk:WAvegetarian"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> <small><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_WAvegetarian_f393.html" title="Special:Emailuser/WAvegetarian">(email)</a></small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WAvegetarian_0ea5.html" title="Special:Contributions/WAvegetarian"><sup>(contribs)</sup></a> 23:14, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
