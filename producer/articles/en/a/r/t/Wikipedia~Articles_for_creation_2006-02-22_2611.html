<p>Fresh Azimiz by Bow Wow feat. J-Kwon and Jermaine Dupri is a hot new joint revealing Bow Wow's maturity over the beats. Poppin' bottles, stayin' on a grind, and blowin' paper is all apart of being 18, grown and sexy. This is a new thing for Bow to throw out to his fans. It's something completely new. A side to him that he wants everyone to know. He's not a little pup anymore. Surprisingly, this pup has grown into a big bad dog.</p>
<p>The video includes appearances and affliations by Mike Jones, the H-Town rapper, himself. Along with a remix to Fresh Azimiz feat. Mike Jones. The video also includes verses from J-Kwon and Jermaine Dupri, producer and rapper under So So Def Recordings, and a few quick shots of actor and aspiring rapper, Khleo Thomas. While poppin' in the club with his crew, sportin' a platinum grill, and getting jocked by over 30 chicks, it gets more serious. Now knowing that his fans have grown in and with him, Bow Wow strives to get this single to the top. The song revolves around his fame and fortune. His reputation and how he enjoys it and lives it to the fullest. His own personal celebration for what he's got and how he wants to let the whole world know what Bow Wow's about. Something that most young people, teenagers in particular, can ultimately relate to. With his voice deeper and his lyrics more mature, he still wants to keep it clean and understands that there are younger fans out there that look up to him. Although some parentals disapprove of the lyrics, most teenagers believe that "Bow Wow is keeping it real and showing the world that it's not all about being love sprung...you've gotta have some pimp in you somewhere!" and that's exactly what Bow Wow is expressing in Fresh Azimiz. His usage in the word <i>nigga</i> refers to his rivals and not in any innapropriate terms to offend any fans in any way. And as far as the half dressed exotic dancing women go, it's all for the video and have no regards towards the song. Most rappers at 18 and over have commonly shown us that it's just the media and sexually explicit music videos are just to intrigue the audience. Some sexually atmospheric videos are irrelevant to some songs but the media requires most of it to sell records. Fresh Azimiz was never intended to send out a message about "bouncing booties" and drugs and/or alcolics. Bow Wow is just being cocky! Proving to the whole world that can't nobody be fresh as he is. He's young, grown, and hotter than ever!</p>
<p>Fresh Azimiz comes right out his most recent album, Wanted (2006). Ya'll make sure to go out and cop that if ya'll haven't already!</p>

Written between July and August 1943 it an invaluable insight into the concluding remarks about political philosophy. It gives new arguments and insights into the author's belief that the individual can only exist as part of a state. He even the denies the actual existence of the individual. Since it is a war time production it also concerns itself with the nature of death and the life of the Spirit.</p>

<p>Leonardo Manecio aka Nardong Putik was a Filipino gangster turned folk hero. An amulet-wielding hoodlum from Cavite province, Putik credited his ability to survive and escape numerous ambushes and gunfights to his anting-anting (Amulet). Nardong Putik's ability to elude the law and his enemies made him a legend and a hero to many people.</p>
<p>Putik's life was made famous in the Philippines in a movie released in 1972. This movie chronicled his anti-hero ways and was a very popular film in Filipino pop culture. Putik was played by Ramon Revilla, now a Senator in the Philippines.</p>

<p><b>Lexus Locklear</b> (born Brandi Janeen Sommerville on March 6, 1976 in Ventura, CA) is best known as the blonde bombshell who helped re-energize the "Debbie Does Dallas" franchise for vivid Video in the late 1990's.</p>
<p>Raised in Pennsylvania, Lexus turned to dancing at strip clubs around the state by her eighteenth birthday. Not long after that, she set her sights on adult-film stardom and headed for southern California in 1994. She appeared in a number of low-budget adult films between 1994 and 1995, working her way up through the pro-am ranks, with very little acclaim or notoriety for her efforts.</p>
<p>Consequently, Lexus basically left the business in late 1995 to regroup and decide what she was going to do with her career. Throughout this time period she appeared in only a handful of films performing only in lesbian scenes. Also notable was her title of "Penthouse Pet of the Month" in May of 1996.</p>
<p>In 1997 though, Lexus returned to adult full force due to her newly enhanced breasts and exclusive Vivid contract. From that point on, Lexus quickly gained a following due to her supermodel good looks and gorgeous bustline.</p>
<p>Throughout the next two years she appeared in adult films such as <i>Babylon</i>, <i>Big Island Blues</i> and <i>Debbie Does Dallas '99</i> before retiring yet again in late 2000 to pursue more mainstream work--though she did work for the Playboy channel for a time and has appeared in five adult films since retiring in 2000-2001, the last of which was <i>Take A Jill Pill</i> in 2004.</p>

<p>Gormish is the formal name used to describe an individual of Amish and gorilla genetic hybrid ancestry. Previously considered mythical, of ancient African cultural folklore, it is now known to be scientifically and physically possible to hybridize the two species. Human alien hybrids are, of course, well established in the scientific literature. Although completely fictionalized, the movie King Kong trivialized this concept. Clearly, Fay Ray was fully capable and willing to produce viable offspring. Gormish individuals lead productive and relatively normal lives. They are fully bilingual and almost exclusively frutarian and vegetarian in diet.</p>

In November of the same year he sold his interest in the Chronicle and Register and removed to Hudson, where he established the [St. Croix Banner the first paper printed and issued in the St. Croix valley. Martha Hughes was associated with him in its management. James died at Hudson in 1873, leaving a widow and eleven children, seven sons and four daughters.

<p>Derek Kollmann is a mislead Ontario youth, who still believes in the credibility of all Wikipedia Articles. Cited as a harsh critic of popular rock and roll band The Beatles, Kollmann is known for his loyality to British rock band Led Zeppelin. "Led Zeppelin is a lot different than the Yardbirds", said by Kollmann in early 2006. Many reputable sources deny any relevance to what he says. "Eric Clapton is the father of jimmy Page, everything Page does, he owes some hommage to Clapton and The Beatles", says Andrew Dundee, Ontario music critic.</p>

<p>Five Year Plan is a fanzine for supporters of Crystal Palace. Set up in 2003 it is the newest fanzine available for Palace fans, set up in the wake of One More Point.</p>
<p>FYP is based on the format of original football fanzines from the 1980s and has a copy-and-stick look to it despite being produced using desktop publishing software. Set up, and run, by James Daly, Five Year Plan offers a less serious view of goings on at Selhurst Park and is sold bi-monthly at home games for ¬£1.</p>
<p>The fanzine constantly looks for contributions from Palace fans for aticles and ideas. After Crystal Palace sold a number of home shirts at the beginning of the 2004/5 season with the club's name spelt 'CHRYSTAL PALACE', Five Year Plan proclaimed itself to be the fanzine that puts the 'H' in Chrystal Palace.</p>

<p>Constantine's Basilica (from the Greek "Basilus" meaning King) was an adaptation of a Roman civic meeting hall built in Rome, begun by his predecessor Maxentius and completed by Constantine after his victory over Maxentius, reuniting the divided Roman Empire. It is now in ruins, but enough of it remains to indicate that it consisted of a central nave and two side aisles with a small apse at one end, and doors at the other end. A large marble portrait bust of Constantine may have been placed in the hall. Construction seems to have been in the form of large arched ceilings of poured concrete probably faced with stone or marble. This or other basilicas such as Trajan's may have served as models for the first Roman Christian churches such as Old St. Peter's, as they are essentially the same plan as the majority of western Christian churches, a long nave flanked by two side aisles.</p>

<p>Cleethorpes Pier was opened on August Bank Holiday 1873, to the designs of J &amp; A Dowson, with Head Wrightson of Stockton on Tees as Engineers. A pavilion was added in 1883, which was destroyed by fire in 1903. A replacement pavilion was opened in 1905 nearer to the shore, whilst a smaler building was added at the pier head.</p>
<p>In 1936 Cleethorpes Council bought the pier off its previous owners, the railway company(now the LNER) that had been involved with the structure's construction. The pier was sectioned during the Second World War as a defence measure. Money was later offered as compensation, but the council claimed there was a ¬£26,000 shortfall. Thus demolition of ther isolated pier neck took place in 1949, salvaged material helping to build both Wonderland, another Cleethorpes' attraction, and a stand at Leicester City's Filbert Street ground.</p>
<p>Modernisation of the pavilion occured in 1968, but following an unsuccesful 1980 Summer Show, the pier was sold to a private owner the following year. After threats to its future, local club owner Mark Meyer bought the pier in 1985, converting it into a nightclub, and re-naming it Pier 39.</p>
<p>Since then further developments have included the addition of shelters, and widening of the entire structure.</p>

<p>Situated on the Old National Road Rethimnon - Iraklio. Belongs to the manucipality of Kouloukona, perfecture of Rethimno in Crete (Greece).</p>
<p>Built after the re-conquest of Crete by Nikiforos Fokas from the Saracens in 961AD. The island was under the Saracens' rule around 134 years. During then, one of the main policies of the Byzantines was to re-Hellanize the island. Hence, many noble families were given huge properity lands for incentive that eventually became feudal villages named after their family names.</p>
<p>Mourtzana was a village that was established by the Mourtzanos family. Mourtzanos is a Saracen nick name for Coral (Mourjan) which means "Dark Red."</p>
<p>The village is considered one of the most richest in architecture, in Milopotamos, dated from Venetian rule. It was conqured by the Ottomen Turks who gave prevlidges to the Mourtzanos family by offering them the turkish noble title "Agha."</p>

<p>Nikola Kunov, Ivan Abuzov, Nako Paunov, Gergo Boychev - these are just one small part of the people, who we must thank for the existence of our favorite club. The year is 1921 and the place is the playground at the "Old market" - at this place the idea of making a football team in the city was born.</p>
<p>Between 1921 and 1956 in Vratza a lot of sport clubs have been founded and on April 3rd, 1957 in the "Razvitie" library they were all united under the name "Sport club Botev". At the same time in the country are formed two "B" football groups and the team from Vratza has joined the North one. In the first couple of season the team has played at a medium level, but in the spring of 1964 FC Botev has won promotion to "A" group. The most important game of that season has been in Mikhailovgrad (Montana), where Botev had to win in order to get promotion. The dream has become truth after a 5:2 victory.</p>
<p>Botev has managed to stay in the top division for 26 years - something hardly achieved by other small town teams. In the period between 1964 and 1990, the team has played 788 games and won 269 of them with goal difference 997-1173.</p>
<p>The first game Botev has played in the group was on "Hristo Botev" stadium against Levski Sofia and more than 30000 fans have seen it. The final result is 1:1 and the goal for Botev s scored by Dimitar Stoyanov-Matzata in the 37th minute. The last game is again in Vratza against CSKA Sofia and Boyko Kraev, who is a coach of the youth team since 2001, scores the last goal in the group.</p>
<p>The biggest achievement of the team is in 1971, when it has finished 3rd and won the bronze medals. During this season the greatest Botev player ever - Georgi Kamenov has scored 20 goals and the team finished with 17 wins.</p>

<p>FRIACO stands for Flat Rate Internet Access Call Origination. It refers to the unmetered access to dial-up Internet services. Telephone numbers used for such dial-up services are free-phone (or toll-free) numbers, so that the user of the service is not paying for the duration of the call in a metered way. Instead, an ISP ("Internet Service Provider") would make other arrangements to cover costs through fixed subscriptions and/or advertising.</p>

<p>N55 is an international project aimed at political and social reform, primarily through active demonstrations of alternative ways of living. The groupd was started in 1994 at N√∏rre Farimagsgade 55, Copenhagen, from which the name is derived. The group grew to a number of people in 1996, but eventually was continued through the efforts of the husband-and-wife team of Ion S√∏rvin and Ingvil Hareide Aarbakke. On November the 23rd, Ingvil Hareide Aarbakke passed away, and Ion S√∏rvin continues to maintain the group.</p>
<p>Their site contains a number of "manuals", documents concerning individual creations. Many of these creations are designed to use as dwellings, furniture, or transportation (and sometimes a combination of all three). The structures are notable for their liberal use of plastic panels and stainless steel girders, and their somewhat minimalist approach to life. Other creations are notable political, including the PROTEST, a reusable rocket designed to carry papers or another payload (the website suggests seeds for superweeds) for purposes of protest or, in the case of the seeds, agricultural sabotage.</p>
<p>Individuals are given the opportunity, and even encouraged, to participate. One manual outlines LAND, a plan for publicly-usable spaces around the world. ROOM, STORE, and FACTORY are similar projects, presumably with the aim of providing people with access to nearly any sort of space or equipment they may need free of charge. In this respect, the group is notable in making all of its work open-source: though their manuals can be bought, they can also be downloaded for free, and people are encouraged to print and distribute copies.</p>

<p>Officially, CADS was created in 2001, but the idea has existed in the minds of its core group of staff and fellows since the late 1990s. Starting out in the Northern Virginia area just outside of DC, the Center moved into the Foggy Bottom area of Washington DC in 2003 and enjoyed an affiliation with the George Washington University. Since that time, the Center is now independent and located near Union Station and the U.S. Capitol.</p>

<p>David Crosthwait was born in Nashville, Tennessee and grew up in Kansas City, Missouri. He got a Bachelor of Science degree in 1913 and a Master of Engineering degree in 1920 from Purdue University and honorary doctoral degree in 1975. Crosthwait moved to Marshall Town, Iowa in 1913 to work for the Durham Company creating heating installations. From 1925 to 1930, Crosthwait was the director of the research department, investigating heating and ventilation methods. Crosthwait has 39 U.S. patents for heating systems, vacuum pumps, refrigeration methods and processes and temperature regulating devices, and 80 international patents for the same. He is very well known for making the heating system for New York's Radio City Music Hall. Crosthwait was an expert on heat transfer, air ventilation and central air conditioning. He wrote a book on heating and cooling with water and guides, standards, and codes that dealt with heating, ventilation, refrigeration, and air conditioning systems. During the 1920s and 30s, he invented an improved boiler, a new thermostat control and a new differential vacuum pump, all more effective for the heating systems in larger buildings. He was the Technical Advisor of Dunham-Bush, Inc. For his outstanding contributions to engineering technology, David Crosthwait was awarded an honorary doctoral degree in 1975 from Purdue University, the same school that had awarded him a B.S. in mechanical engineering 62 years earlier. In the years between, he had received 34 U.S. patents and 80 foreign patents relating to the design, installation, testing, and servicing of power plants and heating and ventilating systems. An authority on heat transfer, ventilation, and air conditioning, Crosthwait invented several new systems. He developed the control systems and the variable vacuum system of heating for major buildings including Rockefeller Center in New York City. His writings included a manual on heating and cooling with water and guides, standards and codes dealing with heating ventilation, refrigeration, and air conditioning. After retiring from industry in 1969, Crosthwait continued to share his knowledge by teaching a course on steam heating theory and controls at Purdue. 69.211.8.69 19:44, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The idea of toposophy, that is profoundly different levels of consciousness, perception and understanding of <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sophont.html" title="Sophont">Sophonts</a>, was coined in the science fiction literature, first by <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vernor_Vinge_e3b7.html" title="Vernor Vinge">Vernor Vinge</a> and then later expanded by the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Orions_Arm_5832.html" title="Orions Arm">Orions Arm</a> fictional universe.</p>
<p>The name reflects the idea in being derived from the words <a href="../../../t/o/p/Topos.html" title="Topos">Topos</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sophont.html" title="Sophont">Sophonts</a>.</p>
<p>Beings of different mental capabilities exist in this concept on different toposophic levels, e.g. unaltered human beings on very low levels and planetary <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artificial_Intelligence_4365.html" title="Artificial Intelligence">Artificial Intelligences</a> on very high levels. Through technological means a being can "ascend" from a lower level towards a higher level, however changing nearly all aspects of itself during this process.</p>
<p>In Orion's Arm, the toposophic levels are discrete states and the ascension from one to another involves a major paradigm shift of the self. In this concept great apes and humans are even nearly on the same toposophic level. To illustrate an ascension: ascending one toposophic level would be like a cat suddenly gaining mental capabilities similar to a human being, like complex reasoning and self consciousness.</p>

<p>Smartstores is the generic term for next generation retail technologies that use RFID and other smart technologies.</p>
<p>Retailers are fast adopting technologies that enhance the productivity of store space and inventory. Some solutions, include kiosks and self-checkout terminals, while RFID will keep track of all incoming and outgoing products. Smartstores technology will offer consumers better information about products and more control over the shopping process.</p>
<p>Radio frequency identification (RFID) tags, which wirelessly transmit information stored on each tag's embedded computer chip are central to smartstores technology. These tags create a central nervous system of a virtual web of goods and products. RFID will help consumers avoid the dreaded long checkout lines, or the search for a staffed cash register, with self-service checkouts.</p>
<p>With RFID, smart shelves, smart tags, smart labels, smart carts, and smart cards, retail in the future will be a seamless network of transactions that work together to provide convenient, fast, and cheaper ways for retailers to manage their stores, and for more efficient ways for shoppers to purchase goods.</p>

<p>Sir Elwoodin hiljaiset v√§rit is a <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finnish.html" title="Finnish">Finnish</a> <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock.html" title="Rock">rock</a> band, which plays moody and a bit melancholy rock-jazz. Elwood has been a distinctive part of <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finnish.html" title="Finnish">Finnish</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/Music.html" title="Music">music</a> for more than ten years. From small smoky bars of the early years the band has found its way to the biggest concert halls of <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finland.html" title="Finland">Finland</a>. In the beginning it was a band of small circles of students who liked the beer-jazz, as the band calls its music. During the years Elwood became more and more popular, and nowadays the band is one of the most liked bands in the country.</p>
<p>Elwood¬¥s lyrics are very warm and personal. They tell about every-man-life; love, travelling, and sorrow. The music has built around the lyrics. The band says they paint and colour the stories with music.</p>
<p>Elwood has played in the biggest rock-festivals and concert halls, but still the most appropriate places for the gigs are smoky rock clubs. Even the band has done well, the success has never been the aim. The music has been done with heart and for people, not with money and for business.</p>

<p>J. Lehti and J. Saaresaho met in 1988 while they were both working at the Myyrm√§ki Youth Center. After P. Loikala joined in with his bass, the group began to give life to songs. In December '88 the trio put together the demo Olinhan siell√§ min√§kin 1. Sir Elwoodin hiljaiset v√§rit played a few gigs as a trio in the first part of 1989, until A. Leskinen and his drums joined into the effort. In the fall of `89 they recorded the single Tango/Karhubaari in the closet of the youth center. R. J√§rvinen played the violin on the single, but became the band¬¥s bass player in the beginning of 1990. Later on Gabi Hakanen and Kauko R√∂yhk√§ heard them play and wanted the group to record a live-album for the new Herodes-record label.</p>
<p>The album Varjoissa vapaan maailman was recorded at the Vernissa club in Vantaa in the beginning of 1991 with the help of M. Joenpolvi and Sasu Moilanen.</p>
<p>H. Saarinen's saxophone playing and Jogi Kosonen's trumpet were recorded later on. The group's first album saw the light of day in June '91. During the autumn of the same year H. Saarinen and his diverse repertoire of instruments officially became part of the group.</p>
<p>The next album Y√∂ tekee meist√§ varkaat began forming in the winter and was published in the fall of 1992. The single Neiti Kev√§t hit the charts earlier on in the year. The album did not become a particularly big success but the band was quickly gaining popularity.</p>
<p>The winter of '92-'93 took Sir Elwoodin hiljaiset v√§rit into the studio for the first time. The previous records had more or less been live-versions, so it was clearly time to record the entire album in a studio. J. Virtanen played the guitar on this album, and later officially joined the band, in 1997. The third album Kymmenen tikkua laudalla, released in '93, brought change along with its release. The single Viimeisell√§ rannalla became a huge success and the group became more popular than ever before. Startled by the sudden interest people were showing toward them, the members of the band decided to take a break.</p>
<p>In April 1995 the fourth SEhv album Puoli viisi aamulla was released. The general sound was much darker than that of all previous ones, and all hints of the pop style of the third album were gone.</p>
<p>At the end of 1996 the single Vanha Valokuva was released as a teaser of what would be coming in the future. The fifth album was to be made without hurry, and the group had already started recording parts of it in the spring of '96. A year later, in the spring of 1997, Puunukke, the fifth Elwood album, was released. The single Perunamaa received quite a lot of airtime on the radio and the album climbed rather high on the charts. Some of the older fans were slightly taken aback by the hard and considerably louder style the band had adopted, but altogether Puunukke received a warm welcome. After a low-profile year, the fall of 1998 saw the release of the collection Varjoja, varkaita ja vanhoja valokuvia, along with an accompanying music book containing, along with a history of the band, the songs that made the group what they are today. In October the group began an 11-concert tour. The next single Kollikissa came out in the end of March 1999 and a TV-document of the band was shot at a concert at the Tavastia Club in April.</p>
<p>On the 13th of August 1999 Sir Elwoodin hiljaiset v√§rit gave a concert in the Finnish National Theatre in Helsinki, during which they played all the new songs of their sixth album, Pyh√§√§ Kamaa, which was released in October of the same year.</p>
<p>The beginning of the year 2000 saw Elwood on tour in northern Finland and during the summer the group travelled wider all over the country. Next November took the band for a few more gigs, and after that the group kept out from publicity for a few months.</p>
<p>In April of year 2001 a new single Kekkonen was released. In June the first album Varjoissa vapaan maailman was republished after ten years with the first music video and a couple of released-only-on-a-single -songs. Another single Torkkelinm√§ki came out in Jyly, and the band spent the summer in a studio recording a new album.</p>
<p>Elwood's seventh album came out 15th of October 2001 and is called Pohjoisesta tuulee taas. The band was on the road for almost two months in October and November of the same year. After having a break for the first months of the next year Elwood was seen on stage during the summer of 2002. September 23rd the band released a 2 cd live-collection called Ilta illan j√§lkeen. The other cd includes a whole consert set of songs, and the other one has 12 strange versions of old songs. All the songs on the collection have been recorded on gigs and conserts during the past five years.</p>
<p>In October of 2002 Elwood had a two week consert tour, and they spent November and early December touring Finland and its clubs.</p>
<p>Elwood spent the spring and the summer of 2003 making their 8th album that was recorded in June in an old villa in Finnish country side. The album named 18. tammikuuta was released on September 19th. Elwood has sort of got back to their roots, the new album having the same acoustic feeling as the band's very first LPs. Elwood had a concert tour later in the sam year.</p>
<p>Information released in the spring of 2003 told us Hansu Saarinen had chosen to pursue his professional ambitions in other projects, and is no longer a member of the band.</p>
<p>Late autumn group travelled around the country, and the tour continued after christmas break with a couple of gigs in January and February. Spring 2004 was spend out of publicity.</p>
<p>On Monday the 14th of June came information about the death of Riku J√§rvinen, group's bass player. Riku had died in an accident on previous day. Sir Elwoodin hiljaiset v√§rit cancelled the tour planned for summer 2004.</p>
<p>A memorial concert for Riku was held on 18th of November at Tavastia Club in Helsinki. Riku's old friend Puppe Luomanm√§ki was playing bass there, and after the gig the band desided to ask him to join them officially. Puppe agreed, and so the band was ready to think about continueing.</p>
<p>Elwood's latest release, a collection and DVD called Varjoja, varkaita ja vanhoja valokuvia, osa 2, was released on 16th of March 2005. The album included one new song, that still had Riku playing his bass. The lyrics were all new and made for the collection.</p>
<p>Later in the spring the band had a small tour in Finland, and the first gigs with Puppe as a official member of the band.</p>
<p>This summer of 2005 Elwood will be seen on stage in a few rock festivals and clubs. A new album is also under thinking, and some of it may be recorded next autumn.</p>

<p>Wikipedia racing is a game that is played with 2 or more people to determine who is the true wiki-guru. The players choose a random destination topic and research it for a short period. All players then go to another random article and use nothing but links in articles to find their way to the destination article that was determined at the start of the game.</p>
<p>This game was invented at the Conrad Weiser High School in Robesonia, Pennsylvania. Students there developed a system of rules to keep all matches fair and balanced during extended stays in the library or one of the various computer labs throughout the building.</p>

<p>Images of the Provincial Mexican in Suave patria</p>
<p>Like a national anthem, an inspirational literary work can serve as a testament of nationality in which the provincial can identify. The inclusion of nostalgic rhetorical elements permits the reader to find sentimental value in a literary work because it evokes a sense of nationalism. The poem Suave patria by Ram√≥n L√≥pez Velarde contains images characteristic of M√©xico and its historic figures, which strengthen the connection of the reader to the poem.</p>
<p>Throughout the work, Velarde incorporates attributes that reflect national characteristics and describe the provincial. The poem describes M√©xico in the verses:<br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Patria: tu superficie es el ma√≠z,<br /></dd>
<dd>tus minas el palacio del Rey de Oros,<br /></dd>
<dd>y tu cielo las garzas en desliz<br /></dd>
<dd>y el rel√°mpago verde de los loros.<br /></dd>
</dl>
<p>Ma√≠z, or corn, is a staple food source and a distinguishing fruit of the land because it serves as a uniting factor since it is consumed by all The ‚ÄúRey de Oros‚Äù is also characteristic of M√©xico because history was dominated by kings made wealthy with vast gold reserves. Furthermore, the references to the herons and the parrots create a sense of awe and beauty that evokes sentimentality to the sight of magnificence and is also a strong local marker. Velarde mentions the ‚Äúmestiza‚Äù in the following verses:<br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Y en el barullo de las estaciones,<br /></dd>
<dd>con tu mirada de mestiza, pones<br /></dd>
<dd>la inmensidad sobre los corazones.<br /></dd>
</dl>
<p>A mestizo is an individual that is of mixed European and American Indian ancestry. The author is communicating the cultural diversity of M√©xico. Furthermore, diversification is evident in the verses:<br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Suave Patria: en tu t√≥rrido fest√≠n<br /></dd>
<dd>luces policrom√≠as de delf√≠n,<br /></dd>
<dd>y con tu pelo rubio se desposa<br /></dd>
<dd>el alma, equilibrista chuparrosa,<br /></dd>
<dd>y a tus dos trenzas de tabaco, sabe<br /></dd>
<dd>ofrendar aquamiel toda mi briosa<br /></dd>
<dd>raza de bailadores de jarabe.<br /></dd>
</dl>
<p>‚ÄúPelo rubio,‚Äù or blonde hair, is not characteristic of Mexican ancestry, rather it is a result of cultural diversification. Again, the poet describes characteristics of the provincial when he describes hair as ‚Äútrenzas de tabaco,‚Äù or braids of tobacco, which further ties the inhabitant to the land and denotes a more bucolic characteristic. Also, the ‚Äúbailadores de jarabe,‚Äù or jarabe dancers, represent a particular dance that is characteristic of the towns of Jalisco in M√©xico. Velarde describes the appearance of a woman in the following verses:<br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Suave Patria: te amo no cual mito,<br /></dd>
<dd>sino por tu verdad de pan bendito,<br /></dd>
<dd>como a ni√±a que asoma por la reja<br /></dd>
<dd>con la blusa corrida hasta la oreja<br /></dd>
<dd>y la falda bajada hasta el huesito.<br /></dd>
</dl>
<p>According to the verses, a woman‚Äôs dress is more native in appearance in the sense that ‚Äúla blusa corrida hasta la oreja y la falda bajada hasta el huesito,‚Äù or the blouse unbuttoned to the ears and the skirt that goes to her ankles. This reference to semi-nudity creates a duality in dress by mixing historic indigenous ancestry with European influence. The ‚Äúpan bandito,‚Äù or holy bread, symbolizes Catholicism, which is the religion that predominates in M√©xico. Also, the reference to holy bread conflicts with the idea of the indigenous appearance of women much in the same manner that European society clashed with the indigenous society of M√©xico.</p>
<p>The images characteristic of M√©xico and the Mexican citizen strengthen the connection of the reader to the poem by appealing to nationalism. Nationalism is an identifying quality which inspires sentiment for an individual‚Äôs native country. From the poem Suave patria, the images of M√©xico focus on the historical personages, such Cuauht√©moc and the indigenous inhabitant, and terrestrial qualities, such as maize and the flight of green parrots. An admiration for the local environment inspires awe in the reader. The provincial is described as being culturally diverse, and possessing strong ties to the land and an indigenous appearance. These images are qualities characteristic of M√©xico that inspire the reader and permit their intended Mexican readers to identify with the country much as a national anthem.</p>

<p>You guys need to update your records.</p>
<p>There's a South African actor gaining a lot of repsectability in Hollywood and I was shocked to see him missing frim your list.</p>
<p>The guy is the best known SA actor outside of Arnold Vosloo.</p>
<p>His name is Stelio Savante and you can check out his credits on imdb.com or any search engine for that matter.</p>
<p>I recently saw him in the lead role of a war film that took best picture at the hollywood film festival, and he was electrifying, he was shooting the new Uma Thurman film in which I think he has a large role so he was not at the award ceremony. Then three weeks I happened to be in SA he was featured in the Sunday Times, the Star and the Argus when I was in Cape Town.</p>
<p>I first heard about him in that 9/11 play when I first moved to New York. he had the lead role opposite Susan Sarandon and John Turturro, so I think you guys need to at least mention him.</p>

<p>Van Rossem had developed a model that could predict the stock market and beat the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalist.html" title="Capitalist">capitalist</a> system. His sympathies for the theories of <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Marx_3bcc.html" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a> did not stop him investing for the very wealthy in the world and accumulating 800 million dollar for himself.</p>
<p>Due to belief in the Moneytron system and also his sence of show and publicity, there came very large sums towards him. He also traded duplicated stocks, according to him, 'A way to fuck the system'. He was the owner a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Formula_1.html" title="Formula 1">Formula 1</a> team in 1989, Onyx-Moneytron, which placed 10th of the 21 teams.</p>
<p>The revenue service and the court were not blind for his methods. He created the political party ROSSEM to avoid lawsuit (elected politicians are not liable in court) and he got three seats in the lower house at the elections of 1991.</p>
<p>At the coronation ceremony of king <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_II_of_Belgium_db02.html" title="Albert II of Belgium">Albert II of Belgium</a>, he shouted 'Vive la republique' (Belgium is a monarchy) as had done Julien Lahout in 1950 at the coronation of King Boudewijn.</p>
<p>In 1991 he was sentenced to 5 years in jail. There he began to write his autobiography, which became a bestseller. After that he had a relationship with <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_Belgium_6cb6.html" title="Miss Belgium">Miss Belgium</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigitta_Callens_18d8.html" title="Brigitta Callens">Brigitta Callens</a>.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-02-22_2611.html" title="Edit section: Nuerostimulator">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Nuerostimulator</span></h2>
<p><b>Nuerostimulators</b> have been working wonders with people who suffer from epilepsy, Parkinson‚Äôs disease, depression, and other diseases. The nuerostimulator is a medical device, which sends electric impulses into the brain. Depending on where the impulses are sent, the treatment is called deep brain stimulation, or vagus nerve stimulation. Both stimulations aid in the treatment or prevention of these unfortunate diseases.</p>
<p><br />
<a href="../../../e/p/i/Epilepsy.html" title="Epilepsy">Epilepsy</a> is categorized as any of the various neurological disorders characterized by sudden recurring attacks of motor, sensory, or psychic malfunction with or without loss of consciousness or convulsive seizures. Epilepsy is not classified by one single problem, but rather a large amount of problems. Depleting motor skills and seizures are the main problems. There are two types of seizures that are from epilepsy. The <i>partial seizure</i> is more common and found in one or more specific parts of the brain. These seizures are likely to develop from certain injuries, but for most cases they are unknown in origin. (A.D.A.M Inc,) The <i>generalized seizure</i> typically occurs in both parts of the brain and is genetically based. Most of the time there is normal neurological function in the brain. With the placement of nuerostimulators in the brain, it may control or eliminate epileptic seizures with programmed or responsive stimulation. (A.D.A.M Inc,)</p>
<p><br />
On the other hand, a patient with <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parkinson%27s_disease.html" title="Parkinson's disease">Parkinson's disease</a> can use a nuerostimulator as well. The deep brain stimulation of the nuerostimulator will help symptoms such as tremor, rigidity, stiffness, slowed movement, and walking problems. The procedure also treats essential tremor, a neurological movement disorder. Once the nuerostimulator is surgically put in the brain, electrical impulses are sent from the stimulator through the wires and into the brain. These impulses interfere with and block the electrical signals that cause Parkinson‚Äôs disease symptoms. At present, the procedure is used only for patients whose symptoms cannot be controlled with medications.</p>
<p><br />
Another problem the nuerostimulator may help is <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depression.html" title="Depression">depression</a>. The electrical stimulation to the brain can eliminate chronic depression if other treatments are not working. People tend to feel an immediate improvement in mood and in their sleeping habits. CG25, also known as the ‚Äúsadness center‚Äù in the brain, is speculated to play a major role in sadness and mood. People with depression have too much activity in that certain part of the brain, which causes minor to major depression. "We thought that one strategy might be to go in and try to turn down the activity in these areas and to see whether that would have any benefit," said Dr. Andres Lozano, a neurosurgeon at Toronto Western Hospital. (CBC News) Since surgical procedures always carry a risk with not knowing what is going to happened as an end result, psychiatrists stipulate deep brain stimulation will only be an option for the serious cases of depression. (CBC News)</p>
<p><br />
<a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_brain_stimulation.html" title="Deep brain stimulation">Deep brain stimulation</a> or <a href="../../../v/a/g/Vagus_nerve_stimulation.html" title="Vagus nerve stimulation">Vagus nerve stimulation</a>, which actually comes out of the nuerostimulator, is a surgical option for people with Parkinson‚Äôs, epilepsy, depression and other diseases. This way of ‚Äúcuring‚Äù the symptoms is a new technique compared to the older way. The old surgery consisted of the surgeon destroying small parts of the brain called the thalamus or globus pallidus. The surgery that is done now implants a piece of thin lead with four electrodes in the brain. Once the electrode is planted in the brain, pulses of energy try to block the abnormal activity, which causes the symptoms. The lead then is connected to a small extension wire that is hooked up to the nuerostimulator under the skin in the chest area.(Cleveland Clinic 03) With the nuerostimulator, it is no longer necessary to do the old routine surgery to try and fix the problems and symptoms. The advancement of deep brain stimulation surgery is contiguously related to finding the specific area in the brain for stimulation.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
All in all, nuerostimulators are helpful to many people with serious diseases such as epilepsy, Parkinson‚Äôs disease, and depression. The nuerostimulator tends to eliminate certain symptoms of these diseases. Nuerostimulators are being used only if the symptoms are rather severe and if medication cannot tame the symptoms. Nuerostimulators have, in a whole, improved the medical health field. New treatments, such as the deep brain stimulation, are being found. These treatments are aiding in reducing symptoms in a certain disease. One may have the enlightening thought that the nuerostimulator could be a cure for a certain disease.</p>

<p>Tottenham is a small .. actually miniscule town slightly south of Alliston Ontario. Tottenham has a population of only a few, nothing major. Theyre hockey arena is used for many things, including hockey, dances and other occasional things. They have a skate park located just outside the rink with a few boards used by the want to be boarders. The only thing useful in the town is its Tim Hortons except its quite slow. The newest addition is theyre price chopper, which seems to be a huge deal .. shows how much excitement hits that town. Alot of the local guys call themselves "Dodge Dwellers" which is apparently cool and hip as well as they like announcing how they "Rep" the 905 area code .. big deal guys try "reppin'" 705 then you'll know cool, most of the "dodge dwellers" go to school in Alliston at the local highschool of Banting which is over populated by drug dealers and kids who have repeated grade 12 several times .. actually alot of them never got all their grade 9 credits. Alliston is a nice peaceful town, except for the hooligans it houses but then again it could be worse off .. it could be Tottenham. Be Thankful Allistonians! Tottenham is known for its steam train, All Aboard .. the whole train could probably transport everyone out of "Dodge" in one haul. Dodge is a wanna be town that will never be so Dwellers move somewhere else or get used to being at teh bottom of the totempole cause thats where youll always be at!</p>

<p>Lisa Alisa <a href="http://www.lisa-alisa.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.lisa-alisa.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lisa-alisa.com/</a> Lisa Alisa, a New York artist claiming to be a citizen of the world, has been gaining recognition and publications all over the globe. With 5 shows and 10 major publications this year alone, Lisa is making a splash with a bang, while maintaining her credibility as an independent artist with integrity and drive. Lisa Alisa believes into the Super-future and holds on tight to dreams of freedom and exploration, preferably the outer space kind. Her edgy sharp girly work (and in this case, girly is a complement of higher caliber) brings new insights to the issues of femininity, gender, society and humanity in general. They also plainly simply and finally kick ass. Lisa Alisa's Art is metaphoric self biography at it's core. All the girls in the paintings carry close resemblance to the author. Her art has stirred up controversy on a number of occasions. Some criticize violence, and others are appalled by the young age of the models. To which Lisa replies: Life is a violent and beautiful thing, you die from it. My art is nothing but a portrayal of everyday life. Every person has to do things they don't like. There is very little actual freedom in our existence, due to social and economical restraints. Your soul, which is a young child forever, is exposed to suffering and anguish, whether you accept it or not. My art explores the depth of horror, dreams of nonchalance, and aims to bring a catharsis.</p>

<p>Suluk are also known as Tao Sug originated from the island of Sulu in the Philippines. At the height of its power, the Sulu Sultanate exercised sovereignty over the present day provinces of Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, Palawan, Basilan and the Malaysian state of Sabah (North Borneo) The Suluk scattered all over this islands and most of them are now natives of this islands.</p>
<p>Infact the Suluk‚Äôs homeland and the Suluk people are parts of dunia Melayu, and they shared many cultural practies and religion with the Muslim in this region. The first Sultan of Sulu with the title of Paduka Mahaseri Maulana al-Sultan Sharif ul-Hashim, whose reign was estimated between 1450 and 1480, was reported in Sulu tarsilas to have come from Sumatra he married the daughter of Rajah Baguinda who arrived earlier in Sulu from Minangkabau. Tracing descent from the ruling families in the region facilitated marriage alliances that provided another connection. Sources both in Sulu and Brunei show that Sulu seventh sultan Muhammad ul-Halim was related to the Brunei royal family. The mother of Sultan Badar ud-Din I was a Tirun from the northeast coast of Borneo. When Spanish governor Corcuera attacked Sulu in 1638 Rajah Bongsu, the Sulu Sultan, was helped by Makassar warriors. Although Arab, Persian and Indian Muslims were limited to traders and missionaries who came for visits, some stayed after marrying local women. Inter marriage within this sultans, warriors, traders and missionaries made up the proud Suluk tribe.</p>
<p>In Malaysia especially the state of Sabah most Suluk settled in the east coast and northern part of the state. The early settlers during the colonial days were under pressure from the British colonial and were branded as Suluk pirates, one of them is Datu Muhammad Salleh or Mat Salleh. He was born in Inanam, Sabah and related to the sultan of Sulu. In 1895, Mat Salleh made a complaint to the Company but the Company ignored him. Soon after the complaint, the Company burnt down his village. In 1897, he retaliated by razing the Company's harbor at Pulau Gaya. Despite the peace treaty, the Company decided to take over Tambunan from Mat Salleh in 1899. Mat Salleh refused and thus, hostility was renewed. On January 31, 1900, he was shot dead in Kampung Teboh, Tambunan. Under pressure by the British colonials, most Suluk had lost their identity to date and preferred to be identified as Bajau, a tribe considered more linen and peaceful by the colonials.</p>

<p>The job and aspects of the lowest combat member of the Runescape clan, <i>The Moriquendi.</i></p>
<p>Cook is a player of mine in Jagex's MMORPG <i>Runescape</i>. He is an active member of the growing clan "The Moriquendi". He has been a member of that clan since December 24th, 2004.</p>
<p>Da Cookstar's job within the clan is to be a moderator of the boards. This means that he must regulate the content of the boards and make sure that other members follow the rules of the forums. It is an important jobs that he shares with other members with surnames such as Quizy9, NG12345, and Arrowpro. The moderators are a vital part in the communication forums of any clan.</p>
<p>Aside from Da Cookstar's forum duties, he also has a duty in wars and <i>pk trips</i>(raids to find other clans to fight). Within Runescape the character Da Cookstar is a <i>ranger</i>, which is a warrior much like the medieval archer. The primary goal of a ranger within a clan is to pick off the enemy wizards, who are powerful hitters against the rest of the army of swordsmen. The rangers have lower armor and power properties than the swordsman, but they shoot at the enemy with great speed, which makes them perfect for taking out enemies with scanty amounts of armor; such as mages who wear robes in battle.</p>
<p>Da Cookstar is the lowest level in the clan, so he is often an early target. The trick to staying alive in a war is to stay hidden in the group and to shoot out at mages who show their faces out of the main group. Although often looked over, rangers play a vital role in any clan.</p>
<p>All in all, between moderating and warring, Da Cookstar plays quite an active part within his clan. From cracking down on "spam" to shooting out sorcerors, Cook has quite a fanstastic life with "The Moriquendi", the coolest clan ever created.</p>

<p>A Bachelor of Arts Graduate from the University of London, Trimmer taught business studies at Victoria Park Collegiate from <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>.

<p>Bioconversion is a technique that using microorganism to biocatalyst specific chemical reaction beyond the capabilities of organic chemistry that involves growth in bioreactor with specific condition. Bioconversion also can be described as a reaction in which one compound is converted to another by enzyme in cell. Bioconversion has been applied for gluconic acid production. Gluconic acid production was investigated using an enzymatic cellulase of waste material in a culture of Aspergillus niger.</p>

<p>In multiple description coding, the multimedia data (mostly used for video) is broken into several streams with some redundancy among the streams. When all the streams are received, one can guarantee low distortion at the expense of having a slightly higher bit rate than a system designed purely for compression. On the other hand, when only some of the streams are received (or even one stream), the quality of the reconstruction degrades but still a correct streaming video is reconstructed.</p>
<p>This way MDC adjusts and matches the quality of the multimedia data according to the receivers bandwith. One with low bandwith will still be able to view the multimedia content without objectionable jiggies or buffering pauses.</p>
<p>Many papers have been made about MDC, possible applications in the future could be live streaming TV over P2P-Networks.</p>

<p>Canix is a secure embedded networking operating system kernel designed by Canaan Kao in 2004.</p>
<p>His goal is to design a simple and elegant monolithic kernel. It provides an efficient and security software platform for developing network added value service like IDS, QoS, and so on.</p>
<p>Canix makes the packets processing as hardware close as possible for maximal performance like figure 2.1 presented. If packets don„Äèt need to transfer to upper layer, they will go the flow-through path on the spot like figure 2.2 presented. If a packet needs to go to upper layer applications, it must pass the test of self protector. Self protector will check its headers and try to find any illegal fields. If it is a malicious packet, it will be dropped immediately by self protector. If applications of Canix need to send packets to network, the packets will be added into OS FIFO queue and wait for transmitting.</p>

<p>Sand Creatures Sand Creatures have been around for thousands of years. They were discovered by the Egyptians and were feared by them for thousands of years, to this day they still are.These creatures, even to this day, were considered the best trumpet players. Also their skill at backgammon was considerable. Sand creatures are of an average 52' in length they are about as wide as an eighteen wheeler truck and weigh 61 tons. Egyptians considered these creatures holy due to the benificial effects of eating their feaces. After eating feaces people will have the power of 100 men. These creatures became extinct the year jesus was born due to the fact that jesus blasted them all with ray guns. The End Peace Out.</p>

<p>MEDI-VEST ¬Æ 2005</p>
<p>Description and Principal Functions</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>"A revolutionary, versatile and mobile wearable first-aid vest that is capable of offering alternative aids to medical professionals when assisting injured patients."</p>
<p>Principal Functions:</p>
<p>To meet the ongoing needs of alternative ‚Äòon the go‚Äô medical professionals ranging from paramedics, bike-medics, first aiders and rescue teams.</p>
<p>To address the physical problems in existing medical first- aid kits such as weight load, transportation, usability, accessibility and structural integrity.</p>
<p>To create a wearable first-aid kit that provides extensive range of medical equipment to cater varying medical professionals.</p>
<p>To re-define existing survival kits by introducing a new paradigm in the way medical professionals will utilise the next generation of first aid kits.</p>
<p><br />
There are no standard versatile and mobile first aid kits that are easy to carry and can be customised to varied medical professions.</p>
<p>Current first aid kits lack innovation and bring added anxiety to professionals when treating patients. The unpredictable demands of medical authorities in our modern world have resulted in an influx of emergency equipment and strain on the availability of first aid.</p>
<p>Current first-aid kits do not comply with the needs of user requirements. Factors such as weight load and transportation add to the difficulty for the generic first- aid tool box to meet this demand for emergency care. Bulky boxes or heavy back-packs, overcrowded compartments and unused equipment do not attempt to answer a simple need such as providing equipment quickly and efficiently in an emergency.</p>
<p>Medi-Vest¬Æ revolutionizes the way society perceives current first aid kits. With the inclusion of technology and fashion, medical first aid kits will no longer be enclosed in ordinary tool boxes or pack packs. Medi-Vest¬Æ offers a simple and innovative solution to the many problems posed by first-aid kits in the form of a light weight, easy to wear first aid vest which enclosed first-aid equipment.</p>
<p>When assisting a patient, Medi-Vest¬Æ will allow the professional to quickly access compartments in a matter of seconds. Depending on the event, users that require more first-aid can attach more pocket compartments onto vest or remove what is not required.</p>
<p>The removable equipment storage sleeves enclosed within the main front pockets allows for re-packing and equipment alteration purposes. Equipment will be stored according to what is required by the user. The equipment is organised in a logical layout. No more cluttered tool boxes displaying equipment in a disorganised manner. The elastic straps secure and fasten the equipment in place. The user can open, zip or Velcro off a compartment when necessary.</p>
<p>Components:</p>
<p>Main front pockets ‚Äì sterile and non-sterile equipment (bandages, lotions and creams) Undersleeve (adjustable) ‚Äì uniform to place pockets on top. Stores disposable sharps case (back) and extra storage pocket (front). Back-pack ‚Äì defibrillator or oxygen equipment. Sterile sharps case ‚Äì sterile instruments.</p>
<p>Medi-Vest¬Æ is constructed in Nylon coated PVC¬Æ and Air Flow Mesh¬Æ which are light weight, breathable and easy to clean. Smart Fabric technology allows the garment to adapt to the changing temperature of the user. Medi-Vest¬Æ appears flat pack and moulded to the human form. The inbuilt (puncture proof) rubber coated Aluminium film and rigid air flow mesh material allows the pockets to flex, bend and mould to the shape and movement of the body. The compressed moulded polystyrene sharp cases avoid instruments from coming in contact with the user, increase durability, and endure contamination.</p>
<p>Medi-Vest¬Æ will be mass-produced. This product is versatile between various medical professionals, allowing for extensive sales to occur. The entire set with equipment is meant to be sold at a reasonable price (AUD 500 ‚Äì 700) It appeals to wider range target markets within the medical industry and possibly it other sectors such as the Army, Life-Savers and other organisations which require some form of first-aid.</p>
<p>Medi-Vest¬Æ provides a visual identity to the user. It becomes a fashionable and recognisable vest making it enjoyable to wear and show off to the public. Medi-Vest¬Æ clearly stands from competition and it moves that extra level above all medical kits, to enhance the performance, safety and usability of the product. It distinctively aligns itself with what medical professionals of today are searching for.</p>

<p>The ancient Hallstatt civilization was a nation in Central Europe first dated from 1500 to 1000 BCE. It is noted for its use of bronze and iron, being among the first civilizations in the Iron Age (along with the Aegean civilizations, Mesopotamian civilizations, and Indian civilizations.) Known for domesticating animals, agriculture, and pottery, Halstatt was among the first great European civilizations.It was also a leading producer of iron sometime around 1000 to 500 BCE.</p>
<p>Halstatt conquered or had large influence over northern Italy, Germany, Scandanavia, the former Yugoslavian region, the Celts in Transalpine Gaul and Catalonia, the Neolithic cultures, and the Illyrians. It is supposed that Hallstatt originated in southern Germany and possibly the alps.</p>
<p>The Hallstatt civilization may have spoke Germanic.</p>

<p>Succinyl-CoA synthetase catalyzes the formation of succinyl-CoA, a 4-carbon metabolite, from succinate and coenzyme-A. Johnson et al, 1998 describe two isoforms of Succinyl-CoA synthetase in mammals, one which specifically uses ATP for synthesis, and one which utilizes GTP. The crystal structure of Succinyl-CoA synthetase alpha subunit (ATP-binding isoform) was determined by Joyce et al., 2000 to a resolution of 2.10 A, with PDB code 1CQJ.<a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1CQJ" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1CQJ" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>

<p>Pakistan is blessed with talent and when we talk about Music, our artists' are popular all over the world. Many new talented artists in Pakistan are working hard to bring quality Pakistani music. But we should not forget lot of talented Pakistani musicians who are away from their motherland but still doing a lot of work for promotion of our own music. One of them is Azhar aka DJ Aphlatoon who was born in Pakistan &amp; raised in Saudi Arabia. He has been living in New York, USA for more than a decade now. This creative 22 years old DJ started work in 1996 but dedicates himself for Pakistani music in 1997 and since then he has been remixing Pakistani songs. He became the first Pakistani DJ to remix Pakistani songs. He used to conceive different beats for the song he got chance to listen and later this ability turned him out into a fine DJ popularly known for remixing Pakistani songs. It is not an easy job at all to take an original song and then mixing it with another but Aphlatoon has been doing this job very well. He released his first Pakistani remixed album titled "Mixistan" in 1999. His second offering was ‚ÄúShauq: The Remixes‚Äù released by PakHits Records. Specialty of this latest album is that it includes a rap song by Asad, first Pakistani English rapper along with a classical singer named Chand. This album includes remixes of popular songs by Abrar, Faakhir, Humera Arshed, Ahmed Jahanzeb, Jawad Ahmed, Nazia Hassan, Vital Signs, Tina Sani, Junoon, and late Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Aphlatoon is not a singer but still he did great job by writing lyrics and composing music of some songs. His popular remixes/ songs include Aasman Ko Lagaanay (Tere Pyar Mein), Bin Tere Kya Hai Jeena (Jawad), Dupatta (Hadiqa), Majajni (Abrar) and Yar Bina Dil Mera (Junoon). But most popular of all these days is "Judai" which is written and composed by Aphlatoon himself and "Murzie" from UAE (who is also Pakistani basically) has performed this song. DJ Aphlatoon has also got his web presence at <a href="http://djaphlatoon.cjb.net" class="external free" title="http://djaphlatoon.cjb.net" rel="nofollow">http://djaphlatoon.cjb.net</a> which is a valuable website providing important information about the artist and links to related websites where you can access his music.</p>

<p>Deadweight was released by american artist Beck (in 1998), for the soundtrack of the movie A Life Less Ordinary. The Deadweight video was directed by french director Michel Gondry. In the video Beck is first seen sitting at a desk by the beach. He dreams of taking a vacation in the city. Everything in the movie has been turned around. Beck follows his shadow and his shoes, the pictures covers the walls and the wallpaper has been framed etc. Also everytime Beck does something the picture cuts to a few seconds of the movie.</p>

<p>The genetic material of a virus is not enclosed in a membrane such as in bacteria but rather a multi protein structure called a capsid. Viral capsids can be either helical or icosahedral in shape. The icosahedral shape is derived from the structure of an icosahedron which has 20 equilateral triangular faces. In the icosahedral capsid, the same holds, however, each triangular face is made up of three triangular protein subunits.</p>

<p>Shane Acton, sailor and circumnavigator, first set sail from Britain at the age of 22, in 1972. Raised in Coniston Road, Coleridge, England, without sailing experience he departed in a used 18 foot bilge-keel boat, built by Caprice, originally named Super Shrimp but known simply as Shrimpy. Later accompanied for much of the voyage by his girlfriend, a photographer from Switzerland, Iris Derungs, he sailed westabout through the Panama canal, circling the globe and returning back to England as a local celebrity eight years later. The voyage is chronicled in his book Shrimpy: A Record Round-the-World Voyage in an Eighteen Foot Yacht.</p>
<p>In 1984 he set off on a second voyage. He lived his later years near Golfito, Costa Rica, and died of lung cancer at the age of 55 in Cambridge, England.</p>

<p>Frame busting is a technique used by webmasters to protect their webpage from being inclosed in an external website's html frame or iframe. It is a javascript test which compares the current javascript window (self) to the root window (top). If they are not equal, it changes the root window to the intended url. By doing so, the intended webpage is shown without being inclosed in a frame.</p>

<p>Coauthorship implies that two or more persons authored an article or a book.
