I am all for having articles about any <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_class_cricket.html" title="First class cricket">first class cricketer</a>, but when it comes to List A, we have to take a look at the context. There is no point in having articles about every player from every <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html#International_structure" title="Cricket">Associate &amp; Affiliate</a> nation, unless he has done something really significant. Note that Oman is not even an Associate nation but an Affiliate one. The eligibility criteria in WP:CRIC should be revised to make it more rigorous. <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETintin1107_b710.html" title="User:Tintin1107">Tintin</a> (<a href="../../../t/i/n/User_talk%7ETintin1107_ddb3.html" title="User talk:Tintin1107">talk</a>) 04:59, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>reply</b> Regardless of the specifics in the individual notability criteria like WP:CRIC, we should NOT delete any article that we can find substantive information on in reliable sources. Regardless of his level of play, this cricketer shows up in MANY sources with non-trivial coverage. While every List A player from an Affiliate nation <i>may not</i> be notable, this one clearly is. Notability should never be based on a a strictly binary arguement (such as "all articles that meet this one criteria are ALL notable/any that do not are NEVER notable). While such guidelines help point us towards <i>further investigation</i> we should not make such claims when further investigation bears out notability. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron</a><a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_Esperanza_2c14.html" title="User:Jayron32/Esperanza"><span style="color:#00FF00;">32</span></a> 06:17, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

There isn't much information about him anyway. <a href="../../../s/r/1/User%7ESr13_af5f.html" title="User:Sr13">Sr13</a> 07:04, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Response</b>. <s>Why is Nate Ilaoa not an article? NCAA football coaches have considered him important and "prominent" in the UH offense. He should be priority when creating UH football related content. <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colt_Brennan_b71b.html" title="Colt Brennan">Colt Brennan</a> is an article though. Why? He is a "prominent" figure in UH football.</s> Although team prominence is important, player prominence is important as well. Thus my decision. Also, WP:BIO mentions requirement "tests". One refers to the 100 year test- Will the person be remembered 100 years from now? <s>Colt Brennan may. Not so sure about the person; the team possibly.</s> <a href="../../../s/r/1/User%7ESr13_af5f.html" title="User:Sr13">Sr13</a> 07:53, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why is Nate Ilaoa not an article, you ask? The answer appears to be "because nobody has written an article about him". One might suggest that the fact that people care enough about Adnan Ilyas to write an article about him, but don't care enough about Nate Ilaoa to write an article about <i>him</i>, is an adequate indication of relative notability. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 22:21, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think the point here is that these are two entirely separate questions. Whether Adnan Ilyas is deserving of an article should be decided on its own merits (I am not voting, but I will commend the research Jayron did here); if Nate Ilaoa is deserving of an article, start one. If you don't have time to really do it up right, create a stub. But "X doesn't deserve an article because Y doesn't have one" is not the right way to look at it. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidConrad_dd88.html" title="User:DavidConrad">DavidConrad</a> 01:53, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. I'm not entirely happy that a player who's appeared at no higher level than the ICC Trophy (which is, after all, very much a second-string international competition) is going to be notable. We wouldn't have a <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_cricket.html" title="County cricket">county cricketer</a> who'd only played for a <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_county.html" title="Minor county">minor county</a>. However, the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Cricket_Council_b676.html" title="International Cricket Council">ICC</a> have deemed the 2005 (and onward) ICC Trophy to be worthy of List A status, and given that fact I think on balance he should stay. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELoganberry_d015.html" title="User:Loganberry">Loganberry</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/g/User_talk%7ELoganberry_54ba.html" title="User talk:Loganberry">Talk</a>) 02:14, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
