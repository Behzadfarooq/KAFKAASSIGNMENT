<li><b>Delete</b> Not because the article may set a precedent or be an exception to the norm (both these things are acceptable), simply because it's totally arbitary in places (relies on what editors think are significant wins rather than any published source), and is not referenced anywhere (and hence not readily verifiable). It also drifts way off topic in places. Finally, I'm just not sure that it's warranted, at least not in an encyclopaedia: noting the top and bottom wins might perhaps be justified in the main article, but otherwise there's nothing particularly encyclopaedic about the rest. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn24601_55f4.html" title="User:John24601">John24601</a> 15:40, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>FYI, nothing in the section [[<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a> appears to apply to this article. That section is very limited in scope (ie the specific items listed in the section that have broader consensus for deletion).
<dl>
<dd>It seems I have misinterpreted the policy somewhat, hence I have struck though this. To elaborate on the point I intended to make, I feel that the article could stand if it were drastically cut down. Winning a significantly large or small amount of money is notable and worthy of inclusion, but being one of 30ish people to win between 10p and £100 seems too insignificant to me. Likewise listing ~20 people to win £20,000 and ~10 to win £10. This is content for a fan site, not an encyclopedia. →<a href="../../../o/l/i/User%7EOliver_Brown_8bca.html" title="User:Oliver Brown">Ollie</a> <small>(<a href="../../../o/l/i/User_talk%7EOliver_Brown_10c9.html" title="User talk:Oliver Brown">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Oliver_Brown_6e22.html" title="Special:Contributions/Oliver Brown">contribs</a>)</small> 11:36, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep (assuming article's references up to par)</b> Reviewing the article and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> as cited above, I fail to see any parts of WP:NOT that apply to this article. The indiscriminate section cited is, as written, limited in scope primarily to the areas of consensus mentioned in the policy, none of which fit this article. Likewise, other sections of WP:NOT don't fit either. In fact, this would appear to be essentially an episodic-synopsis of the series. And since articles about television series episodes are generally acceptable, and this article actually accumulates multiple episode details within a single text, if anything this appears to be a better format for providing details for a weekly serial realty series. Just my opinion. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:08, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

First of all, all of the information on here is from a primary source (the show), which, as both policies say, is to be avoided if at all possible, due to the inherent bias and possibility of misinterpretation of these sources. As all of the information is from the show itself, there is also no notability to the subject: if you find secondary sources (e.g. newspaper articles) on specific wins, then those are notable: a list of what hapenned in a show is not. The bit I was pointing to in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> was "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information". --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn24601_55f4.html" title="User:John24601">John24601</a> 10:44, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The nomination and most of the comments above said that the article violates <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, which isn't true. If the article has a problem with verification and references, that is a violation of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, which is a different policy.

<dd><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>: "Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought" - I think we can assume that any "important" games mentioned on here (other than the highest &amp; lowest wins) are probably somebody's own thoughts. It's also a news report of kinds, and opinion on current affairs. Also, whilst it's not fiction, I think it comes under the spirit (if not the letter) of the plot summaries section of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> (under wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information). --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn24601_55f4.html" title="User:John24601">John24601</a> 06:46, 23 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>To reply to each of those concerns -</dd>
<dd>1) "Not a publisher of original thought" The article does not obviously fit this section, which covers "publishing your own thoughts and analysis". It is listing data about the show, but is not (far as I know) an analysis by the author about what the data might mean in any social or scientific context. And anything that <i>is</i> disputably original opinion can be deleted from the article without deleting the entire thing. For example, if it appears that a comment about the significance of an event is a "weasel word" or the author's opinion, that can be deleted without removing the actual data. Note that there is, however, the issue of providing references to verify the facts.</dd>
<dd>2) "News reports" specifically covers the firsthand reporting on breaking stories. These are not breaking stories, but rather an accumulation of historical data from the show. It is not reporting on "current" events, but indexing historical ones.</dd>
<dd>3)"Plot summaries" Plot summaries is specifically for works of fiction, which this isn't, and says that an article should not solely provide a summary of a fictional plot. Since the show is neither fictional and is providing information outside of a simple plot summary, this section does not apply.</dd>
<dd>So, again, I am unconvinced that this article fails to meet <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> standards. It might fail on standards regarding providing references, though, and like many articles could probably stand a cleanup on the writing. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 16:37, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> unless sourced. Verification has to be repeatable, and already-broadcast episodes of game shows are not, by and large, retrievable for anyone who wants to check the facts. The episodes of most fiction TV programmes can be used as primary sources because every episode is usually easily available on video, but episodes of daily gameshows are not. Verification is also not repeatable if verifying the record requires watching every single episode and looking for the highest/lowest bid etc, that would be <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, but as Noel makes a habit of comparing current games to previous records, I would guess that most of the records have been explicitly set out in one episode or another. However, that's the point, I have to guess - I cannot go back and watch previous episodes because it's a gameshow and unlike fictional series, there is no way for the average reader to confirm the facts. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 12:28, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As an aside, repeatability of verification is an interesting point that might be relevant to a related more general topic of how to handle episodic information for television series. Some television series have articles for each episode, but other series don't. The point you bring up regarding some shows not airing in syndicated or DVD reruns is a good one, and could apply not only to game shows but also soap operas and professional wrestling shows, etc. We might want to require that, if a show does not air reruns, the information be verifiable through a DVD, for example, or a published news article or review talking about that particular episode. I'll mention this on the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Television_2ace.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Television">Wikipedia:WikiProject Television</a> - it might help lead to a good guideline for handling these sorts of shows. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 20:07, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, it's wonderful - it houses a whole host of information. But, that information isn't necessarily encyclopaedic. As myself and others have pointed out, it's not verifiable (as if it were sourced, which it isn't, it would be to individual shows which the average reader has no way of getting hold of a copy of), and because we are taking it straight from a primary source, we have no way to establish notability (as we would if, say, we were to make reference to academic papers, newspaper articles etc.). I'm also not sure that it's particularly encyclopaedic to have such a list, regardless of its sources. Finally, going back to the notability issue - right now, a few editors are interested in it. In 12 months, nobody will remember the majority of these players and wins, and in 5-10 years, the entire show is likely to be a distant memory. So why should we keep it? "It holds alot of information" doesn't really cut the ice, IMHO. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn24601_55f4.html" title="User:John24601">John24601</a> 17:30, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't consider that fan sites count as unbiased secondary sources, all they prove is that someone else has already written a list of what hapenned in every episode: that's no reason for us to do the same, or to pick out what we consider to be the most important ones. IMHO, the topic only becomes notable once it is talked about outside of the inner-core of fans (e.g. a newspaper article, and more than one at that). --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn24601_55f4.html" title="User:John24601">John24601</a> 06:49, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
