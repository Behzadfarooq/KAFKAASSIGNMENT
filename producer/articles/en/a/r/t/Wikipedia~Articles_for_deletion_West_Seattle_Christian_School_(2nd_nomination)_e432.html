<p>Was originally kept following an AfD back in February, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_West_Seattle_Christian_School_d08e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/West Seattle Christian School">here</a>, but has not improved since. Following the closure of the previous AfD, the following comment was added to the article's Talk page: <i>Cleanup arising from AFD seems in order</i>. However, looking at the history, the last time that this article was edited was when the AfD notice was removed back in February--no one has touched it since. This article is two sentences long and asserts no particular importance. Previous AfD discussion seemed to hinge on arguments along the lines of the school having been mentioned in the local paper (as are many non-notable things) and being the recipient of federal funds (as are many non-notable things). <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> (which is <b>not</b> a guideline) suggests that school articles must conform to our <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiablity policy</a>, viz: <i>The school has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the school itself.</i> This article does not appear to present such evidence, and the lack of edits since February strongly suggests that it never will. <a href="../../../p/u/e/User%7EPuerto_De_La_Cruz_9cfd.html" title="User:Puerto De La Cruz">Puerto De La Cruz</a> 18:34, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge</b> into an article on the local community, verifiable but not very long. Alternately, <b>keep</b> as is.

<li>I didn't nominate a zillion, I nominated eleven. I got the idea when someone put a bunch of non-notable webcomics up earlier this week. This is no different. There are literally hundreds of poorly-written, unsourced articles on non-notable schools that survived VfDs last year because our standards were more relaxed at the time, many of which haven't had a single edit since then (as with this one, although the AfD wasn't quite as long ago as the others). I am simply attempting to do some cleanup. <a href="../../../p/u/e/User%7EPuerto_De_La_Cruz_9cfd.html" title="User:Puerto De La Cruz">Puerto De La Cruz</a> 00:17, 11 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Eleven in a day is incredibly excessive and disruptive. They've been around for a while; waiting another day or eleven won't hurt. I would be interested in cleaning up this article, except it's too hard to clean up thirteen articles all nominated for AfD on the same day. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 14:52, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If you are as concerned with this threadbare article (and other school articles in equally dismal condition) as you appear to be, perhaps you could help to make it a better article by adding what you know. IMHO, an article this brief and this generic (unless it is =universally= held to be a notable subject) simply holds us up as amateurs. Either it should be expanded, which I have no interest in doing (I have long held that only truly notable schools should be included in Wikipedia) or it should be deleted.
