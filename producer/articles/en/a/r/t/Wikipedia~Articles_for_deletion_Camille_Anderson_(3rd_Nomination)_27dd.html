<li><b>Comment</b> That's not a reason to vote that way. I have given links to 7 of these contestants, who have equal notability to Camille, and they have all been deleted. The 2 AFD processes (which are not recent, at least 5-6 months old) had very few users commenting, and the evidence was pretty poor, along the lines of "we don't need to delete everyone" or "she seems notable". The first one was a no consensus, and the other was posted far too soon compared to the first one. This article should be deleted like the others, no questions asked. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooshakla_a61e.html" title="User:Booshakla">Booshakla</a> 23:49, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, AfD is all about asking questions and following procedures. Technically we don't "vote" at AfD we form consensus. You seem to perceive your judgement to be better than all of the AfD participants who suggested "Keep" and the admins who evaluated the consensus. Isn't that a bit arrogant?</li>
<li>At my age 6 years is recent, 6 months is a blink.</li>
<li>First AfD was 3 keeps and 1 delete.</li>
<li>Second AfD was 3 keeps and 0 delete.</li>

<dd><b>Note</b> Article has been improved with references and more text. Far from perfect, but it now makes the standards for notability and verifiability (ESPN and Austin Chronicle), with more than Diva to her credit: Ms Austin USA &amp; minor appearances in major films; collectively she is noticed which is all that is required per primary notability standards. Also note that BIO is under dispute now. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 03:06, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> I don't agree with any of your opinions. The reworking of the article just affirms that she isn't notable under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Her part in Wedding Crashers was a bit part, she isn't listed on the first page of the IMDB profile page. The 7 AFDs I have listed are equally or even more notable than her, and they were all deleted. The sources you give don't pass <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, and you need far more than those (and can't just be mentions in passing) to pass WP:BIO. And 6 months is a long time between AFDs, I don't care how you view time, that's not the issue here. A vast majority of users here would agree with me that 6 months is a long, proper time to wait before relisting. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooshakla_a61e.html" title="User:Booshakla">Booshakla</a> 03:49, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>She didn't survive 2 AFDs, no one commented on them, and they defaulted. Very faulty reasoning above, the 2 afds were total bunk. This article needs to go pronto, not notable, no RS, just total trash and should not be on WP. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooshakla_a61e.html" title="User:Booshakla">Booshakla</a> 06:19, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>There were two AfDs. After each one, the article remained. How is that <i>not</i> surviving two AfDs? Anyway, I'm not an obsessive inclusionist nor am I a fan of Anderson's; I'd just rather see this expanded than deleted outright. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff_Silvers_da83.html" title="User:Jeff Silvers">Jeff Silvers</a> 08:14, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> nn model, the past AFDs are not convincing (should have been extended), plenty of other diva search losers have had articles deleted, and a bit part in a movie and a bunch of non-reliable sources in passing don't merit an article. Biggspowd 00:25, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Also, the argument that "other diva search losers have had articles deleted" isn't valid enough on its own to justify deleting this article. <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff_Silvers_da83.html" title="User:Jeff Silvers">Jeff Silvers</a> 02:56, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Biggspowd has made nine contributions during his three weeks at WP, four of which have been to AfD's proposed by Booshakla.
