<li>Please don't go over these "stuck record" schools arguments <i>yet again</i>. The proper study of encyclopaedists is looking for, citing, reading, and evaluating sources. It is <i>not</i> the making of personal, subjective, judgements of importance. Please concentrate upon <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">citing sources</a> to show that this school satisfies the <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> criteria. The Ofsted report is one such non-trivial published work. What were the other non-trivial published works used to build the article?

<li>No. There is no consensus over schools articles. Part of the problem is that a lot of editors employ "stuck record" arguments. You can see several "stuck record" arguments above. <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> is an attempt to break this pattern and to get editors back on track with <i>concentrating upon sources</i>, as encyclopaedists should.
<p>The <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">primary notability criterion</a> in <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> is that the school be the subject of multiple non-trivial published works that are independent of the school, which in fact gets one to roughly the same place, since these published works are neutral sources that can be used to build and to verify an article. (Works published by the school itself are not neutral.) The Ofsted report is one such published work. I've asked for another one three times, now. <i>All that needs to be done is to cite one</i>, and you will have the strongest of proper encyclopaedic arguments, multiple independent non-trivial sources discussing the subject, for keeping the article. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:39, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Actually, this article is about a secondary school, and <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary_school.html" title="Secondary school">secondary school</a> redirects to <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_school.html" title="High school">high school</a>. <sub><a href="../../../j/_/d/User%7EJ_Di_b918.html" title="User:J Di">J Di</a></sub><sup><a href="../../../j/_/d/User_talk%7EJ_Di_c943.html" title="User talk:J Di">talk</a></sup> 09:04, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>There are <i>no</i> "elementary" schools in the UK with the name of "High School"; they are known as <i>primary</i> schools. If you'd read the article you'd know the age range of this school is 11-16, not elementary age and it specifically states it is a <i>secondary</i> school in the first sentence - which J Di points out redirects to <i>high school</i>. --<b><a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex9891_424f.html" title="User:Alex9891"><span style="color:blue">Alex</span></a></b> <b><sup><a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlex9891_0328.html" title="User talk:Alex9891"><span style="color:green">(talk here)</span></a></sup></b> 11:35, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>In American terms, high school is generally grades 9, 10, 11, and 12 - that's 14 - 18. Not the same as the UK. <a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Moitie_d216.html" title="User:T. Moitie">T.

<li><b>Comment</b> — The article is a tad on the fluffy side, including material that only somebody attending the school would care about.

<li>Yes, I would have to agree with that, it can easily be cut down.
