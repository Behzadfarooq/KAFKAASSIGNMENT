<li><b>Keep</b> The "primary subject" rule at BIO is under dispute and is more stringent than the general notability criterion for WP. BIO is a mess right now and changes from day to day. She is a significant subject within the BBC article, but I would like to see more resource material to fully establish notability. I think this article needs to go to cleanup. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 03:20, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I agree. I've removed the advertising spiel at the end of the article. The user who created the articles is currently adding lots of people who have gained <a href="../../../d/b/e/DBE_d557.html" title="DBE">DBEs</a>. Some of these are obviously notable but others must be borderline - this bio is mostly copied from BBC and other articles.

<li><b>Comment</b> - "She started her career in London. After rapid promotion, she became head teacher at Calverton Primary School in the east London. Calverton appeared in the press, described as one of the worse schools in the country." and "Within three years, Calverton became the most improved primary school in the country, with results far exceeding those achieved in far more affluent areas." and "Sharon was invited to Downing Street to tell the Prime Minister, his education ministers, and advisors how these improvements had been brought about. After her presentation, the Secretary of State, David Blunkett asked her to join the prestigious Standards Task Force." and "She established a reputation as someone who could bring about high standards of educational achievement through the reform of traditional practices. She was soon invited to become an advisory head teacher." are lifted word for word from the website is not <i>unquestionable</i>.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Which brings us back to the original point - are people notable purely because they've gained a DBE? While the subject's achievements in her workplace are obviously very commendable, the third-party references were only generated from her award. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of educational staff who have improved school results without gaining an award from it, do they all need a wiki page? <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliminatorJR_b0b2.html" title="User:EliminatorJR">EliminatorJR</a> 00:03, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, article seems to have had some cut'n'paste problems but subject is notable.

<li><b>Keep</b>. References seem OK, and she's notable enough to have been awarded a DBE. <b>However</b> it is important that we are impartial, and seen to be impartial, and are not biased towards any particular commercial interest. Accordingly, we should eliminate the link to her own comments, and watch the article carefully for signs of commercialisation: she is no longer a teacher, but has set up her own "consultancy", presumably to capitalise on her fame. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 13:25, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep:</b> I may be biased as I am the one who created the page but she is an educator who turned around one of the worst schools in the entire UK and was created as DBE for that; and is now an industry consultant, I believe she more than merits a page on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Sorry, <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeronica_Mars_fanatic_645d.html" title="User:Veronica Mars fanatic">Veronica Mars fanatic</a>, I think we were both contributing to the AfD debate at about the same time ( you can check the edit times in the history of this debate ) and I guess I must have clicked something incorrectly when I made my posting. I certainly wasn't aiming to delete your comments, so sorry for that. As it happens, you'll see that we both feel that the article should be retained, so it should be clear that this wasn't meant maliciously, but was a pure accident. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 11:21, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> the added info mainly duplicates the existing page, unfortunately. Despite the fact I nominated this for AfD, I'd actually quite like to keep it, but at the moment I really have to conclude that the only thing that is making the subject notable is her DBE. Even speaking as a teacher myself, if we had pages for every educationalist who had been successful in their job ... you get the picture. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliminatorJR_b0b2.html" title="User:EliminatorJR">EliminatorJR</a> 19:37, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
