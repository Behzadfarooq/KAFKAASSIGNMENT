<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I can't believe how many <a href="../../../w/w/e/WWE_Diva_Search_8465.html" title="WWE Diva Search">WWE Diva Search</a>-related attempted deletions I've stumbled into over the past couple days. Allow me to use some precedent: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Amy_Weber_7bf5.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Amy Weber">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Amy Weber</a> This discussion was just resolved a day ago <i>in favor of keep</i>. I think we've pretty well established that people who are featured as contestants on the Diva Search <i>are</i> notable, particularly in a case like this where they had been featured on television for weeks and weeks. -<a href="../../../u/m/d/User%7EUmdunno_3255.html" title="User:Umdunno">Umdunno</a> 00:23, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. <a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Weber_eed6.html" title="Amy Weber">Amy Weber</a> is much more notable at this moment than the one I just flagged for deletion. This person has been on WWE TV, usually in a brief, non-speaking role, as a CONTESTANT for maybe 3 or 4 weeks. Webber was probably notable enough anyway due to her role on Son of the Beach, even before the diva search. That is a horrible, piss-poor precedent, not even a shade comparable to this. I think my "crystal ball" agrument is far stronger than yours. <a href="../../../r/e/n/User%7ERenosecond_03c0.html" title="User:Renosecond">Renosecond</a> 03:24, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm going to apologize for claiming the Diva Search precedent, as I hadn't realized yet so many were up for deletion (as you well know) though I don't think it would make a "piss-poor" precedent.

<li><b>Delete</b> - as with other reality show contestants, unless there is some other documentation of notability, there does not need to be a separate article. -- <a href="../../../w/h/p/User%7EWhpq_e938.html" title="User:Whpq">Whpq</a> 16:00, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> "just because one is signed to a WWE developmental territory does not mean they are instantly notable or that they would appear on WWE programming" This could be said of nearly anyone currently in a developmental territory, and if that is the precident by which deletions will be made, many more would have to occur beyond this one article. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.124.106.90 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.124.106.90.html" title="User talk:68.124.106.90">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.124.106.90_087b.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.124.106.90">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> She'e more than a reality show contestant. From what I looked up, she's been on <a href="../../../w/w/e/WWE_eb93.html" title="WWE">WWE</a> television for more than the past month and she was recently contracted to the WWE following the contest. She's a model and actress so I think since she's contracted to WWE, there's probably going to be more updates on her new job in the near future. I think it's safe to say that she meets <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. — <span style="font-family:Edwardian Script ITC"><font color="#00FF00">The Future</font></span> 23:02, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep Please</b> I have needed lots of info on her lately, and this has been the best place to find it. All of the Diva Search contestants should be kept on Wikipedia at least until the next Diva Search takes place. If the contestants aren't in the WWE by that time, it is safe to delete her article. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.20.180.64 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.20.180.64_ba44.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.20.180.64">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><del><b>Undelete</b> Although Milena did not win the Diva Search contest, she just signed a contract with WWE. She <b>is</b> going to be a WWE diva and she may debut very shortly.

<dd>Reno, none of those contestants got contracts. Milena has recieved a WWE contract, which helps her notability. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 19:50, 1 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Maybe it helps a tiny bit, but being signed to a contract means that there is no gaurantee that she will have any role in future WWE programming, even being in the development territories does not promise instant notability. Look at the deletion review for Amy Zidian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review#Amy_Zidian" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review#Amy_Zidian" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, she is in the same exact boat as this, and it will probably not pass. Getting signed to a contract does not mean anything at this point, let's wait and see, WP is not a cyrstal ball. <a href="../../../r/e/n/User%7ERenosecond_03c0.html" title="User:Renosecond">Renosecond</a> 02:59, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
