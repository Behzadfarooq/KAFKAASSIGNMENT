<p>Formed in December 2001, Ecolodge began creating electronic music. The music is poppy beats that involve piano, beeps, clicks, pads, synths and other sweeping sounds.</p>
<p>Typical influences of ecolodge are Solvent, DJ Shadow, Marumari, Boards of Canada, Kraftwerk, and other similar artists.</p>
<p>Most known song is simply titled "XP Mix" which ecolodge manages to use the built-in windows sounds to make a flurry of catchy fast paced windows themes.</p>

<p>Mechanized Death were a hardcore punk group from Montclair, New Jersey. Formed in 1982, disbanded in 1985. They recorded a self-titled cassette tape (1985), produced by R. Stevie Moore. Their name derives from the gory 1961 motor safety film shown in American drivers' ed classes, but also resonates with the anti-war message of punk bands like Discharge (an significant musical influence on the band, as was the seminal NJHC band A.O.D.)and the macabre teen idol cult around James Dean, etc. In true punk DIY spirit, they played few club gigs (Anthrax in Connecticut), preferring to play at public libraries, Unitarian churches, or to organize their own (including the Cro-Mags' first-ever New Jersey show). The Discharge/Cro-Mags/AOD influence resulted in a thick, bassy metal-punk sound: Doron Abrahami (drums), Jonathan Skolnik (guitar), Steve Stadtmauer (vocals, hair), Kenichi Sugihara (bass).</p>

<p>A GreensGroomer is a piece of turf conditioning and grooming equipment. It is used on golf courses as a way to evenly spread topdressings in a quick and effecient manner. It is also used on synthetic fields to keep turf fibers lifted and to spread fill material evenly. It accomplishes this with a set of 14 differently sized brushes that work together to "groom" the turf. The GreensGroomer is usually pulled behind a maitenence cart. GreensGroomer Worldwide, Inc. was created in 1996 and is based out of Indianapolis, IN. It is owned and operated by Mike Davis.</p>

<p>Lepidopterans are 6-legged insect-like aliens. "Stink Fly" is an example of a lepidopteran.Stink Fly is seen on Cartoonetworks animated seiries "Ben 10".Not much is known about lepidopterans.For one thing, they have a foul odor.Thier independently-moving eyes give it enhaced visibility,much like a chameleon.Thier eyes are also capable of shooting a sticky substance.This goo is much like oil,causing any fire on it to explode. Thier large wings give it great aero(flying)capabilities.These wings are very delicate though.Any water on it makes it impossible to fly. The lepidopterans tail is razor-sharp,peircing almost anything.It has four legs, with two arms.The legs are just long points, while the arms have three fingered hands at the end. The lepidopterans intellegence is unknown.Our earthly arthropods have no intelligence, but that can't say the lepidopterans intelligence.No other lepidopterans have been seen on Ben 10, or its planet.We'll just have to wait till its told.</p>

<p>Essay on Topic 1: How do you contribute to solving community problems?</p>
<p>‘Water Warriors of India - Initiative towards Pure and Ample water’</p>
<p>No water or contaminated water is commonplace news in the national or regional dailies of India. Such incidents are termed by newspapers as mismanagement of the government, bureaucrats calls it unfortunate incidents and the governing authorities term it as accident. Whatever the term used it’s the shame to the whole mankind that even being in 21st century, with such high development of technology some of our fellow beings living in certain sections of the society has a threat to ill health and in some cases succumb their lives to shackles of death because of water which itself is the originator of life.</p>
<p>Now, the questions to be asked are:-</p>
<p>Are these water problems beyond hope? No. Can we have ample and pure water? Yes.</p>
<p>Such incidents occur throughout India. Year after year, whether or not the monsoon is officially declared "good", whether or not there is an "official" drought.</p>
<p>Can all of India solve its water (and water-related) problems? Yes.</p>
<p>Self help is the best help, each and every being of the community has to take a step to solve its own problem and the best step to solve water problem is to catch and store water where it falls through ‘Rain water harvesting.’ Rain will usher local food security, from rain will come biomass-wealth that will eradicate ecological poverty. From rain will come social harmony.</p>
<p>Rainwater harvesting is what India can choose, and the youth consortium which will bring paradigm shift in this process will be ‘Water Warriors of India’</p>
<p>It’s an irony that India being surrounded by water bodies on three sides, house of 13 major rivers, largest river island (Majuli), highest rainfall ( Mausingram) and many other facts which reflects India’s dominance in water resources, yet we face shortages every year.</p>
<p>Consider this – the per capita water availability in India was 3450 cu m in 1952. It stands at 1800 cu m now and by estimates by 2025 it will fall to 1200 – 1500 cu m per person.</p>
<p>Even though the rate of urbanization in India is among the lowest in the world, the nation has more than 250 million city-dwellers. Experts predict that this number will rise even further, and by 2020, about 50 per cent of India's population will be living in cities. This is going to put further pressure on the already strained centralized water supply systems of urban areas. The urban water supply and sanitation sector in the country is suffering from inadequate levels of service, an increasing demand-supply gap, poor sanitary conditions and deteriorating financial and technical performance.</p>
<p>Supply of water is highly erratic and unreliable. Transmission and distribution networks are old and poorly maintained, and generally of a poor quality. Consequently physical losses are typically high, ranging from 25 to over 50 per cent. Low pressures and intermittent supplies allow back siphoning, which results in contamination of water in the distribution network. Water is typically available for only 2-8 hours a day in most Indian cities. The situation is even worse in summer when water is available only for a few minutes, sometimes not at all.</p>
<p>Looking at the condition at metro cities of India: Mumbai’s demand for water is expected to rise to 7,970 MLD (million litres daily) by 2011, current supply is 3100 MLD which already constitutes a substantial shortfall as the city receives only 2,500 MLD, the balance lost on account of leakages and pilferage. In the capital itself Delhi the supply of water is around 650 million gallons of water per day against the demand of 750 million.</p>
<p>According to a World Bank study, of the 27 Asian cities with populations of over 1,000,000, Chennai and Delhi are ranked as the worst performing metropolitan cities in terms of hours of water availability per day, while Mumbai is ranked as second worst performer and Calcutta fourth worst</p>
<p>All these was regarding the shortage of water but the analysis remains incomplete if we don’t emphasize on the quality of water available for drinking. Whether the water is potable? The fact is that it is deteriorating fast. As early as in 1982 it was reported that 70 per cent of all available water in India was polluted. The situation is much worse today. There are daily news reports on prime dailies showing the pictures of the contaminated water available in various localities of the city for drinking. The colour of the contaminated water supplied to these areas is worse to urine.</p>
<p>Over extraction of ground water has led to salt water intrusion into coastal aquifers. It has also resulted in problems of excessive fluoride, iron, arsenic and salinity in water affecting about 44 million people in India. Ground water is facing an equally serious threat from contamination by industrial effluent as well as pesticides and fertilizer from farm run-offs. Sanitation and water management should be looked at simultaneously. Too often attention is focused on drinking water supply, leaving sanitation and wastewater treatment for later. However, for every 100 litres of water going into a house about 90 litres will have to leave the plot again. Unless priority is given quickly to creating an infrastructure to assure availability of water, there may be no water to meet the agricultural, domestic and industrial needs of a population that has tripled in 50 years to more than a billion.</p>
<p>Water management in terms of availability and most importantly quality is therefore major challenge not only for town planners, state and central governments but being citizen of the world’s largest democracy it’s our supreme duty to overcome the hurdles regarding the water management and water warriors will take initiative in gratifying this duty.</p>
<p>Water supply is an ‘institutional process’ and an institutional framework for effective water supply and sanitation has to comply with the functions of policy, regulation and sector organization, management of quality, infrastructure and on-site sanitation.</p>
<p>So we discuss about the major issues and their solution concerning institutional options in water problem and sanitation in Indian community, analysis can be further extended to other developing countries: First issue: Water supply should treat to all sections of society, but poor people are neglected Institutions in developing countries dealing with water and sanitation issues have rarely been designed to cater for large numbers of poor people. At the level of operations, public utilities are often constrained by bureaucratic requirements. For instance there is often considerable inflexibility in the management of human resources within public utilities. Given the complexity of the problem in many countries there are a number of separate agencies responsible for wastewater and sanitation, particular in the case of public sector provision. For this, the role of Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as ours, particularly in low cost sanitation, community participation and creating public awareness has to be very positive. In cities, community toilets has to be constructed and managed mainly by NGOs or private firms, based on the ‘user pays’ principle or as a charity. We will be active in raising awareness concerning health, hygiene, slum development, solid waste collection and disposal issue and equitable distribution of facilities. The challenge remains to increase the impact of these initiatives by multiplying them on a larger scale or mainstreaming the approach in the leading institutions for water and sanitation in India. Second issue: Should privatization of water be done and confusion regarding the delegation of roles between public and private sector? An important issue according to this is the division of responsibilities between the government and the private sector. Ideally the government would set the framework, but there is often market failure. Then governments get involved and find it difficult to pull out. Also the type and scale of technology is important and has consequences for the management and financing. The larger the scale, the bigger the financial implications. In that case governments will also be more inclined to involve the private sector. But majority of the public opinion favors water as a common resource while showing reservation about policy that seeks to make water a commodity of the state. Water policies adopted by states like Maharashtra and Rajasthan are being opposed by several groups including the environmentalists. A largely felt perception held by the people is that governments in India are buckling under pressure from the World Bank. These policies, it is felt, help declare water as a state property, which later facilitates its conversion into private property. But is the privatization of water the only viably efficient solution to our shoddy management of water resources? The division between the public and private sector requires answering the question which tasks each one is fulfilling? To ensure effective provision of sanitation services it is imperative to have a good understanding of the roles and responsibilities of every entity (be it public or private) and the technologies used to perform its task. The emergence of the private sector and the users themselves as alternative providers leads to a formulation of a large number of institutional modes for the provision of services with private sector involvement. These modes vary from simple service contract to complete divestiture to the private sector, and a large variety of models for user involvement as owners or in the management. On the other hand we as participants of the youth movement in water through our ways of harvesting water along with water activists, environmentalist and policy makers will work to provide alternatives to water policies so that the government and people are made aware that there are ways other than privatization to manage the country’s water resources. Third issue: Willingness to pay or to contribute for water supply and sanitation is minimal. Effective demand for water and sanitation is often weak if measured by the willingness to pay or contribute to for example the installation of sanitary services. Public demand in context of making payments for water supply and sanitation services systems is low in spite of the high social cost assigned to the polluted sites. The public sector has also become increasingly aware of the high political risk of a significant raise in basic rates for providing these services. Key constituting elements of such systems are appropriate policies, laws and regulations, institutions, technologies and cost recovery systems. There is a need to look for appropriate technological solutions and to involve the people at the preparation and implementation stage. In general the public is interested in getting sanitation facilities, but not very much concerned about the treatment of wastewater or the necessary off plot sanitation facilities. This usually means a limited willingness to pay and a negative attitude towards involving private parties. Water warriors in its programme will organize campaign stressing on bringing water democracy by ensuring that every drop is conserved, harvested and shared by the people. Fourth issue: water supply and waste water management should be looked in an integrated way It is desirable to think of water supply, sanitation and wastewater in an integrated way. This implies that the cost of an integrated solution will be much lower than a solution at a later stage by a separate institution based on different cost recovery system. In big cities dealing with wastewater and offsite sanitation is often integrated. However, in the Indian case we also learn that this tends to be limited to the area of the Municipal Commission, leaving the rest of the city to the development authorities or even district authorities, who tend to have less money and no money raising responsibilities. As a result we at our movement will make government and people aware to manage useable water and waste water with same assiduousness. Fifth issue: there is a need for regulation in the system The need for well-defined roles and responsibilities is clear. It is also necessary to make the institutional arrangements between the municipality and the private sector explicit. There needs to be a regulatory framework and the authorities need to take their responsibility. As public utilities are not usually subject to the disciplines of the market, they have fewer incentives to minimize costs (and maximize tariff collection rates). Regulatory arrangements can stimulate them to look at their cost, for example through a system of benchmarking. The design of an effective institutional framework is a challenge in large metropolitan areas. If not done well, the existence of multiple institutions with primary or secondary responsibilities in sanitation can become a hindrance to effective development and management of sanitation services. A case in point is Bangalore where mandates not only overlap, but have also been defined at different levels, and for different technologies. Here, effective co-ordination is absent, as a result of which the services cannot be run effectively. So, if each section of the society is made aware of its role, such commotion won’t arise at all, this is also an area where water warriors will emphasize. Sixth issue: Finances cannot be ignored Financing is crucial. What is the financial basis for supplying water and sanitation services? Some of the cost recovery mechanisms currently used includes infrastructure charges, connection fees, environmental user fees and local taxes. Raising sufficient revenue to cover for the cost is difficult. As already emphasized, the costs of these services are high and at the same time, the demand is usually little developed and the willingness to pay is low, and lower than that for other services. In addition, enforcement of payment for sanitation and waste water services is difficult, as one cannot simply disconnect as is done with other utilities such power and telecoms. Yet, any sustainable water management initiative must address the key issues of financing and cost recovery. In this context, raising the awareness of the need to have adequate wastewater and sanitation services, of the range of technologies, and of the cost of such services and of the inevitability of cost recovery in return for good service quality is a precondition for effectiveness. User participation is yet another key to success in wastewater services: several urban case studies have shown that willingness to pay is above expected levels in cases where the users have been given a chance to consciously participate in the selection and establishment of the sanitation system. Various cost recovery mechanisms or economic instruments can be applied to recover (at least) the operational cost of urban sanitation and the treatment of wastewater. These include user charges, effluent charges and taxation. There should be provision of 'polluter pays' in which the costs of wastewater management charged to a customer are calculated in function of wastewater quantity and pollution load. Household charges may be uniform and based on an assumed pollution equivalent, or a volumetric rate based on recorded water consumption. High charges may encourage pre-treatment and even process-redesign by industries in an effort to optimize water and wastewater costs. (Too) high charges may also have undesired effects such as illegal discharges inside or outside the wastewater system. So water warriors through advocating such policies will ensure maximizing of utility under the constraints of minimizing cost. The youth consortium of water warriors will cater specifically to all the above concerned issues. Having discussed the current scenario, reasons and the issues and their specific solution regarding the water management in India, now we shift our emphasis on the ways in which an individual or a locality can take measures to solve its own major water problem Urban centres in India are facing an ironical situation today. On one hand there is the acute water scarcity and on the other, the streets are often flooded during the monsoons. This has led to serious problems with quality and quantity of groundwater. This is despite the fact that all these cities receive good rainfall. However, this rainfall occurs during short spells of high intensity. (Most of the rain falls in just 100 hours out of 8,760 hours in a year). Because of such short duration of heavy rain, most of the rain falling on the surface tends to flow away rapidly leaving very little for recharge of groundwater. As water shortage increases, alternative sources of water supply are gaining importance. These include sewage recycle, rainwater harvesting, generating water form humidity in the atmosphere etc. Water recycle through rain water harvesting is a simple, effective and economical solution to conserve water so that more fresh water is available for essential uses drinking, bathing, cooking and laundry. Population, industrialization and pollution are putting pressure on our limited fresh water resource. There is limit to increasing water supply because we are running out of sources and cost of additional facilities is prohibitive. The best way to solve water problem therefore is by conserving water and recycling it wherever possible. Recycling must be made mandatory far all new projects- industrial or domestic and even should be promoted to existing buildings also.</p>
<p>One of the solutions to the urban water crisis and the best way to recycle water is ‘Rainwater Harvesting - capturing the runoff.’ Rain harvesting will be really efficient in areas where there is inadequate groundwater supply or surface resources are either lacking or insufficient, it drastically reduces urban flooding from which our two major cities Mumbai and Chennai suffered drastically last year</p>
<p>Rain water harvesting is an ancient concept, the implementation of it does not requires any major technology and the cost is even low, as compared to the benefits cost should not even be considered. At this juncture it’s worth mentioning the ways in which an individual of the society can take part in such a process.</p>
<p>Rainwater harvesting can be harvested from the following surfaces:</p>
<p>Rooftops: If buildings with impervious roofs are already in place, the catchment area is effectively available free of charge and they provide a supply at the point of consumption. Paved and unpaved areas i.e., landscapes, open fields, parks, storm water drains, roads and pavements and other open areas can be effectively used to harvest the runoff. The main advantage in using ground as collecting surface is that water can be collected from a larger area. This is part of the community project to be undertaken Water bodies: The potential of lakes, tanks and ponds to store rainwater is immense. The harvested rainwater can not only be used to meet water requirements of the city, it also recharges groundwater aquifers. Storm water drains: Most of the residential colonies have proper network of storm water drains. If maintained neatly, these offer a simple and cost effective means for harvesting rainwater.</p>
<p>Rain water though stored will only serve the purpose if properly filtered to meet the major drinking water needs. For this effect major invention in the field has been made which provides proper rain water purification mechanisms. These purification system works on the normal treatment method involving screening, flocculation sedimentation and filtration. These purification systems are also available for micro scale projects to serve the need of a household. Such purification systems are simple in installing and easy to operate. The most important feature is that they don’t require electricity.</p>
<p>Many entrepreneurs of industries tend to forget the fact that they are part of the living society and in turn they tend to foster the production of negative externality. It should be made mandatory for each industry to install water management solutions to recycle its waste water for reuse. Major step in this front is through the development of Industrial effluent recycle solution which integrates physiochemical, biological and membrane separation processes for optimum water recovery. They achieve water management through water recycle and source reduction, and waste management through product recovery and waste minimization. They are cost effective as they recover valuable products for reuse while recycling which gives industries a good return on their investment while protecting the environment and even the common people as it reduces the water usage of industries and transmittance of waste to water bodies.</p>
<p><br />
After emphasizing the ways of tackling the problem through rain water harvesting and other recycling options, the following paragraphs paves the way to the essence of the whole discussion; it illuminates the role of the youth in curbing the problem of such a magnitude which can pose a threat to the very existence of the mankind in this world.</p>
<p>Any amount of government expenditure cannot solve this problem unless and until the community as a whole in its full might rise to the occasion and work for it.</p>
<p>In India the role of youth cannot be under estimated as India in its demography cycle has a position of Young India with more than half of India’s population below the age of 35 years. The youth of the nation has to take part in mass movement of awareness; they have to be the ‘Water warriors of India’ In this approach the youth will be enlightened to serve their locality and curb the water problem. Each locality in city will have its own group of members named as the water warriors whose primary work will be to impart awareness among the residents regarding rain water harvesting. Charity begins at home, so in the first step the members have to set up rain water harvesting system in their respective houses, so that they can put forward examples and other people can replicate these. Water warriors of respective localities will provide assistance in setting up of the system of rain water harvesting. In certain cases possible community projects can be taken as a whole where large tanks are to be constructed to store rain water. Major foray of water warriors will be in water harvesting but it will also simultaneously ensure that water is being properly utilized. The promotion techniques will include the most believable of all- word-of-mouth, apart from other conventional means of imparting awareness such as newspapers, hoarding etc, as water warriors will be a youth forum, the awareness and membership will be imparted through the largest network of World Wide Web. The major question which remained unanswered is that why will any youth join this consortium of water warrior? The answer to this question can be traced from last year experience of major cities of west and south India, which were struck by floods, the irony was that there was water everywhere but there was no water to drink, no water to cook food, no water to survive life. This incident in major way has brought into notice the major problem of water management in our country, and it’s the younger generations who have to foray into the scene, join the consortium and solve the problem simply because of the reason that we are the people who have to destine the future of ours as well as coming generation. It was first time that major important cities of India had confronted such a problem which made youth aware of the reality, and steps has to be taken to overcome the harsh realities of water mismanagement. Among the factors that constrain performance of water management in India are: poor levels of service particularly for sanitation, inadequate pricing policies (poor cost recovery), undue political interference with service provision, highly centralized character of the sector, lack of accountability, lack of continuation in policies and programmes, low levels of productivity and efficiency and inadequate training or management and sector staff. These factors are exacerbated by external factors such as of population growth, urbanization, and economic development that jointly drive a growth in demand that providers fail to cope with. Successful approaches that has to be considered at macro level for policies should be effective decentralization, integration of hygiene and sanitation activities, demand-driven approaches, cost recovery and good governance, and focus on poverty alleviation, equitable distribution of health services, and gender-sensitive approaches. It is heartening to note that in India, the water supply sector is at last moving away from an infrastructure- creation approach to a consolidation approach. But India still needs to make substantial infrastructure is that its growth has not been accompanied by an improvement in the quality of governance of water services in the country and that the water sector suffered from a policy of ‘build- neglect and rebuild’. Therefore, government and its agencies should not merely concern them with fixing pipes but also fixing institutions that fix pipes These were the approaches at macro level but for effective utilization of these policies the work has to start from micro level, from each and every household itself. We as youth through our voice need to create awareness about the importance of water in the community so that mindset, attitudes, and habits change proactively rather than wait for legislation and regulation. Together we must work to see that waste of this precious resource is minimizes and we are able to conserve fresh water for future generations.</p>
<p>There is need to grab the water problem by the scruff of its neck. Enough has been written, discussed about the problem, hardly anybody takes a look at the solution. Residents of the locality blame it on the government; government on the other hand overlooks it as a seasonal or short term problem. Therefore, there is a need of a paradigm shift from problems to the solution, from despair to problem solving, form now to future. This is what the youth movement of water warriors will be about.</p>
<p>The water warrior campaign’s, ultimate goal will be to see a world as an agglomeration of ecological - water harvesting - democracies.</p>
<p>While writing this essay I, myself is gulping marketed mineral water, because the water supply in my locality is not safe for drinking, but after completing the essay it’s assured that we as ‘Water Warriors’ will promise the world of pure and ample water.</p>

Not-for-profit partnership "Russian Trading System "Stock Exchange" was established in 1995 to consolidate separate regional securities trading floors into a unified regulated Russian securities market.</p>
<p>The Exchange used to work on trading and settlement software supplied by NASDAQ. In 1998 the RTS switched to the modern software and hardware system fully developed in-house.</p>
<p>At the beginning the RTS Stock Exchange was offering only the organized OTC stock trading with foreign currency settlement.</p>
<p>Not-for-profit partnership "Russian Trading System "Stock Exchange" lists leading Russian securities that are of great interest to both domestic and foreign portfolio investors, thus providing the industry with the most important market indicators. The RTS establishes efficient market prices for a wide range of stocks and bonds, and the trading information is being distributed worldwide through the largest financial information services companies, such as REUTERS, Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Now the RTS product line includes a wide variety of products and services offered to investors and market participants, such as:</p>
<p>RTS Classic Market – with ruble- and dollar-settlement; RTS T+0 Market (including trading in “Gazprom” stock) – double-auction anonymous market with full preliminary deposition of assets; FORTS – futures and options trading with ruble settlement; RTS Board – the system used for indicative quotation of securities not listed on the RTS. NQS Bills – the system used for indicative quotation of bills issued by Russian companies. By end-2004 more than 300 securities traded on the RTS Stock Exchange, including more than 40 bonds. FORTS (Futures &amp; Options on the RTS) market currently lists 8 futures and 5 option contracts. Indicative quotation systems comprise about 700 stocks and 500 bills issued by Russian companies.</p>
<p>Not-for-profit partnership "Russian Trading System "Stock Exchange" strives to help its customers implement their most diverse investment strategies and timely inform them on the latest market events. Investors using the Exchange can trade stocks, bonds, futures and options (with ruble and foreign currency settlement) in the real-time mode. Internet trading is also available. The RTS has developed a unique electronic documents interchange system (EDI) that significantly reduces risks and minimizes customers' transaction costs.</p>
<p>The RTS Index, the official Exchange indicator first calculated on September 1, 1995, has since become the benchmark in Russian securities' industry. The Index is computed on thirty-minute intervals using real-time prices of the most liquid stocks listed on the Exchange and is relayed to the RTS Web site ( www.rts.ru ), RTS workstations and news agencies.</p>

<p>Guitar strings usually break because of undue wear from the bridge or the nut. If the pattern is a certain string breaking at a certain end, you likely have an issue at that point. File or sand down the bridge or nut.</p>
<p>If you have various strings breaking, you may need to use heavier gauge strings or play softer.</p>

<p>The Hypnosis Motivation Institute, HMI, is a non-profit nationally accredited hypnosis training college and clinic of hypnotherapy that has been serving Southern California for more than 35 years.</p>
<p>John KappasHMI was founded in 1968 by Dr. John Kappas. Dr. Kappas literally defined the profession of hypnotherapy in 1973, when he wrote and defined the profession of a "Hypnotherapist" in the Federal Dictionary of Occupational Titles. That definition remains in force and unchanged today.</p>
<p>Celebrating over 35 years of excellence, HMI has earned the distinction of being America's first hypnotherapy training institution to become nationally accredited, by an accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education, in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>HMI's Hypnotherapy Clinic is home to over 50 Certified Hypnotherapists and serves more than 200 clients a week. HMI estimates that it has provided more than 250,000 hours of private hypnotherapy services in its 38 year history. It is this clinical experience that provides the foundation for HMI's Hypnotherapy Certification Training and Internship program.</p>

<p>Popular slang term for being in a dismal state upon making a large mistake; named after Phil Mickelson's emotional state after losing the 106th U.S. Open at Winged Foot due to a double bogey at the 18th hole, letting Geoff Ogilvy win by 1 stroke at +5.</p>
<p>On the 18th hole, where Mickelson teed off knowing that he could hit bogey for the win, he hit a series of terribly chosen shots to which numerous sports anaylsts referred to as "one of the greatest breakdowns in Majors history". Phil himself said of himself "I am such an idiot" after hitting his putt for double bogey.</p>
<p>The breakdown started with a terrible driver shot off the tee that bounced off the tarp behind the crowd, which most said should have been a long iron or a 3 wood at most. This was followed by a overachieving shot attempting to reach the green in 2, which should have been a simple punch back onto the green to save an easy bogey to force a playoff. The shot hit a elm tree and only went 25 yards remaining in a terrible lie. The 3rd shot landed in a bunker to the left of the green, and from there he hit 3 more shots to hit a double bogey and finished 1 over the lead.</p>

<p>Fattitude, refers to the 'fat' behavior and state of mind, outwardly expressed both socially and physically by person(s) previously hampered by being overweight or obesity. Person(s) experiencing fattitude have a tendency to placing an unreasonable value upon food consumption, one that is considerably larger than that of most normal human beings (also see stoners). However, those experiencing fattitude are not physically fat themselves; their weight problem pertains simply to a mental ailment. Suffers of fattitude are likely to display usual behavior towards food, often suffers crave meat products such as souvlaki's from Stalactites in Melbourne, Australia. Fattitude was first discovered by one M. Pollino, who after undergoing a massive weight reduction found that his symptoms for 'fatness' remained a constant mental battle. Socially, fattitude is preferred over the actual physical presence of carrying excessive weight, fattitude is not visible to the normal being however most person(s) having suffered weight loss will report an unhealthy desire towards food which is for most part incurable. Suffers are also prone to escalating simple signs of respect such as a peck on the cheek to large bouts of double anal, also incurable in fattitude sufferers.</p>

<p>The C-unit is St. Michael's College most famous sporting organization. This publicity has been drawn from the old school beats played at their games - done best by no other than MC Craig Moore.</p>
<p>The team has a hell of alot of stars chokin up the limelight. KiNGPiN 50 MOORE is a dominant figure on centre court - pulling down Shaq posts. Jackway camps on the three - that kids got enough time to cook up a storm on the old camp fire over there. Asian Phil is speedy. Morizzi used to be a hog, but this season he has changed and has become a real c-unit team player. Rosie is Scottish. Dunn - yep Dunn. Big bustling Talanskas takes it to the rim and is pretty much the reason we win every game along with Jackway.</p>

Naydenov created Teximbank in September 1992, the beginning of the post-communist Era. The bank was created by more than 4000 initial shareholders who trusted in Naydenov. It managed to survie both Bulgarian economic Crisis and restored its political and economic independence.</p>

<p>Around 1900 in New Berlin, Ohio, a department-store worker named J.M.Spangler invented a device which he called an electric sucion sweeper<i>Italic text</i>.The device became very popular and could have been known as a spangler<i>Italic text</i>.People could have been spanglering<i>Italic text</i>their floors .The use could have extended to a whole style of behaviour called spanglerism<i>Italic text</i>.However, none of that happened. Instead, Mr. Spangler sold his invention to a local businessman called William Hoover whose Hoover Suction Sweeper Company produced the first "Hoover".The words hoover<i>Italic text</i>and hoovering<i>Italic text</i>become familiar all over the world.The point of this small tale is that,although you had never heard of Mr. Spangler before, you can very quickly understand a new word in your language ( a neologism <b>Bold text</b>)and accept the use of different forms of thet new word.</p>

<p>The invention of totally new terms is known as coinage<b>Bold text</b>.There are several interesting examples of this process:aspirin<i>Italic text</i>,nylon<i>Italic text</i>,zipper<i>Italic text</i>,kleenex<i>Italic text</i>,teflon<i>Italic text</i>and xerox<i>Italic text</i>.</p>

<p>The process of taking over of words from other languages is known as borrowing<b>Bold text</b>.The English language has adopted a vast number of loan-words from other languages,e.g.alcohol<i>Italic text</i>( Arabic),piano<i>Italic text</i>(Italian),yogurt<i>Italic text</i>( Turkish),croissant<i>Italic text</i>(French). A special type of borrowing is known as loan-translation<b>Bold text</b>or calque<b>Bold text</b>.During this process, there is a direct translation of the elements of a word into the borrowing language e.g. un gratte-ciel<i>Italic text</i>is a French term which literally translates as " a scrape-sky"; in English this word is refered to as a skyscraper<i>Italic text</i>.The examples of direct translation are: perros calientes <i>Italic text</i>(Spanish, literally " dogs hot")or hod dogs<i>Italic text</i>;boyifurendo (Japanese)from boyfriend .</p>

<p>A joining of two separate words to produce a single form is known as compounding<b>Bold text</b>.It is very common in languages like German and English, but much less common in languages like French and Spanish.Obvious English examples would be bookcase<i>Italic text</i>(book+case),textbook<i>Italic text</i>(text+book),wastebasket<i>Italic text</i>(waste+basket).</p>

<p>Taking only the beginning of one word and joining it to the end of other word is known as blending<b>Bold text</b>e.g. gasohol<i>Italic text</i>(gasoline, alcohol) , smog <i>Italic text</i>( smoke, fog), brunch <i>Italic text</i>(breakfast, lunch).</p>

<p>It is a process during which a word of more than one syllable is is reduced to a shorter form, often in casual speech e.g. ad<i>Italic text</i>(advertisement), sitcom<i>Italic text</i>( situation comedy), gas <i>Italic text</i>(gasoline).</p>

<p>It is a process during which a word of one type ( usually noun 0 is reduced to a form of a different type (usually a verb) e.g. television<i>Italic text</i>(n) - televise<i>Italic text</i>(v), donation<i>Italic text</i>- donate<i>Italic text</i>. A particular type of backformation produces forms technically known as hypocorisms<b>Bold text</b>. In their production a longer word is reduced to a single syllable, then -y<i>Italic text</i> or -ie<i>Italic text</i>is added to the end, e.g. bookie<i>Italic text</i>("bookmaker").</p>

<p>This process is connected with affixes. Affixes<b>Bold text</b>are small units of words which cannot stand separately in the sentence, but which can be attach to other words in order to produce new words e.g.un-<i>Italic text</i>,mis-<i>Italic text</i>, pre-<i>Italic text</i>.</p>

<p>Preffixes<b>Bold text</b> are a type of affixes which we add at the beginning of a word e.g. un-<i>Italic text</i>. Suffixes <b>Bold text</b> are a type of affixes which we add at to the end of a word e.g.-ish<i>Italic text</i>.</p>

<p>Several different processes occur one after another e.g.deli<i>Italic text</i>- delicatessen<i>Italic text</i>(borrowing)- then clipping that borrowed form. Besides this processes there is another one process in word-formation processes-analogy.Analogy<b>Bold text</b>forms new words which are similar in some way to existing ones e.g. hippie<i>Italic text</i>-yipppie<i>Italic text</i>.</p>

The story is set in what you can call a cyperpunk world. Sue is assigned to a former military man named Ryuu Feye Kazuhiko as a "delivery" of a top secret item. The number of a clover that is assigned to some one is considered a measurement of a persons power's. Sue's clover is a 4 leaf making her a valuable and extremely dangerous person if given to the wrong hands The Clover manga is 4 volumes and is still considered unfinished by many.</p>

<p>Laeto formed in 1998 in Dundee, Scotland in 1998 while all members of the band were attending Dundee University. The first show was played on Valentines Day, Feb 1998, with Snow Patrol. Kevin Black (Bass) left the band less than a month later, and was temporarily replaced by Alex Botten (ex-Maps of Jupiter, ex-Neurola, ex-Magnetic North Pole and currently Thee Moths). Black rejoined and Botten departed approximately 3 months later.</p>
<p>Laeto played frequently around Scotland, alongside local and touring bands (such as Fugazi, Bluetip, At the Drive-In, Oxes, Les Savy Fav, Idlewild). Laeto toured the UK with Idlewild in Sept/Oct 1999 and immediately afterwards recorded a debut album (with engineer Michael Brennan) for release on UK independent Guided Missile Records. The debut album 'Make us Mild' was released in May 2000 to mostly favourable reviews.</p>
<p>The follow-up album 'Zwoa' was recorded over the space of 18 months by Robin Sutherland in Dundee and was released on Glasgow independent 'Too Many Fireworks Records' in August 2004 and illustrated the progression that Laeto had made in the 4 year interim, with a more rock approach as opposed to their mainly instrumental 'post-rock' beginnings.</p>
<p>Laeto is currently writing for their 3rd album (as yet untitled), planned for release in Spring 2007</p>

<p>Nikolai Astrup lived from 1880-1928, grew up in Ålhus as son of a priest and is supposed to be the most famous painter from Western Norway. Many of his pictures show the landscape of Jølster where he lived. Several of his pictures have later been sold for high prices in the big auction halls in Europe. But during his life time, the artist often swapped his paintings in food.</p>
<p>When he decided to become an artist, he did this against his fathers wish, who wanted him to become a priest like himself. After going to a religious school in Trondheim, he went to drawing school in Oslo (at that time called Kristiania), and studied afterwards art in Germany and France, as a student of Christian Krohg, where he was influenced by among others Henri Rousseau and Paul Gauguin.</p>
<p>From 1902 he lived in Jølster again, where he married and had many children. In 1912 he and his family moved to a small farm at the lake Jølstravatnet. Today, this farm called Astruptunet is a museum about Nikolai Astrup including a gallery showing his works.</p>
<p>Astrup had asthma and abused alcohol all his life. He died of pneumonia, only 47 years old.</p>

<p><b>-Bioinformatics and Assays Development Program</b> A critical area of focus for DHS is the protection of the homeland from the release of a biological agent as demonstrated by systems such as the currently deployed BioWatch surveillance system. Under solicitation RA03-01, HSARPA has recently initiated a program to develop new sensor technologies to significantly enhance the BioWatch system while simultaneously reducing its cost of operation (see www.hsarpabaa.com for details about this past solicitation). As a complement to the technology program initiated under RA03-01, HSARPA is initiating the Bioinformatics and Assays Development (BIAD) program to extend the existing family of detection and forensics assays as well as to develop next generation assays and new tools for assay development. The BIAD program will facilitate a number of HSARPA’s goals, including:</p>
<p>Enabling future enhancements to existing detection systems; Enabling new types of detection systems; Supplementing our current family of confirmatory assays; Supplementing our current family of forensic assays; Creating next generation assays which are robust against novel and engineered threats; Creating new bioinformatics tools; Characterizing and increasing sample extraction efficiencies. <a href="http://www.hsarpabaa.com/main/BAA0403_solicitation_notice.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.hsarpabaa.com/main/BAA0403_solicitation_notice.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hsarpabaa.com/main/BAA0403_solicitation_notice.htm</a></p>
<p><b>-Automated Scene Understanding</b> This BAA addresses a general class of problem that is becoming more acute as the nation deploys sensors and security networks in response to the global war on terrorism. Multiple governmental organizations are deploying sensors, such as closed circuit television (CCTV), specialized video and infrared cameras, radars, and other sensors to provide physical security and general awareness at critical infrastructure, transportation hubs, borders and border entry points and our ports and harbors. In parallel, private industry, more acutely aware of the threats to physical security, is installing large numbers of security networks, many based on CCTV systems, at buildings, industrial sites and other key locations. With the introduction of these sensors, the volume of data (in terms of video screens, alarms, tracks, etc.) is far outstripping the number of operators available to monitor the data. In addition, combinations of different types of sensors, such as CCTV, thermal imaging, beacons, and radars are also appearing at such locations. Today, the fusion of data and information from these different modalities must be done by the operator, further expanding his or her workload, and increasing the chances of the systems being ignored or being ineffective. The problem will get dramatically worse in the coming years as governmental agencies and industries continue to invest in security monitoring sensors through the wide application of various security grants. <a href="http://www.hsarpabaa.com/main/BAA0405_solicitation_notice.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.hsarpabaa.com/main/BAA0405_solicitation_notice.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hsarpabaa.com/main/BAA0405_solicitation_notice.htm</a></p>

<p><b>-Advanced Container Security Device</b> The objective of the HSARPA Advanced Container Security Device Program is to provide the next generation of maritime shipping container security device with multiple sensing modalities, “smart” condition monitoring, automated alerting, and advanced communications. This effort is intended to supplement those by taking a slightly longer design period to look ahead at the next generation of “smart” containers. Primary emphasis is on assuring the physical security of the container including the breaching of the container through the sides and status of any seals or locks. Secondary emphasis is on detection of certain prohibited cargoes, internal ambient conditions, manipulation or change of state of the contents, and the recording of a “smart” history of the container interactions. The device must survive the rigors of intermodal transportation, especially the marine environment. <a href="http://www.hsarpabaa.com/main/BAA0406_solicitation_notice.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.hsarpabaa.com/main/BAA0406_solicitation_notice.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hsarpabaa.com/main/BAA0406_solicitation_notice.htm</a></p>
<p><b>-Innovative Architectures for Unified Incident Command and Decision Support (UICDS)</b> The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) seeks proposals for an innovative information management and sharing architecture that answers the growing needs of the emergency responder community. This solicitation seeks to confront the technical challenges associated with the development of such an innovative, modular, scaleable, and secure information management architecture. A system based on this architecture should allow incident commanders to capture important incident-related information, analyze captured information, more effectively disseminate mission critical information to emergency responders, present decision guidance options for incident commanders, more finely coordinate the efforts of emergency responders, and store relevant information for future study. The overarching benefit of such a system should be a highly enhanced situational awareness for individual emergency responders and emergency responder teams that contribute to the overall success of a mission. <a href="http://www.hsarpabaa.com/main/BAA0414_solicitation_notice.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.hsarpabaa.com/main/BAA0414_solicitation_notice.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hsarpabaa.com/main/BAA0414_solicitation_notice.htm</a></p>
<p><b>-Instantaneous Bio-Aerosol Detector Systems (IBADS)</b> A critical area of focus for DHS is the protection of the homeland from the release of a biological agent as demonstrated by the currently deployed BioWatch surveillance system. In FY04 HSARPA initiated two critical bio-sensor development initiatives under the Detection Systems for Biological and Chemical Countermeasures (DSBCC) Program, RA03-01. The Bioagent Autonomous Networked Detectors (BAND) and the Rapid Automated Biological Identification System (RABIS) initiated under RA03-01 will provide a cost effective, robust capability for continuous monitoring for a broad range of potential bio-aerosol threats with very high sensitivity and specificity. As a complement to the technology programs initiated under RA03-01, HSARPA is initiating the Instantaneous Bio-Aerosol Detector Systems (IBADS) program which seeks to develop, test and transition the next generation of rapid bio-aerosol sensors for use in Detect-to-Protect system architectures.

<p><b>-Low Vapor Pressure Chemicals Detection Systems (LVPCDS) Program</b> The goal of the HSARPA Low Vapor Pressure Chemicals Detection Systems (LVPCDS) Program is to develop, field-test, and transition to commercialization existing, state-of-the-art and next generation systems that can detect toxic compounds having low vapor pressures (= 10-4 Torr) without coming in contact with the contaminated surface. The DHS S&amp;T Directorate has identified two high priority requirements as Technical Topic Areas (TTAs) to be addressed in this solicitation (These TTAs are described in greater detail in Section 4, “LVPCDS Program Goals”): The LVPCDS Program will facilitate a number of DHS goals, including: Enabling novel and cost effective enhancements to existing detection systems for rapid deployment; Development of next generation detection systems providing superior performance, ease of operation, and cost; and Development of revolutionary technologies, subsystems or components with significant impact on cost and/or performance of existing or next generation detection systems. <a href="http://www.hsarpabaa.com/main/BAA0410_solicitation_notice.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.hsarpabaa.com/main/BAA0410_solicitation_notice.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hsarpabaa.com/main/BAA0410_solicitation_notice.htm</a></p>
<p><b>-Innovative New Materials for Personal Protective Equipment</b> This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) addresses a need that is becoming more serious as the nation’s emergency responder community prepares to combat the results of future terrorist attacks – highly innovative/revolutionary protective materials and materials systems that can be used by emergency responders and Homeland Security Operations professionals in multi-hazard environments. Many of the requirements presented in Section 3 have been derived from Project Responder1. The R&amp;D efforts, however, are not limited to the basic guidelines provided in Project Responder2. As we continue to assess operations resulting from terrorist or other mass destruction/mass casualty incidents, other national level guidelines will apply. Cross referencing applicable requirement and concept of operations documentation is encouraged and will be assessed as part of the proposal evaluation process. This is a dynamic environment with rapidly changing and emerging requirements. It is incumbent upon all participants in this R&amp;D process to ensure that the collective R&amp;D initiatives are responsive to improving protection against traditional and emerging hazards, and are applicable to a wide range of Emergency Responder (ER) and Homeland Security Operations (HLS Ops) professionals. <a href="http://www.hsarpabaa.com/main/BAA0501_solicitation_notice.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.hsarpabaa.com/main/BAA0501_solicitation_notice.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hsarpabaa.com/main/BAA0501_solicitation_notice.htm</a></p>
<p><b>-Advanced Spectroscopic Portal Monitors</b> A critical area of focus for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is the development of Advanced Spectroscopic Portal (ASP) Monitors that improve our capability to address the threat of a Radiological Dispersal Device (RDD), an Improvised Nuclear Device (IND), or a nuclear weapon being used by terrorists within the US. DHS is implementing a comprehensive systems approach that emphasizes early detection and effective intervention capabilities at the Federal, state, and local levels, as well as post-event capabilities for remediation.

DHS S&amp;T has developed a set of maritime surveillance requirements that, if satisfied, will greatly aid in performing this mission. Pursuant to accomplishing this goal, DHS S&amp;T is currently conducting a study to identify candidate platform and radar sensor technologies that together comprise a cost effective solution to persistent wide area maritime surveillance capable of detecting, tracking and discriminating surface vessels 25 feet and larger from 12 to 120 NM offshore. This study effort is a precursor to a possible follow on effort to conduct an integrated research, development, test and evaluation program that demonstrates a persistent, wide-area surveillance (WAS) radar capability to the U.S. Coast Guard. <a href="http://www.hsarpabaa.com/main/RFI-Radar.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.hsarpabaa.com/main/RFI-Radar.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hsarpabaa.com/main/RFI-Radar.htm</a></p>
<p><b>-New Standard VHS Videocasette Recorders (VCR) for Forensic Video Requirements</b> The commercial market for video recorders is moving to newer digital technology. However, in security applications low cost VHS recorders are still very common and will remain so as long as they are serviceable. This results in many VHS recordings that continue to be analyzed by forensic labs to recover images relevant to criminal investigations. Unfortunately, manufacturers are no longer making the higher quality players that are used in forensic labs to recover these recordings. Labs desire to replace their heavily used equipment, but are becoming less and less successful finding suitable replacements and are thus operating with lower quality equipment. What is needed is a high quality, robust video cassette player that will reliably playback the low quality, overused recordings on low-cost tape produced by poorly maintained VCRs that are so typically received from the average security system at a crime scene. <a href="http://www.hsarpabaa.com/main/RFI-VHS.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.hsarpabaa.com/main/RFI-VHS.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hsarpabaa.com/main/RFI-VHS.htm</a></p>
<p><b>-Single Pricing Structure for Global Connectivity to Cellular Data Services To Support Marine Asset Tag Tracking System (MATTS) Communications</b> The Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) of the Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&amp;T) issues this Request for Information (RFI) regarding a scalable pricing structure of cellular data services with highly reliable global connectivity for the Marine Asset Tag Tracking System (MATTS - H-SB04.1-005) devices. MATTS is a multi-modal communication gateway for Advance Container Security Devices (ACSD - HSARPA BAA 04-06), capable of providing global remote communications and tracking information for a container and is applicable to in-bond shipments. As applied to this operational concept, utilizing cellular services, while technically feasible, is not economically practical worldwide due to the current pricing structures, account administration, and roaming agreements employed by cellular service providers. Innovative and alternate strategies in these areas are sought. <a href="http://www.hsarpabaa.com/main/RFI-GCCDS.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.hsarpabaa.com/main/RFI-GCCDS.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hsarpabaa.com/main/RFI-GCCDS.htm</a></p>

<p><b>Tony's Handymen &amp; Construction</b> Tony’s Handymen &amp; Construction start of business was in 1999 known as Tony’s Handymen in Fresno California, as a handymen repair company. It soon grew into a licensed contractor, participating in private and public contracts. The corporation developed an excellent construction team as a licensed Construction Contractor, The Corporation specializes in heating, ventilation, air conditioner units (HVAC), and opened a subsidiary constructor corporation providing construction clean up on residential and commercial property and it is also a design corporation known as Abiathar Design &amp; Cleaning. In 2006 the corporation branched out into maintenance and cleaning contracts for maintenance repairs, replacement, and selling parts. The contracts are highly successful, and utilized by home sellers in California to boost property sales, by offering a cleaning service to the new buyer.</p>

<p>Patricia Jordan Weathington, Tony’s Handymen &amp; Constructions C.E.O started the corporation after the start of two other corporations, a for profit corporation, and not for profit corporation. With a few failed attempts in business, and meeting great controversy with nurse’s disloyalty and lack of business knowledge may have contributed to the faithlessness in the first union or any type of union for Individual Nurse Providers and the Department of Health Services (D.H.S), unwillingness to license a Private Duty Nurses Agency. Patricia Jordan’s dreams of uniting nurses as contractors were dashed. The unsuccessful attempt was related to the previous Medicare reform that forced the larger surviving Home Health Agencies to become controlling and forcing smaller agencies out of business, or severely deterring a new business from starting in the Home Health Agency industry. For good reason the health care industry was and still is currently against nurses uniting in the Home Health industry and starting a new Florence night and Gayle trend. Nurses that are competitive or a competitors are not good employees of any Home Health Agency.</p>

<p>Before Patricia entered into the health care industry the Medicare cost of the industry had sky rocketed in this industry in the 1990’s, before the Medicare reform. And only the larger and older Home Heath Agencies were able to survive the Medicare reform in the 1990’s. Over 300 Home Health Agencies were forced to close its doors to its patients, because of the reform. Patricia had entered into an industry under reconstruction, and quickly learned the Florence night and Gayle days were gone. Large corporations now owned the industry, and were not willing for nurses to amalgamate, and pilfer the corporation’s patients, or the 60 billion dollar Home Health Medicare remuneration. D.H.S soon wanted a list of all the nurses listed inside of the union. Which the young willing C.E.O gave D.H.S.</p>

<p>D.H.S soon had meetings with the nurses training and teaching the nurses the Home Health industry D.H.S acknowledged the nurses as 1099 employees, which this concept had been stated through out the Home Health industry as taboo. D.H.S would now have a preferred list of 1099 employees to provide Home Health services at a less expensive and cost effective way of providing Medicare patients with Home Health services through its Individual Nurse Provider network, which had been quickly taken from the young C.E.O. In 2005 D.H.S started a controversial referral list for patients who were seeking to hire their own nurses, unsatisfied, not referred to, or attempting to take their nurses from a licensed Home Health Agency, In some cases through the D.H.S list the customers or patients were helping the nurses pilfer the Home Health Agencies patients with out incurring penalties from the Home Health Agency that employed the nurses. D.H.S list is not known in 2006 to be a Private Duty Nurses Agency (P.D.N.A) or Home Health Agency, but has the markings of a P.D.N.A.</p>

<p>The 30 year old Patricia had turned her thoughts and energy years before the dissolution of the union or network into becoming a licensed Home Health Agency, and building a construction Contractor Corporation. The construction contractor industry was welcoming of the start of a new business related to the demand of building. The C.E.O provided simple handymen services, with contracts with property management firms. As of 2006 the 35 year old Patricia Jordan Weathington is the successful and proud owner of a construction cleaning corporation, and licensed construction contractor corporation, which specializes in the sales, repair, replacement, and maintenance of heating, ventilation, and air conditioners. During this interview in March 2006 Patricia or as she likes to be called Pat, seemed hopeful of Tony’s Handymen &amp; Construction and Abiathar design &amp; cleaning corporations success in construction. She even expressed interest in cleaning up and providing HVAC units to the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina. But she stated “The corporation is on a list in 2006 with the US Army Corps of engineers and F.E.M.A with other contractors more than willing to locate an office in the disaster area”. The elated Patricia Jordan Weathington C.E.O has left her abortive attempts in the past. She contributes success and failures as the life of a young entrepreneur attempting to get a niche in any industry. Her survival in business seems to be, because of the endeavors of the young entrepreneurs’ ability to adapt and the ability to overcome obstacles placed in many industries to keep the fragile, insubstantial, and inadequate out. She clearly stated “In 1993 I prepared myself for this rough road ahead of me by enlisting in the United States Army for 8 years, where as an African American female I learned skills to overcome obstacles set before me, and keep a positive attitude while doing it”.</p>

<p>Pat envisions the corporation going public within the next 5 years. Where she feels she will be warmly welcomed, because investors love making money by the hard work and accelerated thoughts of the young entrepreneurs. I asked her did she feel Tony’s Handymen &amp; Construction or Abiathar design &amp; cleaning will endure time in this industry. Pat looked at me and laughed, then stated “Are you serious, of course it will survive. Construction’s a welcoming industry the licensed contractors are the industry rather it’s an individual that’s licensed wanting to provide food on the table for one family, or a corporation giving jobs to many that provide food on the table to many families. As the contractor grow, develop, repair, design, and create the world. The contractor creates a strong enduring construction company. We are licensed contractors regardless if we make enough to only feed our family, or feed thousands of our employees’ families, and make investors prosperous, we will survive in this industry”. Pat feels if she receives enough federal, state, private contracts, and consumers using Tony’s Handymen &amp; Constructions’ many contractor services the corporation will remain stable.</p>

<p><b>Big Daddy</b> is John Mellencamp's tenth studio album released in 1989 on Mercury Records. The album peaked at number seven on the Billboard 200 and contained the singles <i>Pop Singer</i> and <i>Jackie Brown</i> which peaked at number fifteen and forty eight respectively on the Billboard Hot 100. A re-mastered version of the album was released on May 24, 2005 and it contains a bonus track which is an acoustic version of <i>Jackie Brown</i>. Like <b>The Lonesome Jubilee</b>, Big Daddy is folk-inspired as violins and fiddles (among other instruments) are significantly utilized on a number of tracks. The album's lyrics largely take a serious tone and the album as a whole is regarded by some as Mellencamp's most reflective.</p>
<p>Mellencamp continues his pattern of social commentary used on <b>The Lonesome Jubilee</b> on a number of tracks on the album. <i>Jackie Brown</i> addresses the issue of poverty and stimulates images of the hardships faced by those living in poverty. A lyric in the song's final verse which reads "...But who gives a damn about Jackie Brown? Just another lazy man who couldn't take what was his" seems to indicate that Mellencamp believes the issue of poverty to be correlated to the general public and the reluctance to show interest in developing resolutions. <i>Country Gentleman</i> is another social commentary addressing Ronald Reagan's presidency and policies. In the song, Mellencamp continually states that it is not Reagan's interest to help the poor, but rather only his "rich friends". <i>J.M.'s Question</i> is a broad social commentary addressing many diverse issues prevalent in the United States including the contamination of the environment and violence stemming from the constitutional right to bear arms among other issues. <i>Void In My Heart</i> is reflective song regarding Mellencamp's position as an acclaimed singer and as one who has worked hard to make it but still he confesses "There's a void in my heart I can't seem to fill". <i>Big Daddy of Them All</i> is the account of a parental authority figure whose selfish womanizing ways have led to his downfall. <i>Martha Say</i> is an account of an stubbornly independent woman whose ways lead Mellencamp to caution her to "look out". The album takes a less serious tone on two tracks, the first of which titled <i>Pop Singer</i> is a clarification of Mellencamp's identity (he sings that he "never wanted to be no pop singer"). The song seems to describe Mellencamp's evolution from a young man who was manipulated by former manager Tony DeFries in the late 1970's into a stong-minded, independent musician. <i>Let It All Hang Out</i> is the second less serious song and is a cover of the Hombres; it was unlisted on the original album's packaging.</p>

<p>Born on November 7, 1989, Mary Ellen Knight began her life in the Music City Capital of America - Nashville, Tennessee. Unlike most girls, Mary liked to "rough" it, playing with her brothers most of the time and acting like an absolute tomboy. However, as the years went by, Mary became much more interested in the field of science. In fact, she finished a five-hundred page book on the life and history of a neurologist named Ben Carson when she was only in the second grade. It changed her life, and it was apparent by the fifth grade that her goals were set on the medical field. By the ninth grade, she was participating in the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Medical Explorers program, which she attended every other wednesday during the school year. When asked about the experience, mary said, "I just want to love my life doing good things for other people. This experience has opened my eyes so much, and I am determined to become a doctor and save lives." Not long after this program ended, mary went on to pursue another learning experience called St. Thomas science Scholars. "It was an enriching experience," she said, "and I wouldn't have traded anything for it." The coming summer, she took part in the Vanderbilt Research Internship Program. "I just wanted to learn more about what I can do today, right now, in the real world," Mary stated.</p>
<p>She currently lives with her mother, father, and younger brother.</p>

<p>The Church's unremarkable Victorian exterior is deceptive. The Church of St. John the Baptist was founded in 689 by King Æthelred of <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercia.html" title="Mercia">Mercia</a>. In the 10th century the church was enlarged as part of the renovation of the Roman fortress of Chester. In 1069 Peter de Leia, <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop.html" title="Bishop">Bishop</a> of <a href="../../../l/i/c/Lichfield.html" title="Lichfield">Lichfield</a> moved his seat to Chester after describing Lichfield as a "sordid and desrt place" He set about building a Cathedral on the site of Æthelred's humble church. The Cathedral Church was laid out on the classic plan of <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_Architecture_bdb6.html" title="Norman Architecture">Norman</a> Cathedrals, with its <a href="../../../n/a/v/Nave.html" title="Nave">nave</a>, its side aisles, terminating in two low towers, its central lantern <a href="../../../t/o/w/Tower.html" title="Tower">tower</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transepts.html" title="Transepts">transepts</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choir.html" title="Choir">choir</a>. Around the choir, in later years, were to spring up the chauntry chapels, of which the ruins remain today.</p>
<p>For a few years the work proceeded rapidly; the choir was built, the great tower arches were turned and the nave arcading erected. Then, in 1082, Bishop Peter de Leia died and was laid to rest in the unfinished choir of the church.Bishop Peter's successor, Robert de Limesey, was less enthusiastic about the project and about the situation of Chester in general. and moved his seat to Coventry where he commisioned work on the Old <a href="../../../c/o/v/Coventry_Cathedral_cbf3.html" title="Coventry Cathedral">Coventry Cathedral</a>. After the move, work on the Cathedral was largely abandoned, the nave was open to the air for nearly a century until around 1190. It was at this time that unknown builders resumed work, and did not approach a state of completion until sometime in the late 13th century, whereupon St. John's became a Collegiate Church. Nearly four and a half centuries were to pass before Chester would have it's own Cathedral. This time it would be the former Benedictine Abbey of St. Werburgh, re-dedicated to St. Mary the Blessed Virgin and Christ the King. Thus saving the building from the dissolution of the monasteries.</p>
<p>It is difficult to tell weather it was the materials used in the construction of St. John's or its long exposure to the elements, the buiding suffered a series of catasrophic collapses. The central tower collapsed in 1468 and again in 1562 and was never rebuilt. This was shortly followed by the collapse of the West Tower in 1574 destroying four bays of the nave. The tower was rebuilt but fell again in 1881, crushing the Early English porch.</p>
<p>In 1547 St. John's was reduced in status from a Collegiate Church to an ordinary Parish Church. The lead was stripped from the roof of the chior. The east end soon became disused to the extent that a wall was errected to seal the east end off from the rest of the church. The 14th century ruins of which can stil be seen to this day.</p>

<p>Established in 1984 by founder and CEO Dr. Stanley M. Hyduke, Aldec, Inc. is a self-funded, privately held organization that continues to deliver high quality, performance-driven EDA products. Dr. Hyduke's 42 years in the industry provide him with a unique knowledge and understanding of the trends and technologies that will most benefit hardware engineers. Because of this clear focus, Aldec has evolved into one of the best-known names in design verification.</p>
<p>Since 1997, Aldec has been focused on providing easy-to-use VHDL and Verilog design entry and simulation products to support programmable logic designers; its products were well accepted by customers who were transitioning from schematic-based design to a mixed schematic/HDL environment and pure HDL code.</p>
<p>With the density of FPGA/CPLD devices continuously growing, ASIC designers are beginning to utilize FPGA/CPLDs for prototyping and finished products. Responding to this need, Aldec has added a new line of hardware/software co-verification products utilizing hard and softcore processors to address the market requirements for new verification methodologies.</p>
<p>Aldec's industry-proven, common kernel HDL simulation technology supports all operating systems (Window, Linux and UNIX) for both 32 and 64 bit configurations. In addition to traditional, high-performance HDL support, Aldec also supports SystemC™, SystemVerilog™, Assertions (OVA, SVA and PSL), hardware acceleration and co-verification from a single design platform.</p>
<p>Aldec provides a broad spectrum of HDL verification tools to support every market segment, ranging from entry-level HDL users who target low density FPGAs to users requiring high performance tools for Assertion-based verification designs, as well as hardware-based acceleration and co-verification methodologies to best meet their time to market requirements.</p>
<p>Aldec continues to deliver the highest mixed simulation performance for all market segments.</p>
<p>Focus: Aldec provides highly-integrated solutions for the design engineering community by supporting new methodologies that speed the overall design verification process. The company has developed a world-class simulator that addresses users' requirements for common kernel simulation, in addition to supporting new design verification methodologies that include SystemC™, SystemVerilog, Assertions-based Verification (ABV), hardware acceleration and co-verification from a single platform.</p>
<p>Current Products: Active-HDL™ - Supports FPGA/CPLD and ASIC designs; used for developing VHDL, Verilog, SystemC, SystemVerilog or mixed designs on the Windows operating system. Active-HDL is an integrated, easy-to-use product that offers complete design entry, debugging and simulation.</p>
<p>Riviera™ - Operating under Windows, Linux and UNIX, this common kernel mixed VHDL, Verilog, SystemC, SystemVerilog and Assertion-based simulator is used by customers developing FPGA/CPLDs and ASICs. Riviera offers extensive regression test capabilities and supports other leading third-party tools through its PLI and VHPI interfaces.</p>
<p>HES™ (Hardware Embedded Simulation) - A unified acceleration solution that dramatically reduces RTL and netlist-level simulations of ASIC and FPGA designs. VHDL, Verilog, SystemC, SystemVerilog, Assertions, IP Cores and EDIF netlists are accelerated within any industry-standard HDL simulator. HES's patented acceleration methodology lies in partitioning the design between the software simulator and the PCI acceleration board. Portions of the design are offloaded from the software simulator while maintaining full visibility into signal in hardware. Automated design partitioning and multiple clock domain handling simplify implementation of entire designs or specific modules into hardware. Options include coverification of ARM® embedded systems and protoyping mode with Xilinx® ChipScope® Pro support.</p>
<p>Current Industries Supported: Over 3,000 commercial companies, as well as 1,500 accredited academic facilities, utilize Aldec's design entry and mixed language simulation tools to expedite their design and verification cycles. Aldec's customers vary in industry from Telecom, Industrial, Military and Space Agency, Consumer Electronics and IP development companies. Aldec's products provide innovation and functionality to every market segment, and as customers' requirements for high level verification tools grow, so does Aldec's breadth of product offerings and technology.</p>
<p>Number of Employees: Aldec currently employs well over 200 sales, support and engineering professionals worldwide with direct offices located in the U.S., Canada, China and Europe.</p>
<p>Patents Held: (Dr. Stanley M. Hyduke) US Patent# Description 5,479,355 System and Method for a Closed Loop Operation of Schematic Designs with Electrical Hardware 6,578,133 MIMD Array of Single Bit Processors for Processing Logic Equations in Strict Sequential Order. 5,051,938 Simulation of Selected Logic Circuit Designs 4,827,427 Instantaneous Incremental Compiler for Producing Logic Circuit Designs 4,791,357 Electronic Circuit Board Testing System and Method</p>

<p>Guglielmo Oberdan, an Italian nationalist and deserter from the Austrian imperial army, plotted an assasination attempt on the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph in 1882. That year, the Emperor was paying a visit to the Italian-majority city of Trieste, a city which was both a hotbed for Italian irredentists, as well as beholden to the honorific title of <i>urbs fidelissima</i> (faithful city) for its non-participation in the revolutions of the 1840s. After Oberdan's plot was revealed, the Emperor's notion of the fidelity of Trieste was forever tarnished. Oberdan was sentenced to hang, crying "Viva Italia!" before doing so, and as Italy's honor "hung in the noose" with Oberdan, he instantly became a martyr. Statues of him shortly sprang up in towns and cities throughout unified Italy. The subsequent assasination of Archduke Ferdinand in 1914, and the revival of irredentism that followed, harked back to Oberdan's earlier attempt.</p>

<p>Brimsen (slovakian: <i>Bryndza</i>) is a soft white cheese made from sheep`s milk or a mix of sheep`s and cow`s milk. Very common in Eastern Austria, Slovakia and Romania. It is white and unaged, similar to cream cheese, quark, pot cheese or ricotta.</p>
<p>Brimsen has its origins in Romania and was brought to Slovakia somewhere between the 14th and 16th centuries by Walachian settlers. It became popular in Slovakia in the 18th century and soon spread to the neighbor regions.</p>
<p>Brimsen is made by letting lactic acid bacteria (sometimes also rennet or citric acid) ferment milk, with the resulting soft cheese. Then it is drained, salted and filled into wooden containers and sold as fresh as possible. Brimsen is only made and sold in the summer months (March-September) due to the natural milking cycle of the ewes.</p>

<p>Dan Vislocky, known to his adoring public as Stella Franshinehowserburger-Murphy, has modeled his career on the theory that animation does not have to be good, average, or even acceptable. He has proven in his work on many occasions, that only two key frames are really necessary to make what many might perceive as the worst possible approach to animating anything...anyone...anything.</p>
<p>Mrs. Vislocky travels the country preaching his/her/its established theory of "Badimation: The Spectaularizationalist Approach to Creatilating Things for Stuff". His thoery has been largely, if not completely, denounced by the animation community, the viewing public, and anyone else who has eyes, except for one true believer. That saddly confused, fabulously-mistakenly-semi-downsyndrome-esque, fully craptacular animator in training is Kevin Estey. His down-right painfully horrendous looks don't help to hide the fact that his animation lives up to every inch of Dan Vislocky's above stated theory, thus rendering his work completely useless to anyone, anywhere, anytime...ever.</p>

<p>Nothing To Lose is a song by Canadian punk rock band Billy Talent. It is about a youth suicide.</p>

<dd>Teacher said it's just a phase</dd>
<dd>When I grow up my children will probably do the same</dd>
<dd>Kids just love to tease</dd>
<dd>Who'd know it'd put me underground at 17</dd>
</dl>
<p>The song is sad and slow, and is Billy Talent's lone ballad. This song is their fourth single and their last of their first album. This is usually regarded as their second biggest hit after 'River Below', but some would argue that it is their biggest.</p>

<p>Ulrica Forbes was born in South Africa and came to England as a very young woman to study at The Slade School of Art undet Henry Tonks who was professor of life studies at the Slade from 18?? to 19?? She exhibited, from the records we have found to date,at the New England Art Club, The Grosvenor Gallery, and The Royal Academy.(see the official records of the R A )She is also recorded in a newspaper article, I believe The Observer. to have exhibited at The Walker Gallery, where her work was praised by no lesser person than Augustus John in his introduction to the exhibition.Among her many sitters was Yehudi Menuhin ( see letter to James Laval thanking him for his review dated 1950 Glasgow University Records) In 1954 she was commissioned by H R H The Queen Mother to paint Princess Anne (and Prince Charles?)and within the Royal Collection there are 2 pastel drawings of Princess Anne as a very young girl. These are in the print room at Windsor castle having been brought there on the death of the Queen Mother. At some stage after this we know that(from a remnant of an article in an S A publication) she returned to South Africa where she is rumoured to have been murdered, although this has to be discounted as the article recording her return states that Mrs Ulrica Scott-Forbes had been ill for some time prior to returning to S A ( Which also gives us a clue as she now has married. I will continue researching this artist and if you have any knowledge then your help would be welcome. == Sources === Glasgow University/Royal Academy/The Royal Collection/David Roberts</p>

<p>BIOGRAPHY ADHD SPIETMOBIEL</p>
<p>Eddy Huizing alias Speedy aka Mouse aka Piepke , well-known of the former bands in which he was the leadsinger, the punkbands The Chops and Boegies and the ska-bigband Jammah Tammah, seemed to become just history, since 3 years past by with no Speedy as a singer in the spotlights. 28-8- 2005, Café Ome Ap in Leek, Speedy, as a DJ, plays eastern european polka, ska, Balkan music and Guns ’n Roses for a change, sticked together by his particular voice. There Walter de Vries aka Wally asked Speedy if he did rather want to get on stage with a band again. ’Ofcourse!’ was his answer. And so be it! Together they started writing songs. Not much later they commenced practicing with the base of the band complemented by Wally’s bandmates from B.O.T., Martijn Louwes aka Martino and Arthur van der Velde aka Arf and pubmate Rudmer van der Meer aka Django. After a month Obed Brinkman aka Obrocht and Dirk-Jan Heinstra aka DJ joined the party. They played with Speedy in Jammah Tammah and also play in Zebra. The songs are ska mixed with Mediterran, Gypsy, Taverna and Punk music. Lyrics are in English, Dutch, Italian, German, Russian, Latin or a combination of these . Appie Albers(AA&amp;the Doctors) made up the name for this new band: ADHD Spietmobiel. 16 December 2005 was the first gig in Café De Zolder in Groningen. They have played on the Dutchskafestival 2006 in De Melkweg in Amsterdam en De Effenaar in Eindhoven and more. They’re first cd is called ‘Shout!’ and contains 5-tracks.This summer ‘Steamin’ up’ the first single and videoclip will be released.</p>

<p><br />
The Cheapshots are a Ska-Core band from Sarasota, Fl. Members come from local bands jamSKwAd, Upstroke Mayhem, and No Ca$h Value. Their sound is similar to Leftover Crack or The Suicide Machines, but their 4 piece horn section really sets them apart from most Ska-Core bands. They released the Rodeo EP early in 2006. Their lyrics are poitical.</p>
