<li>I don't know what the point of this discussion is. My arguments for merging or deleting the page are there. Regarding your comment: You haven't followed our discussion there. I never wanted to have that book censored. There is an article on it. There are academic scholars such as <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Ernst_52f3.html" title="Carl Ernst">Carl Ernst</a> and <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khaleel_Mohammed_64e7.html" title="Khaleel Mohammed">Khaleel Mohammed</a> who seriously question Spencer's scholarship (<a href="http://www.unc.edu/courses/2004spring/reli/026/001/spencer.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.unc.edu/courses/2004spring/reli/026/001/spencer.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). It is not my own point of view. Let me put it simpler: find a respected academic scholar who supports Spencer. You can’t. I contacted Prof. <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_Stillman_0160.html" title="Norman Stillman">Norman Stillman</a> about his opinion on the works of Spencer. He replied back to me: "I have not read any of Mr. Spencer's works and, therefore, am unable to make any fair judgments. Since he does not publish with academic presses and the titles do sound rather polemical, I have never felt a need to examine them." See, a respected academic scholar of Islam finds the titles of his book polemical. Spencer argues that my books don’t have any flaws. Really? Then why doesn’t he publish them in university presses? --<a href="../../../r/e/z/User%7EReza1_9735.html" title="User:Reza1">Reza1</a> 18:38, 30 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It would be reasonable to assume that Spencer doesn't publish his books via university presses because he wants people other than college students to read his works, suspects the university presses would be lax in promoting the works, and/or because he doesn't want the particular universities owning said presses any share of the proceeds.--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike18xx_f1c0.html" title="User:Mike18xx">Mike18xx</a> 18:13, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, As an author stated in the discussion page, <b>currently</b> there is one single point of view, to a very suspicious blog which indicates that it is unquestionable and true. This idea will not be tolerated for other websites, e.g. JewWatch wiki entry i.e. stripping out the critisms and stating it is factual. Thus far, this article seems to be a mere attempt to gain extra hits to a Web Blog! Furthermore, The JewWatch website is <b>NOT</b> a blog, yet this is. I strongly feel this entry should be deleted. It hold zero significance other than stating there is a Blog out there, linking it, and once entering the unquestionable, uncritizable "Blog" being bombarded with blog enteries stating repulsive things about our fellow-man! (LewisRyder 10:29, 31 August 2006 (UTC))</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b>. There are thousands of Wiki articles that are <i>less</i> "notable"; and if an editor has discovered that an Alexa ranking is obsolete, he should correct or eliminate the references, not recommend the entire article for deletion. Furthermore, neither JihadWatch or DhimmiWatch are Spencer's "personal websites"; and neither are designed like personal blogs.--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike18xx_f1c0.html" title="User:Mike18xx">Mike18xx</a> 18:07, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Having a Wikipedia entry for a blog is not an endorsement of the material on that blog by Wikipedia; it is merely an acknowledgement that the blog is notable. If there is a controversy over whether the blog contains truthful material, that might be good material to put into the article, but it is not a reason to not have an article. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 19:42, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> As above, it is a personal blog, top 50000 or so is not notable!! Keeping this will only fuel others to place their blog on here, just to get more viewers.

<li>I think you are misunderstanding how Alexa works. It is the 21,370th most viewed web address, not blog. Sites above it include stuff like, say, ford.com (3,978).

<li><b>Delete</b> - At least delete the article in its current state, its become a revert war, which makes the article itself change in almost entirety many times over the course of a day or two. The article itself doesn't provide much, it basically just says that this site is out there, if that's all there is to say, then there's no point of it being on Wikipedia. The article is a mess and should be blown up and redone, or blown up and just mentioned on the Robert Spencer article. --Seventy-one 08:01, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, one of the most notable blogs on the Internet. If we're going to have articles on any blogs at all (and I know the orchestrators of the War on Blogs would love it if we didn't, but Timecop doesn't get to make the rules), this should be one of them. Also, Alexa only measures those users ignorant enough to use Internet Explorer or another spyware-susceptible browser.

<li><b>Comment</b> Kindly spare me of stating that it is notable. It is arguably in the top 50,000 websites (not using Alexa), shall all 50,000 websites be placed into Wikipedia encyclopedia? It would be a mockery if that happens. Someone has yet to state one benefit of this wiki blog entry. I have been racking my brains to think of any benefit to any researcher, academic etc. which resulted in me having to eat some painkillers as there was no feasible benefit of a relatively unknown blog being placed into an encyclopedia. Oh, and "googling" gives no information about notability, I have googled the word "The" and got 14.1 billion hits, but I will not be writing an article about "The" and linking it to my personal blog (which is in the top 100,000 but is of no use in an encyclopedia).

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Brianyoumans et. al. the essence of your “compelling” arguments thus far encompasses; (1) ‘The blog is in the top 50,000 therefore should be advertised on Wikipedia.’ (2). ‘People have discerning views about an encyclopedia entry that simply points to a blog and according to Alexa feeds off the wikipedia link so it should be left as an entry.’ Anything further to add to this overwhelming barrage of points?

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm going to stop responding to this AFD - I think it is probably going to fail, and I have other interests on Wikipedia. I hope that those who are trying to "kill" this article will co-operate with others in making the article better, and cease trying to simply get rid of it. Personally, I haven't read Spencer at all, but if he is in fact an Islamophobe and is disseminating false information, then this is certainly something that should be discussed in the article. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 22:42, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Brianyoumans, if you review the Wiki history on this article, users, such as Mike18xx and others will not 'allow' any discussion in the article about the blog giving out contentious information. Anything which has a neutral point of view, or more than single point of view will be reverted in haste. This leads to the question, why is this blog present in Wiki.(LewisRyder 09:25, 3 September 2006 (UTC))

Your "trick" of accusations of vandalism directed toward those who've largely written the topics you're accusing them of vandalizing is becoming tedious.)&#160;; <b>08:15, 24 July 2006 Mike18xx (Talk | contribs) (Wikipedia is not a link-repository for ever bitch-moan-whine site that is unsatisfied with the traffic Google is sending it.)</b> etc. Not being able to add any other point of view, or add neutrality leads to abusive comments and a swift revert. So, what is the point of this so called notable encyclopedic entry?? (LewisRyder 16:51, 3 September 2006 (UTC))
<ul>
<li>Citing selected past edit commentary instances of my reversions of your vandalism (and calling you for the counter-propaganda tactic of accusing <i>original article writers</i> of vandalism while engaging in it yourself) does not constitute defending your claim of <i>"Anything which has a neutral point of view, or more than single point of view will be reverted in haste,"</i> since the article is already neutral-view in that it accurately described the ideological stance of its topic. <b>Your argument, now, is essentially that the article should be deleted <i>because other editors won't entertain the changes to it that you desire,</i></b> and that's bad faith.--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike18xx_f1c0.html" title="User:Mike18xx">Mike18xx</a> 18:22, 3 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Anyone may examine my edits and edits from others that have been reverted and judge for themselves!! My argument is clear, the entry should be deleted because; 1. It is a single point of view. 2. It is not a neutral point of view. 3. It is a mere blog. 4. The entry appears to just be an advertisment link to the blog (check Alexa link-ins). Anyone care to add on to this endless list.

<dd>My apologies, although I never did state it was a "personal website", but thanks for the fabrication. So the reason for a "Keep" from you is because it is not a "personal website"?
