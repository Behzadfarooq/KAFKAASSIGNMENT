<li><b>Comment</b> I removed the speedy and the prod. First of all; speedy <i>or</i> prod, please pick one and don't use both. I didn't think the db-context applied to an article that long; and as for the prod... Don't you think we should give a newbie contributor who is probably confused as to where their first attempt at creating this article went a chance to learn what's wrong with their article and create something coherent out of it? If this is an emerging cult, sect, or new religious group the article should be tagged for clean-up, issues mentioned on the talk page, and given a chance to evolve if possible. I watchlisted it when I tagged it for clean-up and if there was no change would have prodded it a few days from now. Lets give the creator a chance to look over the links in the welcome message I left them, and a chance to look at the issues pointed out with clean-up messages and on the talk page, and see if there is a change in the article. ~ <i><b><a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn"><span style="background:#0cc;color:#fff5ee">ONUnicorn</span></a></b></i><sup>(<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">Contribs</a>)</sup> 17:25, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I added the PROD as well because the article had already been speedied today; I wasn't sure the speedy tag was quite right and also wanted to avoid speedy/recreation pingpong, so I figured I'd save time in the event admin didn't speedy-delete it. <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMacks_c1d8.html" title="User:DMacks">DMacks</a> 17:39, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The article creator appears to be attempting to address some concerns and remedy some of the problems in the article. Unfortunately, in doing so they have just asserted that, at this point in time the existence of Lavaeth Church is not <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>. This quote from a recent edit they made to the article:
<blockquote>
<p>The number of members of the Lavaeth Church is not numbered greatly, and therefore is given the term "sect". Due to its foundation last year in the United Kingdom in the county of Kent <b>it does not have a great deal of publicity</b>. The reason for the Wikipedia article is to give a brief outline of the beliefs of the sect, with references to the scriptures.</p>
</blockquote>
[Emphasis added]</li>
</ul>
<p>If you cannot demonstrate via previously published material that this sect actually exists, then Wikipedia is not the place to give a brief outline of its belief system. Try another website like <a href="../../../m/y/s/Myspace.html" title="Myspace">myspace</a>, or <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikia.html" title="Wikia">Wikia</a>. If and when this belief system catches on and is written about in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, then this article can be re-created. <b>Delete without prejudice</b> ~ <i><b><a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn"><span style="background:#0cc;color:#fff5ee">ONUnicorn</span></a></b></i><sup>(<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">Contribs</a>)</sup> 20:52, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Clearly, comments by one or two editors above show total religious bias, which is not needed in an AfD discussion. But a number of comments made in the article in relation to other religions are inaccurate in the terms of those religions, the basic text is unreferenced, important details lack context, and the sect is, as stated within the text, unknown and therefore non-notable.

<li>Unfortunately, it seems to be that Hoax Religions appear with regularity on Wikipedia. I understand that this faith may be real and may be something by which you live your life (and I do, despite the implications of others, respect that), but without verification it's nigh impossible to seperate from Religions which might have been invented.

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b>. It is lifted out of the organisation's promotional literature, albeit with permission, although there is no trace of how that permission has been granted and in what are the limits to that permission, so it may fail <a href="../../../c/o/p/WP%7ECOPYVIO_ef21.html" title="WP:COPYVIO">WP:COPYVIO</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> Straight forward delete because it is not notable and not verifiable in published sources. Verifiablity is covered above. A prophet could be considered inherently notable, however, my understanding of the various Wikipedia guidelines would suggest that a prophet would have to attract a significant number of followers before achieving notability, or alternatively, a significant number of gainsayers. There is no evidence either in this case. --<a href="../../../b/e/j/User%7EBejnar_f26b.html" title="User:Bejnar">Bejnar</a> 19:41, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
