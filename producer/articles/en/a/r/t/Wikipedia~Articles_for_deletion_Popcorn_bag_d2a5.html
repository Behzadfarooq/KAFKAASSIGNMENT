<dd><b>Comment</b>. The <i>technology</i> of microwave popcorn bags may be fodder for an article (though in its present incarnation I think it should be merged with popcorn). However, there is nothing notable about popcorn bags of the everyday variety. The entire focus should thus be on the history and technology involved with that topic; the article should not masquerade as a general article on popcorn bags and should be renamed "Microwave popcorn bag technology" or something similar. Think about it this way, would there be any reason to keep if the article was lolipop wrapper? Generic popcorn bags are still the analogue of lolipop wrapper. --<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 04:01, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
