<p>KENNETH E. TYLER (1931- ) BIOGRAPHICAL PROFILE</p>
<p>Kenneth Tyler is one of the foremost contemporary printer-publishers, specializing in limited edition fine art graphics, multiples, and unique works of art. Throughout his career, he has collaborated with artists to create editions of the highest creative and technical quality. Noted for his innovative use of combined print media, and stretching the boundaries of scale, he is credited with blurring distinctions between painted, sculptural, and printed expression.</p>
<p>Tyler's extensive training in the arts and industry has enabled him to uniquely respond creatively to artists' needs. After receiving a Bachelor of Art Education degree from the Art Institute of Chicago in 1957, he briefly taught art. He then worked in sales research for a steel company, during which time he became a member of the Metallurgical Society of America and worked with corporations such as IBM. He resumed his formal education in 1962, graduating with a Master of Art Education Degree from the John Herron School of Art in Indianapolis in 1963. That year he received a Ford Foundation Grant to further study printmaking in Los Angeles at The Tamarind Lithography Workshop, where he later served as Technical Director from 1964-1965.</p>
<p>In 1965, Tyler founded his first workshop, Gemini Ltd., in Los Angeles, and the following year, formed the expanded Gemini G.E.L. His pursuit of new materials and techniques spurred projects that ultimately redefined the scale and complexity of contemporary printmaking. Tyler was awarded a grant in 1967 from The National Endowment for the Arts for the research and development of paper, inks, embossing, and three-dimensional works. In 1971, a retrospective exhibition, Technics and Creativity: Gemini G.E.L., was held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, honoring the workshop's creative output.</p>
<p>In 1974 Tyler relocated to New York and founded Tyler Graphics Ltd. in Bedford Village, New York. There he opened his own paper mill, advancing papermaking as a major medium from which artists could make original works, and developing large-scale colored paper pulp as substrates for printing. In the course of the next eighteen years, Tyler aided in revolutionizing colored and pressed paper pulp, pushing the medium with one pioneering project following the next, beginning with Frank Stella’s ‘Paper Reliefs’ in 1975, then Ellsworth Kelly’s ‘Colored Paper Images’ in 1976, Kenneth Noland’s ‘Handmade Paper Project’ and David Hockney’s spectacular ‘Paper Pools’ of 1978, James Rosenquist’s ‘Welcome to the Water Planet and House of Fire’ mural-size works in 1989, and Robert Motherwell’s printed colored papers in 1992.</p>
<p>In 1986 Tyler built an even more elaborate facility, moving the workshop to Mount Kisco, New York. The custom-designed space included a gallery, paper mill, and facilities for all fine art printmaking media: intaglio, lithography, screenprinting, and woodblock relief printing, as well as facilities for the production of unique works and multiples. As with his former workshops, Tyler designed new presses to accommodate the ever-increasing potential of print and papermaking media. In Mount Kisco he engineered a computer controlled, power driven combination lithography and etching press with a five-by-ten foot printing bed, and a massive hydraulic platen press capable of printing 98 x 128 inches under 500 tons of pressure. Previous to this, he designed several hydraulic lithography presses (his first in 1965), an inking machine for spectrum rollers for lithography, and products such as a riser scaffold system (which he invented in 1957 and patented in 1961). In 1978, needing rigid archival honeycomb paper panels for three-dimensional work with Frank Stella, Tyler created ‘Tycore,’ which he patented and registered.</p>
<p>In 1982 the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis acquired the Tyler Graphics archive (comprised of prints dating back to 1965 from Gemini Ltd., Gemini G.E.L., and Tyler Graphics Ltd.), opening the collection formally to the public in 1984 as the Tyler Graphics Archive and McKnight Study Room, and launching the exhibition Prints from Tyler Graphics in honor of the event.</p>
<p>In 1990 the Museum of Modern Art, New York, exhibited the ‘James Rosenquist: Welcome to the Water Planet’ prints, a project representing Tyler's first collaboration with Rosenquist which resulted in ten painting-size works (the largest is 8 x 10 feet) combining lithography collage over colored, pressed paper pulp. In 1992 a travelling retrospective, Innovation in Collaborative Printmaking: Kenneth Tyler, 1963-1992, originated at the Yokohama Museum of Art, Yokohama, and traveled extensively throughout Japan. The scope of the exhibition extended from Tyler's previous decades of printing and publishing through current projects still in progress or newly completed, including two mural-size prints shown for the first time: Time Dust by James Rosenquist (a work spanning 35 feet and 7 feet high) and The Fountain by Frank Stella (over 7 feet high and 23 feet across). Groundbreaking in scale and complexity, these artworks demonstrated Tyler's, Rosenquist’s and Stella’s combined motivation to create a new paradigm for prints.</p>
<p>Concurrent with activities at the Yokohama Museum of Art, the USIS (United States Information Service) scheduled Tyler and artists John Newman and Steven Sorman to lecture in seven cities throughout Japan. During this visit, Tyler arranged for the two artists to work on innovative paper projects at the Fuji Paper Mill in Tokushima, Japan.</p>
<p>In 1992, Dai Nippon Printing Company acquired a collection of Tyler’s works published since 1974 and built a the Center for Contemporary Graphic Art and Tyler Graphics Archive Collection (CCGA &amp; TGAC) [For further details on CCGA in Japan, visit their web site: www.dnp.co.jp/gallery/ccga ], a modern museum which had its grand opening in April 1995, in Sukagawa City, Fukushima, 400 miles north of Tokyo. The center is the only facility of its kind dedicated to fine art prints, multiples, and graphic design. Currently, in its ninth year of operation and presenting its 30th exhibition (Helen Frankenthaler: The Woodcuts), CCGA continues to “foster a deeper understanding of, and closer affinity to prints by more people.” Frank Stella &amp; Kenneth Tyler: A Unique 30-Year Collaboration, a retrospective originated at The Walker Art Center, was shown at CCGA (March-May 1998), then traveled to The Kawamura Museum where its curator, Nobuyuki Hiromoto, enlarged the exhibition to include large-scale sculptures and paintings and produced a major museum catalogue.</p>
<p>In 1999, Tyler’s printing/publishing achievements were celebrated in two exhibitions. One was at the Singapore Art Museum, entitled Impression to Form, Selected Works from the Singapore Art Museum’s Tyler Art Collection. The second, Kenneth Tyler, Thirty Years of Printmaking, a retrospective curated by Judith Goldman and organized by Curatorial Assistance and Tyler Graphics Ltd., toured across the United States, with its final venue in late 2001 at the California Center for the Arts. On view in both exhibitions were prints from some of Tyler’s earliest collaborations, including David Hockney’s ‘A Hollywood Collection’ (1965), and Jasper Johns’ ‘Color Numeral Series' (1969).</p>
<p>The Singapore Art Museum (SAM) has both series in their permanent collection, along with approximately 1,500 works from Tyler’s personal collection, now owned by Singapore’s National Heritage Board.</p>
<p>However, the largest and most comprehensive archiving of Tyler’s many years of collaboration rests with The National Gallery of Australia, in Canberra. [For details regarding the National Gallery of Australia, visit: www.nga.gov.au and click on the Ken Tyler Collection]. The NGA has been collecting Tyler’s prints since 1973, when the gallery acquired some 600 prints, rare proofs and related drawings from Tyler. NGA has continually built upon this collection, especially in recent years. In 2002, NGA acquired 2200 prints, proofs and documentary items, giving the collection a historic breadth spanning from 1965 to the present. Eighteen years ago, NGA honored Tyler's long-time achievements with a major exhibition: Ken Tyler: Printer Extraordinary, and the publication of the book, Ken Tyler, Master Printer and the American Print Renaissance in 1986, written by Pat Gilmour. In 2002, celebrating NGA’s 20th year and its greatly expanded collection, the museum’s print curator, Jane Kinsman, featured works by eight of the artists of the Tyler Collection with a show entitled, The Big Americans -- Josef Albers, Helen Frankenthaler, David Hockney, Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Motherwell, Robert Rauschenberg, and Frank Stella at Tyler’s Studios.</p>
<p>In addition to his innovative projects with artists, Tyler has participated as a guest artist and lecturer internationally, and as a juror for art exhibtions since 1964. In 1996 he received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from Alfred University, Alfred, New York. In 1998, Tyler was awarded a second honorary Doctoral degree from The Atlanta College of Art, Atlanta, Georgia. In 2002, he was named the recipient of the Dieu Donné Art Award (celebrating the papermill’s 25th anniversary,) to honor Tyler “for a lifetime of extraordinary collaboration with artists creating landmark works of art….”</p>
<p>Also in 2002, Tyler lectured at the University of Michigan's School of Art and Design as an invitee of their Distinguished Vistors Program. An exhibit containing works printed and published by Tyler with artists including Josef Albers, Helen Frankenthaler, Jasper Johns, Claes Oldenburg, Kenneth Price, Robert Rauschenberg, Richard Smith and Frank Stella was on view at the University of Michigan's Museum of Art during Tyler's visit. Later that year, he lectured and gave printmaking workshop demonstrations at the Dieu Donné award ceremony in New York City, the National Institute of Arts (Canberra), and the Australian Print Workshop (Fitzroy, Victoria).</p>
<p>Tyler's most recent and ambitious collaboration for advancing fine art printmaking has been the development of the Singapore Tyler Print Institute (STPI) [For information on STPI in Singapore, go to: www.stpi.com.sg ]. In a state-of-the-art facility, and with a new generation of Master Printers and trainees, STPI envisons the continued growth of print and papermaking. Its inaugural exhibition, Frank Stella in 2002, opened in April 2002, and was followed by Tear Up The Rule Books.</p>
<p>In 2003, some of Tyler’s early prints, his own work from 1964, was included in the exhibition, Making an Impression: Printmaking at The Herron School of Art. In the forward to the catalogue, Tyler enthuses that it was in the early 1960s that his lifelong passion for art, learning and teaching, and “passing on knowledge and craft to future generations” began.</p>
<p>In continuation of this desire to inspire future generations, Tyler Graphics made its last gift of prints to three museums in 2004: The Addison Gallery of American Art (Phillips Academy, Andover, MA, USA), The Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, NY), and the Tate Modern (London, England). Tyler’s art donations amounted to more than 8000 works archived to various museums worldwide. Tyler closed down his facility and workshop in Mount Kisco in 2004.</p>

<p>A chindi is the ghost of the Navajo tribe believed to be released at dying breath. The chindi is almost always considered to be an evil force, avenging some form of offense to the person. The Navajo believe that contacting such a spirit can cause illness, or death. It is also believed that a chindi can be used to cause harm upon someone else. The most famous account of the chindi is the account of the Long Salt family.</p>
<p>In the August-September 1967 issue of a magazine by the name of <i>Frontier Times</i>, John R. Winslowe wrote of his 1925 encounter with Alice Long Salt, a slender teenage girl. She told of the demise of the Long Salt family. In the periodical, she describes the believed reason for the Long Salt demise. It was believed that after two members of the tribe deceived a blind medicine man, he sent a chindi to destroy the Long Salts. Each member of the family was striken with an incurable illness, and eventually died.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Curiously, anyone marrying into the family met the same fate as a blood Long Salt. Alice's mother died when the girl reached seven and she was attending the Tuba City boarding school at the Indian agency. Alice's father became skin and bones, dying two years later... The remaining three Long Salts [Alice's two uncles and an aunt] were ill, crippled, and helpless. Friends cared for them, watching them fade into nothing before their eyes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the winter of 1928, Alice Long Salt was found dead three miles from the trading post on Red Mesa.</p>

He is a proud supporter of the experimental disciplines within science, with a constantly expressed ambition to "measure the world, and see if it matches the analysis". His scientific career has included work at many different organisations within Australia, including CSIRO Molecular Science, the National Magnet Laboratory, the University of New South Wales and Macquarie University.</p>
<p>Born in 1981, P.G. Morrison was raised in the Sydney North Shore suburb of South Turramurra. As a child he was first exposed to scientific knowledge by his father, at the time a professional scientist at CSIRO Minerals Division. This seems to have started a thirst and quest for knowledge, culminating in two summers of research training in molecular biology at CSIRO in 1999. This fed into completion of a degree in theoretical physics and mathematics at the University of New South Wales.</p>
<p>At present, P.G. Morrison is heavily involved in theoretical research with the CQCT, Macquarie [1]. He notes that the expenditure for experimental research in the areas which current science is investigating is prohibitively high, and as such his labour is much better applied at analytical tasks. Despite this, he is often found expressing the view that he "should be in the lab, making something, cooking something up!"</p>
<p>An often elusive and mysterious person of strongly held views, P.G. Morrison's analytical ability is often seen to represent the triumph of the individual over the system. He was quite famously seen as the "dark star" of theoretical physics, using intuitive methods to solve difficult problems that had befuddled the experts for years.</p>
<p>P. G. Morrison is a leading proponent of quantum control theoretical techniques, derived principally from the work of Dr. A. Carlini et al [2,3]. These methods examine the concept of optimality in a fully quantum-mechanical fashion, designing time-dependent steering functions which are capable of engineering transitions of quantum states for application in computational systems.</p>
<p>His personal work focuses on linear algebraic methods for understanding quantum systems. This has led to some interesting results which seems to imply the existence and exchange of quasi-particles between the system and environment on the boundary interface. These particles (termed "entangled photon pairs") have interesting physical and logical properties in that one member of a pair is never directly observed, if the other is. This assumption of non-detectability nevertheless is useful in understanding a number of the physical properties of simple quantum systems.</p>

<p>Tomoyuki Hoshino is a Japanese writer. He was born in Los Angeles in 1965 and his family returned to Japan before he was three years old. He attended Waseda University and worked for a while as a journalist after graduating in 1988. He spent the better part of the years 1990-50 living in Mexico. He returned to Japan and worked for a while translating from Spanish to Japanese. He published his first novel The Last Gasp in 1997, and it was awarded the Bungei Prize. He won the Mishima Prize for his second novel The Mermaid Sings Wake Up, which was published in 2000. He won the Noma Bungei award for Fantasista in 2003. He has published at least one book a year since making his debut in 1997. These works include The Poisoned Singles Hot Springs (2002), Naburiai (2003), Lonely Hearts Killer (2004), Alkaloid Lovers (2005), The Worussian-Japanese Tragedy (2006), The Story of Rainbow and Chloe (2006), and the collection We Kittens (2006). His short story "Sand Planet" was nominated for the Akutagawa Prize for 2002. He has published many short stories and essays, both fiction and non-fiction. He also writes guest commentaries for newspapers and journals on sports (especially soccer), Latin America, politics, nationalism, and the arts. His short story "Chino" has been translated into English by Lucy Fraser and is available online via the Japanese Fiction Project (Emerging Writers in Translation), and his novel Lonely Hearts Killer has been translated into English by Adrienne Hurley and is soon to be published. He travels frequently and has participated in writers' caravans with authors from Taiwan, India, and elsewhere. In 2006, his critique of Ichiro Suzuki's remarks at the World Baseball Classic were considered controversial by some, and so have some of his other writings related to Japanese nationalism, the emperor, and sexuality. Also in 2006, the literary journal Bungei dedicated a special issue to Hoshino and his work. He sometimes teaches Creative Writing at Waseda, his alma mater.

<p><b>Shrabani Basu is the writer of the biography of The Spy Princess the life of Noor Inayat Khan.<br /></b></p>
<p>We all know the well known book, but what we dont know is why Shrabani Basu picked this person to write on, how she chose to write about Noor in the first place, and no one has asked these questions. --59.144.51.183 10:16, 17 December 2006 (UTC) Shrabani Basu</p>
<p>It was a story waiting to be told. The story of a beautiful princess who despite the odds went on to become a spy; her courage in the face of terror; her ultimate sacrifice for her cause and her nation— all the right ingredients for a perfectly captivating tale.</p>
<p>So when author Shrabani Basu first heard of Noor Inayat Khan “many years ago in an article about the contributions of Asians to Britain,” she could not help but be drawn to the subject. “I read Jean Overton Fuller’s Noor-un-nisa Inayat Khan, which was fascinating,” says Basu.

<p>It is a unique historical feature in the Keilor East area. The bridge was built in 1928 and was (and still is believed to be) the highest railway bridge in Victoria. It crosses the Maribyrnong River from Keilor East on the North side to Sunshine on the South side of the river. Being 54.6 metres above the river , the bridge is higher than the Sydney Harbour Bridge (52 metres) and the Westgate Bridge (53 metres) and in fact is high enough to top the flagpole on the Flinders Street Clock Tower. It is .4 of a kilometre or a quarter of a mile long - it was known in railway circles as the Quartermile. The girders were sunk up to 20 metres below ground level to obtain firm foundations for the concrete pedestals, onto which the big steel towers were erected. The bridge is noteworthy for its unusual K frame bracing. In its construction, 1,600 tons of steel and 6,000 cubic metres of concrete were used. Approximately 200 men were employed to build the bridge and one man lost his life during its construction. Originally only goods trains used the line but it was used for troop trains during the Second World War. Since standardisation of the Victoria/N.S.W. line, all Sydney trains cross the bridge. It is located on Melway Map 27 at grid 2A. and can be clearly seen from the E.J. Whitten Bridge on the Western Ring Road - on the East side of the road.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-18_5b57.html" title="Edit section: Patrique">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Patrique</span></h2>
<p>Patrique is an American author, socialite, pop singer and fashion designer. His projects have been mostly independent, but he has received a high degree of attention for his personal life and at times comedic actions.</p>
<p>Patrique first came in to the public eye in late 2005/early 2006 as a socialite when his antics with British socialite Shane Tyas became a fixture in internet gossip blogs. On December 23, 2005 Girlstalkinsmack.com reported that Patrique and Tyas would be starring in a Fox spinoff of the E! program "The Simple Life" starring Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie. Then, on January 21, 2006 FadedYouth reported that Patrique would be suing Shane Tyas for $3 million. Patrique reportedly filed the lawsuit with Paris Hilton, and gossip blogger Perez Hilton. In late 2006 Patrique made a petition against myspace model Tila Tequila complaining about the fact that she lists herself as an unsigned artist even though she is signed to A&amp;M records. Shortly after the petition was released A Hot Mess Gossip Blog, citing a blind item, claimed that Patrique actually started the petition because he was angry at Tila for stealing his rumored boyfriend, actor Jared Leto. The rumor quickly spread through the internet.</p>
<p>In 2006, Patrique released his first book "Beverly Hills 60643" with print on demand company Lulu. The book chronicled the lives of four teenagers in the wealthy Chicago community of Beverly. The book recieved a fair amount of public attention, the book has yet to recieve any commercial success, lurking at the bottom of the Lulu.com sales chart.</p>
<p>Also in 2006 Patrique released his own clothing line called "Strength: By Patrique" the line featured highly priced clothes for all ages.</p>
<p>Patrique is in the process of recording an album, which will be a mixture of Pop and R&amp;B. On August 31, 2006 Patrique's song "It's All About Me" was leaked to the internet, the self affirming song is about Patrique and his material possesions. The song has been criticized for being self centered. Some claim that the songs instrumentals are similiar to a Britney Spears song "Oops I Did It Again." The songs lyrics are also nearly identical to a song of the same name from a Disney channel show "The Proud Family." Many claimed that the song in the voice could not be Patrique since it sounded like an African American singing the song, and compared Patrique to Milli Vanilli. Patrique denied the claims insisting that he did sing on the track and the producers had just used "cool effects" to make his voice "sound different."</p>

<p>A jewled Turban decoration. The only references I can find all refer to the item called a Chelengk being a Jeweled item presented by Sultan Selim III of Turkey to Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson as a thank piece for his successful action against Napoleon's navy after the Battle of the Nile in 1798. This item is seen in later portraits of Nelson, worn as a cockade to his Bicorn hat, see <a href="http://www.aboutnelson.co.uk/images/abbott2.jpg" class="external free" title="http://www.aboutnelson.co.uk/images/abbott2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.aboutnelson.co.uk/images/abbott2.jpg</a> a portriate by Lemuel Abbott</p>
<p>An object of this note ought to be covered by it's own entry and also some mention of it should be added to the coverage of Admiral Horatio Nelson.</p>
<p>A full description of the Jewel and a photograph of a replica can be found at <a href="http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/nelson/viewObject.cfm?ID=JEW0368" class="external free" title="http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/nelson/viewObject.cfm?ID=JEW0368" rel="nofollow">http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/nelson/viewObject.cfm?ID=JEW0368</a> which is an entry in the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, UK, website.</p>

<p>Google returns a number of hits (not too many) for Chelengk, at least one of which refers to the Patrick O'Brian Novel "Treason's Harbour" in which his character Jack Aubry is presented with a Chelengk by an unnamed Turkish Potentate. It was this reference which prompted me to search wikipedia for the item and when I failed to find a reference I then tried Google. O'Brian is (rightly to my mind) celebrated for the accuracy of his portrayal of the maritime world circa 1800.</p>

<p>Loladiablo was first created on Daggerspine in early 2005. She immedietly grew to popularity on said server. She would speak her opinion wherever she went, letting people know how she felt. She started her first guild around level 20 and called it Masquerade. She enjoyed the name and symbol of the guild but soon had to dismember it due to problems. Her next guild was called Tastes like Chicken. She planned it because above her player it would say "Loladiablo &lt;tastes like chicken&gt;". Her same loyal guild members, including Vachie, her brother, followed her through her many guilds. Many of her guilds fell sadly fell apart.</p>
<p>Some of these include: Masquerade, Tastes Like Chicken, CAUTION, and Im a Whorde</p>

<p>Pop up retail (also known as pop up shops or guerilla boutiques) are stores that can sell anything from clothing to soap, cat food to furniture from a temporary space for a restricted period of time- anything from a month to a couple of hours. The reasons behind this method of selling are varied. They include wanting to create 'buzz' around a product by making it harder to purchase, creating brand awareness and clearing out large amounts of stock in a short space of time.</p>
<p>The first pop up stores started to appear in late 2004, although it could be argued that market stalls, car boot sales and fairs have been doing the same thing for much longer. However, guerilla boutiques often integrate music, performance or art into their space, thus creating an atmosphere that is attempting to be more exciting to its' public than a regular vendor. Guerilla boutiques have been advertised through main stream media but are more often publicised through viral methods- such as blogging, newsletters, word of mouth, the internet and flyering.</p>
<p>Companies to create pop up shops include Nike, American Apparell, Hummer, Comme Des Garcons and Target. Many independent designers have also set up guerilla boutiques because it is a cheap and effective way to sell their designs. Clothing boutique Venue developed the VBOX, a travelling pop up store equipped with iMac and hi fi system.</p>
<p>Pop up shops continue to pop up. Gorillaretail.com is a website (launching in Feb 2007) that will be a directory of independent boutiques, guerilla boutiques and pop up shops as well as announcing launches and openings, across UK, Europe, Japan and USA. <a name="Sources_33" id="Sources_33"></a></p>

<p>Polymorphic Hemophilia is the disease that, in some legends, Vampires have. Literally broken down from the Greek; Polymorphic means "Having many forms," poly meaning "many" and morph meaning "form." Hemophilia means He/She/It who loves blood, Hemo or Haemo, meaning blood, and philia meaning "love" or "obsession".</p>
