<li><b>Merge</b> into main article. For the record, this article is NOT A GAME GUIDE.

If merged, the PangYa article may be considered too long. And walkthrough? you're full of it. The article describes the characters in the game, that is not a walkthrough or guide as much as an explanation of fictional characters. This page is as much "cruft" as the other pages I linked are. As per the WP:NOT charge, what does it fall under? It is not an Internet Guide, Instruction Manual, or simply a listing, going by their definition: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 63.85.214.4 (<a href="../../../6/3/2E/User_talk%7E63.85.214.4.html" title="User talk:63.85.214.4">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_63.85.214.4_888a.html" title="Special:Contributions/63.85.214.4">contribs</a>) 12:46, December 29, 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This should be considered worthy material for an article due to its current importance and role in the gaming world. GamePark has absorbed a <i>far greater</i> amount of the <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_Empires_II_ccb0.html" title="Age of Empires II">AoE2</a> community than <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gamespy.html" title="Gamespy">Gamespy</a> has. In addition to that, it is the <i>only</i> remaining matchmaker for AoE2 which has rankings, seamless game launching, and natively supports the 1.0e anti-hack patch. For those which feel this article should be deleted, I strongly urge you to first <a href="http://www.viciousempire.com/extras/aoe2conq/articles/gameparkgamespy.html" class="external text" title="http://www.viciousempire.com/extras/aoe2conq/articles/gameparkgamespy.html" rel="nofollow">see this article</a> prior to drawing your conclusion. I do however recommend that we possibly <i>rename</i> this article to something such as GamePark_(Gaming), due to the fact there is an also popular Czech version of the site located at <a href="http://www.gamepark.cz/" class="external text" title="http://www.gamepark.cz/" rel="nofollow">gamepark.cz</a>, which should also be included. I understand that some have suggested the article does not meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, however, when a fairly new website plays such a de facto role in something - would deletion truly serve justice? --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMaTrIx_c42e.html" title="User:MaTrIx">MaTrIx</a> 04:00, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>A nonexistent person whose only claim to fame is that <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conan_O%27Brien_99b0.html" title="Conan O'Brien">Conan O'Brien</a> laughed on TV at what he assumed was his name.

No sources save for the episode itself; some of the content may constitute <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, and it seems unlikely that the article could be expanded without adding more.

<p>The result was <b>keep</b> but <b>cleanup</b>. There's more than one album, as the group was previously known under another name.

<li><b>Comment</b>"Many of us who spend a lot of time improving Wikipedia's musical coverage feel that notability is required for a musical topic (such as a band or musical theatre group) to deserve an article here. Please note that the failure to meet any of these criteria does not mean an article must be deleted; likewise, the meeting of any of these criteria does not mean that an article must be kept. These are merely rules of thumb which some editors choose to keep in mind when deciding whether or not to keep an article that is on articles for deletion." The article doesn't break any rules, and it doesn't hurt to have it. I'd like it to stay, so the question is, do you really want it NOT to be kept? <a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGert2_931d.html" title="User:Gert2">Gert2</a> 04:01, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Spam for web site launched in late 2006. Much of the text of the article (and Google hits for "Riottt") focus on the "Be the Riottt!" festival, which appears to have been a music show like many others, not really a "festival", certainly not near notable enough for an article. The article says that it was written up in Pitchfork and Tripwire, but the links don't go anywhere useful; and in Spin, but no link given. Again, all this is for the "Be the Riottt!" <i>show</i>, which I guess was their big shoot-the-wad kickoff; it doesn't really have much bearing on the <i>web site</i>. Cutting to the chase: no assertion or proof of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> notability, spam. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 04:19, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Songs which overtly name the person or group in question shouldn't be a problem, anything currently on the "covert" list will need a citation from a source (the actual artist, someone involved with production, or a biography, most likely) indicating that the "covert reference" is not actually overt OR. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 08:16, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b>: This is a very interesting piece that surely has a place on Wikipedia. This list illustrates the greatness of a collaborative project: it has been a part of this encyclopedia for three years and has been continually edited by dozens of editors who have put in a great deal of work. Until tonight I have not been one of them because I wasn't aware of it, so I am not speaking on my own behalf, but on behalf of other hard-working contributors. Put one of your stickers on top, if you must, suggesting that references be added, and let the editors of the page consider if and how they wish to do so - in most cases it's a matter of reading the lyrics. But it should not be summarily trashed just because the policy du jour is remove, remove, remove, and a very small group of editors - far fewer than those who have diligently worked on this page for three years - have come to this page to vote it out as if this were an episode of "Survivor". Have some respect for the hard work of others and don't be so rigid. Does anyone remember "If the rules prevent you from improving or maintaining Wikipedia's quality, ignore them"?

<li><b>Strong keep</b>: although trivia, this list can be useful, and for that reason augments Wikipedia's aim of forming as comprehensive and in-depth encyclopedia as possible.

<li><b>Comment</b> The problem with saying that the songs themselves provide references, is that is only true when the exact name of a person is used in the song. But, and especially because the article is <i>covert</i> references, anything beyond that would be an inference, or a hypothesis if you will. It might be a hypothesis that any informed music-lover might make, but unless it <i>has</i> been made, and by a credible, referenced source, it must be considered original research. It is tough to prove a negative, but if this is indeed <i>not</i> original research, I'm sure someone will come up with sources, and I'll change my opinion. <a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEchuck215_5075.html" title="User:Echuck215">Charlie</a> 10:01, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

It can be renominated if/when the category is created. As to encyclopedic nature, songs with alleged cryptic references to real persons are an ancient and interesting phenomenon.

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't mean this as a personal assault, but you opened a window I felt needed crawling through — what is being sought is an encyclopedic reason, not a wholesome or fun reason ... there is an encyclopedic reason afterall and that is establishment of notability.

<li><b>Delete</b> Sorry for causing loss of people's work. But this seems rather OR-ish to me. The word "covert" is a red flag. Sometimes with overt references, one can rely on the primary source. But covert, means that a straightforward reading of the lyrics doesn't prove its true, and it might even by denied, with an alternate explanation of what the song is referring to. No independent reliable sources have presented. If anybody wishes to save this, I recommend copying to user-space, finding sources, and making a new artricle, with citations on every item. Any place, other than article space, would be good. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 04:04, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Some of the best entries in the Encyclopedia Britannica are about little-known, covert aspects of culture.

<li><b>Keep</b> I hope that it is not a surprise to anyone that musicians make inobvious allusions to earlier performers &amp; their contemporaries. Deleting this article does not solve the problem that some editors will try to push their own theories &amp; original research into this list; these tendentious editors will find other ways to accomplish their goals (will this also lead to a ban of any section header similar to "Trivia", "X in popular culture", "Cultural references in X", etc. that might appear in any article?). The proper way to fix this problem is on the Talk page for this article: state that a given claim <b>needs references</b>. If someone hasn't tried that solution before listing an article on AfD, it's hard to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> when the article appears here first. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 01:42, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I've seen people throwing around the "it's hard to assume good faith" threat quite a bit in this discussion, and frankly I don't understand it. Why is it hard to assume good faith? From my point of view, the lack of references <i>indicates</i> that the list probably is original research, which is a good reason for AFD. It didn't take me long to arrive at that reasoning either, and that reasoning seems like a fine one if you need help in assuming good faith. Moreover, I haven't seen any of the keep voters really tackle the OR issue in their arguments, other than just claiming it is not OR, or claiming it is impossible to understand why anyone could think it is. I would really like to see that addressed, and not because I'm convinced the article definitely needs to go. I am sympathetic to <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West's</a> request that we consider how long it would take to properly source this, and vote keep for now, to give the authors time to source it.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Forster's manuscript on Musical Mathematics is almost unique on the www, and that is rare. There is tuning information there I have not found anywhere else, internet or print.

<li><b>Comment</b> Is the manuscript actually available on the www?

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. Sorry but VANITY strikes a real sour note. Creating and article about yourself is not what wikipedia is about. Plus asking all your friends to vote is so pathetic that even if the article was well-written and notable, I am automatically opposed. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMiracleMat_90d1.html" title="User:MiracleMat">MiracleMat</a> 07:14, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> I have followed Forster's work for 30 years and I feel strongly that his work deserves an entry in Wikipedia. There seems to be some bias against microtonality here -- last year the main entry on microtonal music was repeatedly challenged until the poster convinced the princpal critic (a physicist, as I recall), that the subject was appropriate. Microtonal music is a rapidly growing movement in contemporary music worldwide, and Forster is a leader in the field and has been for decades. His beautifully crafted instruments were featured in Xenharmonikon 7&amp;8 back in 1979, btw. I have added an external link to the WIKI article on microtonal music to provide more context for Forster's page.John H. Chalmers 17:53, 29 December 2006 (UTC) <small>— John H.

<li><b>Comment</b> actually, the only bias I see here is against articles that are not <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>; which is an absolute must for a wikipedia article. That is what is still missing here. If Forster is a leader in the field, where is any sourcing that indicates that? Like I said above I'd be willing to reconsider if some sort of reliable external sourcing were provided, but that has not happened as of yet.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:30, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> My nomination of this article a second time was because this is recreation of material that was deleted for being an autobiography. However, if Forster is demonstrably notable and we have several independent authors here willing to review and contribute to this article, I don't think this reason is any longer valid. If we can find some published sources about his notablity, then it should stay. - <a href="../../../r/a/i/User%7ERainwarrior_5180.html" title="User:Rainwarrior">Rainwarrior</a> 09:00, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Notable artist in a tiny and somewhat out-there field, but one fairly central to students of modern music.

<p>This article describes a phrase which is purported to be a meme referring to people taking credit for other people's ideas. The phrase garners few Google hits, none of which clearly use it as a meme; rather, the Google hits refer to people named Larry having ideas. There are no Google Groups hits at all for the phrase. Normally I would have taken this to <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a> instead of <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>, but the article is mostly about <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Sanger_037d.html" title="Larry Sanger">Larry Sanger</a> ceasing to receive credit for having the idea of establishing Wikipedia. Consequently, the deletion of this article should take place under the open process so nobody accuses anyone of trying to cover up an article for portraying <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">Jimmy Wales</a> in a negative light. Regardless of anything else, though, the phrase "Larry had the idea" has no notability in itself, and this article should be <b>deleted</b>. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 07:34, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not sure what VIS is... from my research, it appears to be a training camp attended by soccer players from Victoria. Unfortunately, the article doesn't say much about it other than which notable players have passed through it. From what I can tell, it appears to be an amateur league of some sort, the only connection to notability being these players having participated in it. <s><b>Neutral</b></s> from me, since I'm no expert on this, but I brought it here because it is a suspected <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>, and the author (either directly or through an IP) repeatedly removes speedy deletion tags. --<font face="Book Antiqua"><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu"><font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu"><font color="red"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 08:36, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> Unless the author just found the page in a bad state and decided it was impossible to fix on the spot (as there does not seem to be any discussion prior to the statement of a clear need for deletion by the nominator) then they should stop screwing with the afd process. This page is not in violation of the advertising "rule" as it contains quotations which justify its statements. An article would have to be unverifiable and unfairly unneutral to fail that criteria, something which this is not. Also, avoiding self-references does not stop pages about Wikipedia existing. That is not a deletion issue again. Again, please stop mucking about with the process...Discuss in a rational manner first before taking the issue to here and the whole encyclopedia may be able to improve in an economically sound way. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 10:43, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

It would make a muh better section in the <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin_Group_f40e.html" title="Virgin Group">Virgin Group</a> article, which is at present basically an introductory paragraph and then a list of Virgin brands (which would probably work better as a separate list article). <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 10:44, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> There are a couple reason why deleting this list is not a good idea.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>1.) It is already well maintained, if not by me, it is by a host of others.</dd>
<dd>2.) The page can have Japanese names attached, something no Category page can do. See <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_animation_listed_by_year.html" title="Chinese animation listed by year">Chinese animation listed by year</a> for example.</dd>
<dd>3.) The reason why this list exist is because the original "list of animes" got too huge to maintain. Why are we going backwards?</dd>
<dd>4.) From animenewsnetwork if you extract the anime list to raw text, it comes out to a 4MB file. No one would ever go to wikipedia article that is 4MB of raw text.</dd>
<dd>5.) This page does not include Hentai. The same go for both movie and TV series page. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjwong_5487.html" title="User:Benjwong">Benjwong</a> 04:02, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A joke a joke, but seriously, even if the vast majority of hentai is... well... crap as far as plot goes, to exclude it simply because it's hentai is pretty much censorship. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 04:09, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - reply.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>1.) 49 edits to the page since 5 June. That is just over 8 edits a month. Well maintained?</dd>
<dd>2.) It can have Japanese names attached, but it doesn't. It also can have references attached but doesn't. How about we evaluate the article on what it does have?</dd>
<dd>3.) We're not going backwards by deleting redundant information. There are several categories that do the same job that this list does.</dd>
<dd>4.) I think I see your point on this one and wikipedia has several advantages over ANN, but remember the categories vs list argument as well.</dd>
<dd>5.) As per what Ned Scott said, wikipedia is not censored</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The goal was never to duplicate the "list of anime". The category pages already do that. Whether it is ranked by year or alphabetical, it doesn't matter. What matters is that this list highlights a few animes out of the thousands for convenience.

<li>We will add the additional reasons and proof of the notoriety. Every step that I have been insructed to do to keep this article on WIlk has been done.

<li>With all do respect, as I mentioned, why do you consider Dave Hart to hace a lack of notability? Mr. Hart is known throughout the United States and has been an imporatant figure in many areas. In, since the main page was created, we have strived to follow every request to add references, etc. Also, just FYI the WILI link from the Dave Hart website has been removed since this seemed to be a problem. WHat in the world do we have to do to keep this page other than all of the changes and additions that we have already made. It seems to me that no page is safe and perhaps it may pass with 15 editors but then when one finds it to be non imporatant it gets deleted. Is this how Wikipedia works? Should I just gove up here or what?? I truly feel that this is a proper contribution to Wikipedia and just because you haven't heard of Dave Hart doesn't mean that thousands or millions of others haven't.

<li><b>Delete It</b> - Stop wasting time talking about it. Just delete the damn thing. Just for the record, I am Dave Hart's web master, I am not Dave Hart. You folks keep saying that this is a conflict of interest because "Dave Hart is editing his own page!" I know the WIKI rules and if I was trying to be sneeky, why the hell would I have created the username of Dave Hart and not my own? When I sat the account up, I assumed that the username had to be the title name as well. WOW, you spent so much time anylizing this!! I set this page up (not as a marketing tool) but as many people consider Mr. Hart to be "imporatant." I am sorry that you don't, but you do have the power to delete the biography so DO IT!! Also, since all of you think you have figured it out see these notes: Passion of the... wrote "subject such as labeling himself a 'great man' and pretending to be a third-party "attesting" to the subject's community involvement and charitable activities ...Mr. Hart then attempted to cover his tracks by blanking the talk page entry, including a subsequent response from a user raising WP:COI objections to the article." MY Response, Dave Hart is a great man and does many charitable activities. It amazes me how much you spent going through the history on this stuff thinking you are diugging up "dirt" on someone. And then I, Steven Reed NOT Dave Hart did not try to "blank the talk page entry" to cover anything up. I made the necessary changes then I thought that I was able to delete the notes stating the errors since they had been fixed. There you go, now stop wasting time and just delete the Dave Hart page. People try to contribute to this site and you shoot them down. It's not like I stuck a site up of a local gas station of something..(here is my signed username&#160;: DAVE HART)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Although since just thoroughly reading the details on COI I agree, I think that some of you have forgotten about your own WIKI rule:</li>
</ul>
<p>"During debates in articles' talk pages and at articles for deletion, disparaging comments may fly about the subject of the article/author and the author's motives. These may border on personal attacks, and may discourage the article's creator from future considerate contributions. Avoid using the word "vanity" in a deletion discussion — such an accusation may be defamatory. Please assume good faith, and don't bite the newcomers."</p>
<p>May I say that this is exactly what has happened here. After recieving constructive criticism from WIKI user such as Elonka, we made the effort to do everything to make the user page acceptable. Then, suddenly this morning all of the derogatory accusations began flying. Of coarse I take it personnal when those who are avid WIKI's appear to be dirt digging and trying to make it as if I have tried doing things towards the wrong. Issues such as deleting an item from an editor was done because I did not know any different. As it was mentioned, I thought that once the issue was addressed, the editors note be deleted. My Bad!! But please don't try to make like I am trying to cover something up. I will speak with Jimmy about this next week. JR Horse used the term Vanity several times. Also, this is not conflict of interest, the actual Dave Hart has only seen the WIKI page of himself a couple of times and I did not recieve any compansation to create it. I am paid to manage his corporate website only. Thanks, Steve R on behalf of User talk:Dave Hart 16:09, 28 December 2006</p>

<p>I really cannot do much better here than to quote the final paragraph: "For people who desire treatment for the balloon fetish, is suggested Neuro Linguistic Programming. In fact, due to the very lack of information is observed by the Psychotherapy professionals the fetish is thought to be very obscure. Because of the perceived obscure nature of the fetish, fetishists keeping it secret, it is very common for Psychologists never to have heard about it." So there you have it. A fetish that most psychologists have never heard of, with (in confirmation) zero credible medical or psychological sources. The article is long, but reads as <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and is heavily compromised by weasel words. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 11:12, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> This is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, and judging by the lack of reliable sources, it does not seem appropriate to have an article on such a fetish at this time.

<p>Another unsourced paraphilia. The closest it comes to a reliable source is citing Joyce, who the article speculates <i>may</i> have had the fetish. For fetishes we should require at the very least some citations from reliable sexual health and medical sources. Gassyerotica.com probably does not <i>quite</i> qualify there...

<p>No ghits for this vehicle: appears to be probable hoax. I can't find anything on any car magazine websites about this, and no sources have been cited.

<dd>Because there's issues of size (the articles get fairly big, and if we were doing this season after season after season...) and the fact that an individual Premiership goal isimply isn't that notable, as commented below.

That <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antoine_Sibierski_06f9.html" title="Antoine Sibierski">le Sib</a> has scored two goals this year, whilst surprising, isn't paticularly notable. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 21:00, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b> I think that this article and others of the same kind are very important and need to be kept because they help in any form of research, wether it is proffessional or personal. The template for football players which includes the amount of goals they've made for the club is not season-wise and it sometimes take long to update while this articles are usually updated instantaneously. I've looked for this kind of information in other sites and for other leageus such as Germany, and I've had no luck finding one. This articles can be consulted for knowledge about how is a player or a team is doing in the league and to know who has scored the goals for the team and how many they have. About size, these article don't grow more than they already are. Hardly you get new scorers by this time of the year. And I have to completely agree with Mjefm on why to make Wikipedia less informative just for the sake of it. Combines, these goalscorers articles don't occupy more then a megabyte on Wikipedia's servers. It's not like it includes any pictures.200.121.177.124 21:31, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> A professional footballer is notable, a goalscorers in <i>top division of very notable league</i> is even more.

<li><b>Very strong keep</b> as per several speakers above. These lists provide lots of information which gives the readers of "our" encyclopedia the opportunity to see which players scored which amount of goals for a certain club in a certain season. I don't see why this would be overkill. The information is notible to the players which are notible to have an article in the encyclopedia. For those who don't have an article yet or those who are stubs these lists can easily help creating better articles on the players as more information on them is available and easily accessible, by creating links or by a simple click on the player's "what links here section". The comment that says the articles are becoming too large is total nonsense to me. So far the articles are not too large and I doubt they will be as the seasons in Europe are all half way or over already and you can assume most players who will score a goal in the second part of the season already have scored at least one goal in the first part of the season. Of course some players will be added who did not score a goal yet, but the articles won't be expanded that much anymore according to the size. A lot of people spend lots of their free time in this encyclopedia, inclusive very useful lists like these. Not that that particular fact should be a reason not to delete the articles, but I personally would feel all the time I spent in these articles would be thrown away in just one simple click for deletion. Better spend some more time in looking for total crap in this encyclopedia instead of deleting useful information. Also, the existance of these pages is already known for months. The pages have been updated ever since and are currently correct. Concluding that these have not been up for deletion in the past you can assume no one has had problems with them in the past. Everybody let the editors update these lists before nominating these for deletion in late December, so all work would be for nothing. Pretty sad in my opinion, but we will see what will happen, all I can do is give you my opinion and here it is.

<dd><b>In addition'</b> does this also mean we are going to delete all scored goals information from the players articles? Thousands of players on Wikipedia have their goals specified like in these goalscoring articles mentioned on their own articles year after year as well. Some, like in <a href="../../../b/o/u/Boudewijn_Zenden_d4aa.html" title="Boudewijn Zenden">Boudewijn Zenden</a> for instance even have them specified for league, cup, Champions League etc. If the goals are not notible in one article, why would they be notible in another article? I'm not telling these statistics on the players should be deleted, but if we are going to delete these goalscoring lists as they are considered overkill then the only conclusion can be that all the goals scored by a player should not be mentioned on their article page as that would be overkill and because Wikipedia is not Soccerbase, or any other football player profile page. <a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESportsAddicted_c1a4.html" title="User:SportsAddicted"><b>SportsAddicted</b></a> | <small><a href="../../../s/p/o/User_talk%7ESportsAddicted_7258.html" title="User talk:SportsAddicted"><font color="dimgray">discuss</font></a></small> 04:54, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hmm, this is a slightly bizzare argument - you appear to be calling for the same information to be displayed twice? I agree that a lsit of appearances and caps on a player's page is notable. But such information renders pages such as these redundent.</dd>
<dd>As for size issues - this is more a precdent thing. At the moment, we're talking about 14 aritcles for one season. But what if next year this is reapeated for every top level football league in Europe? And then someone adds a try scorer list for the Super Leauge? And that continues season after season after season. Suddenly, we have thoudands of fairly large pages that are a collection of facts and trivia, not knolwedge. The top scoreres in a league is relevant in a league summary. A player's total appearances and goals scored is relevant info in a page about him. Lists such as this one are not relevant. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 09:58, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's not a bizzare argument. Just try to find something random on Wikipedia and you will most likely find it again somewhere else on Wikipedia, but in a slightly different form. That's also the case in this situation. The stats on player pages are extremely notible to the player in question. Once on his article page you see the amount of goals scored and you wonder where he was in the top goalscorers rankings for that season. Was he the club top goalscorer? Was he among the top 10 of the goalscorers in that league during the season? This way these questions are answered. If these are not available you should know each and every team mate in a certain year, browse to all of their separate player pages to find out the same results that can be found in these lists in one simple view. Yes it's the same information, but it's there in a different form, just like many other facts described on Wikipedia. As for the sizes, yes you're right, Wikipedia is growing and will always keep on growing as long as it will exist. You can't stop that and that should not be stopped as that would prevent us creating an encyclopedia that is as complete as possible. It will never be complete, but if we are leaving out notible information it might get lost and no one will ever be able to find this information again. The grow of Wikipedia should not be an argument to delete these documents. <a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESportsAddicted_c1a4.html" title="User:SportsAddicted"><b>SportsAddicted</b></a> | <small><a href="../../../s/p/o/User_talk%7ESportsAddicted_7258.html" title="User talk:SportsAddicted"><font color="dimgray">discuss</font></a></small> 00:17, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. Wikipedia is not a news-reporting data dump. Only fans would remotely be interseted in this extemely high level of detail. In answer to everyone above who is jumping up and down and exclaiming that we should make this wiki as informative as possible, I MUST point out that this website is NOT free and requires extensize physical hardware which cost money to operate. So, please, before you vote to keep this useless drivel, look at the green bar at the top of the page. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMiracleMat_90d1.html" title="User:MiracleMat">MiracleMat</a> 07:47, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - but merge them into a 'results' or 'scorers' page. It's not non-notable information. Commentators of football frequently reference to such information, which it may be pointed out is most definitely fact and usable. As per arguments above regarding to size, yes, too much, cut it into one page and reduce the amount of info.

<li><b>Keep</b> - This kind of information is very useful to some people, its not useless drivel (just look at the new pages to see the usual pathetic nonsense that gets added to wikipedia). This is information that is factually correct, kept uptodate and is often unavailable without subscription. As for the "delete it to save space argument" I think there are plenty of vanity pages, made up rubbish and irrelevant nonsense articles on wikipedia to get rid of before we start removing verifiable information for the sake of space. By all means merge the articles, but to erase them completely, would be removing information just for the sake of it.<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKing_of_the_North_East_f9ad.html" title="User:King of the North East">King of the North East</a> 13:12, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> These are pages which should be left on wikipedia. Wikipedia is about arranging information for internet users in a readily accessable way. This is the most in dept and accessable information on goalscorers in major leagues on the net. Destroying this information is doing internet users a diservice.

<li><b>Comment</b> There seems to be a lot of discussion on how valuable the information is to a certain group of people... but that has never been a sole qualification for what gets kept and what gets removed. Plenty of things are useful to certain people that aren't notable or go beyond the scope of detail necessary. The usefulness of the information is not relevant, as far as I can tell. It's not one of the criteria that the deletion process is designed to consider. 206.213.209.31 17:23, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>&lt;reduce indent&gt;My logic behind saying 'this information, whilst useful, is not valid for Wikipedia' has two fundamental underpinnings:
<ul>
<li>The 'indiscriminate information' means that we don't just include everything factual. We are instead, in the business of recording <i>knowledge</i>. A list of countries by their GDP is knowledge because it informs us as to the relative macro-economic performances of countries, and is a statistic used by a number of institutions when formulating policy. A list of FA Cup winners is knowledge because it shows the victors of an important competition through the ages and the changes that have occured in English football. A list of the top scorers in a season in English football is knowledge, for similar reasons. However, a list of every goal in the Premiership/SerieA/La Liga (never mind the Libyan Prem and Dutch Second Division) is <i>not</i> knolwedge; it is trivia, it is statistics, it may be other things, but its not 'knowledge'. <i>Indiscriminate</i> refers to the fact that we are not discriminating between knowledge and other facts</li>
<li>As noted before, the scope for these articles to grow is quite frightening. We're basically justifying the creation of simialar articles for every season of football throughout in history in any top or second level league. THAT is a lot of info and that is the sort of stuff that should be in a football stats database, not an ecyclopedia. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 18:32, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Of course these pages are knowledge and the information is not only useful but also notible for the leagues, the players and the clubs. It informs us about which player scored for which team in which year and where he was in the top goalscorers list among his team mates. Wahetever you make out of it that information is notible. It may not be of your interest, but something not being of your interest should not be a reason to delete it from an encyvlopedia. The lists could be merged into the articles describing the seasons if that would be better for the servers, but from what I have seen everywhere on Wikipedia is that we try to keep article pages as small as possible and we create subpages where possible, to prevent the original articles becoming too large. I agree with Robdurbar that this is information that should be available in a football stats database, but that does still not say this information should not be on Wikipedia. If you can provide me a website on the internet that has all this information available for all these leagues let me know. RSSSF has a lot of information available, they have all matches, sometimes even with goalscorers and line-ups available in any league, but does not give us the information described in the way they are described in these lists. <a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESportsAddicted_c1a4.html" title="User:SportsAddicted"><b>SportsAddicted</b></a> | <small><a href="../../../s/p/o/User_talk%7ESportsAddicted_7258.html" title="User talk:SportsAddicted"><font color="dimgray">discuss</font></a></small> 00:36, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep all</b>. We should be encouraging editors who are prepared to write football articles and not discouraging them. We are not short of server space (and if we are the ever increasing barometer at the top of this page will buy lots more!) so the arguments over length, precedent etc don't hold water. These articles comply with all WP policies and as stated above are of both interest and use to some people. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 02:42, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: if WP isn't here to be a useful internet source of information, what is it here for? It's own sake? Articles such as this have merit, are useful, concert a noteworthy subject (there are far more obscure subjects on WP that professional football, for goodness sake). Besides, the <i>WP is not an Almanac</i> 'rule' was only recently dreamt up and has subsequently been removed. An encyclopaedia is simply a collation of information.

<li><b>Strong, strong (as strong as it gets!) keep</b>. The article has been renamed, and most reviewers seemed to accept this compromise. So, I honestly do not understand this new AfD. In any case, I strongly believe that we definitely need this article. The whole issue is very important (the article does not fail WP:N), notable and with many parametres we can develop. In the research I started to conduct, I read and learnt about an alleged genocide conducted against Kurds in 1937-1938. I do not necessarily endorse these allegations, but they are important issues and in my recent sourced edits you'll see the huge reprecussions of these events (such as the persecutions of a prominent Turk sociology). I do not argue for keeping this article because of blind nationalism. I may become unpleasant to the nominator or to other reviewers, but I strongly believe that we need this article for strictly encyclopedic reasons. I will continue my research and I'm sure I'll find other, even more interesting parametres. POV and OR can be dealt with, but encyclopedic knowledge shouldn't be thoughtlessly deleted.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 15:08, 28 December 2006 (UTC):*I have already started providing verifiable sources per WP:V.

<dd>I suggest writing about those historic events under their respective titles (such as the said rebellion) rather than a blanket article about Kurdish rights in general.

<dd>Cat out, do not hurry! More sources are coming! I'm gathering such important material about the "Bersim genocide or massacre", that I am now thinking that the first title of the article (<a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdish_Genocide_a65e.html" title="Kurdish Genocide">Kurdish Genocide</a>) was not after all so inaccurate as I was initially convinced. I am thinking about proposing the renaming of the article and the adoption of its initial title. If you think my sources from Google Search are biased, then provide your own sources and conduct your own research!--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 15:41, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I think well-researched information on historical genocides is very important, but the problem with this article is that it makes no attempt to discuss both sides of the event, nor does it document the events so well that that it makes it possible to treat potential criticisms dismissively, as mere fringe beliefs (as with <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a>, which has 60 references). If you'd like to get this article accepted, you need to provide much stronger sourcing (more than one book, and an email archive) and you need to make an attempt to write it in a neutral voice. For now, I'd suggest taking some of your sourced information and amending existing articles on human rights or Kurdish history to reflect this information (where it will undoubtably be read by more people anyway). <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 15:31, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree and I provide verifiable sources from Google Search.

<ul>
<li>Can you find some verifiable media sources that name the event? I don't really understand what was wrong with the original "Kurdish Genocide" title, since that seems more descriptive, but perhaps there are no media sources that ever used that term (the new title strikes me as vague relative to what you want to talk about in this article). <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 16:08, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I am now conducting the material and making my own research. Until now, I was not actively involved in the article.

<li>Your statement that youare "making [your] own research" is troubling because it suggests you are using Wikipedia to publish original research. If you reference your own research it needs to be peer-reviewed research published by another reliable entity, or better yet, research that's been done independent of you. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 16:32, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>My own research of sources Tarinth. What has this to do with OR? Let's not argue for trivia. I do know how Wikipedia works; it is not the first time I am editing an article. See my edits and if you see any OR tell me. I only use verifiable sources.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 16:37, 28 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is original research to merge two/three unrelated incidents. The Dersim incident can be it's own article but has no connection with the incident involving the PKK nor does it have any connection with the European Human rights court decisions.<br />
With statements like "Beşikçi paid a heavy price for his moral and intellectual courage" I question the neutrality of the said source. I also question the objectivity of the editor writing the statement to the article. The question "why is a person with Greek origin is writing an article about Turkish/Kurdish history and human rights issues" bothers me. There is also the allegations of Greek vote stacking on the previous AfD.<br />

<li>Cool Cat, you oblige me to officially ask you to substantiate these allegations against me. I have the right to edit any article I want as long as I do not violate Wikipedia policies. If you think I do violate any Wiki policy, proceed to the due actions; otherwise, avoid unsubstantiated personal attacks. If you think my sources are biased, provide yours and contradict my findings. I'll rephrase the sentence you mentioned, because it qualifies indeed for POV - my mistake. But apart of that, I feel offended by your comments against me, and I ask you to provide evidence or to recall.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 19:27, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

I cited one example on how what you wrote was biased, I probably can cite more. If you consider that a personal attack thats your problem and frankly I could care less.<br />
I am not required nor expected to contradict your "findings". You are however required to write neutral articles and this one is far from neutral and it is digging into further bias and original research.<br />

<li>I'm cool, but I'm accepting no unsubstantiated allegation against me. Therefore, I hope you won't repeat them. The argument of Original research is obviously ill-grounded. Everything I write is based on sources. Unless you regard the reports of EU, the decisions of the European Court or the articles of Economist as OR?!!!! It is your right, of cource, but I'm afraid that you are not particularly convincing. Now, as far as POV is concerned, everything I write is based on verifiable sources. Now, if you disagree, please contradict them. Speaking generally for POV does not help. If my phrasing is somewhere wrong, as you saw, I'm willing to change it (as I proved). But the most important it this: I do not accept allegations like this one: "There is also the allegations of Greek vote stacking on the previous AfD". If you think somebody committed vote stacking, go and speak to him; not to me. Don't throw phrases like these in order to create a wrong impression against me. You chose the wrong guy for such unsubstantiated accusations.

Reports of EU, articles from the Economist and etc are not necessarily without bias. So far you have been only relying on sources "accusing". You also seem to be covering minor incidents.<br />

<dd>An argument in favor of merger is that if your information is notable and useful to people, then it's more likely that people looking for your subject will find the information they're looking for...

<li><b>Keep</b> per Yannismarou. Turkey is a nation with a huge role in the history of the Middle East and Europe. There is no need to shove all human rights concerns with respect to Turkey into one article, when there are multiple reliable sources with respect to this one aspect of Turkish human rights. The article has numerous independent and verifiable sources.

<li><b>Comment</b> Now back to square one&#160;:) I still think that some people have not understood why this is a fork... HR of KP in TR inevitably covers other subjects in HR in TR. The whole article is simply a mirror site, but only concentrating on HR as concerns the Kurdish people. The article is big <i>because</i> most of its info comes from other articles. Yannis, I don't think that you understand the true nature of the merge proposal: gender-equality is already talked about in HR in TR for example. <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurds_in_Turkey_c5e2.html" title="Kurds in Turkey">Kurds in Turkey</a> and casualties of the TR-PKK conflict already cover many sections in this article. In fact, I really think that this article is a fork of THREE articles as is. Well, I will restart working on HR in TR article soon, and when it will be finished it will cover the same thing as here. There is no need to list every single ECHR case either, even in <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion_in_Turkey_89ae.html" title="Religion in Turkey">Religion in Turkey</a> article the landmark ECHR headscarf case is talked about in two sentences, not three <i>looong</i> paragraphs like it is here.

<dd>The article is concentrated on the Kurds and elaborates on their human rights. The fact that it is related with other articles or that it repeats some assessments does not outdo the fact that:1) the topic is notable, 2) the article can stand as a seperate article, 3) POVs can be addressed, 4) the OR allegation is now at least weak. This is what I believe, and that is why I do not endorse the merger proposal. Now, if you re-work the articles you say and the overlaps become "annoying", we can reopen the whole discussion. It is not a problem to create new sub-articles, if these articles have a reason of existence and an encyclopedic value. This article fulfils both these criteria IMO. Again, I do not try to impose my opinion here. I respect your arguments, but I cannot endorse them.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 08:55, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Bio of "prophetic geographer" credited with, among other things, being the first to note that India was an emerging world power (in, from what I can tell, 2005) and being a profound influence on someone the article refers to as "George Walter Bush, junior, the USA President". The sources that clearly bear on the subject are from MSN groups; the others appear mostly to underpin other aspects of the article's tortuous argument. The man most likely exists, but whether his world influence rises to the <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">notable</a> certainly seems questionable. His name has recently been inserted into a range of other articles, from <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminist_geography.html" title="Feminist geography">Feminist geography</a> to <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geopolitics.html" title="Geopolitics">Geopolitics</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertissimo_7443.html" title="User:Robertissimo">Robertissimo</a> 15:13, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Though there is a citation list, external link list, and sources list, the article is very difficult to navigate right now. I'm hoping someone who cares about the article being kept will take the time to clean this up, i.e. connect facts in the article with the source from which they come. Also, the MSN links add a particularly unprofessional flavor; please consider providing more scholarly sources if they are available.

<li><b>KEEP</b> . <i>Thakur Sher Singh Parmar</i> and <i>Sher Singh Parmar</i> are variants of the same name.If a person has contributed to so many branches of geography, then naturally it is reflected in terms of his inclusion unde many headings.Receipt of a national level award like Dr.Manibhai Desai Rashtraseva Puraskar for contribution to hindi literature itself shows this person is notable.NO NON-NOTABLE RECEIVES SUCH A PRESTIGIOUS AWARD.The sources of dainiks show clearly that all his poems have been published and as such these have found a mention on the page. If this seems to be a biography , well what other Wikipedians doing - why don't they improve upon it.Its very easy to destroy or delete anything but it needs some hard work to improve.So why we don't improve upon this article instead of being bent upon destroying it.To say that "I don't see any MSN web pages on India's page. It does have several .gov and .org links, which, like .edu links, tend to be a bit more scholarly than .com ... and especially groups.msn.com." is sheer nonsense because scholarly articles can appear on any web pages including the MSN pages and by the way one can doubt that the so-called scholarly artciles on ".gov and .org links" are there simply because the scholars writing these had good personal relations with their editors and so managed to get their articles published there. All the objections being raised have only one clear aim of deleting this page, seems people are bent upon deleting this page.Honest officers like Sher Singh Parmar have thousands enemy who would like to see that no one comes to know of these honest people."And I cannot find any of these variants in book sources such as <a href="http://www.worldcat.org" class="external text" title="http://www.worldcat.org" rel="nofollow">WorldCat</a>." saying this is just running away from truth.If his name is not found on some searches then it means that the people running those searches have poor technology unlike GoogleIf we apply the logics being given by all these counter-vandal patrollers and others, then we have to delete all the pages from Wikipedia.There shall be no Wikipedia at all.I request the ADMINISTARTORS OF WIKIPEDIA TO BE MORE VIGILANT AND RETAIN THE CURRENT PAGE.</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - Thanks for the clarification; I can now comfortably move my input from weak to strong delete. I have requested more information, asked relevant questions, suggested room for improvement and have not received any answers other than POV. If my questions were answered (perhaps the most important being one I posted here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Amita_karpe" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Amita_karpe" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>), I would gladly help you clean up the article in hopes of it surviving the AfD process. If there is no material published regarding this person in a book with an ISBN or a journal with an ISSN, then ... he is probably not noteworthy and doesn't deserve an article in WP. If you have the ISBN or ISSN, then please share it so I can verify it with my own resources. Another piece of information that would be helpful, since I've heard this is such a prestigious award, is a verifiable source listing of all the other winners of Dr. Manibhai Desai Rashtraseva Puraskar's award, before and after Thakur Sher Singh Parmar's receipt. <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeesiewonder_39bb.html" title="User:Keesiewonder">Keesiewonder</a> 13:04, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Comment - I don't doubt that the book exists, and I don't doubt that there are many copies of it. However, if with my research and communication skills, I cannot find any reference to the book, and no-one can give me a citation that points to a published book, then, I am not convinced that we need an article on Parmar at this time.

<p>Kinshasa Highway could be any road in the direction of Kinshasa. The article is about a network of roads in central Africa that are not clearly defined. Only one or two books mention this "Kinshasa Highway" or highway to Kinshasa as a catalyst for the spreading of AIDS. This topic is not notable enough to be its own article and should be mentioned only in the history of AIDS. <a href="../../../m/o/y/User%7EMoyogo_6e0f.html" title="User:Moyogo">moyogo</a> 01:03, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>, I may not have been sufficiently clear. There is no formal highway in Congo named "Kinshasa Highway"; it's an informal name for at least two concatenated routes that run from the Rwanda/Burundi/Uganda region to Kinshasa. This is only <b>one</b> African highway that has been called an "AIDS highway". The name and concept are usually attached to an unfinished Trans-African highway that's somewhat farther north, and nowhere near Kinshasa. Additionally, the concept of a highway being implicated in the spread of HIV is invoked in other places where HIV infection is rampant. I see the possibility of 1, an article on the real, separate Congo highways on this alignment, 2, an article on the Trans-African Highway which may yet be completed this decade, 3, an article on AIDS highways as a concept. I don't see the article as it stands helping anybody looking stuff up, because it's too vague.

The information that we are adding is referenced and well organised information which could be viewed as useful. How this information strays from the meaning of the word encyclopedia I don't know. You should try to go on the internet to find detailed results of matches from the internet as we were doing and discover how hard it actually is to find such detailed information. I also put the word comprehensive in bold. More detail is what we need here and not less.<a href="../../../n/i/a/User%7ENiall123_9f3d.html" title="User:Niall123">Niall123</a> 13:34, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Very Strong Retain</b> -. The information is encyclopaedic, they are major world leagues. We have lists of all sorts of things on WP - palindromes, English historical counties. Just being a list does not mean something is not encyclopaedic. If you delete the results you should delete all sorts of lists on astronomy, geography and so on as they probably appear in Whittaker's Almanac. The whole point of WP is that it is definitive and detailed. If they were the Wakefield &amp; District Sunday league results fair enough, but please everybody stop your tiresome and objectionable campaign against sport articles. If you wanted to delete it, have the decency to say at the <i>start</i> of the season. I don't know who updates them but it probably takes them forever.

<dd>The "we're half way through the season" argument doesn't really work. Lots of people put in a lot of effort on lots of articles that get deleted.

<li><b>Very Strong Retain</b>: I agree with the WP code; but then we should decide what's the meaning of "important tournament", since NBA, NHL, Serie A, La Liga, Bundesliga, Premier League are all important tournaments in their sports.

<ul>
<li>The subject of the article has strongly objected to there being an article about him.</li>
<li>He is forced to check it every day for libel, slander etc.</li>
<li>He has now been banned for trying to get the article removed.</li>
<li>He has made an anti-Wikipedia website, and is a regular poster on the Wikipedia review. Probably both in response to this article.</li>

<li>Thank you, I am aware of that. The reason why something has not happened before, however, may prove instructive in deciding whether allowing it to start should happen. You have no offered a compelling reason or really even a legitimate reason as to why Daniel Brandt should be allowed to dictate whether he has an article or not. He's notable. "Exceptional" case or not, he has an article and there is no reason why he shouldn't. If he doesn't like it, I'm sorry, but the proverbial genie is out of the metaphorical bottle and Mr Brandt doesn't get to stuff it back inside. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 18:35, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Incredibly strong keep</b> not just because of the notability of the subject, but because the nominator does not provide any reason for requesting deletion.

<li><b>Speedy keep</b>. Notable enough and the consensus is in favour. What I oppose is this afd, plenty of us check this article daily for libel etc not just Brandt, though dont know why he bothers as due to his own behaviour he is banned from editing. If George W.

Brandt is internationally notable and far too important to consider having no article about him. 10 times is a mockery of our processes, as is the timing when many regular editors are on holiday and this page should be speedied, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 19:02, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> the subject of a biography does not determine if he belongs here or not. Libel issues need concrete examples. Diffs please?

I urge that this article be deleted simply because it is disruptive to the project. We don't need to have it, and it has directly and indirectly caused grief to many editors.

<li><b>Keep</b> because it's a neologism that has entered widespread usage.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not sure what exactly all these "transwiki" votes want transwikied. Are these actually votes of confidence that the article properly defines "Player hater"? Because I don't think it does - I think it's one single random and perhaps nonstandard opinion, akin to an urbandictionary entry - which is why I&#160;!voted delete. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 07:54, 29 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The Transwiki option is not so much a vote that the definition is correct as stands and should be migrated to another wiki, it's simply a vote that it should to be migrated to another wiki. Whether it's correct... well, I guess that's up to the editors on Wiktionary in this particular case. =^_^= Not to say that it should be transwiki'd if it's incorrect; it should be correct, natch. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 00:01, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Things don't get deleted just because they are incorrect or incomplete - they get fixed. The first step towards fixing this is to get it on the right site - which is Wiktionary. The editors there will correct it and bring it up to their standards. <a href="../../../k/o/w/User%7EKoweja_a591.html" title="User:Koweja">Koweja</a> 00:43, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I have an opinion that all Extremism sites should be removed whether they are about Hinduism, Islam, Christianity or any other, because those extremist elements are not derived from the ‘Truth’ of those religions but from those of who were ‘Fanatic’ of those religions or misused those religions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Jesus Christ never said anywhere to spread the God’s message in ruthless ways, but what had actually happened in the Old Europe, West Asia and rest of the world. The newly Christianized Emperors and their local rulers destroyed the most beautiful Pagan Temples in then Roman Empire everywhere in the Old Europe and West Asia. Frankish King Charlemagne in the Saxon Wars converted Saxons into Christianity by massacring thousands of them ruthlessly. The European colonizers in Asia, Africa and Americas so ruthlessly killed native inhabitants to convert them into Christianity and destroyed their Temples. Islamic kings and Emperors were not second to others.</p>
<p>Even in the Hindu society was and is divided by various caste systems. But if you carefully analyze there is mystery on many things of their originality. Whether they really represent the original Hinduism or the derivatives, which was blended with.</p>
<p>When the Indo-Europeans conquered the Indus-Valley Civilization there were not only a mixture of religious faiths but also the customs and practices based on the dominant group toward the early Hinduism for their survival. One can’t rule out the warriors who conquered and married the local women brought the customs for their survival, which latter derived into rigid caste systems in India and the marginalization of widows for their own purposes. So it is not prudent to observe Extremism in Hinduism, but wipe out those weeds of customs, which were introduced within the Hinduism from the pre-historical times and the fanatics who misuse the Hinduism.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, there is an article on <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu_nationalism.html" title="Hindu nationalism">Hindu nationalism</a>. The comparison with, say, 'Islamic extremism' doesn't work. 'Islamic extremism' (although I don't suggest that this would be an NPOV naming) is, in many cases, an ideological movement seeking to establish a political and legal system based in Islamic teachings. This is not really the case regarding so-called 'Hindu extremists'. Hindu nationalists (RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal, etc.) are not necessarily very devout religious people, but rather Hinduism is a group identity around which politics is formed. --<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESoman_c37c.html" title="User:Soman">Soman</a> 15:55, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

A <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Pure+obsessional+OCD%22+-%22it+is+distinct+from+traditional%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Pure+obsessional+OCD%22+-%22it+is+distinct+from+traditional%22" rel="nofollow">Google search for "Pure obsessional OCD" -"it is distinct from traditional"</a> seems to weed out most of the Wikipedia article mirrors, and leaves only 160 Google hits, of which many are blogs, chat forums, or yet other mirrors of, or indices generated from, Wikipedia. Only one of these hits is from a .edu domain, and that's from a wiki.</p>
<p>I propose that this article be <b>deleted</b> unless it can be shown from peer-reviewed medical literature that this is a widely-used medical diagnosis, rather than a neologism. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 19:28, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - As a person who has obsessive compulsive disorder, I can tell you that many in the blogosphere and web forums have coined this term. I would normally want to maintain the article even if it hadn't been recognized as a disorder formally yet, but it fits as other symptoms and disorders. If a person ruminates but does not perform compulsive behaviors to directly or indirectly relieve the anxiety, the person is simply ruminating and probably has generalized anxiety disorder or a form of anxiety disorder involving a phobia or several phobias. If a person ruminates and does perform compulsive behaviors to directly or indirectly relieve the anxiety, the person has obsessive compulsive disorder.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, on second thought, I'd like to rescind my vote; though I disagree with some of the group's past aims (notably trying to block a parking structure for park visitors), as a group, the organization has received plenty of attention not only in local Atlanta media, but from similar groups and media in support of and in relation to large urban parks across the nation (Griffith Park in L.A., Lincoln Park in Chicago, Jackson Square in New Orleans, and others).

<p>The article was originally nominated for speedy deletion per A7, no assertion of notability.

The group's <a href="http://www.parkertrio.com/n/references.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.parkertrio.com/n/references.shtml" rel="nofollow">site</a> doesn't provide much as far as references except for pastors from around North America (though this could indicate that they've toured the continent).

For instance, <a href="http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/14036.html" class="external text" title="http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/14036.html" rel="nofollow">Marc Sageman</a> testified to the <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_Commission_ffe5.html" title="9/11 Commission">9/11 Commission</a> that:"<i><a href="http://www.9-11commission.gov/hearings/hearing3/witness_sageman.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.9-11commission.gov/hearings/hearing3/witness_sageman.htm" rel="nofollow">peaceful fundamentalist Muslim groups such as the Tablighi Jamaat may help to promote a peaceful message and repudiate terrorist violence. We need to elicit their help for they attract the same clusters of alienated young men as the Global Salafi Jihad and might provide them with a peaceful alternative to terror. Many such organizations are penetrated by the global jihad and we should help them regain their purity by unmasking those that subvert their message.</a></i>"</li>

My interpretation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> us wikipedia contributors should not be taking sides as to whether the the US allegation are credible. What we should do is provide the background necessary for wikipedia readers to make up their own mind as to the allegation's credibility.

<li><b>Keep</b> I originally tagged this for a speedy A7 at a time the article was in a much different form, didn't appear to assert notability, and lacked any sourcing. I probably jumped the gun and should have given the editor a chance to make further improvements. I still don't have an opinion on whether the article is factual or not (I'm just glad there -are- sources now) but I certainly think it is now a lot better than 95% of WP articles. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 21:52, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is a concept vehicle from a company that is not notable for anything else. It makes incredible claims with tons of marketing speak and is written almost entirely by one person, whose comments on uploaded pictures appear to me to imply that he's one of the two designers of the vehicle. It's being used as a platform for advertising. Please check the history to see the version before I started trying to clean it up. Not notable, advertisement, and Wikipedia is not a crystal ball. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 21:57, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> I agree with TomTheHand, more sources backing up some of the outlandish claims need to be provided, perhaps some reputable news source has done a story on this vehicle. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J.

<ul>
<li>The sources in question are just coverage of the claims made. A concept appeared at the 2006 Geneva auto show and there was a flurry of press because of the claims made, much like what happened with the Barabus TKR (successful AFD <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Barabus_TKR_8496.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Barabus TKR">here</a>). I see this AFD as essentially identical to that one: an unknown company brings a concept car to an auto show, claims it'll be the fastest thing <i>ever</i>, and gets drowned in press coverage. However, there's no actual <i>product</i>, at least not yet. This vehicle deserves an article when it actually exists; right now it's just hype and Wikipedia is <i>not</i> a crystal ball. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 01:39, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>I don't really see why concept cars are not appropriate for wikipedia especially if it is made clear that they are in fact concept cars and their performance claims are not substantiated.

<li><b>KEEP:</b> I work with the Speed Record Club, and it is my opinion that the inclusion of the Acabion is valid for the encyclopedia. I have tested the machine from an unbiased point of view, and have found Dr Maskus to be intelligent, knowledgeable and polite. The Acabion is his vision of the future, and this vehicle, in the same way as the Peraves project, is an important step in the development of environmentally friendly travel. Just because it is not well known yet is not a valid reason to delete it from the site. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Guttley (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Guttley_a949.html" title="Special:Contributions/Guttley">contribs</a>).</small>.</li>

<p>I created this page because I am a <b>fan</b> of cokelogic. This page not only contains relevance to an art, but a place in time with numerous references source. All facts are accurate and related to the subject matter. I ask, is Wikipedia an encyclopedia for <b>only</b> "popular" material? Not a record of history, but a catalog of pop culture. Exactly how many records must be sold before a band is noteworthy enough to be recognized by Wikipedia?<br />
I submit that no violation has been committed with this page. I am <b>not</b> a member of the band. I am a <b>fan</b> making a page for one<br />
of my favorite bands. And there is <b>nothing</b> in Terms of Service that that tells me I can't; in fact it encourages me to do so.<br />
Pernambuco's argument holds no water. I will overlook the personal attack laid upon me: I will debate his AfD submission, but I will not stand to be criticized as a "bad editor". To delete this page would be to deny useful and relevant information.--Paul Dempsey 14:33, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The new website contains many resources and useful links to learn more about the bands history, and experience their sound. I think this is a fantastic article with poignant thoughts and relevant info. It would be a shame to deprive so many people of this bands richly textued sound and arrangements. --Melissa Skorupa</p>

<p>This is outrageous. Am I actually reading that cokelogic is not noteworthy because, "they haven't won a Grammy"? The Doors never won a Grammy. Led Zeppelin never won a Grammy. Queen never won a Grammy. Should we tear them out of the history books? Madness.<br />
And let me understand that you must now have toured internationally, as a simple inner-national tour amounts to nothing in the eyes of Wikipedia?.<br />
And finally, I would like to point out yet another, 'editorial' in this so call fact sheet: "XM Radio...maybe? Not sure because XM will play nearly anything". Please site facts, not opinions. Suddenly we're calling in the merit of an international satellite company? It's becoming clear that this is not a matter of what is noteworthy for Wikipedia, but what people 'feel' is a popular, view 'hitting' page.<br />
Finally, let me editorialize a little myself. I can't remember when I had a bigger laugh than when Brian posed the question, "have they created a theme for a network TV show or movie"; oh, dear lord. Are these really your points for deletion consideration? As far as I can recall, The Rolling Stones never wrote a TV theme songs and they got into Wikipedia just fine. So if you are keeping score: The Rembrandts (the band that wrote the Friends theme song), one; The Rolling Stones, zero.<br />

<li>Paul, all I did was look at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> (Had you looked at it before making the article?). What I did was take each point from what that guidelines states and then stacked CokeLogic next to Wikipedia's standards. This is NOT personal. I enjoy their music, but they do not meet Wikipedia's standards. Even if one of the artists was a friend or relative, I still would have the opinion of Delete. Don't be upset at me for pointing out the short comings. No, the doors never created a theme, but they did have multi platinum records and were charted. They did tour internationally.

<li><b>Delete</b> - to clear up Paul Dempsey's confusion, think of it as a point-scoring system. You get one point for a Grammy, one point for having one or more charted hits, one point for having at least two albums on a major label, one point for major national or international tours, etc. So if you add up the scores for the Doors or the Beatles, you get at least five or six.

This is alarming. The negativity from this site is beyond words. Shot and a miss for our friend Xrifr; so brave to pass judgement while hiding behind a screen name. Wikipedia has accepted pages for <b>Paris Hilton</b>, <b>Ralph Wiggum</b> and <b>Toast</b>. <i>Three examples that hold only the most important of information in the great halls of this great institution</i>. A rich man's daughter who's claim to fame is gonzo pronogrpahy, a fictional cartoon chracter (not even a main character of The Simpsons, mind you) and Toast. All of these subjects are seen fit in the Wikipedia record books, but not the musicians of Cokelogic? If this Cokelogic page does not stand, there is something inherently wrong. Both with the structure of this site and the elitist navs who pester these grounds.--Paul Dempsey 12:18, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Paris Hilton was on the cover of many woman's mags, has many articles written about her from reliable, reputable sources and has co-starred in a TV show. (has CokeLogic done any of these?) Ralph Wiggum is a part of the popular 'Simpsons' TV program. Normally, instead of creating a very large page, information on each character is seperated out into it's own article. As an asside, most Microsoft software has it's own wikipedia page because adding it to the main page would create information overload. As for Toast...well who doesn't know about toast?&#160;:) Anyway, the point is...Do the above mentions meet wikipedia standards? Paris Hilton with <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>? Yes. Ralph with <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>?

<li><b>Delete</b> Sorry Paul. The difference between cokelogic and Ralph Wiggum, Paris Hilton, and Toast is that I've heard of those three but never heard of this band before.

So let me get this straight, because Lankybugger has not heard of Cokelogic, the information is therefore insubmissable? This is your arguement? Perhaps with a place like Wikipedia you can learn about something you haven't heard of. Learn about Cokelogic. Is this not the point of the site? But no need for any new information, if Lankybugger hasn't heard of it, it doesn't exist. Please counter-point this respond and sound ridiculous; I need a good laugh.--Paul Dempsey 21:57, 29 December 2006 (UTC)<br />

I refuse to believe that and I will stand up to this challenge. --Paul Dempsey 23:42, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>If you're going to quote me, it'd be nice if you did it in context. My point was not that I had not heard of this band and therefor it wasn't worthy of inclusion, but that the average person not in the underground music scene would not have heard of this band... and that they WOULD have at least a passing knowledge of who Paris Hilton is, what show Ralph Wiggum appears on, and what Toast is. They are notable simply by virtue of their immersion in popular culture. I'm sorry if that was unclear. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Lankybugger</a> 21:12, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Demiurge, I've read these before. If you <b>actually</b> read the debates above you'll see that you are last to point this out. I've stated before that I am a fan of the band putting up a page for Cokelogic. Now I'm being asked to be a professional investigator and pull up articles, TV apperences and the like. Since when has any page started "finished". Why do some of you add to the article. Do some research. The page should be dismissed because I don't have <b>all</b> the answers? Am I supose to know everything about the band?--Paul Dempsey 17:00, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Paul, I'm sorry if you're feeling picked on, but this is just one of the <i>hundreds</i> of articles listed for potential deletion each and every day. And this one (unlike many) was considered borderline enough to be listed for discussion first. Which means that it was posted where people who <i>do</i> know how to do some research are able to review it, and see if it can be salvaged. Many people (including me) browse the daily lists of articles to discuss to see what, if anything, can be salvaged. I know how to do some research on musical acts, and have helped salvage many articles, but I cannot find anything to help salvage this one. I'm sorry. [[Us<br />

<li><b>Comment</b> - while that's certain that you've made your case clear, we've also made ours equally clear - if this techno group is indeed notable as you insist it is, you need to stop arguing the point ad nauseam and improve the article. You have only argued with us and been generally uncivil, falling short only of <a href="../../../s/p/i/WP%7ESPIDER_911a.html" title="WP:SPIDER">climbing the Reichstag dressed as Spiderman</a>, and according to the article's history, the only thing you've done to the article is create it, not improve it. If you wish the article to be kept, then you need to improve the article, and likewise, you need to stop trying to <a href="../../../l/a/w/WP%7ELAWYER_7fd4.html" title="WP:LAWYER">lawyer</a> your way around with irrelevant examples as precedent for a keep, decontexted quoting, and generally being uncivil; by doing this, you aren't exactly going to win people over to your point of view. To distill this: if you want to change our minds, you need to improve the article, and stop wasting your time arguing. Unless you improve the article, my vote (for one) stands as delete. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 22:30, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hello, this is Pernambuco again, I am the person who listed Cokelogic for deletion, and Paul was angry with me for that, but it was nothing personal, I just gave my reasons and I wanted to hear what others think. My own opinion is unchanged until now, I still support deletion, and if it is not deleted, then at least it needs to be rewritten and improved, it is one of these two. The current article is just not very good, this is why I always thought it needed either delete or improvement. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPernambuco_dde4.html" title="User:Pernambuco">Pernambuco</a> 04:29, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You've done fine, Pernambuco. The ball is now - and frankly, has been - in Paul's court: like I said above to him, he needs to quit arguing and fix the article if it is not to be deleted. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 04:56, 2 January 2007 (UTC)<br />

<dd>thank you, it is normal that pages are deleted or improved, I saw this one, and I listed it for deletion. It was nothing personal against cokelogic or Paul (I do not know Paul, and I have never heard of this band cokelogic before in my life) and I want to say that this is not the first time that I am suggesting a page for deletion, however, it is the first time someone is angry about it, I am sorry, but I still feel the way that I do. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPernambuco_dde4.html" title="User:Pernambuco">Pernambuco</a> 14:58, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am open for suggestions. I'm hearing, 'improve the page' now. I'm not sure how to improve things here on a text based article. If anyone has suggestions, I'm will listen as it's closer to keeping the page up without threat.--Paul Dempsey 06:19, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As suggested before, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> will tell you of the verifiability guidelines, and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> will tell you of the notability guidelines. <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> in particular will apply here. Read those guidelines, and look for clues of this on the 'net. In particular, we're looking for anything - newspaper articles, for one; magazines, for another. Those are examples, and are by no means the limit - the articles I quote here will give you good guidelines of what to look for. In this case, Google is your friend - do your research.</dd>
<dd>One thing that's important to keep in mind - <i>we are not prejudiced to a deletion</i>. If you can get these guidelines going before the AfD here is complete, it's probably a keep; if you can't, and it gets deleted, keep up with your research, and go to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a> to get it undeleted when you complete it. What <i>would</i>, however, make us prejudiced to deletion in the future (should this get deleted in the meantime) is insistent recreation of the article with a failure to follow these guidelines. In I think a good idea behind this is probably looking at the recent AfD for comedian <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_2_the_Ranting_Gryphon_%282nd_nomination%29_93a2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/2 the Ranting Gryphon (2nd nomination)">2 The Ranting Gryphon</a>. (I submitted this one myself. I like the guy, and he's funny as hell, but <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">I like it</a> is not a suitable reason to keep something here - and he's only really that notable within the <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry_fandom.html" title="Furry fandom">furry fandom</a>.)</dd>
<dd>As soon as I (or someone else) can get it, there'll be an introduction to Wikipedia on your talk page, explaining what we're about, and explaining in brief the five "pillars" of Wikipedia. In the meantime, you may want to make a backup of the article <i>just in case</i>, and work on it in your userspace somewhere if it gets deleted.</dd>

<p>The group of people who were up for election in 2012 were up for election in 2006. This is six years away, all the senators listed could be retiring, no one is going to make an annoucment for years. No one's annouced whether there retiring or whether they could potentialy run. Who knows if Artur Davis of Alabama will run in 2012? 2008 is more for sure..

<li><b>Comment</b> If this ends in delete, I'd ask that it gets moved to a subpage so that it can be moved back when there are some sources. Or at the very least leave a notice on the talk page. Hopefully some editor will notice that and ask for a restoration. A lot of work went into this page, so there's no reason it needs to be duplicated when the page does become more desirable.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 23:15, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - useful advance planning, appropriately caveated without crossing the line into "crystal ball" territory. It doesn't duplicate the 2006 elections article because some incumbents retired and some were defeated in 2006, and although the information in the 2012 article could be extrapolated from other pages, why should the reader have to when an editor has already usefully compiled it in this form?

Perhaps the "so-and-so may retire" parts of the "Races" section is too crystal ball-like, but the table of which senators will be up for re-election and the 2006 results aren't. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliceNYC_999d.html" title="User:SliceNYC">Slic</a><a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliceNYC_Esperanza_84b5.html" title="User:SliceNYC/Esperanza"><span style="color:#00FF00;">e</span></a><a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliceNYC_999d.html" title="User:SliceNYC">NY</a><b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SliceNYC_0634.html" title="Special:Contributions/SliceNYC">C</a></b> <a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESliceNYC_67e2.html" title="User talk:SliceNYC">(Talk)</a> 02:34, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Much speculation about retiring congresscritters which could be borderline crystalballery, but beyond this I think the other "Keep" votes above have the right idea. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 02:54, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. More important than individual Senators' futures is the question of which party holds the seat and how their state voted in the Presidential or other intervening elections. There are also likely links from the articles of lower-level politicians considering whether to run in the next election (2008 or 2010, depending on state) or this one. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 08:22, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do not Delete</b> I disagree - Cornell University EMS is one of the most important student organizations in a notable Ivy League university. It is a large organization that has many physician alumni that have gone on to make important contributions in medicine and science. As part of Wikipedia, this page is part of a larger subdirectory of student organizations at Cornell, and this subdirectory would be incomplete if the EMS page were removed. It is a brief, well structured article that is inappropriately targeted for deletion.

<p><b>Delete</b> I have an opinion that all Extremism sites should be removed whether they are about Hinduism, Islam, Christianity or any other, because those extremist elements are not derived from the ‘Truth’ of those religions but from those of who were ‘Fanatic’ of those religions or misused those religions. So it is not prudent to observe Extremism in Islam, but wipe out those weeds of customs, which were introduced within the Islam from the pre-historical times and the fanatics who misuse the Islam.</p>

Does having a short story accepted in an annual anthology published by a firm with - let's say - connections to an organization that is not without its critics - count as "receiving an award"? If so, the article should stay. If not - and I don't personally believe it is - and if Damon has no other claims to notability, it should go. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 03:42, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'd personally kind of waffle on this, but lean toward "no", only on account that the founding organization of this award is...well, incredibly self-isolated. Based on your points, Tevildo, I'm going to downgrade my vote to a weak delete. I want to keep this. By the way, Damon, I for one appreciate your understanding in this - and wish you much luck. =^^= --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 05:48, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm changing my mind again... sort of. I looked at the article, and in that it's only <i>loosely</i> connected with the Scientologists (remember, Hubbard was a sci-fi writer himself), it probably should have some notability to factor in. I'll leave this as an exercise to others out there; please comment, and really, please change my mind about that delete. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 05:52, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Again, I'm obviously somewhat biased here, so take this with a grain of salt. I would argue for the notability of Writers of the Future winners in general, regardless of the criticism one might level at <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a> (and I agree that there's lots to criticize). The contest has yielded a large number of successful science fiction and fantasy writers, such as <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jay_Lake_2c00.html" title="Jay Lake">Jay Lake</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nina_Kiriki_Hoffman_fbdd.html" title="Nina Kiriki Hoffman">Nina Kiriki Hoffman</a>, and R. Garcia y Robertson (who really ought to have a Wikipedia entry). As for my own notability - aside from winning the contest, that is - I have to admit it would only stem from my association with the <a href="../../../w/o/r/Wordos.html" title="Wordos">Wordos</a> workshop. If those combined merit a full entry, so be it. If not, so be it. --GoodDamon 05:00, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>, I really don't think one minor short-story award is enough to establish notability, especially not when it's just for third place. And especially not when it's really more of a "we're going to include you in our annual anthology" (i.e. a sale) which is <i>called</i> an award in order to promote the anthology. It's nice that they encourage as-yet-unpublished writers, and yes, they've helped some good ones get started. But I still think its status as an actual award is a bit iffy. And given that, and given that the third-place-winning story is still unpublished, and given that there's no actual evidence that Mr. Kaswell will go on to be a successful author in the future, I think notability is not (yet) established. But I do agree that it's a promising start for Mr. Kaswell, and I wish him continued success in the future. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 09:41, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> -- I just don't see any way of expanding this article beyond a stub at this point. Maybe at some point in the future Mr. Kaswell will have achieved enough prominence as a science fiction writer to warrant inclusion in Wikipedia. However, that doesn't appear to be the case at this point in time. Also, Mr. Kaswell is most likely unknown outside the world of writers and avid readers of science fiction writing at this time.Librarylefty 07:30, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>There are several reasons which I think show that this page should be deleted: <b>What is a "Christian country"?</b> Defining whether or not a country is a "Christian country" will require <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> the article needs to be cleaned up, but the topic is interesting. Rather than presenting info about Muslims in individual countries this is a more general article on the situation of Islam and its followers in Christian countries. Of course the definition of a Christian country can be subjective, but arbitrary parameters, such as a Christian majority can be used. <a href="../../../t/s/o/User%7ETSO1D_9399.html" title="User:TSO1D">TSO1D</a> 01:15, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I understand your concerns. However, the problem is that there is no general situation of Islam in Christian countries. There is no specific decree in Islam that deals with Islam in Christian countries. There could be an article titled Muslims living in Dar al-Dawa, with differing Muslim interpretations about how to live in societies that do not have Muslim majorities.

You can have neither a keep nor a delete vote, that's your privilege. But you failed to address my question, which was why you think that "Islam in predominantly Christian countries" would be an appropriate title for an article.

<dd>You read way to much into what I said. I only proposed "predominantly Christian countries" as a substitute for "Christian countries" in the event the article is kept. It is a better title in that it doesn't imply the countries discussed are Christian officially or rightfully, only that its citizens are "predominantly Christian". For instance, most citizens of the United States are Christian, but the country has no official religion, and Muslim Americans are not any less American because of their faith. I really don't see how you interpret what I said to mean I would "support" "Islam in non-Christian countries" or "Hinduism in Christian countries", etc, any more than I "support" this article. A much better analogy would be "Christianity in <i>predominantly</i> Islamic countries" or "Hinduism in predominantly Islamic countries" (note the <i>predominantly</i>, the only thing I actually suggested). "Predominantly Christian countries" is only appropriate because the article is discussing predominantly Christian countries. Whether this is a useful topic is a different question; I already expressed my feelings on this in my first comment.--<a href="../../../c/u/c/User%7ECuchullain_f14f.html" title="User:Cuchullain">Cúchullain</a> <a href="../../../c/u/c/User_talk%7ECuchullain_0f10.html" title="User talk:Cuchullain"><sup>t</sup></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cuchullain_2c21.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cuchullain"><small>c</small></a> 03:43, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Completing a started AfD by an anon. This article is very obviously on a non-notable person. The article was created by User:WaWa12, who has little on his Wikipedia resume that is not vandalism. Unsurprisingly, mrpregnant.com has an Alexa rank of 475,597. Lots of Google hits for "Mr. Pregnant", but the ones that are related to this blogger are all video postings on YouTube, Google Video, etc. <b>Strong delete.</b> <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 00:18, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Mainly to see what people here think and because Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#INDISCRIMINATE" title="WP:NOT">not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>, but see further comments below. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 00:17, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm nominating this to generate further discussion, as I feel that the article in its present form violates the concept that Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#INDISCRIMINATE" title="WP:NOT">not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>. There is some notable stuff in here, but after the non-notable stuff has been weeded out, what is left could be put somewhere like <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_c3f4.html#Other_effects" title="2004 Indian Ocean earthquake">2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake#Other_effects</a>, or a new section created on the cultural impact of the disaster. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 00:29, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and comment</b> - Damage from a hurricane is notable, and the article seems properly sourced. I think the only qualms I have is that the article may be too specific, but the sheer amount of information warrants this topic to have its own article.--<a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirbytime_cc43.html" title="User:Kirbytime"><font color="red">Ķĩřβȳ</font></a><a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam"><font color="green">♥</font></a><a href="../../../k/i/r/User_talk%7EKirbytime_d8cd.html" title="User talk:Kirbytime"><font color="pink">Ťįɱé</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kirbytime_b7f3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kirbytime"><font color="blue">Ø</font></a> 03:11, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. For an event like this, I really believe we need <i>many</i> subarticles to cover it. The tsunami had a gigantic effect on many aspects of life. In the big picture, library damage may seem like peanuts compared to other effects of the disaster, but I wouldn't go as far to say it is an indiscriminate collection of information.

<li><b>Keep</b> can't believe we have this, can't believe I'm saying keep it, but it is well-referenced and demonstrates some notability, particularly in saying a famous library in Aceh was destroyed and its valuable collection lost.

<li><b>Delete</b> - purest cruft, WP not an indiscriminate collection of info. Just because it's true doesn't mean there should be an article on it. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreschi_31bb.html" title="User:Moreschi">Moreschi</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Deletionism_9106.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletionism">Deletion!</a></sup> 18:48, 29 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To be fair, the following points are what I believe should be rescued from the article (the tables and lists of libraries and damage ratings should go - I think this is actually some paper presented at a librarian's conference that the author has stuck online because they think that is what Wikipedia is for):
<ul>
<li>"The Aceh Documentation and Information Center, known for its collection of rare books and manuscripts chronicling the heritage of Aceh, was completely destroyed. Only half of the building remained standing, and the entire collection was swept away. A team from the National Library of Indonesia visiting in January 2005 was able to salvage only three books and one sheet of the genealogy of the Muslim kings of Aceh. These were taken to Jakarta for restoration."</li>
<li>"Aceh branch of the National Land Register Agency was inundated with water. Roughly 629 boxes of materials certifying individual land ownership in the province were damaged. Due to the efforts of a team of conservators from Japan and archivists from the National Archives in Jakarta, many of these land register documents were preserved."</li>
<li>"The National Maritime Museum in Galle lost 90 percent of its collection, mostly artifacts salvaged from underwater wrecks and archaeology sites. The Maritime Archaeology Unit of the Central Cultural Fund was also severely damaged, resulting in the loss of artifacts from an 18th century Dutch shipwreck."</li>
<li>Plus several of the stats about numbers of buildings destroyed and people killed: "2,364 teachers and staff members were killed and 2,240 schools were destroyed on Sumatra and its outlying islands." (Indonesia) and "it is estimated that 1.2 million volumes of books and other reading materials were destroyed in the disaster" (Sri Lanka).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>That is about all I could find that I considered worth keeping. If people want more, they can follow the links to the sources, IMO. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 19:17, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, it may seem trivial information to those of us in the West but the article addresses a very serious issue. <a href="../../../d/u/k/User%7EDukeOfDuchessStreet_45c7.html" title="User:DukeOfDuchessStreet">--Duke of Duchess Street</a> 03:54, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The earthquake is still quite a big topic as RockMFR has pointed out, which requires a number of articles to support it. This article is long enough. Failing that, a merge is possible, but this would mean another article would become too long. Therefore, I would rather keep. <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsanephantom_93dd.html" title="User:Insanephantom"><b><font color="#006040">Insane</font></b></a><a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInsanephantom_69e0.html" title="User talk:Insanephantom"><font color="#906C5A">phantom</font></a> 12:51, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> -- While the information in this article is valuable, I think it's too in-depth for an encyclopedia. As such, I don't think that Wikipedia is the appropriate place for this information.Librarylefty 07:22, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Of course, that was in 2005, and it is possible that the concept of tagswarming has become documented since then. Searching reveals that it hasn't, however. The only documentation to be found is things like <a href="http://www.chrisfreeland.com/2005/12/tagswarming.html" class="external text" title="http://www.chrisfreeland.com/2005/12/tagswarming.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> which is an article on a personal web log of one Chris Freeland, who states that xe is an employee of the Botanical Gardens, and <a href="http://tagswarm.wikispaces.com/page/history/home" class="external text" title="http://tagswarm.wikispaces.com/page/history/home" rel="nofollow">this</a>, which is an article hosted by a free wiki hosting service that is written by a user named "chrisfreeland".
