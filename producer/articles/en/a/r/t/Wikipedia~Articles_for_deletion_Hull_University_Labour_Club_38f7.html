<p>This was speedied as an 'nn club'. But it is certainly not a speedy - I've undeleted and sending here for completeness. University political societies are the breeding grounds for British politicians, and often mentioned in their bios. It is not just that famous people attended these, but that their political affliliations and often allegiences were formed in these places. They are at least as notable as schools and minor bands (which we keep). Hull itself boasts the current UK deputy Prime Minister, a deputy leader of the labour party (and previous Chancellor of the Exchequer) plus three other MP's (and that is just from the article). If that is not an <i>assertion of notability</i> what is?--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><small><sup>ask?</sup></small></a> 21:02, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I speedy deleted it earlier. My reasoning was working it backwards; should all clubs/groups that these people have been affiliated with get an article simply because they happened to be affiliated with it? The nature of universities means there's a pretty good chance that any club that's been around for a few decades is going to have at least one notable alumni. I don't think this counts as grounds for inclusion. If the group itself is notable for something, not just the later fame of its alumni, then I think there's a case. But, I don't see anything like that in this article. The article claims it is "well known...for it's rebellious nature", attended a rally, and did some campaigning. Google test on this article's subject shows 9 hits. I don't see anything here that strikes me as being notable. Compare to <a href="../../../s/k/u/Skull_and_Bones_93ca.html" title="Skull and Bones">Skull and Bones</a> which has notable alumni but has also frequently been in the press, especially in the last couple of years. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 22:46, 25 January 2006 (UTC) Addendum: <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> was in <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cub_Scouts_621f.html" title="Cub Scouts">Cub Scouts</a> when he was a child. Based on the criteria that a group is notable because it has notable alumni, should we have an article on his Cub Scout den? What about a biography on his den mother? It's like saying an article on a place where Lincoln slept is notable because Lincoln slept there. I don't believe association is sufficient for notability, unless that association is somehow influential to the person's later fame/notability. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 23:14, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>If you quote it properly, it says "well known among Labour Students", not just "well known..." as you paraphrased. The main argument is that Oxford and Cambridge uni Lab clubs have one. Either we should all be allowed one or no one should.</li>
<li>Durin, that is a valid opinion, although I think it is wrong. But it was not valid to speedy this! A7 requires 'no assertion of notability' and even a borderline assertion requires an AfD. Two deputy PMs is certainly an assertion of notability (most school articles would die for such notable alumni) --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><small><sup>ask?</sup></small></a> 22:51, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Agreed. You don't speedy articles that <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=assert" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=assert" rel="nofollow">assert</a> importance, as A7 says.

<li>Abuse is a bit strong of a word. Did I make an error? Perhaps. Abuse? That implies conscious, reasoned knowledge that I was violating A7. That did not happen. Let's ratchet back the rhetoric, ok? As for them being known as being rebellious, how about a cite for such a claim? Failing that cite, that's potentially POV. Though I grant that a speedy might have been premature, I fully stand by my vote. And yes, I do think similar organizations shouldn't have an article unless the organization is notable for reasons other than the later fame of their alumni. Alternatively, if the alumni reference the organization as a major reason for their later fame, then that could be sufficient. But, no such claims have been made here that I see. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 22:59, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
