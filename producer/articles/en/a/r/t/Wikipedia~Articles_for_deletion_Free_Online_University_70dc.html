<p>According to the article, the "<i>Free Online University was founded on the 17th of May, 2005</i>". I don't think it really needed an article the day after. Come back when the university is at least marginally notable. <a href="../../../r/l/_/User%7ERl_43ae.html" title="User:Rl">Rl</a> 16:52, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Delete: Prank boast. It's like those articles on "famous" bands that were formed in May of 2005. Just childishness that verges on vandalism. A typo in the article explains it best: "Histoy." <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:29, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> just because something is new doesn't mean it isn't real. it's quite a leap of logic to call such a posting "vandalism".... aimlessly lashing out at people is the real indication of childishness. <a href="../../../j/0/n/User%7EJ0n_44a3.html" title="User:J0n">j0n</a> 21:11, 18 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You don't say? So, it can be described because it exists only at the moment of speaking. It has no stability, nothing which can be referred to, since it is existing only in the form of a potentiality? Seems pretty unverifiable to me. List of students? List of teachers? List of classes? All to come whenever, someday, maybe? It isn't real, except as an announcement, and announcements are not appropriate content. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 01:21, 19 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>try reading the [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy" rel="nofollow">deletion guidelines</a> ] again. there's nothing on this article that violates any of the listed standards. you need to find something better to do with your time than trolling around and trying to find fault with others. maybe take up knitting or something <a href="../../../j/0/n/User%7EJ0n_44a3.html" title="User:J0n">j0n</a> 02:19, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Thanks for the advice. I think I've already found it, though: verifiable. You see, when something exists for a day, it isn't really stable enough to be discussed. The purpose of encyclopedias is contextualizing of information, not announcing neato things. Oh, and advertising. That's another deletion guideline violation. Perhaps, though, you would be better served by establishing these items than trying to insult me: it's easier. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 10:52, 19 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>the free online university was founded when the wikipedia entry was published, it is designed to mirror a similiar philosphy to that of the wikipedia, so it seems like a logical place to start. <a href="../../../a/g/h/User%7EAghost_88dc.html" title="User:Aghost">aghost</a> 20:17, 18 may 2005 (UTC)

<li>This is Votes for Deletion. This is not a rallying point for anything at all. We ask only one question: Does this article violate the deletion guidelines. The answer is yes.

<li><b>keep</b>: the university does not violate any of the wikipedia parameters listed in the deletion guidelines. furthermore i see the logic in officially founding this on wikipedia. given the beautiful philosophy in a free online university it would have been hypocritical to come into written existence any other way. please, how is anything interesting or utopic to come of the internet if we can not make individual evaluations as to whether older made systems should be implemented, like demanding physical information, or whether this is a good idea and so i will trust the creators verification of its existence because if it is it is and feeling that one has proof enough to claim it is not and should therefore be deleted is being far more bold than a creator. --1bit 11:51, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, that's not the point. The reality is that it is frequently the case that some contributors to Wikipedia fight against deletions of their articles by creating <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_sock_puppet.html" title="Internet sock puppet">sock puppets</a>. A first time poster making his very first contribution in a vote for deletion is unusual. The tendency is to believe such an account is a sock puppet.

<li><b>Comment</b>: <a href="../../../a/g/h/User%7EAghost_88dc.html" title="User:Aghost">Aghost</a> has created Everything records, according to the revision history complete with a speedy delete to go with it (<i>"{{db|page is only related to the [[aghost]] page, which is a likely candidate for deletion}}"</i>, which wouldn't be a reason for speedy deletion anyway). According to the article, that record label was founded on May 20, 2005 (today). He added links to said article from <a href="../../../k/h/o/Khonnor.html" title="Khonnor">Khonnor</a>, Wwcarpen, and Aghost.

<li>Quoting from that; "You may not host your own website". In the article we're discussing here, you state that the Free Online University was founded on Wikipedia.

<li>It is hosted here. That is clear. You founded it here. You claim to have created the freeonlineuniversity.org web but while that domain name is taken, there is no serving host. Thus, at this moment in time, you are hosting the project on Wikipedia. Wikipedia is not a hosting service. Sorry. Even if this 'university' passed such a test (which it doesn't), then the article still fails on a number of points including notability and verifiability, both of which it clearly and utterly fails, your arguments not withstanding. Regardless of my opinion or yours, this article is currently being voted to be deleted, and it is highly unlikely it will pass muster. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 17:41, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I note that there is a serving host for the domain name now (side note: the page is badly formatted HTML). On the single page on that site it says, "Accepting teachers in the Fall, 2005.". So, this 'university' has no teachers (other than you?). We have a multitude of high schools and primary schools that are not on Wikipedia because of a lack of notability, and they <i>have</i> teachers, in fact lots of them. Also the Wikipedia entry here for this 'university' has considerably more information than the domain name site. It certainly still appears like this project is being hosted on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 21:23, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
