<p><b>BBC official statement</b> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/jamiekane/pressrelease.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/jamiekane/pressrelease.shtml" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>: <i>Jamie Kane Wikipedia Entries: To clarify the confusion about Jamie Kane biographical entries appearing on Wikipedia: The first posting was simply a case of a fan of the game getting into the spirit of alternative reality a little too much. The follow up posting was made by a fan of the game who happens to work in the BBC (where we've been beta-testing for the last month). This was unauthorized and made without the knowledge of anyone in the Jamie Kane Team or BBC Marketing. To confirm: the BBC would never use Wikipedia as a marketing tool. We hope you enjoy the game:-) Team Jamie</i></p>
<p>As a side issue: how on earth would "the BBC" (more exactly, "Team Jamie") know who made the initial entry? Have they provided a source for their reassurance upon this point? Most reputable news organizations are expected to verify facts with two independent sources. Are we expected to take them at their word simply because they are the BBC? Unless we've divulged our IP logs to them - which we certainly should not have done - they are in no position to state anything whatsoever about the identity of the person who created the first article - except perhaps that no one on "Team Jamie" admits to it. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 04:10, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please note that the first revision of the article (supposedly created by Jon_Hawk) did contain a weak note (bottom of the page) about this being a fictional page. While the original article was bad in most (or all) aspects, I do not believe it was done as part of an advertising campaign - more likely a person who is familiar with the game and conceived the fictional character as notable created the article in much the same spirit as most "StarTrek", "Doom" or "Halo" articles which treat the material as a matter of fact and only weakly note their fictional nature. 62.90.49.87 10:53, 15 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>What note are you talking about? As far as I can tell, Jon_Hawk's material was all fake presented as real. Somebody else added a note at the bottom, but not until it was tagged as disputed.--<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 14:56, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>keep</b>. When suitably marked as "fictional&#160;: accuracy disputed", and re-written to explain the fictional use, this (a) shows how fast, intelligently and effectively Wikipedia can respond to such silly marketing tricks and remain on higher ground, by simply exposing the truth rather than getting caught up in silly games. Also, (b) it largely destroys (or at least, can be written to counter) the viral marketing goals, if that is indeed why it was created. In this sense, it can be used to explain to the exact demographic who are being taken in by the fictional game, why this conflicts with the goals of Wikipedia. Lastly (c), if other marketers see the above process, and realise playing tricks with wikipedia will run a high risk of damaging their brand, rather than creating a "cool, viral" edge, then they will be less likely to abuse it in the future. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintywalker_29f8.html" title="User:Mintywalker">mintywalker</a> 10:54, 14 August 2005 (BST)

<li>I disagree. Keeping the article purely to point out that its fictional viral marketing and how evil it is would be a POV, and go against the principles of Wikipedia as a source of knowledge, not a source of comentary. The best thing is to simply remove viral marketing as it appears. It should be noted that keeping the marketing, but noting it as marketing, does not reduce the marketing impact. Infact, this whole debate simply gains more 'eyes' on the BBC which was the intent. So I feel it should be quickly directed to a deletion. --<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarberio_8f89.html" title="User:Barberio">Barberio</a> 10:15, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You're missing the fact that it wasn't rewritten solely in order to render the neutral point of view and to correct spelling. It was rewritten <i>using information from cited sources</i>.

<li>From what I can tell, the References section is a collection of links to blogs and a couple of PR stories in the Guardian. Hardly notability... if the game takes off the article can be recreated.

<ul>
<li>If your argument is that the fact that newspapers cover something, and that people discuss it, does not indicate notability at all, then I disagree. If your argument is simply about <i>what level</i> of discussion is necessary, then I agree that this subject is at the low end of the spectrum. However, as I stated above, an additional factor to take into account is that were this article to be deleted, we'd quite probably (as has happened in other cases in the past) have a succession of silly "Jamie Kane is a pop star" articles continually re-created in its place by players of the game over the coming months. Better an encyclopaedia with a proper article about a subject at the low end of the notability spectrum than an encyclopaedia with a succession of silly articles. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:23:57, 2005-08-15 (UTC)

<li>I got a mention in two of my local newspapers last week. Wikipedia article here I come! If I trawl google I can find people have been discussing any old cruft and rubbish. The Guardian entries are PR stories... ten-a-penny. I simply don't understand your point about how there will be lots of "Jamie Kane" new pages -- you don't and can't know that. If that starts to happen then people are playing it and it's becoming more notable, in which case my position might change. Your speculation is hardly a good reason for keeping it... isn't Wikipedia supposed to catalogue notable things rather than predict them? - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 18:47:38, 2005-08-15 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is a fascinating discussion and it would be a shame to loose it.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> As long as it is edited to contain factual information, then there is no reason to actually kill it, IMHO.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, deletion proposal predates <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle_G</a>'s edits. The article is about the game, hence properly titled. External links point to it. It is not vandalism. An article like this one -- factual, accurate, with references -- should not be deleted just because the original version was controversial. --EJHuff 04:09, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> marketing campaign plain and simple. And it's not because it is a controversy now that it deserves to live.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Better Wikipedia leave commercial product information to other websites, than it become Wikispameteria. 70.19.59.94 05:18, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> The apology is irrelevant, what is important is the intent, which was to use Wikipedia as an advertising medium. This is unacceptable however you look at it. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuartCarter_88e0.html" title="User:StuartCarter">StuartCarter</a> 06:17, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Did you actually read the BBC statement or Jon and MattC's post? The BBC's wasn't an apology, it was a categorical denial and neither Jon or MattC indended it as advertising. 129.169.154.82 13:12, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The current page is informational, and given that it has been mentioned on slashdot and boingboing it is now part of Wikipedia lore. Meta though it may be, the history of Wikipedia itself is worth considering. Right now it is clearly marked as fictional and NPOV, so I see no reason at all to delete it other than petty revenge. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasterDirk_4311.html" title="User:MasterDirk">MasterDirk</a> 06:34, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>the edited version is just fine. I understand the concern for commercial products on Wiki, but Wiki is in fact not advertising Jamie Kane or the BBC. The article (the just-the-facts, ma'am article) is fine, and in the spirit of free info about everything, I think it should stay. -kelly</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It's a game just like any other and deserves a spot in wikipedia, you'd have to remove A.I web quest and many others too.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Following the rewrite by Uncle G and the inclusion of a note about all the mess, this is now a real article about a game (like, say, the <a href="../../../d/o/o/Doom3.html" title="Doom3">Doom3</a> article.) <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBoris_SDC_46e4.html" title="User:Boris SDC">Boris SDC</a> 13:06, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
