<p>Likely hoax.

<p>I am doing a report on the Providence of Frozinone. There are several references to the Cascheras, but they are all in Italian. Please see "Broccostella: I Fondatori". Please also note that they are only legandary. Italians are famous for having such creation/founding myths, ie Romulus and Remus and the she-wolf. 141.161.98.205 17:54, 29 September 2005 (UTC)Don Tote141.161.98.205 17:54, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>At the moment the sounds rather incongruous. <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julius_Caesar_5dfd.html" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> and his mythical ancestor <a href="../../../a/e/n/Aeneas.html" title="Aeneas">Aeneas</a> lived 1000 years apart. Someone's ancestry can be traced back to one or the other but not to either. And the idea that anyone (even a legendary figure) could be nursed by a <i>lion</i> in the densely populated <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latium.html" title="Latium">Latium</a> of <a href="../../../1/0/0/100.html" title="100">100</a> AD isn't believable. As I said, verifiable sources are needed. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 22:16, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>141.161.92.132 23:43, 29 September 2005 (UTC)In fact, Caesar did claim that Aeneas was his ancestor, please see Plutarch's "Life of Caesar" and Suetonius's "Life of Caesar". Also, Latium was and is not "densely" populated even to this day. Most of it is rural mountainside with peasant villages scattered along the Appene mountain range. During this time period, the region was popluated with Lions until the Romans killed most of them off. Furthermore, the fact that they are legendary figures seems to escape some people. They were most likely not real, that is, these are figments of ones imagination not to be taken seriously. To say that it "isn't believable" would mean that one was ignoring the fact that they are legandary. I have managed to find a reference of The Caschera's in "Mythical and legendary narrative in Ovid's Fasti" by Paul Murgatroyd. A further study would have to be required in order to justly remove this entry. Also, the Fibreno River can be located to be an actual river found near the village.

<li>Legends must be self-consistent, too, people like them to make sense. I know that Caesar traced his own ancestry back to Aeneas. Someone would trace back his own ancestry only to Caesar <i>or</i> to Aeneas, who lived 1000 years previously, but not to both. As far as the lions go, from what I know Latium was the heartland of the Roman empire and at that time extensively used for agriculture. There is no place for lions on cultivated land. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 18:30, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>delete</b> i am zak baneys agent his real name is ralph baney and he is the very first person to produce the genre called acid breaks back in 1987 .in miami florida he didnt intend on pioneering a style of music he just used chicagos acid sound with breakbeat there for creating the very first acid break track so he should be credeit for the work he has done .kenji matsumi</li>
<li>I dont understand what to do here but i do know Ralph Baney but he goes by Zak Baney and he is known for being the one guy that made acid breaks and i think he needs to be noted for that ...dj king js

<li><strike>Great! But in order for it to be in a wikipedia article it needs to be verified.

<p>Article has escaped under the radar screen. It is basically a creationist POV-pushing endeavor.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is one of the oldest articles at Wikipedia (3 years, 10 months).

<dl>
<dd>When "evolution" is defined in naturalistic terms about 1 American in 8 supports it. When the definition of "evolution" is expanded to include gradual emergence of species <b>guided by an intelligent force</b> (like God) then additonal 3/8 of Americans may be said to "support evolution".</dd>
<dd>Sources have been in this article (I know: I put them in there at least twice over the years). If sources were deleted for some reason, then simply put them back.</dd>
<dd>There is no reason to delete this article, other than to suppress information about the controversy, dispute and/or debate between advocates about their positions on evolution.</dd>
<dd>It's especially disturbing that when I linked to this article, another contributer immediately said that he would try to get it deleted.

<dd>Can you make it clear how votes count here? Do I have to put <b>delete</b> after each kana, or will you only count votes one for each person for the whole article? Sorry if this is a stupid question, but I'm not sure of the rules. --DannyWilde 00:57, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not likely to close this AfD myself (I rarely close AfDs) but I would recommend that whoever does close this use common sense in counting votes. It is important, in my opinion, that all three articles close with the same result, and I imagine that the closing admin will examine all offered opinions without too much regard to which articles they are offered in connection with to reach a decision about consensus. Frankly, at this point, I can't see how a consensus will arise out of this swamp, but stranger things have happened.... <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> 01:27, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dictionary definition. DannyWilde 00:59, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>, dictionary entry exists in Wiktionary anyway. --DannyWilde</li>
<li><strike><b>Weak Delete</b></strike>, as DannyWilde said, they're <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%81%AE" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:の">already in wiktionary</a>. The roman alphabet (<a href="../../../a/_/_/A.html" title="A">A</a>, <a href="../../../b/_/_/B.html" title="B">B</a>, <a href="../../../c/_/_/C.html" title="C">C</a>, ...) has individual pages, but the wiktionary pages seem to already have more information than is being created in the en/wikipedia pages. If there's enough information to go in these, that doesn't belong in Wiktionary, then <b>Keep</b>. Are all 50/100 kana going to be added? Are any kanji going to be added?? --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 01:20, 29 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Merge to Wiktionary</b>, per Uncle G. How a word is written and pronounced belongs in a dictionary. The same goes for letters that make up words. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 12:49, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. No, kanji will not be added, only the kana, and the katakana will redirect to the hiragana articles. Like with the articles on the English alphabet letters, these articles could show the history of the writing of individual kana. In fact, I have a 2000 page dictionary in storage that shows the history of each English letter, with each article on them at least two pages. Aside from the history, the article could go slightly deeper into phonology, too, and possibly instructions on how to write the kana. <a href="../../../t/o/o/User%7EToothpaste_ac49.html" title="User:Toothpaste">Toothpaste</a> 01:15, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Wiktionary is the place for this (The fact that you are referring to a dictionary should tip you off.), and a lot of such work has already been done, long since.

<li>As per our <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28use_English%29_65c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)</a>, if there is an encyclopaedia article to be had, it should be under an English title. But, as per the far better dictionary article <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%81%AE" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:の">の</a> in Wiktionary, there is clearly no subject for an encyclopaedia article to be had. This article is a mis-placed dictionary article, pure and simple. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>.

<ul>
<li>If you are unsatisfied with the name of the article, it can be moved to <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_%28kana%29.html" title="No (kana)">No (kana)</a> and the actual hiragana and katakana can be made into redirects.
<ul>
<li>I reiterate: There is no encyclopaedia article to be had here. Everything that you have proposed adding, pronunciations, stroke indexes, and so forth is <i>dictionary article content</i> about the word. Wiktionary has had vast numbers of such articles with pronunciations, stroke indexes, and so forth, since 2003. If you want to improve them with pictures, Wiktionary is the place to do so. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:55, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

I don't know, but I should expect you would be able to say as much about the kana as about Roman letters. ~~ <b><a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickptar_0554.html" title="User:Nickptar">N</a></b> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickptar_0d70.html" title="User talk:Nickptar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nickptar_06b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nickptar">c</a>) 02:07, 29 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>One can, <i>and the dictionary does</i>. Go look at some of the thousands of such entries in Wiktionary. Some of them are huge. They have Unicode values, stroke indicies, input method indices, meanings in several languages, transliterations in several systems, translations, and more. Pictures would improve them yet further. A random medium-length example (selected, ironically, by hitting "random page" <i>exactly once</i> at Wiktionary) of what a dictionary can contain: <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%86%9D" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:冝">冝</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:19, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>A false analogy. Whereas a dictionary article on <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/plutonium" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:plutonium">plutonium</a> tells one about the word, how it is pronounced and so forth, an encyclopaedia about <a href="../../../p/l/u/Plutonium.html" title="Plutonium">plutonium</a> tells one <i>about plutonium</i> — about the element that the word represents. This is not the case here. You are not creating encyclopaedia articles about the things that the words represents. (It's clear from the Wiktionary entry telling us the meaning of the word that there isn't an encyclopaedia article to be had about the thing that <i>this</i> word represents.) You are creating <i>dictionary articles about the words themselves</i>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 02:01, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>To my understanding, kanji are used as the bases of words. Hiragana and katakana are uses as noun endings, adjective endings, for other suffixes, to show the pronunciation of kanji, for stylistic purposes, for otomotopoeias, for emphasis, for technical terms, and for the transcription of words borrowed from other languages. I do not think we should have an article for every character representing a word, or part of a compound word, or a rootword, but for characters that represent individual sounds that can form a word, as in the English alphabet and with the kana. If this and similar articles were to be kept, only approximately 50 or so kana articles would be created total. <a href="../../../t/o/o/User%7EToothpaste_ac49.html" title="User:Toothpaste">Toothpaste</a> 03:11, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Just a note from the person who suggested deleting this in the first place: there is some information about some of the kana characters which could be worth having in Wikipedia. For example the origin of the kana ン is disputed. It might belong in Wikipedia if we were to discuss the origin of the character, or if there is to be something other than just "this is a Japanese character, it is pronounced "no" ". However, I'd expect such information to come from a split from <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katakana.html" title="Katakana">katakana</a> or <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiragana.html" title="Hiragana">hiragana</a> pages if it came from anywhere. Also, "no" has very important grammatical functions in Japanese grammar. So I think there is a possibility of expansion or split from <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_grammar.html" title="Japanese grammar">Japanese grammar</a> of a "no" page. However, since there are already lists of Japanese symbols on the <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiragana.html" title="Hiragana">hiragana</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katakana.html" title="Katakana">katakana</a> pages, I'm very dubious about making a full set of small, unexpandable stub articles about every single Japanese symbol. --DannyWilde 03:47, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: since I started the vote for deletion, this article has been artificially bulked with copy-paste edits from other pages, probably in order to avoid being deleted. For example, the comments about "no" coming from the sousho form of characters, etc., apply to ALL of the Japanese kana, not just this one - there is no point in having fifty identical pages, one for each kana, with the same copy-pasted statement. Using this kind of trickery in order to avoid the page being deleted should not be acceptable. --DannyWilde 07:40, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Please assume good faith. If you'd prefer the history section to be taken out temporarily, this would be fine. The transition of man'yōgana to hiragana is much more complex than what is written now. For example, it's a pretty big jump from the second character to the third in the picture at Image:Nohistory.jpg. I'd rather have a few copy and pasted statements, aided by pictures, than an article lacking completely in history content, which applies to this VFD, but overall, and I already it's already a beginning to be a bit comprehensive. <a href="../../../t/o/o/User%7EToothpaste_ac49.html" title="User:Toothpaste">Toothpaste</a> 07:57, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If you are serious about writing in detail about the origins of kana on a per-kana basis, I would suggest an article on "Origin of kana" with section headings for each kana you want to discuss, if you have enough material that it will make <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiragana.html" title="Hiragana">hiragana</a> or <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katakana.html" title="Katakana">katakana</a> too big, of course. If there is so much stuff on <b>one</b> kana that you actually need a <b>whole article</b> on it, I'd be surprised. Spreading origins all over the place in fifty different articles doesn't make any sense, since the hiragana and katakana are all very closely related to each other and the history is the same. --DannyWilde 13:06, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Dictionaries are for the <b>physical</b> written, spoken, and electronic <b>symbols</b>, how those symbols fit into larger physical expressions such as individual sentences, and the historical changes of the physical symbols. Encyclopedias explain the <b>ideas those symbols refer to</b>, and refer back to physical symbol history only when needed for disambiguation purposes. This goes <i>doubly</i> for individual letters. You wouldn't put an audio pronunciation on the wikipedia の page, any more than you would put <i>'his-t(&amp;-)rE &amp;v "ar-&amp;-'zO-n&amp;</i> on the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Arizona_ecdb.html" title="History of Arizona">History of Arizona</a> page. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 16:32, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>And, as stated above, letters are even more low-level representations than individual prefixes, words, or phrases. You find pronunciation of words and a long list of historical spellings in dictionaries, but not in encyclopedias. That's because dictionaries describe how you write a word down, how you pronounce the word, how you attach it to other words. Encyclopedias describe the concept, history, and larger context that pops into your head when someone says/writes/types that word to you. Individual letters having nothing to do with abstract ideas in your head. There's clear precedent that pronunciation belongs in a dictionary, so it follows that how a letter or word is expressed in Unicode or Braille also belongs in a dictionary, because these are just different mechanisms for communicating between two people, but they don't have any impact on the higher-level thoughts a person has once the idea is communicated to them. Note that kanji (and chinese characters generally) blur the line between letters and words, and chinese characters clearly belong in a dictionary. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 17:38, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If given its own section, the Grammar section will be merged into Usage.

<ul>
<li>Ahh. Ideograms clearly are dictionaries (eg. see <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictionary.html#Character_dictionaries" title="Dictionary">character dictionaries</a>). As for the difference between pentagrams and syllabary... You can stick a pentagram next to an octagon next to a circle, and it doesn't mean anything syntactically. Whereas, with syllabries and letters, their purpose is to be part of the language hierarchy (eg. letters form words, words form phrases, phrases form sentences, sentences form paragraphs, paragraphs form encyclopedia entries (or something)). Letters are on the opposite end of the language hierarchy from where encyclopedias sit. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 18:38, 29 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I used pentagram and ampersand as examples of signs that have their own articles. I didn't say that pentagram is a letter or an ideogram. -<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHapsiainen_6f9e.html" title="User:Hapsiainen">Hapsiainen</a> 18:46, 29 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>According to the standard I put forth in the couple of comments above, language-oriented <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grapheme.html" title="Grapheme">graphemes</a> should be placed only in a dictionary (contrary to current precedent), but non-language-oriented <a href="../../../p/i/c/Pictogram.html" title="Pictogram">pictograms</a> (such as a pentagram) should be placed only in an encyclopedia. So those were arguments for that position. Both Encarta and Merriam-Webster include entries for individual roman letters, so I suppose a safe way to rule on this would be to put the same/similar content on both wikipedia and wiktionary. But that's a bit of a weird solution, especially if we can find a standard that indicates which articles should go where. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 18:57, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm proposing that if an organization produces both an encyclopedia and a dictionary, and makes them equally available (<i>especially</i> for free), it should not have duplicate entries for every single grapheme.

<li>I think most people can understand the difference between Wikipedia and Wiktionary. However, I don't understand how there's a difference between existing content for the grapheme articles (Braille, Unicode, audio pronunciation, part of speech usage, stroke order, etc). It seems to be the same on both sides. --<a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInteriot_4e2d.html" title="User:Interiot">Interiot</a> 21:01, 29 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am of the opinion that this is material that is perfectly appropriate for an encyclopedia, and maybe less appropriate for a dictionary entry. However, whether <i>they</i> think it is appropriate <i>there</i> is something they have to decide by themselves, and I'm saying that <i>I</i> think this is appropriate <i>here</i> in this discussion. There is no rule that content must not be duplicated on Wiktionary and Wikipedia, as long as both communities want it. --<span style="font-family:monospace">&#160;<a href="../../../g/r/m/User%7EGrm_wnr_b9ae.html" title="User:Grm wnr">grm_wnr</a></span> <a href="../../../g/r/m/User_talk%7EGrm_wnr_e8bc.html" title="User talk:Grm wnr"><span style="border:1px solid;color:black;font-size:9px;padding:2px 1px 0px 1px">Esc</span></a> 21:09, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>So, the suggestion then is that users should click on the interwiki link, and read through both articles at the same time, to make sure they get the full/best information?

<li>As said before, kanji are not pertinent to this discussion.

<dd>A small correction: Japanese kana aren't <a href="../../../i/d/e/Ideograph.html" title="Ideograph">ideographs</a>. Anyway, I completely agree with your point. I hope something everyone will agree with is that the history of kana does belong in Wikipedia. But, before deciding whether to keep the article on that basis, please take a look at the two excellent existing articles, <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiragana.html" title="Hiragana">hiragana</a>, and <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katakana.html" title="Katakana">katakana</a>. If there is a lot of information to include, it is possible that each individual character might need to have a history page, giving more details, but as I suggested above I think it would be better to integrate the information into one focused page if at all possible. --DannyWilde 05:56, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>, The issue is that, I strongly believe it's a problem if the standards say that information should be completely duplicated in both places. At this point, there's precedent on both Wikipedia and Wiktionary <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E4%BA%8C" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:二">(1)</a>, <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Image:Zh-zu2.ogg" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Image:Zh-zu2.ogg">(2)</a> to keep all the information discussed so far on either side. When AfD/RfDs come up, the easy thing to do is vote Keep, and act like a problem doesn't exist. So eventually this information will get copied to both sides, while all along, people aren't required to give reasoned arguments for or against the idea that it should be copied verbatim in both places. I'm a programmer, and one of the first things that was pounded into my head over and over, was that you don't keep information in multiple places unless there's a really really good reason, because it always causes more problems than you think it will, keeping them synchronized or coordinated wastes a lot of human time, and usually there's a simple technical or procedural fix for it. This discussion is made more important because we really are talking about duplicating <b><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:List_of_joyo_kanji_by_reading" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Wiktionary:List_of_joyo_kanji_by_reading">hundreds</a> and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Chinese_radical_index" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Wiktionary:Chinese_radical_index">thousands of characters</a></b>. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Most dictionaries <i>and</i> encyclopedias have characters in them.

<li><b>Reply</b> - There is a growing consensus that the proposals on <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">WP:COMIC</a> are inadequate. I think the article would be of a lot more use on a project like compixpedia as mentioned below. Another point is, why was the article created about a specific part of the site?

<li>This is a valid concept, but this article defines it narrowly and incorrectly. "To slum" originally meant simply to patronize, for the purpose of recreation and adventure, an establishment (e.g. a bar or restaurant) that is well below one's means. The author of this article has mistaken a derived usage, which is nonnotable, for the original usage, which is notable. I think someone can easily write an encyclopedic article about this phenomenon, elaborating on its motivations and its connection to the <a href="../../../y/u/p/Yuppie.html" title="Yuppie">yuppie</a> subculture, etc. So I vote to <b>keep and improve.</b> <a href="../../../b/h/u/User%7EBhumiya_8fee.html" title="User:Bhumiya">Bhumiya</a>/<a href="../../../b/h/u/User_talk%7EBhumiya_1af5.html" title="User talk:Bhumiya">Talk</a> 02:31, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

I'm not sure if I'm allowed to do that myself, so maybe an admin can drop this, since nobody has voted delete (and re-directs, if wanted don't require an AFD).

<li><b>Keep</b> "Since 1893" indicates a long history with lots of details to be found. A very good school stub so far, and will be improved over time.

<li><b>Comment</b> - So nobody should nom a school for deletion just because nominating 1 is "pointless" in your view and mass noms are frowned upon? That is ridiculous reasoning. Unless there is a policy that all schools are notable, noms like this are going to happen and should happen until there is a standard set for notabilty of schools. Just because you don't agree isn't reason enough for someone who believes schools are not notable to stop nominating them.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:33, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

I understand where you are coming from <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> but just because it ruffles a few feathers is no reason to abstain from a nom for AfD.

<ul>
<li>Many people believe all schools have notable. We have the upper hand and have established a de facto policy. Schools shouldn't be nominated just as countries shouldn't be nominated. On the other hand almost no-one believes all people are notable and many biographical articles are deleted every day. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 20:14, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>How many schools have to survive the AfD process before we can declare that a concensus exists "not to delete school articles" simply because they are about schools? What percentage of nominated school articles must survive the AfD process before we can declare such a concensus? How many poorly-written articles have to be fixed through the AfD process before we can declare a concensus that "it is better to just to fix a poorly written school article rather than immediately send it over to AfD"? How many months of schools surviving the AfD process are needed before we can declare a concensus that "it is better to work together to build the quality of school articles instead of gaming to system in a vain hope to get even one school article deleted"? While these are partly rhetorical questions, I think that those that nominated and vote to delete school articles on the basis that either A) "They are schools and non-notable" and/or B)"This school article is poorly written", should consider answering the questions. How long must the charade of AfD rules-gaming continue?--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 08:00, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Once all the inaccuracies and POV statements are removed, this article has literally nothing (0 words) left:<br />
<i>Human rights frequently are abused by police of Anhui province of China.</i> Says who? And what exactly is so special about the situation in the province of <a href="../../../a/n/h/Anhui.html" title="Anhui">Anhui</a> as opposed to the rest of China that merits this article? <i>This has to be seen in the context that Anhui still is seen as a part of China which is less developed than the entire East of China excluding Manchuria.</i> Patently false. Manchuria is far being from the poorest region of eastern China. <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henan.html" title="Henan">Henan</a>, <a href="../../../j/i/a/Jiangxi.html" title="Jiangxi">Jiangxi</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shanxi.html" title="Shanxi">Shanxi</a>, and <a href="../../../a/n/h/Anhui.html" title="Anhui">Anhui</a> all have GDP per capita lower than Manchuria.<br />
<i>It is administered by the provincial Public Security Bureau, whose director is Cui Yadong.</i> Provinces in China are administered by Party Committees and the Provincial People's Governments. Public Security Bureaus are subordinate entities. This statement is laughably false.<br />
<i>In 1995 police in Anhui province launched a campaign to hit and eradicate five religious groups.</i> Source? Which five?<br />

<li><b>Keep</b> and move to East Campus (MIT).

<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree with SPUI. This should be moved to East Campus (MIT) and expanded. Baker House, Simmons Hall, Burton-Conner House, and Bexley Hall are other dorms at MIT that have informative entries in Wikipedia, and I don't those pages up for deletion. I don't see any reason why East Campus should not have an entry. MIT dorms indeed have very unique and interesting cultures. --RadiantEuphoria (talk) 16:24, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The number of dorms notable enough to have their own article is few to none.

<li><b>Keep</b> -- I think that you all are confusing a poorly written article with a subject that has no merit. I agree that the article needs work, however East Campus has a long and colorful history. For example, the recent Time Traveler Convention was held at East Campus, which got international press. I will appeal to my friend who lived at East Campus to ride in and fix the article. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheinfo_0d45.html" title="User:Theinfo">Theinfo</a> 21:42, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Shall we start with the poll tax? Obviously, Dodd was not a pioneer of the poll tax because he supposedly lived in the 1800s while the poll tax is from the middle ages. Otherwise, I wasn't able to verify any of the info, and had it been true it should have been easy to do so.

<p><b>Do not delete</b>-I have put in correct dates corresponding to when he lived. Somebody had been lying, he never went to Tiffin school but he was minister on the council of leicester.

<li>Waitaminute...I thought he played at LEAST one. Maybe I could be wrong...but when I created all those stubs I looked at the Swannies' senior player page to start it all. So I really was quite blind to who has played a game at the AFL level or not...and besides, I did all those stubs at 4:30 in the morning two days after the qualifying final vs. West Coast.

<li><b>Delete</b>, this is similar to online gaming clans, who are also regularly deleted. Playing pub quizes may be serious for the members of this team, but: <i>"Playing pubquiz is a very serious business in Holland and is fast becoming an inseparable part of the Dutch identity."</i> is seriously overstated. I am from the Netherlands and study in Utrecht and haven't come across any pub quiz players in the 5 years I've been studying here. If this was as serious as claimed, I would've at least seen more announcements and come across fellow students and PhDs playing which I have not. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 08:31, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, MgM's remark about not having come across players in the last 5 years in Utrecht is irrelevant. I've lived in Utrecht for 9 years and have not met any Mah-Jong players in that period. Despite that, I would welcome a Wikipedia-page about the best Mah-Jong players in Holland. Besides, MgM uses his own rather limited empirical experience as argument, which doesn't do much to help his case. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.171.208.225 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.171.208.225_1a08.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.171.208.225">contribs</a>) , at 17:25, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_10.html" title="October 10">October 10</a>.

<p>This is the second year that some of us are celebrating the holiday, from St. Louis to San Francisco. It may be small, but that does that mean it's insignificant?

<p>Wow, cool! I hadn't seen that before. Thanks for the link.

I guess it's a big deal in SF. But just because it's gotten little "Web exposure" is no reason to kill it! I took a brick to a bar last October 15th. Didn't you?

<li>It’s the <i>selection</i> of quotes that makes it POV format. One could make an entirely different selection of quotes to prove the opposite, or any point. ♠<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanMS_20a7.html" title="User:DanMS">DanMS</a> 00:02, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanMS_20a7.html" title="User:DanMS">DanMS</a> is correct. These particular quotes are taken out of the full context of the Quran and displayed in a format that obviously has a POV connotation.

<li><b>Keep</b> if rewritten. The article does say this is disputed in Islam. If the quotes supporting the self-purification side of the debate were given equal weight, then I feel this would be a useful source article (rather than having the indiviual quotes available but scattered).

<li>Now hold on there. This is definitely a notable road feature, if not an infamous one. Technically, it's in Raritan Township, not Flemington. And, you can't go purely by the population of the town. In New Jersey all of the towns seem to run together. There are many, many more than 4,000 people living in the area. <a href="../../../a/e/v/User%7EAeverett_b346.html" title="User:Aeverett">Al</a> 19:25, 29 September 2005 (UTC) <b>Keep</b>
<ul>
<li>How am I supposed to know from the article? Here in Britain there are tens of thousands of roundabouts, dozens in each town. The article should mention why that particular roundabout would be of importance to a non-local, otherwise it has to go. Is it the first in New Jersey or a known accident blackspot? Please note that I am aware of <i>two</i> British roundabouts in here, the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_Roundabout_%28Swindon%29_3124.html" title="Magic Roundabout (Swindon)">Magic Roundabout (Swindon)</a> and the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_Roundabout_%28Hemel_Hempstead%29_56ac.html" title="Magic Roundabout (Hemel Hempstead)">Magic Roundabout (Hemel Hempstead)</a>. <s>129.215.194.205</s> <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 19:37, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>The article as it stands is a stub, and therefore patently incomplete. If we were to delete all incomplete articles on Wikipedia as soon as we noticed them, a new article would be a rare thing. And the fact that no one has seen fit to add a comparable set of articles on British roundabouts is neither here nor there. It's not the fault of <i>this</i> article. The correct solution is to add them, not to delete other articles out of some misplaced sense of "fairness". <i><a href="../../../c/s/e/User%7ECsernica_0047.html" title="User:Csernica">TCC</a></i> <small><a href="../../../c/s/e/User_talk%7ECsernica_eca6.html" title="User talk:Csernica">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Csernica_7ef8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Csernica">(contribs)</a></small> 21:41, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>But they wouldn't remark on this particular exhibit, unless they were local to the area. There is a section (than can probably be expanded) in <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traffic_circle.html" title="Traffic circle">Traffic circle</a> on the Twenties-built NJ roundabouts, that's where the information belongs.

<li>I think they probably would, but you've never had to take the Flemington Circle to get to anywhere I've lived. But I think I agree with you that a section (or article) discussing them collectively and singling out prominent ones is a good idea; better than seperate articles. I had hoped for some future historical information which I do not have access to, but was assured was available, and have been somewhat disappointed that they have not been developed further. <i><a href="../../../c/s/e/User%7ECsernica_0047.html" title="User:Csernica">TCC</a></i> <small><a href="../../../c/s/e/User_talk%7ECsernica_eca6.html" title="User talk:Csernica">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Csernica_7ef8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Csernica">(contribs)</a></small> 23:31, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>It is sometimes amazing to me the things that get to have the "notable" tag around here (e.g., <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_fish_on_stamps_of_the_Falkland_Islands_f1e3.html" title="List of fish on stamps of the Falkland Islands">List of fish on stamps of the Falkland Islands</a>). Anyway, I would support Traffic circles in New Jersey as TCC describes. It is a unique feature of New Jersey roadways. It might do to have an article on that unique Jersey road feature of the <i>jughandle</i> too, but none of them are named nor are any particularly notorious. <a href="../../../a/e/v/User%7EAeverett_b346.html" title="User:Aeverett">Al</a> 12:22, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a very heavily travelled roadway, one of the few remaining intact traffic circles in New Jersey, and certainly is therefore notable. Besides, to call Flemington a "village of 4000 people", as if those who lived in the borough were the only local inhabitants, is to ignore the rather dense suburban housing of the surrounding area.

<li>It isn't personal at all. Claims of "notability" and "not notable" can only ever be judged on a relative scale by personal POV. Civil engineering topics are, in my opinion, far more notable than obscure details of a British television series that only fans will recognize. I never proposed deleting such Dr. Who trivia, only that the reasons for keeping it are similar to the reasons for keeping items like this fine article. We're having this discussion because we have POV differences, and Wikipedia is supposed to be NPOV. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 21:50, 2 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is personal because you based what you said on what you perceive about me and how I edit wikipedia. It's a matter of scale and if you think a traffic circle is a major piece of civil engineering, that's fine, we are all entitled to opinions. I find it extremely minor. What you call "obscure details" have so far formed three featured articles, because there is much to write about a television programme that has been around for over 40 years. This traffic circle is hardly in the same league of fame, which had it not been given a name noone would know of. I have the same opinion of the "obscure detail" of Doctor Who and if you don't believe me you can check out <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Doctor_Constantine_a629.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Doctor Constantine">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Doctor Constantine</a>. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimPope_0d3a.html" title="User:TimPope">TimPope</a> 22:09, 2 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It still isn't personal, it's a simple comparison of POV. If you hadn't called someone else's good faith contribution "ridiculous", I wouldn't need to compare POVs to make a point. You're welcome to your own opinion of what is appropriate for an article, but your incivility is very unwelcome. Again, I don't really care how many featured articles come from your interest set, but calling someone else's good faith contribution "ridiculous" is just plain wrong. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 23:50, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>It <u>still</u> isn't personal nor is it uncivil. If you're not willing to calmly and rationally debate the relative notability of subjects you're interested in as compared to those that others are interested in, then simply don't use "ridiculous" or "not notable" as your argument to delete. Comparison of our POVs regarding notability, when notability is used as the reason to advocate deletion of retention of an article, is neither personal, nor an attack; its the <u>only</u> avenue available for debate.

<li><b>Comment</b> Quintin, as you have interest in this area, why not work together on creating an NPOV article on the community, which does not unduly promote DeAngelo or any other commercial interest?

<li><b>Comment</b> Quintin, what you don't realize is that <i>everything</i> related to the seduction community is regarded as commercial spam by a large number of WP deletionists. We need to start from the beginning without any promotional biases toward any particular website or any commercial seduction teacher. (This article is the most poorly written of the three you mentioned and the most POV.) Lest you or I be accused of sockpuppetry or spamming. The bottom line for a lot of people is that the subject of guys picking up women is controversial and not notable, regardless of the amount of Google hits, television and newspaper coverage. <a href="../../../d/u/t/User%7EDutchSeduction_7022.html" title="User:DutchSeduction">DutchSeduction</a> 09:56, 6 October 2005 (UTC)

DeAngelo and Jeffries are two of the big commercial teachers to come out of the <a href="../../../s/e/d/Seduction_Community_12c9.html" title="Seduction Community">Seduction Community</a>. These two are also the ones who do extensive Internet marketing, so you will definitely get some Google hits for them. Where media coverage is concerned, the most interesting (and IMO most NPOV) story revolves around the <a href="../../../s/e/d/Seduction_Community_12c9.html" title="Seduction Community">Seduction Community</a> itself and covers a number of the "schools of thought" on this phenomenon. <a href="../../../s/e/d/Seduction_Community_12c9.html" title="Seduction Community">Seduction Community</a> had an extensive list of media references due to the recent publication of a book on the subject, 'The Game' by Neill Strauss. <a href="../../../d/u/t/User%7EDutchSeduction_7022.html" title="User:DutchSeduction">DutchSeduction</a> 04:15, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> So was David DeAngelo (referenced in this new best-selling book 'The Game' by Neill Strauss). All the more reason to keep the article, as his program is now referenced in mainstream materials. To make an arguement something needs to be removed because there's a commercial element to it would require removal of every product/company article on Wiki (IE - movies, high-tech companies, etc.) And yes, his material changed my life as well. -- <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarrettmagic_ed4a.html" title="User:Barrettmagic">Barrettmagic</a> 07:51, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> Barrett, I agree. See my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:DutchSeduction" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:DutchSeduction" rel="nofollow">talk page</a> and the VfU for <a href="../../../s/e/d/Seduction_Community_12c9.html" title="Seduction Community">Seduction Community</a>, which endeavors to provide an unbiased portrayal of the seduction community - i.e. the trainers, books, etc, teaching people how to seduce women. The topic overall is notable. The problem is that the subject is also controversial and a spam target. You are showing bias to one particular businessman in this case. He himself should probably be a footnote in a bigger story as he is barely mentioned in Neill Strauss' book. <small><a href="../../../d/u/t/User%7EDutchSeduction_7022.html" title="User:DutchSeduction">DutchSeduction</a> 12:26, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - the wording can be rephrased as much as needed, to better suit Wiki rules, but the service in itself is cool , works better and better, has been tested already in real life occasions like the Turin transport system in Italy, has a history, has been presented over Europe and US a few times already and has even been already mentioned or employed in various cross-pollinated interaction design projects presentations: it would be counterproductive and silly not to find a Wiki explanation.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but change wording! 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Fluidtime was an academic research project in Interaction Design Institute Ivrea, which examined how time is becoming more dynamic and personal as communication technologies advance. While I agree the sentence above is very close to advertisement, I would suggest we change the wording so that the entry can describe more about its core concepts. I think its concepts are interesting and worth keeping as a Wikipedia entry.</li>

<li>They would deserve an article, they are quite notable in France (even I who has absolutely no interest in hip hop have heard of them), but right now this article has no content whatsover, due to copyvio. So what should I write&#160;? Request for article&#160;? I suggest to replace by a place holder such as "Le Peuple de l'Herbe is a French hip-hop band" so that someone complement it with legit content.

<li><b>Hey Abbott!!!!</b></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Begining in 1967, 156 4 minute cartoons were produced with the help of Bud Abbott lending his voice. Almost everyone of them featured Lou Costello's character(voice by Stan Irwin) running for his life shouting "Hey Abbott!!!". They were produced by Hanna-Barbera Studios, RKO-Jomar Productions and distributed by: Gold Key Entertainment, King World Productions.</dd>
<dd>That information is well documented here <a href="http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon_information/28850-Kooks_and_Spooks.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon_information/28850-Kooks_and_Spooks.html" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> and other places. And the line "I've been a bad boy Abbott" appeared in most of the radio, film and cartoon versions of thier comedy as well.</dd>
<dd>Further if you do a google on "I'm a bad boy Abbott" you'll get a dozen hits stating that was one of their trademark lines in radio, tv and in the cartoons.</dd>
<dd>So why this got flagged for deletion and cited as nonsense is beyond me. It is clearly one of thier lines. Maybe Feydey just doesn't like the story.</dd>

<li><strike>The nomination is for the nn made-up term Babbat. It has nothing to do with the notoriety of Costello's catchphrase which is already documented elsewhere. <b>Delete</b>.</strike>. Changing my vote to <b>transwiki</b> to Wikidictionary as the article appears to have been revised so it's not suggesting the phrase "babbat" (<i>not</i> "Hey Abbott" which is not being debated here) was coined by A&amp;C since that form was never used in any of the A&amp;C movies and was bastardized by other parties to become "babbat". Still not worthy of a Wikiarticle, but probably would fit into Wikidictionary though there should still be some sources cited that this is an actual expression and not something just made up. I could create a term like "mickfiddling", come up with a definition and post it too. There are plenty of printed sources to back up the existence of Valspeak and its associated terms. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 18:48, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> So let me get this straight. First the item is nominated for deletion because someone thinks the catchphrase is bogus. Then it’s acknowledged the catchphrase is legit but the content is nonsense because it doesn't pertain to Abbott and Costello. The entry does not have anything to do with Abbott and Costello other than to explain where the origins of Babbat came from. In the United States our language evolves pretty quickly and is littered with slang which often is very regional. For example; <a href="../../../f/o/_/Fo_shizzle.html" title="Fo shizzle">Fo shizzle</a> my <a href="../../../n/i/z/Nizzle.html" title="Nizzle">nizzle</a> is non-English nonsense (why the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hell.html" title="Hell">hell</a> didnt that nominated for delete?). But if you are a teacher in Orange County California and tell your students they can’t use that in scrabble and that sideways N’s can’t be used as Z’s you'll be declared a racist and fired for being culturally insensitive. See <a href="../../../e/b/o/Ebonics.html" title="Ebonics">Ebonics</a> or <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_Vernacular_English_5350.html" title="African American Vernacular English">African American Vernacular English</a>. Because you have not heard <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babbat.html" title="Babbat">Babbat</a> used does not mean it is nonsense and not being used by people somewhere. I found an entry for <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valley_Girl_4b86.html" title="Valley Girl">Valley Girl</a> here at Wikipedia that describes nonsense terms like "Grody to the max", "Fer sure", "Gag me with a spoon" and what the origins of those words were. Now I'm sure if you surveyed a broad section of society no doubt they would think this was non-sense and just all around poor English. But if you asked the girl working at the Hot Dog On A Stick stand at the Valley Mall in <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encino.html" title="Encino">Encino</a> I'm sure she would tell you that it was very relevant to her and that it is just how she and her friends talk. Either way you argue it the fact is that it worked its way in to our culture and our language as evidenced by its entry here at Wikipedia and countless other sources. So let’s just call this what this is. An argument about cultural relevance which really has no place here. Cultural relevance crosses generational, geographical and racial boarders so much these days that what is relevant to one may be irrelevant and nonsense to another. We barely speak the same language from one coast to another anymore. Like it or not in certain circles <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babbat.html" title="Babbat">Babbat</a> is weaving its way in to conversation. If you hung out in brew pubs in Oregon or a DEFCON convention in Las Vegas you'd probably hear it so often that you’d ask “What the &amp;*^% does <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babbat.html" title="Babbat">Babbat</a> mean?” and is why I wrote that entry for <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babbat.html" title="Babbat">Babbat</a>. I was asked what it meant so many times that it was suggested I add it in Wikipedia. Which I might add was my first visit and only entry here. I actually took the time to read the manual, sign up for an account and post the thing. And I got to say I'm thoroughly unimpressed. I could care less if the entry stays or not. But as a community I think you guys got a lot of growing up to do if you're going to have a truly content rich site and not run people off who genuinely just want to contribute something. I can't even believe I'm having this discussion. The fact that Wikipedia gets caught in my spell checker and doesn’t appear anywhere in Webster’s is proof enough that you can make up anything you want, give it a meaning and it will catch on somewhere with some people. Catch a clue guys. I think <b>Catch a Clue</b> will be my next entry. MudPuppy610 10:28, 30 September 2005 (PST)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> Why not? Jake has a good point - I think this is a very valid entry. Believe it or not, I know some of these guys from DEFCON. I used to think there were four or five people who called themselves Babbat. The article set me straight. Thank you! I vote to keep the entry and allow it to be expanded. The person asking for deletion should move on to another victim entry.
