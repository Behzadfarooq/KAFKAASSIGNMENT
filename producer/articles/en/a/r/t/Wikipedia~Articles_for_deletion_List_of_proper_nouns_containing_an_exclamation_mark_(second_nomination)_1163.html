<p>The initial keep result for this article at its first AfD was contested at DRV. A very messy sequence of events ensued involving an out-of-process deletion (and reopening, and reclosing, of the first debate.) The confusing result was judged by DRV consensus to be in error. Please begin debate here <i>afresh</i>, concerned only with the merits or demerits of the article. This is a procedural renomination, so I <b>abstain</b>. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 03:32, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. To repeat what I said at the DRV, this page meets the basic standard of usefulness. Lists are useful for conducting research, e.g. on the topic of why entities choose to add exclamation points to trademarks. For instance, why was <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dare_%28album%29.html" title="Dare (album)">Dare (album)</a> released as "Dare!" in the U.S. and "Dare" elsewhere? A list is the best way to organize this information because it maintains its availability for those who are interested and does not intrude upon other pages. Presuming that our policies are directed at creating a useful reference work, it's hard to imagine that they are intended to cause us to delete useful pages such as this. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 04:12, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. Quick note - I deleted the article last time it was on AfD because whoever relisted it didn't remove it from the first day's AfD page it was on. At the time I came across the original AfD, it was 9 days old, and had something like 26 users supporting deletion, and 5 not. Not a tough call at all. But anyway.

<li><b>Delete</b> I don't buy the arguments about why this list would be useful. To use Christopher Parham's example, if I wanted to know why the album "Dare" had different names in the US and elsewhere, I'd go look at the article <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dare_%28album%29.html" title="Dare (album)">Dare (album)</a>, not this list. What purpose does this list serve? When do I ask the question: "what are all the proper nouns that contain an exclamation mark"? I can't think of a realistic answer to that. If you really need the information then proper use of a search engine can generate it. This list is so inherently unmaintainable that it actually gives you a false answer. It can never be useful. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gw</a><a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_Esperanza_97e1.html" title="User:Gwernol/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">rnol</a> 13:45, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
