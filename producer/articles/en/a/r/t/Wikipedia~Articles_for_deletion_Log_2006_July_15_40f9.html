<li>The problem is that totalitarianism comprises both fascist and communist regimes, so it's not clear why this should redirect to only one variety. Redirecting to <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalitarianism.html" title="Totalitarianism">totalitarianism</a> might make more sense, if there is actually something like a serious attempt at a definition that somehow bridges the gap between the two which we could then add to the article. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 05:44, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Furthermore, although attention has been brought to the article by the preceding AfD nominations, the case was closed without justification (or rather, an erroneous "copyvio" change), and nobody has improved the article other than making it a quote of Friedman.

<dd>On 1. We don't have any definitions yet. Neither Friedman nor DiLorenzo provide definitions.</dd>
<dd>On 2. According to my research: "Even more important, the changing climate of American culture is increasingly the threat of some form of totalitarian control which make the existence of privately-controlled education extremely precarious. And the growth of this economic totalitariansim with its political concomitants makes the work of racial advancement both more difficult and more necessary." -- The Impact of the War Upon Privately-Controlled Colleges and Universities for Negroes, Buell G. Gallagher, The Journal of Negro Education &gt; Vol. 11, No. 3, Negro Higher Education in the War and Post-War Reconstruction (Jul., 1942), pp. 346-358. Also no definition.</dd>
<dd>On 3. Absent sources, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> Value of the term in pol econ = 0, as amply discussed. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 10:46, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you look below you'll notice I've done rather extensive research on the term. For any term we consider encyclopedic, we should be able to establish the following: 1. provenance, 2. a trajectory of usage starting from the original, 3. a commonly understood formal or informal definition. See <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspicuous_consumption.html" title="Conspicuous consumption">conspicuous consumption</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creative_destruction.html" title="Creative destruction">creative destruction</a>, or <a href="../../../i/r/r/Irrational_exuberance_%28finance%29.html" title="Irrational exuberance (finance)">irrational exuberance (finance)</a> for typical examples of popular terms that have an economic origin (and not to forget, the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Dismal_science.html" title="Dismal science">Dismal science</a>). "Economic totalitarianism" has been used on a smattering of (disjointed) occasions by a number of people, but there is no evidence that any usage actually caught on to the point that if we say "economic totalitarianism" we mean it in the way Friedman or Gallagher have used it. I'm by no means opposed to putting popular economic terms into Wikipedia, but I'm opposed to putting paleoprotologisms here that have no definition, no agreed-upon meaning and no history of usage to speak of. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 17:17, 18 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Valid argument. On the other side, if I were to read Friedman and encounter the term, I might look it up on Wikipedia. It would be nice if I then would find your above argument, that although the term is being used, it has no real commonly accepted definition or meaning. This would help me in putting the hypothetical Friedman text in perspective. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucVerhelst_3fe1.html" title="User:LucVerhelst">LucVerhelst</a> 11:05, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. If you're going to base an article concerning <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_sciences.html" title="Political sciences">political sciences</a> on quotes you find Googling, I really wonder why we pay teachers to teach political sciences and analysts to observe and conceptualize politics? I mean, why bother reading books when you can describe a concept which is apparently related to <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalitarianism.html" title="Totalitarianism">totalitarianism</a> (in appearance only, IMO), on which thousands of pages have been written? If no one has any real knowledge of this concept, I don't think just Googling in quotes to "write an article" is a really serious solution. I do understand, however, that this provides some leisure time. But isn't leisure time best satisfied by simply reading and withstanding from contributing to a subject which only way of approach is "Googling it through"? <a href="../../../t/a/z/User%7ETazmaniacs_ae79.html" title="User:Tazmaniacs">Tazmaniacs</a> 18:01, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment to Taz</b>: Theres a difference between amazon's search inside and ghits. The former can be used just like anyone else uses a book to make statements within an article while the later is test in notability. Search inside is an electronic representation of pages concerning the search. With this method, you can easily source a whole article as long as its notable. You might have noticed that I specifically stated "Amazon.com" and not "google", or you might think they or one in the same. Either way, the article can be expanded once a serious contributor wishes to take the time to expand. <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynergeticMaggot_5ec3.html" title="User:SynergeticMaggot">Zos</a> 18:25, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I wonder if it's worth keeping a separate article for the ill-defined term. The situation feels somehow similar to Brown's gas. <i>Brown's Gas</i> is a stoichiometric hydrogen-oxygen mixture prepared through water electrolysis under certain conditions. Supposedly it gives more heat than expected, the extra energy usually being derived from the electrodes breaking up during preparation of the mixture. It's a favorite of the "free-energy crowd". Once can either track down the history of the idea in its incarnations, attempting to write an impartial account at Brown's gas on what is a fringe subject and trying to keep the article free of trolls, kooks, pseudoscientists and shady salesmen. The alternative would be to add a few paragraphs to the article on, say <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrogen.html" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> or <a href="../../../o/x/y/Oxyhydrogen.html" title="Oxyhydrogen">oxyhydrogen</a> to keep a balanced view of the subject matter and keep the article policed by people who know what they are talking about. (After <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Aquygen_678d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aquygen">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aquygen</a> I was thinking of writing a balanced history of the idea but then decided against it, it's an ephemeral subject.). <i>Economic totalitarianism</i> is certainly ill-defined (neither Friedman nor DiLorenzo attempt a definition) and a favorite of blogging wingnuts. Putting DiLorenzo's ideas into context with genuine, bona-fide uppercase Fascist economic practice of the 1930s seems the more sensible solution. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zak_7805.html" title="User:Dr Zak">Dr Zak</a> 06:44, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>DiLorenzo's "definition" is worthless. It's not even in a peer-reviewed article so that we could track citations. Discounting mirrors I get 12 unique hits for his definition, mostly blogs. The Von Mises Institute doesn't consider it worthy of indexing.<a href="http://www.mises.org/humanaction/theindex.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mises.org/humanaction/theindex.asp" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> It's an <i>idée fixe</i> semi-popular among a couple of partisan bloggers, which is even more reason why we shouldn't include it. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 07:11, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I wasn't arguing to keep this, rather this should be deleted. What I was trying to say is this: if the article turns out to be kept at the insistence of people a redirect is the lesser of two evils. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zak_7805.html" title="User:Dr Zak">Dr Zak</a> 15:22, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> What someone does on ebay has no relevance here. What you think of him/her has no relevance here. What would be relevant would be <u>specific</u> citations to demonstrate this band's notability. If they're not available on amazon (which sells just about everyone's albums, if they're released commercially) and not listed on allmusic, you've got an uphill battle.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: This may be a controversial and unpleasant subject. But that should not mean it should not be addressed in Wikipedia. I believe that it is a significant issue. I request you to read the references before making a decision.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One would think that Indians and Pakistanis/Bangladeshis, who once shared a common history, and are from a region that was once just one country, would be very similar. However the Indians and Pakistanis/Bangladeshis in UK have developed into very distinct communities, with different lifestyles and outlooks.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The data on employment and education is from UK government sources. These are very singificant measures. I am sorry, there is no gentler way to do the comparision. They do bring out the differences using concrete numbers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Those of you who have followed the news from UK, and the riots involving the "Asian" youth may have noted that that the Hindu Indians were not among the rioting youth, but rather on the other side. In one case the "Asians" burned the cars of the Hindus. I request you to please do read the articles on the riots in UK, before judging the article to be "pov".</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Should Indians in UK continue calling themselves "Asian"? Many don't think so. They resent not having a distinct identity. They were not among the "Asian" rioter. They have nothing to do with the "Londonistan". The article addresses this issue.

<p><b>Comment on the deletion proposal</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>Anirvan, in his proposal for deletion writes: <i>"The article also makes sweeping one-sided POV arguments"</i>. He also stated at <a href="../../../u/k/_/Talk%7EUK_Hindu_Identity_09b3.html" title="Talk:UK Hindu Identity">Talk:UK Hindu Identity</a> <i>"The article can be summarized in a line: "British Hindus are smart, wealthy, and good-looking, and hate being associated with evil Pakistani and Bangladeshi riot-causing terrorist-loving Muslims." It's racist, essentializing, full of unlabeled POV, and consists almost entirely of original research."</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I take strong exception to this. I did not write anything about Hindus being good-looking. As for the race, the Muslims of the subcontinent belong to the same race as Indians; in most cases they have risen from the same castes and tribes as Hindus.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think I need to defend what the UK government studies directly say about education and unemployment. However let me mention about two things that many apparently may find offending and POV.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Involvement in "Asian riots"</i>: Let me say this again, and you can check it yourself by looking at reports in British publications.

<dd><i>About the militancy</i>: It should be acknowledged that many among the Pakistanis/Bangladeshi communities in UK have tolerated Islamic militancy. It is no accident (and it is not a secret) that a number of notable participants and supporters of militancy, with activities spanning countries outside UK (including India and Pakistan), have come from the UK Pakistanis/Bangladeshi community. Even now, about 15% of them consider the underground bombers to be "martyers". I am sorry to bring this out, but it makes them and UK Indians very, very different. If it is not permissible to mention that on Wikipedia, then Wikipedia is not what I, and many others think it is; and I, and many others, should not be wasting their time on Wikipedia.--<a href="../../../i/s/k/User%7EISKapoor_fb2c.html" title="User:ISKapoor">ISKapoor</a> 05:43, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are problems with this article - mostly because of the fact that it is not NPOV. For example, it generalises by using statistics about British Indians and applying them to Hindus only. True, Indians do far better than other South Asians in the United Kingdom when it comes to money and education, but Indians are not a homogeneous group. Indians comprise of roughly 45% Hindus, 35% Sikhs and 15% Muslim. The statistics for Indians cannot be generalised to apply to Hindus alone.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, the article touches on an important (and a very none-PC point) that is felt by Indians. Indians dislike the moniker "Asian" because the largely inconspicuous Hindu and Sikh groups do not wish to be tarred with the same brush that Muslims have been tarred with. It's a way for Hindus and Sikhs to get away from the "everyone that's Asian is a terrorist supporter" opinion held by some. <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukh_2aea.html" title="User:Sukh">Sukh</a> | <span style="color: green;" lang="pa" xml:lang="pa">ਸੁਖ</span> | <a href="../../../s/u/k/User_talk%7ESukh_f94b.html" title="User talk:Sukh">Talk</a> 23:01, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear Sam, if I may call you that. Please note if I have added a reference to this article. It's from the online edition of an American newspaper called the Washington Post. Perhaps you could let me know if this would be considered reliable.

<dd>The trouble with that article is that it says <i>"An established hacker group known as "Bantown" claimed responsibility"</i>. Even if it had said that they had carried out a single attack on LiveJournal, that would be very shaky grounds for notability, being only a single event - <i>claiming</i> to carry one out is almost non-existant. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 09:50, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hi Sam. I would love to know your real reasons for wanting to delete this article. I don't understand your objection to the 'claim of reponsibility'. Perhaps your unaware that hacking Livejournal was an illegal act, and that so far no successful convictions have been brought against the perpetrators. Perhaps you can explain the distinction between claims of reponsibility and actual responsibility implicit in the words "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events". The facts remain
<ul>
<li>This article contains multiple references to news reporting of incidents involving Bantown</li>
<li>They are not all from one source</li>
<li>They do not all refer to a single incident</li>
<li>They include well-known and respected sources such as slashdot.org and the Washington Post</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Consequently any nomination based on non-notability is abusive. The fact that this AfD nomination is being ballot-stuffed by IP-based users who have no other edits on record is further evidence of this abuse. <a href="../../../v/i/a/User%7EVia_strass_3093.html" title="User:Via strass">Via strass</a> 21:20, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear Sam, I have taken the liberty of quoting form Kotepho's comment referenced by you:
<ul>
<li>Can an AFD be closed based on the weight of arguments instead of numbers? The answer is obviously yes, in some cases. I don't think anyone really cares that 'votes' from (sock|meat)puppets and new users are regularly ignored. If 20 people vote keep, but one person points out it is a copyright violation, can it be deleted? <b>If 20 people vote delete because of lack of sources, and one person finds mentions in the NYTimes and Washington Post, can it be kept? I say yes.</b> While this closure is not as clear-cut as these other cases, I do not see it as being egregiously out of line. If they cannot, we should get rid of "NOT a democracy" and move AFD back to VFD. Thus, I do not think arguing this on procedural grounds has much merit. [emphasis mine]</li>

<li>There is no such a thing as a "permanent stub". The definition of a stub is that it is a basis for expansion.

Since I don't see a particular target, I might as well say keep as there is not a problem that requires deletion currently presented. Kotepho 14:27, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> To be fair,just wanted to note that there seems to be some influx of pro-deletion new users (probably from a rival hacker group or something) which would account for some of the more extreme comments above.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I am not a bantown member, I am in fact a member of a "rival hacker group or something" called the GNAA. But this is a notable article. Attacking LJ and getting however many accounts IS notable. I'm pretty sure they weren't the ones to crack freenode, though. --<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStaos_7ea7.html" title="User:Staos">Staos</a> 16:18, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Is this a discussion of the ethics or lack of thereof of Bantown and its members, or is it a discussion of whether an encyclopedia should have an article about the group that is beeing refered to in day to day conversations and are certainly noteworthy for their efford in the LJ case and the later Freenode hijack.</li>

<li>I suspect this deletion is simply because of a morality matter which should have no impact on this. Unless there is a secret Wikipedia morality policy? Wikipedia's role is not to be moral. It's role is to be an encyclopedia. This strongly smells like people who simply don't agree/like the subject of the article wanting to scrub them from the system based on that. Also, I should add, playing a role (based on four published web sources) in forcing a service with 10 million plus accounts to change their systems permanently is noteworthy. There are stubs that no one makes a fuss over for even stupider/weaker things. Deleting this article is inappropriate based on bias by WP editors. NOTE: I have nothing to do with bantown. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> 18:07, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I should add, if we're going to start playing games of ethics over what should/shouldn't be in WP, we might as well nominate <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Qaeda_fab2.html" title="Al-Qaeda">Al-Qaeda</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">Pedophilia</a> for deletion. I think even more people find both of those abhorrent than do Bantown. Crusading/POV warrioring etc. by select groups of admins to delete things they don't like must be stopped. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERootology_9f38.html" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a> 18:14, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You illustrate my point quite well. The nomination is not on grounds of abhorrency, it is on grounds of non-notability. <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamas.html" title="Hamas">Hamas</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Qaeda_fab2.html" title="Al-Qaeda">Al-Qaeda</a> et al have acres of news coverage from reliable sources dedicated to them - <a href="../../../p/a/e/Paedophilia.html" title="Paedophilia">paedophilia</a> ditto, plus numerous academic studies into its causes, its effect on children and why Americans can't spell or pronounce it correctly. Hence, we can write a comprehensive article on them while sticking to that which is verifiable. Bantown has, so far, two reliable sources with no more forthcoming, none of which provide a claim to notability (well, they claim that they hacked LiveJournal and FreeNode... so basically, they claim that they have a claim... rock on). Plus the usual post office gossip from the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_village.html" title="Global village">global village</a>. I dunno, I just think there's not much of a comparison between prosecuting a global jihad by launching hundreds of rockets against Isreal, and t07a11y f1gh71ng t3h p0w3r d00d by annoying a bunch of emos reading each others' diaries.

If it's content of notable nature--for better or worse--it deserver inclusion. Also, how many sources are needed for noteworthiness? Trolling related or other controversial topics I feel are held to a higher and more rigorous standard than most articles.

<p>This quest for deletion here (and at the <a href="../../../g/n/a/GNAA_29cf.html" title="GNAA">GNAA</a> article) is against Wikipedia's own policies based on what I suspect is admins having a negative view of the participating group that is covered. I could care less personally whether this article stays or go based on the content. However, based on WP's own rules removing this one in this manner would be a flagrant disregard of our own policies, in my opionion, for "not liking them". Any such deletion should be fought tooth and nail on that criteria.</p>
<p>Would anyone care to try and demonstrate why any of the conditions I list above are not met? Everything of this nature needs to be kept in check.

<li><b>Comment</b> I have added further information to this article in response to comments and criticisms made on this page. Not including Slashdot stories, there are now 3 references and a primary source linking the subject to newsworthy events. A reference and a primary source give direct evidence that Bantown are prime suspects for the two attacks, although their responsibility has not been 'proved'. These references include well-known news outlets - none of them are forums or user-sourced comment. While I understand Slashdot does not fact check, the two front page stories at least show the general level of interest in the topic. The references on this page are much better than most other short articles on wikipedia.</li>

<dd>There are now 11 'Keep' comments on this page and 17 'Delete' comments, at least three of which seem to be sockpuppets (Qurve, ZomgPete and 67.191.90.151), some other of which do not justify themselves sensibly (eg Cheburashka, 71.112.141.236). It really doesn't seem to me that we will acheive any consensus to remove this article. Is it possible that we can agree to end this farcical process? Then I can get back to my work and those people whose main motivation on wikipedia is deleting other people's work can perhaps focus on <a href="../../../l/e/s/Lesbian_until_graduation.html" title="Lesbian until graduation">Lesbian until graduation</a> or similar.</dd>
<dd>If you are someone who has repeatedly called for deletion on this page, it would be courteous if you could leave a comment saying whether or not you are going to continue calling for the removal of this article. If you are going to carry on I think you should give a responsive answer to all of rootology and my points above. As I already pointed out I have other things to do than trying to stop people deleting things I wrote in good faith.

<dd>Apart from my concerns above, which a chat log does not nullify, I cannnot support retaining an article where the claim to notability rests on supposed crimes for which no-one has been convicted, per <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_cfbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons">Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons</a> (in which I am a great believer, in contrast to the "it's the Internet, you can say anything" attitude that seems to prevail around articles like these). It may seem like an irrelevant concern given that the group involved has themselves claimed to be responsible, but I can assure you that it will look very different to everyone involved when they're 10 or even 5 years older. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 12:57, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>It is not a 'chat log'. It is the official response by the operators of the irc network <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freenode.html" title="Freenode">Freenode</a> to the attacks. They are an irc network so the official comment was made on irc. The page this log appears on gives context.</li>
<li>Perhaps you should direct your attention to the page <a href="../../../o/s/a/Osama_bin_Laden_a745.html" title="Osama bin Laden">Osama bin Laden</a>. AFAIK he has claimed reponsibility for numerous acts of terrorism, but has not yet been convicted of any of them. This objection is laughable.</li>
<li>Bantown is not a living person and this article does not refer to any living person who may or may not be involved with Bantown. The links between the two attacks and a person or persons <i>acting under the name Bantown</i> has been proven, I needn't reiterate this again. If you feel the article should be reworded to avoid incriminating anyone you are free to do so. This has nothing to do with notability.</li>
<li>I'm not asking that you <i>support retaining</i> this article, just that you stop trying to get it deleted.</li>

The fact that other articles about vandals and criminals exist does not impinge on the notability of this article.

<li>Hi Tychocat. Thanks for your input. If you would take the time to look thru this page and the article you would see that the issue of 'claimed responsibility' has now been addressed about 5 times. Apart from the question of whether this is a genuine caveat to notability the article now includes the following sources:
<ul>
<li>An internet security expert from the Washington Post discussing in detail Bantown's livejournal attack after having interviewed them at length.</li>
<li>The official public statement and Q&amp;A session given by a Freenode staffer in which they cite Bantown as suspects for the network takeover</li>

Anyone who has appeared (or been involved in) in a film or TV production can have their own listing if a user takes the time to submit their name and if they can be verified as being actual people.

<li><b>Extra strong delete.</b> This is an article interesting only to a niche audience. Most of the 300,000,000 inhabitants of the United States, for example, where the film was produced, would not choose to read any of this without a financial incentive. Since Wikipedia was designed in part for low-income children who are probably more worried about having enough money for lunch rather than enough money to buy Star Wars toys, I think this should go. It violates the spirit of the project. I can't imagine a kid in a missionary school in Kenya caring about this or even beginning to understand why it would be important to anyone. Wikipedia is not paper, but the flagship Wikimedia project should have an image to uphold and the thought of someone finding this on Special:Random pages is an embarassment to me. I'd also support <i>transwiki</i> to an appropriate Wikia project, such as Wikia or a Wikibook on film production. Erik the Rude 11:47, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> This article should be deleted because Wikipedia, rather than being for anyone who wants to learn, is actually for people who are too poor to avoid Star Wars merchandise and therefore should be protected from reading any article which mentions something which has a product attached to it? I have never heard of this or anything like this as a criterion for deletion. In fact it seems to me that this editor is displaying a bias towards a certain vision for wikipedia not shared by all who contribute.</dd>

<p>Also, if we deleted every article which was interesting to a niche audience, we'd delete half of wikipedia.

<li>It seems you're correct. I wasn't aware of the other national pages when I created the afd, but I understand the motivation of keeping it now. I'm withdrawing the afd, accordingly. I would recommend that you take Fabrictionary's comments to heart, however: the page isn't even close to neutral in its current form, and needs radical revisions to be brought up to Wikipedia standards. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 02:55, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Just because something is real does not make it instantly notable or worthy or a Wikipedia article. The only claim of notability was tacked on by a user whom removed the prod<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Triangle_Town_Center&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=63570983" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Triangle_Town_Center&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=63570983" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>, just for this discussion. The user whom wrote it, most likely doesn't know about this mall, also the one line claim to notability, which is extremely weak, is unsourced. There is nothing unique or notable about this mall. I think using critea from <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, is an excellent way to assess the notability of nearly anything. The only coverage this mall got was for being a mall, and that coverage is not about anything notable but about stores and the like. If the mall could prove it was notable like, say <a href="../../../m/a/l/Mall_of_America_3a18.html" title="Mall of America">Mall of America</a>, then yes this would be notable. However, just existing is not reason to keep an article that barely asserts importance. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font></a><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="red">sox</font></a> 12:11, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Wikipedia is not a source for maintaining government propaganda to mislead the public about how things are or are not. If there is editing required then I don't see any reason why someone can't add possitive things to say if this is seen as all negative by anyone. I am sure people see this as balanced factual information.</p>

<p><a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiRoo_dac4.html" title="User:WikiRoo">WikiRoo</a> 12:38, 15 July 2006 (UTC) Looks like some people here are getting all their friends together to post in favour of deleting this article. Someone once said something about protesting too much! I have more details and information to post about the uniqueness of Regional Government in Ontario Canada and will provide links and other reference material to augment this article. I don't see what all the fuss is about. But since the Regions altogether spend close to $10 Billion dollars and therefore a lot of people are dependants on them it may explain some of the insistance against publishing negative details. The same holds true with lack of press about their activities.</p>

<p><a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiRoo_dac4.html" title="User:WikiRoo">WikiRoo</a> 15:04, 15 July 2006 (UTC) Regional Governments in Ontario are considered by many to be the most corrupt type of government in the world for being outside of public scrutiny hidding behind a false democratic front. The network of families and individuals pilfering from the $10 Billion dollars anually is well known and documented by people that have dealt with them. They use these billions of dollars in public spending to advance their interest. The people that are dependant on the corruption of Regional Government, which includes many professionals and legal systems will do anything to preserve the status quo and keep from general public knowledge the basic structural problems that permit their form of corruption, favoratism and encumbancy to by maintained. I am surprised that we don't yet have hundreds of posters comming here to ask for this article to be deleted.</p>

<li>I disagree. I would recommend that you read the introduction of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. It indicates that "notability" is not in and of itself the reason for inclusion of deletion of a subject. Instead, it helps determine whether a subject will meet the Wikipedia policies of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not including indiscriminate information</a>. For example, <a href="../../../e/d/u/Eduard_Einstein_f765.html" title="Eduard Einstein">Eduard Einstein</a> is probably not notable, but being Albert's son, he meets <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, so the article on Eduard survived an AfD. -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalcoff_a391.html" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> 23:14, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is one of my top favorite pages, so I have a decent grasp on it. However, this page is drastically different, and that AfD is really questionable and most likely should be reseructed as most of the people whom thought the article should have been kept have some some not so stable reason to remain. And for pointing to another article, I kindly ask you to read <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">WP:INN</a>. Let's examine this article. "Mayor of the Town of Caledon, Ontario, Canada," that's the article, a one line sentence that is just perfectly fine in the main article. There is no reason for a seperate page for something that alreadly exists near ver batem. Comparing this and Einstein's son is like comparing apples and oranges. E's son has a slim range of notability (I may re-nom it for AfD), while this subject's notability does not exist and is not necessary for a Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font></a><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="red">sox</font></a> 00:34, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree that this is a terrible "article" as it exists. No one should create an article just to create it. That said, it certainly is expandable. I'm sure there are several interesting issues surrounding Caledon -- the province is trying to put most of the town off-limits to development, for example, and the mayor of Mississauga is trying to get rid of Peel Region. Morrison must have opinions on these matters and others. Certainly, the article could be expanded into something worthwhile, perhaps by someone willing to look through the archives of the community newspaper. -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalcoff_a391.html" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> 02:36, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If it can be expanded, please tell me what makes her notable/unique from other mayors/politicians? The things you listed are more of local flavor and notability, there is nothing notable about her outside of her limited scope of notability, which should exist only within the city's article. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font></a><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="red">sox</font></a> 02:56, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It doesn't matter. "Notability" is not, in and of itself, a criterion for deletion. If the information is verifiable and of interest to a significant number of people, it can stay according to current WP policy. -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalcoff_a391.html" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> 03:46, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Notability is and can be a criteon for deletion, it's the main reason why articles about students whom stress notability within their scope of "notability," are deleted. The logic you are proposing is contradicting WP policy itself. If we took everything and didn't have standards for notability (like <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>) this site would be bogged down with hundreds upon hundreds of articles not worthy of inculsion. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font></a><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="red">sox</font></a> 03:49, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It should also be noted that, by simply reviewing a number of similar AFDs, it's clear that community consensus is that general notability must be established for an article to survive here. --<a href="../../../n/m/c/User%7ENMChico24_74ee.html" title="User:NMChico24">NMChico24</a> 03:52, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> disclaims any pretense of being a criterion for deletion. It reads, "<b>This guideline is not Wikipedia policy</b> (and indeed the whole concept of notability is contentious). However, it is the opinion of many Wikipedians that these criteria are a fair test of whether a person has sufficient external notice to ensure that they can be covered from a neutral point of view based on verifiable information from reliable sources, without straying into original research (all of which are formal policies). <b>Failure to meet these criteria does not mean that a subject must not be included, meeting one or more does not mean that a subject must be included</b>." (my bolding) It appears to me that "notability" is a tool used to assess whether an article can meet criteria for inclusion (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, etc.) and is not a criterion in and of itself. -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalcoff_a391.html" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> 03:59, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Ok, let's put it like this: whom aside from the people in the town care about her? What has she done outside the town that has made her noted by "outsiders," has she done anything within the town to make her notable? I am serious when I purpose this, it's a serious issue that needs to be approached. What exactly gives her reason for the article to remain? <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font></a><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="red">sox</font></a> 04:06, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>First, I think that enough people within the town of 50-60K alone would be interested to make the article something more than "indiscriminate information." I think that her views on the Ontario Greenbelt and the shape of Peel Region might make her of interest to some of the 5.3 million people of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Toronto_Area_aadf.html" title="Greater Toronto Area">Greater Toronto Area</a>. I don't know enough about her to say what she has or hasn't done. From quick Internet searches, it seems Morrison is not nearly as outspoken as some mayors, but any mayor of a town of 50,000 will have to have made some significant deicisions. The article should stay because, while it is crap now, it theoretically could become full-length without violating policies like <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalcoff_a391.html" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> 04:19, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>50-60K isn't that big of a community, my city has 98K and our former mayor who was noted in papers like the Boston Globe has borderline notability. The issue is: "If she is so outspoken has she gained any coverage for this?" The answer from what I can tell is: no. There are alot of outspoken people out there, but that doesn't make them worthy of being put up here. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font></a><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="red">sox</font></a> 04:25, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Now we're at the crux of the problem. I think a mayor of a town of 50K is "notable" and you don't. (I grew up in a city of 15K, so 50K seems big to me.) Who's right? There's no way to know. That's why "notability," in and of itself, cannot be the criterion to decide whether a subject should have an article. It can only help us determine whether the article meets other criteria, most importantly whether there's enough independent, verifiable info out there about her. My feeling is the answer to that question is yes -- a search on /+Morrison +Caledon/ in the <a href="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/results.html?num=25&amp;st=basic&amp;QryTxt=%2BMorrison+%2BCaledon&amp;sortby=REVERSE_CHRON&amp;datetype=7" class="external text" title="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/results.html?num=25&amp;st=basic&amp;QryTxt=%2BMorrison+%2BCaledon&amp;sortby=REVERSE_CHRON&amp;datetype=7" rel="nofollow"><i>Toronto Star</i> archives</a> finds 69 hits. I'm sure the <i>Orangeville Citizen</i>, <i>Brampton Guardian</i> and <i>Caledon Enterprise</i> also have had lots to say about her. -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalcoff_a391.html" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> 04:35, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't think the issue is really the notability of the town/city/community itself, it really has to do with outside sources. A mayor is obviously going to garner alot of coverage from a local city/town and state/province, I think politicians since they will gain automatic coverage from local sources should be held to somekind of national coverage. I know it sounds shaky, but I am tired. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font></a><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="red">sox</font></a> 04:41, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I disagree that this is spam. I created this page simply to detail this consulting firm. It is not an advertisement masquerading as an article, and the text maintains a neutral point of view.

<li>I'll accept for the moment that your intention was not to create a spam article. The AfD runs for five days, so you should have plenty of time to find sources. Even if it gets deleted, a friendly admin would probably undelete it upon later presentation of appropriate sources.

<li>You're right. This company will never cease to fail the "rough guidelines" at WP:CORP unless it is made public. None of the mentioned lists (Fortune, Forbes, etc.) include private companies that have no stock market indices. If these guidelines must be strictly, objectively adhered to at all costs, then I concede - please close this discussion as soon as possible and get this over with. However, I still believe this is a case (like so many others ) where "non-notability" is not a truly valid criterion for deletion. Consider that this is not spam, vanity, etc.; that this aricle was created to give information (that I certainly would have liked to have earlier), not to make an object more famous; and that besides "non-notability" according to guidelines that cannot possibly apply to companies like these (no significant online/Google presence is directly, positively associated with its importance?), no other reason to delete this article has been given. This article does currently or can in the future provide information that is not available elsewhere on Wikipedia, such as who was responsible for the websites of major, <i>notable</i> companies. The potential for crosslinks when appropriate strengthen the notability of the article. Mgiuffrida 17:30, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> As a developer for a consulting company (not listed in Wikipedia) which has also developed the websites for many major notable companies, my personal opinion is that no one cares who built the websites.

<li><b>Cautious Keep</b> This is a difficult one. Sandy is really quite well-known amongst uh... the mainstream porn-mag reading public of at least the UK. She's had only a modest career as a porn actress but has been much more successful as a porn magazine model. A no-brainer for a Porn wiki - if there is one out there. For main wikipedia, verification of her fame is difficult. Can anyone come up with her features/shoots for mainstream mens lifestyle magazines GQ and FHM? That would help. Bearing in mind the limitations of Alexa rankings (which can underrepresent as well as overrepresent), I would note that Sandy's Club Sandy website (which she owns) has an Alexa ranking of 8,055 <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=clubsandy.com&amp;url=clubsandy.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=clubsandy.com&amp;url=clubsandy.com" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> compared with US porn superstar <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jenna_Jameson_fd39.html" title="Jenna Jameson">Jenna Jameson</a>'s own official Club Jenna website which has a ranking of 16,489<a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=clubjenna.com&amp;url=clubjenna.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=clubjenna.com&amp;url=clubjenna.com" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> - even though Jenna has an advantage in being much more well known in the United States, has a well established video career, and has been aggressive in her website publicity e.g. multiple billboards including 4-storey billboards promoting her Club Jenna website up on <a href="../../../t/i/m/Times_Square_cdcd.html" title="Times Square">Times Square</a><a href="http://www.mk-magazine.com/news/archives/000553.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mk-magazine.com/news/archives/000553.php" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>, and Jenna's website has been around since 1998 or earlier and Sandy's since 2003 (based on whois.net registration data) <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 12:25, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: As an attempt to reorganise the india-and-christianity-related pages I came across this as one of a bunch of pages created by the same editor a few months ago and then abandoned. Most of the pages for the church and catholics are divided up into region-specific articles, like <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholicism_in_Goa_2fdf.html" title="Roman Catholicism in Goa">Roman Catholicism in Goa</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholicism_in_Mangalore_4542.html" title="Roman Catholicism in Mangalore">Roman Catholicism in Mangalore</a>. Konkani is a language. I prodded it, pointing out that whatever useful information, whenever it comes, will be put on the appropriate pages. Deprodded with the statement "this is not about Goa". Sending it here, though am actually quite neutral about it, perhaps could be replaced with a redirect or a list of alternative articles. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 05:40, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Vanity autobio, spam, unverifiable notability</p>
<p>This person is a persistent Wikipedia spammer. His story seems to be that he's a real estate guy who dresses like Mick Jagger and plays in a part-time Rolling Stones cover band (the Unauthorized Rolling Stones). His claims of notability are hard to verify (see Talk:Rudy Colombini for some attempts). Allmusic.com lists two solo albums but one of them appears to be self-published (just all Google search hits on the supposed label name, "Marvelous Show Productions" reach the Unauthorized Rolling Stones site). The other appears legit if maybe a bit obscure. He claims to have co-written the soundtrack for Rumblefish, but IMDB and the DVD credits don't mention him, so the claim is in doubt and by extension the other claims are also in doubt. His claim of membership <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Divine_Comedy_%28band%29&amp;diff=14318776&amp;oldid=14282708" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Divine_Comedy_%28band%29&amp;diff=14318776&amp;oldid=14282708" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> in well-known band <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Divine_Comedy_%28band%29_cb28.html" title="The Divine Comedy (band)">The Divine Comedy</a> has also been disputed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Divine_Comedy_%28band%29&amp;diff=16348796&amp;oldid=15680911" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Divine_Comedy_%28band%29&amp;diff=16348796&amp;oldid=15680911" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>--the diff's edit summary says he was in a US goth band of the same name.</p>
<p>The article is almost certainly autobiography, since the anon IP that posted it resolves to the street address of the Nob Hill Hotel owned by the subject (see talk page). Nob Hill Hotel was a spammy article from the same IP, now deleted; he also inserted it into a cluster of large, famous Nob Hill hotels at the <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nob_Hill%2C_San_Francisco%2C_California_c329.html" title="Nob Hill, San Francisco, California">Nob Hill, San Francisco, California</a> article although the hotel itself is quite small (it's in the middle of a residential block far away from the Nob Hill hotel region--I'd say it's actually not in Nob Hill (uppercrust region of SF) at all but in the northern part of the <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tenderloin%2C_San_Francisco%2C_California_2a57.html" title="Tenderloin, San Francisco, California">Tenderloin</a> (region of SF with a bad reputation because of its downtown slum area, though the hotel wasn't in that part of it); however, that's tangential. He entered vanity articles for Music City SF and San Francisco Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as if these were legitimate, notable venues, when in fact neither of them has ever been open to the public (they're planned for the same address, were supposed to open a year ago, but are apparently stalled in construction (see talk page), articles now deleted). He similarly put replaced a link to the large Mark Hopkins hotel with one to his Fitzgerald Hotel which doesn't even pretend to be in Nob Hill <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nob_Hill%2C_San_Francisco%2C_California&amp;diff=21589837&amp;oldid=21439473" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nob_Hill%2C_San_Francisco%2C_California&amp;diff=21589837&amp;oldid=21439473" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>. I list all this stuff to show that the main motivation for the articles seems to be spamming.</p>
<p>Fitzgerald Hotel (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Fitzgerald_Hotel_d891.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Fitzgerald Hotel">deletion discussion</a>, now a redirect) and Villa Soma (redirected) were two more of his promotional hotel articles. These hotels were also plugged in his autobiography but I didn't see them as relevant to whatever notability he might have as a musician, so I deleted the promotions and just said that he owns several hotels. But I think that the article is mostly unverifiable and what's left isn't enough for notability per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, so this AFD.</p>

The editor, after removing the PROD tag, placed a comment in the article stating this institution conveniently has little Web presence.

<li><b>DON'T DELETE&#160;:</b> The picture was most likely developed by a student or someone outside of the school. The fact that information about the institution's "conviently" minimal web presence was entered after the deletion of the PROD tag simply shows that the PROD tag was seen and that viable information was added in which was mistakenly not added before.

<ul>
<li>Deletion of this article has no merit. It is not hurting any one for it's presence on the site. It is not producing falsified information in any way. It is an E-Federation site where people with english talent are able to re-produce that talent in the form of characters from their own minds. It is an art form, though many will not see it that way and that's fine. It is the perfect example to have on wikipedia for an example e-federation for those interested in the area. It has over 1000 members and growing and has seen a life span of over 3 years. There is simply not a good enough reason to delete it. Notability? What defines that anyways? Over 1000 people have visited and signed up to the website and if you look at the edit history, there is interest in this wiki and it will CONTINUE to be updated since the federation CONTINUES to live on and expand. The information and history will continue to be written. Is it so bad and so wrong to have a prime example of a successful and fun e-fed as an example wiki and as an extension of the E-Fed wiki? I don't think so. Please <b>keep</b> this article. It is a great addition to wikipedia and the fact that a couple persons do not enjoy or understand e-federations is not reason enough for it's termination. Thank you, and again, <b>KEEP</b> this article. --Shmylann13 14:12, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I am opposing PROD, I wouldn't have created the page if I didn't think he was notable. Also, there were already a few red wikilinks for him, so obviously others thought he was notable.

I've added Call of Cthulhu into the entry to reflect this.</dd>

<dd>Google claims to have 21,300 hits for "lynn willis", and though a good number of these are for other people, that still leaves thousands of hits.

If Chaosium is notable enough to get a Wikipedia entry, why shouldn't its Editor-in-Chief and "longest serving member" be notable enough for Wikipedia? If the Cthulhu RPG is notable enough, why not its current co-designer? Not to mention his other work.</dd>

<dd>Perhaps the number of redlinked wargames helped convince you that he only designed non-notable games, but that says more about the weak coverage of wargames on Wikipedia than Lynn Willis.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Thanks to Kchase for "playing fair" and adding my comments from <a href="../../../l/y/n/Talk%7ELynn_Willis_496c.html" title="Talk:Lynn Willis">Talk:Lynn Willis</a>. To summarize:
<ul>
<li>There were already redlinks from three articles for Lynn Willis, so apparently I was not the only one who thought he was notable.</li>
<li>The page lists some of his design credits, which implies that those who want to delete him consider all those games to be non-notable themselves. I have to wonder whether pro-deleters are familiar enough with the wargaming and RPG fields to know who is notable in them and who is not. Dungeons &amp; Dragons isn't the only "notable" RPG, after all.</li>

<li>I'm getting better at "playing fair". I don't have an opinion about whether the games themselves are notable, but I'm skeptical about pages for game designers. Perhaps a passing mention in the articles for Chaosium and Cthulhu would be appropriate? In any case, we have plenty of gamers on Wikipedia, so some knowledgeable comments shouldn't be long in coming.

<dd>I'm a wargamer, not an RPGer, so defending his notability based on what he's done since going over to the "dark side" feels a little strange. However, to wargamers, saying that games might be notable but not their designers, is akin to saying that Wikipedia should have entries for notable films but not their directors.</dd>

<dd>I think part of the difference in perspective comes from the way mass market boardgame publishers fail to acknowledge designers. Nowhere on the box or in the rules will you find the credits for Monopoly or Risk or Chutes and Ladders. Yes, you can find out from a historical source who designed Monopoly, but Parker Brothers and Milton Bradley want you to associate the games with them, not the designer. Furthermore, such games have relatively simple rules, so designing them doesn't seem like a lot of work.</dd>

<dd>But in fields like wargaming, where the designers are identified (and rules are typically more complex), designers can gain reputation and loyalty. For a "grognard" wargamer, there are designers that walk as gods among men. Now, Willis wasn't prolific enough to be in that category, and I'll admit that there are more prominent designers who don't have entries, but there are also less prominent ones that do. --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice">Groggy Dice</a> 09:52, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> (withdrawing nomination) I still don't think he meets WP:BIO.

However, I'm persuaded by Groggy Dice's argument in his last couple of paragraphs that these particular game designers generate a more substantial reputation. I saw enough minor webpages in those google results where Lynn Willis (and others) was mentioned prominently in a brief blurb about various games (examples: <a href="http://www.gamingreport.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Sections&amp;file=index&amp;req=printpage&amp;artid=168" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gamingreport.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Sections&amp;file=index&amp;req=printpage&amp;artid=168" rel="nofollow">[34]</a> <a href="http://www.maranci.net/rqpast.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.maranci.net/rqpast.htm" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>, plus this <a href="http://www.yog-sothoth.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=8" class="external text" title="http://www.yog-sothoth.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=8" rel="nofollow">interview</a>).--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 01:21, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Ah, but now I've found out from <a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghostbusters_%28role-playing_game%29.html" title="Ghostbusters (role-playing game)">Ghostbusters (role-playing game)</a> that he was a co-designer on that as well, and it won the HG Wells Award for Best Roleplaying Rules of 1986.

<li>When it comes to awards, one problem is that his work for Chaosium seems to have been very collaborative, so it's hard to find an award for which he would get sole credit. On the Chaosium site's list of awards<a href="http://www.chaosium.com/article.php?story_id=45" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chaosium.com/article.php?story_id=45" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>, I did find an award from the "Game Designer's Guild" for Lords of the Middle Sea. (Since that was the only wargame he put out for Chaosium, it's possible his other wargames also garnered some now-obscure awards.) But he should get partial credit for some of those awards, besides the Ghostbusters award I mentioned earlier. For example, the 3rd edition of Masks of Nyarlathotep won the Origins Award for Best Roleplaying Adventure of 1996. Though he was not the primary author of the original edition, he edited, rewrote, and contributed to it, and got co-author credit. And he also edited and did the art assignments, though not the layout, for the third edition.

As far as the Google testing goes, I tried to run a search that would clear out false positives, and even err on the side of caution. The reason I revised the result upward is that afterwards I thought of adding "cthulhu" to my terms, and found that just the combination '"lynn willis" cthulhu'<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22lynn+willis%22+cthulhu" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22lynn+willis%22+cthulhu" rel="nofollow">[38]</a> got 10,000 hits, more than my previous search terms combined! Also, note that these searches exclude pages where his games and works are mentioned, but he himself is not. For instance, a search designed to turn up hits for his Godsfire game, but excluding pages with "Willis," gets 1,350 results<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=godsfire+-felice+game+OR+wargame+-willis" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=godsfire+-felice+game+OR+wargame+-willis" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>.

<p><b>Comment</b>. I have now incorporated some of the additional information into the article, as suggested by Wine Guy. In fact, this whole process has actually been a blessing in disguise. I first intended to create the article based on his wargaming work alone; I didn't know what had happened to Willis since the seemingly abrupt end of his wargame designing. In the process of checking "what links here" I found him linked from some RPG articles, and was able to put that into what I was writing. And having to defend him against PROD and AfD has forced me to turn up more information, which has now gone into the entry as well.</p>
<p>Since AfD started, I have found four additional Wikipedia articles where he was already mentioned but not wikilinked; I have now linked him, sometimes finding someone else to link, too. I added a sentence into the Call of Cthulhu page, noting Willis' assumption of the game after its original creator left. I looked at the Chaosium entry, which I found to be very Stafford-centric, and put in a mention for Willis and the other designers whose names I had run across. As a result, I think there is now a healthy number of other Wikipedia articles linking to him, and that's before any entries have been created for any of his wargames! --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice">Groggy Dice</a> 08:39, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comments for inclusion and expansion:</b> More articles on politicians running for office, be it a municipal race, a national legislature, or an executive position, are important. One of the great strengths of Wikipedia is the fact that it contains current and up to date information as well as obscure information that is hard to find in other places. But the key is: information.</p>
<p>This article's subject is hardly borderline (see below for more on the concept and controversy of notability), to say so is highly subjective. Her inclusion needs to be objective and not a political ad. The simple fact that this subject is a credible candidate in an election makes her anything but borderline on the notability scales.</p>
<p>Elections are the lifeblood of the political process of a republic. Adding in the accomplishments of this subject (youngest woman elected to AZ Senate) and the case of calling her borderline makes even less sense.--<a href="../../../u/t/a/User%7EUtahredrock_5879.html" title="User:Utahredrock">Utahredrock</a> 14:57, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comments from nomination for deletion:</b> This article's subject is a borderline non-notable person. Gabrielle Giffords is currently only a candidate for the US House of Representatives, not actually a current politician. She was the youngest woman elected to the Arizona Senate, but I don't think that this makes her notable enough for inclusion. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarthVader_1e48.html" title="User:DarthVader">DarthVad</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarthVader_1e48.html" title="User:DarthVader">r</a> 08:14, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

It seems obvious that this article will be kept, but I wish to offer an explanation of why I did nominate the article in the first place. There seem to be a couple of candidates for this election that are going to have their pages deleted; for example <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_John_Courage_cfbd.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/John Courage">John Courage</a>. When I came across this page, it looked like she was pretty well was just a candidate for this election, as well as once being a politician in the Arizona Senate. I agree with <a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae'blis</a> that since she is no longer a politician she is not necessarily still notable. Also, being a candidate for this election does not imply notability either. I asked on IRC first before nominating this article for deletion, and a few users said that she was not notable, so I nominated the article. I didn't prod because it is obviously a borderline (and therefore controversial) case about notablility, so I took it here to ask the community whether this person is notable or not. It seems that the consensus will be to keep the article, and that is completely fine by me. At the end of the day, I wanted the community to look at this article and decide on its notability so that we can be sure that our articles are about notable people. To be honest, I was simply unsure of its notability; it wasn't that I "deemed" it to be unworthy. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarthVader_1e48.html" title="User:DarthVader">DarthVad</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarthVader_1e48.html" title="User:DarthVader">r</a> 05:58, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This proposal for deletion is absurd. Giffords is an accomplished Arizona politician and the leading candidate to replace Jim Kolbe. In a democracy citizens need as many sources of information as possible on their candidates. This article was created in attempt to provide basic facts and links to information on Giffords. It's bad enough how much politicians have to spend to get their messages out, Giffords, and candidates from all parties and levels of government are important to our political process. Supressing information about them makes no sense. Wikipedia exists not to promote a candidate or cause but to serve as a source of information. The discussion for deleting this article is misguided. <b>Instead people need to write more articles on other candidates.</b>--<a href="../../../u/t/a/User%7EUtahredrock_5879.html" title="User:Utahredrock">Utahredrock</a> 21:16, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I do not think we should have articles on U.S. House of Representatives candidates, but I think we should have articles on all approximately 7,500 state legislators. As a former state senator, she meets the "Political figures holding international, national or statewide/provincewide office or members of a national, state or provincial legislature." requirement of Wikipedia standards for article notability.<br />
Presently Wikipedia has articles on many members of the California, Texas, New York, Quebec, Ontario, and Tennessee legislatures. In the interest of conformity, I advocate that the results of this debate also be applied to other articles existing almost entirely on the basis of that person being a member of a state legislature. In addition, while I do not think being a candidate for a federal legislature is a qualification in itself to be listed in Wikipedia, I think it adds to the qualities listed above.<br />
An issue does not need to be decided at the federal level for it to be important. When an issue is to controversial for it to be handled, it is the state legislature that decides whether to set a minimum wage above the national level, to ban or allow gay marriage, to arrest you for possessing marijuana, to allow euthenasia, to raise state taxes, and if you can be arrested for not buckling your seatbelt. If a state legislature does not cooperate with the executive branch under certain circumstances, then, as in New Jersey, the government may even shut down. Please consider this when deciding whether or not non-federal politicians, judges, and cabinet members have a place in Wikipedia.

<li>Being elected to a state legislature makes someone worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia, according to the Wikipedia notability policy, whether now or 200 years ago. Information relating to her service in the Senate seems to have been temporarily removed, though I'm sure, given the lack of trouble I've had in finding things to write about current Tennessee senators, that there will be little trouble in finding something related to her past service. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Bush_238d.html" title="User:Daniel Bush">Daniel Bush</a> 23:44, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Please point out for me where we say that someone who has once held a state-level office is worthy of a biographical article. All I can find is <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a>, which uses the verb "holding", implying that they currently have the position.

<ul>
<li>I don't really have a strong opinion on state legislators, frankly I think simply being a state senetor does <i>not</i> confer inherant notability, but the current guidelines state otherwise. But just for clarification, are you suggesting that once someone leaves state office that their WP article should be deleted? The guideline really does need to be cleaned up in this respect. --<a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWine_Guy_7420.html" title="User:Wine Guy"><font color="#000080"><b>Wine Guy</b></font></a> <a href="../../../w/i/n/User_talk%7EWine_Guy_c683.html" title="User talk:Wine Guy"><font color="#000000"><small>Talk</small></font></a> 07:47, 18 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Essentially, yes. I think that if a person's ONLY claim to fame is that they were <i>once</i> a state senator, they don't necessarily need an article here. Of course, politicans usually find ways to become notable for other activities (notable bills sponsored, scandals, rousing speeches, etc) so I don't think this is a particularly high bar to set. I realize I may be in the minority at present. -- <a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae'blis</a> <i><sub><a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">(talk)</a></sub></i> 16:37, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Extremely detailed cruft about a bunch of "Pokémon" that are just placeholders in the game code, accessible only with a cheat device or a short circuit (really). There's nothing in this article that could possibly be sourced anywhere (the only source is a particularly bad Bulbapedia article), and I can't imagine how this could possibly be encyclopedic. Pokémon is notable, but every single glitch associated with it ever is not.</p>
<p>I came across these while working on merging the wholly crufty and unsourced glitch articles into <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon_glitches.html" title="Pokémon glitches">Pokémon glitches</a>, which is <i>not</i> included in this AFD. Suggesting that this article be merged there, however, isn't very helpful unless someone can also offer a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> with which to verify the claims in this article.

<li>Hmm. This is a tricky one, as I have contributed to these pages in the past. No article of this variety exists throughout the whole of the rest of Wikipedia. However, for those who wish to keep such information, they should be able to do so of their own volition - as I am certainly going to do in the future should this be deleted. Thus, for those who most want this article on Wikipedia, the article in itself is useless, and thus this equates to a regrettable, but not necessarily permanent, <b>delete all</b>. Does that represent a vote of <i>deal</i> or <i>no deal</i>, however? <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobo192_c260.html" title="User:Bobo192">Bobo</a><a href="../../../b/o/b/User_talk%7EBobo192_2f09.html" title="User talk:Bobo192">.</a> 05:37, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>In light of the number of sources which have been added, I am voting <b>Keep</b> on this. I'm not sure whether merging this with the main sex tourism article or having two separate articles would be optimal, I'm fine with either option. <s>I'm not entirely sure this should be deleted, but I'm concerned enough on this to nominate it. The article appears to have only one source, a book where the author matches the name of the person who wrote this article. In addition, the publisher which amazon.com lists for this book has only published two books... both by this same author.

<li><b>Revise, but provide guidance please?</b> Hi everyone, original author here. I read 800 books, articles, memoirs in three languages in my study of female sex tourism, which was reviewed by 25 scholars, including Erik Cohen, Suzanne LaFont, Scott South, Eugenia Wickens, Mick Bloor, Ron de Graaf, and Donald Symons, all leading experts on female mating behavior. In other words, the scholarship and editing of this book is on par, or surpasses, books published by larger houses, and tackles a niche of no interest to large publishers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the seminal works, such as "For Love and Money: Romance Tourism in Jamaica," by Pruitt and LaFont, are in scholarly journals such as Annals of Tourism Research that cannot be linked to directly, often not even indirectly. They can be cited w/o URL links I suppose? Another major work, April Gorry's "Leaving Home for Romance: Tourist Women's Adventures Abroad," is a doctoral dissertation that can only be purchased via UMI or viewed at UC-Santa Barbara. The most important newspaper articles lie behind the wall at Lexis-Nexus. Some of the best and most riveting online discussions on Lonely Planet's Thorn Tree were removed in the passage of time. If you want to know details on Victorian female sex travelers from the United States and Britain, who visited Europe and India, that will require a month in the Library of Congress looking at books, some in the antiquarian section.</p>
<p>If anyone has ideas on how to proceed on this topic w/ a paucity of possible external links, let me know, I can revise it. If you want someone else to tackle the topic, that is fine too, the question is ... who? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Jbelliveau (<a href="../../../j/b/e/User_talk%7EJbelliveau_a1ff.html" title="User talk:Jbelliveau">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jbelliveau_1173.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jbelliveau">contribs</a>).</small> --Jbelliveau 16:29, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>More work necessary</b> The author has done some good work to keep this article going, and, on reflection, there is a different slant on male and female sex tourism.

Bwitthh also thanks for the New York Times cite for "Libidos of a Certain Age" -- didn't know it was published yet -- I was interviewed by the reporter Wednesday, and her questions were basic yet so thought-provoking I came here to Wikipedia to put together starter information. It would be tricky to merge with the larger sex tourism article because the academic citations are so specific to female sex tourism but that is for the group to decide.

<li>Quick reply to some of the points raised earlier by Jbelliveau. First, welcome to Wikipedia, thank you for creating this article, and we hope that you will join in contributing and editing to other articles too. Freely available external web links are ideal references, but references from newspaper databases, thesis databases, published works, and library archives are also generally acceptable (even if not on open search engines like google scholar etc.) as many Wikipedians have access to such databases and can cross-check and confirm such references - this is not quite a routine part of the verification process, but does happen often. Also, all wikipedia articles are subject to editing by multiple authors of varying degrees of expertise - very often, no special expertise is necessary if an editor is simply creating content from verified external sources. On the subject of academic citations, these can be turned into small font footnotes. There may be cause for a separate subarticle if a main article's main body of text is too long, but this is not the case for references. But are there good reasons besides layout why there should be separate articles? <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 16:39, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Great question. So much of female sex travel requires at least a semblance of wooing and affection that some observers (Pruitt, Lafont) dub what is going on "romance tourism" instead. So there is a raging debate on the extent to which women's love journeys parallel male sex tourism. Also, making female sex tourism -- a very poorly understood activity -- a subset of the Sex tourism entry, would sort of bury the new information and interest in casual travel sex by women under some boilerplate on prostitution in Amsterdam and Nevada (? would think Nevada is not relevant to sex tourism). I do keep coming back to the question of design as well -- (being a student of Edward Tufte and how to present information) -- the Sex tourism entry does not have information on the history, reasons and depictions of male sex tourism. The female sex tourism article does have this information at this point. It's hard to envision a cohesive article that spans Nevada brothels and prosecution for pedophilia and then jumps into a longer, more detailed, with different subheads, discussion of female sex tourism. A proper article merging the two might have to be called the Globalization and Commodification of Sex and started from scratch and really address men, women, traveling for sex and a worldwide Affection Deficit Disorder. --Jbelliveau 17:14, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think there's a significant difference between male and female sex tourism. Destinations is a factor, even though I've seen an article detailing female sex tourism in Thailand (specifically British women; Taiwanese and Japanese women have been documented already) and I'd imagine male sex tourism would go to places other than SE Asia (which is probably more correct) and Eastern Europe. In addition, the part stating masculinity and feminity is not only stereotypical but Euro/Americentric. --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 22:34, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In terms of popular destinations, there's considerable overlap between female and male sex tourism, isn't there? <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 12:02, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Some overlaps in Thailand (though to simplify, men go to Bangkok / Pattaya, women to Phuket / Pattaya), the Dominican Republic and Cuba. Other sites have little overlap, i.e., the Philippines and Vietnam cater to men only; Greece, Barbados, the Gambia cater strongly to women. There are some places mainly catering to gay men and straight women, such as Morocco and formerly Haiti. --JBelliveau 12:11, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In that case, I think I basically agree with having separate articles. I recommend moving the male-specific content of <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_tourism.html" title="Sex tourism">Sex tourism</a> to Male sex tourism, and add a prominent disambiguation (not just in "see also") <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_tourism.html" title="Sex tourism">Sex tourism</a> to link to Male and Female articles. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 13:44, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Response to JBelliveau. It will be up to an administrator to decide whether this article should stay, 5 days after nomination. I don't see any reason now why it shouldn't stay, given the voting, when that happens anybody can create a redirect. It may be better to make <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_tourism.html" title="Sex tourism">Sex tourism</a> a disambiguation page to male, female and child (which is presently a redirect) sex tourism. There may be other related articles that should be listed as relevant to the general heading of <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_tourism.html" title="Sex tourism">sex tourism</a>. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichhoncho_144b.html" title="User:Richhoncho">Richhoncho</a> 14:55, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Response to JBelliveau Standard process is that the afd discussion stays up for 5 days and then an administrator (who should not have taken part in the debate) comes along and closes the debate, and takes whatever actions the admin thinks have been consensually decided by the debate. This is not a simple vote - the admin decides which side has the best arguments (taking wikipedia policy and precedents into account). Sometimes, the admin may decide that there is no consensus (in which case the article is kept and should not be renominated for deletion for 2 or 3 months). Occasionally, an admin may decide that the minority opinion in the debate has the better arguments, and make a decision that goes against the majority. People who think the admin closed the debate unfairly, may take the case to other admins at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review" rel="nofollow">Deletion Review</a>, where it's possible an article will be undeleted or relisted for discussion. An article can get a consensus of "speedy keep" or "speedy delete" votes which may be acted on by an admin, meaning that an article nomination lasts much less than 5 days. The admin may also decide to speedily keep or delete an article if it is clear that an article was incorrectly nominated or clearly breaks core Wikipedia policies (e.g. copyright violation). An admin may also decide to speedy keep if the original nominator withdraws the nomination, or if the article creator (but only if they have created almost all the article content, and there are no suspicions of ulterior motives) asks for the article's deletion. In this case, the article may be speedily kept once an admin notices that the original nominator has changed their vote. When the article closes, note that the admins does not have to undertake all the specific changes/renaming/editing actions suggested by users that are outside the main calls for deletion/keeping/merging etc. - usually its the responsibility of the users to follow up on that <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 15:01, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Often when you merge male and female data / information, you end up with mud, especially with regards to sexual behavior. For example, if you say the average American has eight lifetime sexual partners, that is close to meaningless, if the men have 20 partners and the women, three. The "merged" information is almost disinformation that obscures a very important distinction between male and female sex behavior that is the real point of the data. Sex tourism may be a similar case, where combining the two is like mixing vivid colors of paint and ending up with brown. I am not saying the articles cannot be merged, but to do so will essentially require (a) expanding the material on male sex tourism to be comprehensive and structured in parallel with material on female sex tourism (b) pondering whether the material in the sex tourism article regarding Nevada brothels and pedophilia prosecutions is germane to the larger question of sex tourism as a response to economic and affection-deficit problems in the West and the developing world.--JBelliveau 11:19, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>But, I see no issue with having a female-specific section of the article. My point is this: if female X is sufficiently different from male X, that is a good reason to have a section in the article about X discussing gender differences concerning X, or even two separate sections (one male, one female) within the article about X. But you still haven't given a reason for having two completely separate articles. And the reality is, even when female X and male X differ, there is still some commonality, so having two or three articles is going to inevitably result in overlap. So I think its better just to have one. --<a href="../../../s/j/k/User%7ESJK_cc2d.html" title="User:SJK">SJK</a> 10:09, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

It is true that <b>parts</b> of the chapter have been used at weddings, but that only makes the parts notable, not the whole thing as a unit, in the same way that <i>alas poor Yorick, I knew him Horatio</i> is an often used quote from shakespeare, but that doesn't mean we can justify an article concentrating on Act 5 Scene 1, all of Act 5 Scene 1, and only Act 5 Scene 1, of <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamlet.html" title="Hamlet">the play in question</a>.

<dd>I've been asked to clarify my vote. At a minimum, I think the article should not be deleted, but be preserved; be it in the article about the 1 Corinthians, or in a standalone article. I tend to favor the busting out of articles that can stand on their own from their parents, <i>see main article XYZ</i>, even when the sub-article is small. So if facing a choice between keep and merge, I would choose <b>keep</b>. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 23:26, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> not every chapter of the Bible is independently notable, this one is. It is the most common reading at weddings, was read at the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales, was the origin of the phrase "through a glass darkly". To Clinkophonist: the analogy with a Shakespeare play does not realy work. It's more akin to an individual sonnet, or perhaps <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosencrantz_and_Guildenstern_debd.html" title="Rosencrantz and Guildenstern">Rosencrantz and Guildenstern</a>. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 14:21, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, it isn't akin to a sonnet because it isn't a natural unit, the subject matter spans more than this chapter and/or breaks up within the chapter rather than spanning it; the "love" section starts at 1 Corinthians 12:31b and continues to 14:1b, and that it starts and ends half way through sentences demonstrates it was never intended to be a distinct unit. And what is worse is that the prophecy section seems to start at verse 9, i.e. the section that continues in chapter 14 starts in the middle of chapter 13, and the division that makes the love part mostly fit into its own chapter, rather than the prophecy part fitting into its own chapter is entirely arbitary. It is more akin to "lines 17-37" of a sonnet, where lines 17-37 are chosen for no notable reason other than that someone in the middle ages thought that lines 1-16 were a nice total size, and drew a line under them, then drew a line under 37 because lines 17-37 were about the same size. <a href="../../../c/l/i/User%7EClinkophonist_b598.html" title="User:Clinkophonist">Clinkophonist</a> 15:57, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, as much as I am sick and tired of hearing that passage at every wedding I go to. Its "notability" (if such a thing is necessary) is quite clearly set out in the article. People may be interested to see that <b>this was previously <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1_Corinthians_13_c39f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/1 Corinthians 13">nominated for AfD on May 16</a></b>. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 16:27, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. This passed its AfD with a "keep" result just two months ago and the chapter has not lost its notability since then. The suggestion that only "parts" of the chapter are notable, not the chapter as a whole, is misguided because the chapter is only 262 words long in the New International Version translation. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20corinthians%2013&amp;version=31" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20corinthians%2013&amp;version=31" rel="nofollow">[51]</a> The notable parts are basically all consecutive with each other. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 17:02, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> (or possibly <b>Merge and Redirect</b>). Here we go again! As stated last time: this is a key chapter from the bible which those interested in literature, irrespective of their own belief system, will want to know about.

By the way, has anyone spotted that this chapter is quoted in its entirety at <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charity_%28virtue%29.html" title="Charity (virtue)">charity</a>&#160;?

<li><b>Keep and don't Merge</b> No one cares about the whole First Epistle to the Corinthians.

<li><b>Keep and Weak Redirect/Merge</b> -- definitely notable on its own. I think it might be more encyclopedic to keep the whole epistle together.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> -- appears to be a notable passage, is used in Christian wedding rites. However, the current state of article is a train wreck and very non encyclopedic.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I've never believed that Alexa was a notable means of computing a websites popularity or notoriety. This is especially true considering a large portion of the community follows alternative browsing practices, and wouldn't be caught dead with an Alexa toolbar on their system. Such a practice is no different than that used for television monitoring, in which 1% of the poulation is responsible for all of the determined ratings. The entry for theshizz.org does not constitute advertisement, and it is a resource of several historical facts that are not common knowledge. The site has also been subject of several newspaper and media articles in the Arizona area with regards to the excellent work the site does in promoting bands and arranging the stellar Bands on Grand local music festival.--Nitramzero 16:23, 15 July 2006 (UTC) <small>User's only edit.</small>
<ul>
<li>It's not called the Phoenix-area video game music-related Wikipedia. It's just Wikipedia. Why should anyone else care about this website? Calling anything in that article a "historical fact" is pretty damned ballsy considering it has crap in it like "Meatwhistle has rocked the valley for over 10 years. They are extremely entertaining to watch as well as listen to. Plus, cock rings!" and "A forum post originally created as an accidental double post and has grown to a giant miscellaneous thread of epic proportions thanks to the efforts of forum member Spunkman." Oh, WOW! A post that has grown to epic proportions, you say. Those are pretty rare from what I can tell. Do tell us more! This website has no notability to anyone except those involved, so you had better make sure all of the forum members sign up for accounts and vote here as well. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 21:10, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>1. It's more than just a Phoenix-area thing. There are users from all over the world. (Hell, I'm from Minnesota.) 2. Obviously, it's important enough that articles <i>have</i> been written about the site, which makes it pass <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. 3. I do agree that it needs to be edited for POV, but that has no bearing on its notability. 4. Suggesting that forum users will flood this page is out of line until that actually happens. Yes, I post at The Shizz, but you can see that I've been a member of this community for a while now. I honestly have no idea who Nitramzero would be, but at the very least he/she makes good points. <a href="../../../w/y/a/User%7EWyatt_Riot_62dd.html" title="User:Wyatt Riot">Wyatt Riot</a> 23:38, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Two other anonymous users complained when I prodded it plus the guy here, so I don't think a few more showing up is out of the question. Congrats on finding all three articles that have been written about the site, sorry if I don't seem all that impressed. It is probably a pretty notable accomplishment for a small site like this one, though. Lets say that all of the site's users are so alternative they would never install an Alexa toolbar, then what accounts for the site only having <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?url=www.theshizz.org" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?url=www.theshizz.org" rel="nofollow">17 incoming links</a> to it? Or that the Wikipedia article has exactly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=The_Shizz" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=The_Shizz" rel="nofollow">3 internal incoming links</a>?

<li>I honestly don't know what the issue is. The Shizz "has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself" and so it is clearly notable per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Whether or not you are impressed with the site has nothing to do with it. I agree that the cites weren't included in an External Links section, but that has been fixed. <a href="../../../w/y/a/User%7EWyatt_Riot_62dd.html" title="User:Wyatt Riot">Wyatt Riot</a> 01:02, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"I agree that the cites weren't included in an External Links section, but that has been fixed." I have no idea what you are referring to there. There are other guidelines and policies that apply besides WP:WEB, like <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>; just because it scrapes by WEB doesn't necessarily mean it is notable enough for an article, which is why I'm guessing people are still voting and saying "non-notable." There isn't just one issue, there are many. Terrible Alexa rank, few incoming links to the site, few incoming links to the article, no demand for an article from other users not affiliated with the site and an amateurish article (which, yes, could be fixed, but probably won't be). <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 01:20, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>We're only responding to the reason that you requested deletion: "Non-notable internet forum. Fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and has an Alexa rank of almost 4,000,000." It passed "<i>any one</i>" of the guidelines in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, and hence is notable as far as that is concerned. By the "that has been fixed" comment, I meant that external links <i>were</i> included in the article, just not in the External Links section. That has been fixed, as I said, and I'll be cleaning up much of the non-encyclopedic content in the coming weeks. Assuming, that is, the entry isn't deleted. <a href="../../../w/y/a/User%7EWyatt_Riot_62dd.html" title="User:Wyatt Riot">Wyatt Riot</a> 02:12, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>RE:recury: If you would be so kind as to point out why it fails WP:NOT, that'd be nice. Now I know you've (as well as the other people agreeing with the delete) have taken it upon yourselves to patrol the site and make deletions of scrupulous articles, but I would simply appreciate a nice explanation beyond it fails this and that guideline “so tough nuts”. Now you must understand that I don't quite understand how it fails these guidelines, as after reading them myself, I cannot find an applicable case for the matter. Your argument on linking may be slightly more relevant, but I still fail to see how this warrants an entire delete over the many other more trivial and poorly written articles. Stick a "stub" tag, or a "needs a re-write" tag, but I still don't believe it needs to be outright deleted. --Nitramzero 03:03, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>No, we aren't <i>only</i> responding to the reason I gave in the nom; I'm free to bring up other reasons as the AFD goes on. I never said external links weren't in the article and couldn't care less if they are. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> has a good explanation of why I think it fails WP:NOT. There are worse articles, but they aren't up for deletion like this one is (yet), so lets just stick to talking about this one for now. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 04:37, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The problem that I see is that we <i>should</i> be responding to the reason you gave in the <i>nom</i>, but we <i>should</i>, for some reason, be required to accept more general <i>proof</i> as the argument goes on. I would just like a simple explanation as to why the article meets a certain criteria of importance for deletion. I do NOT feel that it is necessary to fall back upon a more general article (possibly relating to the possibility for deletion) every time a request of <i>evidence</i> or a 'proof' of lack of said <i>evidence</i> is preformed. The main issue is that a proper case for deletion has never been potentially presented, merely a proposition that feels it can infinitely generally modify itself to suit itself.--Nitramzero 06:43, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> <i>Operation Summer Rains</i> would be POV. IT would be less POV if we knew what Hamas called the operation, since that is what precipitated the current crisis.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Being "an invitation to spam" is not a reason to delete, since almost every article here about any commercial subject could be considered such an invitation.

<li><b>Comment</b> The cyLEDGE article has now been edited to take into account justified criticisms by several users. Please accept our apologies for what may have seemed excessive or unclear marketing jargon (the jargon which, for better or worse, we are most familar with...), and have done our best to follow the Wiki Style manual. Though cyLEDGE contains the company site as an external link, it is not so much a marketing campaign than it is an attempt to communicate what we are doing and get reactions from other people working or interested in the field.

<li><b>Keep</b> as per arguments from last AfD. It is a pity that the name of this town is the same as the initials of Gay Nigger Association of America, but that is quite irrelevent. The town exists and the page will expand. Geographical information on towns is notable. If a town this size was in Europe nobody would dream of deleting its article.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a little surprising that the GNAA think that use of the town's name by a troll club enhances, let alone constitutes the sole claim to, the notability of a town of 6500 souls.

<dd>Forgive some original research -- I just pulled out my new map of Nigeria. It lists about 1,500 towns in the index. Gnaa was not one of them. Also, there were no names starting with "Gn" -- perhaps that's not even a common Nigerian spelling?

<dd>Thanks for the NGA link; it looks like the NGA geographical names database doesn't just include cities but also "places".

They list 43,342 places in Nigeria, 31 of which fall within just 10 km (6 miles) of Gnaa's reported location. Are we going to get 43,342 place articles just for Nigeria?</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. According to the NGA database, Gnaa is a <i>populated place</i>, which the database explains is <i>a city, town, village, or other agglomeration of buildings where people live and work.</i> The undersea features in the database are of course not populated places. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpacepotato_5fc6.html" title="User:Spacepotato">Spacepotato</a> 07:42, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The population figure of 6,559 for Gnaa that this article used to have was taken from fallingrain, but this is probably bogus as fallingrain lists the same population figure for Kaor, Nigeria. Gnaa is either an error in the NGA database (which also contains the apparently nonexistent populated place Polfbroekstraat), or a place too small to show up on multimap. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpacepotato_5fc6.html" title="User:Spacepotato">Spacepotato</a> 08:04, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Here are some good reasons not to delete it: first, the Society has been written about many times in mainstream publications; second, it has been listed in various listings of international organizations since its founding in 1982; third, it is the oldest and best known of the "ultra high IQ" organizations.</p>
<p>Size alone is not a good indication of "encyclopedic" nature in this case, because the nature of the Society limits its size. A better criterion would be "utility." Currently the entry is referenced several hundred times per day. That qualifies it at as a useful entry.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not a member of the Mega Society though I spent two years trying to join it. There is shamefully little work being done in the area of high-range psychometrics (above 4 SD) and the founder of Mega is one of the few experts in the field. Now you might well think that the concept of g, general intelligence, is not valid, and that therefore not only high-end psychometrics but all psychometrics that attempt to measure IQ are not valid. But many reputable scientists would disagree with you. It is not in the category of, say, astrology. Since you (hopefully) wouldn't dream of deleting the article on IQ, why delete one of the few societies pioneering its use and measurement on the far right tail of the bell curve? Brian</li>

<dd>Well, provide with some citations about the worthwhile scientific research this society is conducting, and then the article ought to be able to stay.

<dd>The criteria for notability, and indeed the notion that notability is even relevant, have been hotly debated. I notice that some of the debate concerns inclusion of college fraternities.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Mega is not a large society, but the idea that there's only one active member refers to the so-called "Mega Society East," founded by Mega member Chris Langan (not Langdon). Langan insisted that his society was the real one but not even one other member of Mega went along with him and he lost a court decision and is now prohibited from using any form of the name "Mega Society." He also lost an ICANN arbitration regarding Mega Society domain names. Details can be found on this page: <a href="http://www.megasociety.org/about.html" class="external free" title="http://www.megasociety.org/about.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.megasociety.org/about.html</a> . The real Mega Society has many active members, as is obvious when one examines recent issues of *Noesis*. As for Langdon being a bigot, his jokes pages contain jokes about many different ethnicities, religions, etc. Categories include: Arab, Horrid Nursery Rhymes, Black, Interbreeding, Misc./Mixed Ethnicities, Buddhist, Irish, Polish, Celebrity, Jewish, Polish/Italian, Chain Letter, "Johnny," Polish Pope, Christian, Knock Knock, Redneck, Commercial Parodies, Lawyer, Scientology, Dead Baby, Lightbulb, Sex, Dyslexia, Mexican, and Space. It would be pretty exhausting to hate all of these groups. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.126.182.196 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.126.182.196_a941.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.126.182.196">contribs</a>) 22:27, July 15, 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The Mega Society has a number of members other than Kevin Langdon, as can easily be ascertained by looking over recent issues of *Noesis*. I *can't* tell you what test I took to get into the Mega Society because the founder of the predecessor 606 Society (6-in-a-million cutoff), Chris Harding, didn't explain the basis on which he invited members. Members of 606 were grandfathered into the Mega Society when it was founded. However, as the limit of what can be measured with reasonable precision is somewhere around the 606 qualifying level the difference in cutoff levels is academic. Mega does the best it can to select members at its nominal cutoff level. It may be that the actual cutoff is a few points lower; that's the price you pay for pushing the limits of psychometric science. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Langdon_c518.html" title="User:Kevin Langdon">Kevin Langdon</a> 08:19, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Commment</b> Does it strike you as strange that this person is looking down his or her nose at IQ 150 (the one in a thousand level)? This IQ elitism is characteristic of Mega Society member and sore loser Chris Langan. In fact, when several Mega members took the Mobius Test, by Edward Cyr, an extremely difficult test, I got the highest score and Ron Hoeflin was just one point behind me. The objection to my compilation of jokes is irrelevant and absurd. The study of jokes is as valid as the study of any other sociological phenomenon; I am not endorsing prejudice and the butt of many jokes which stigmatize whole demographic groups is not the group stigmatized but those who stigmatize them (as in certain jokes about Blacks which really target the intolerance of rednecks). --Kevin Langdon <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.82.9.59 (<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User_talk%7E66.82.9.59.html" title="User talk:66.82.9.59">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.82.9.59_f6cb.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.82.9.59">contribs</a>) 15:38, July 16, 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>This quotation is extracted from a longer section in which Hoeflin is arguing that biological evolution is an ongoing process. This is the same point that Nicholas Wade makes in his new book <i>Before the Dawn</i> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1-59420-079-3</a>). While I don't persionally agree with the argument, there are scholars who do. However, how did we get to discussing whether the Society is "scholarly" anyway? The original reason given for deleting the article was that the Society was not "notable." This ambiguous criterion was then defined as requiring that the Society has been discussed in the "mainstream" press. That criterion has been satisfied. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanon_c331.html" title="User:Canon">Canon</a> 00:19, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> This commentary confused the action of the California Board of Psychology against what it saw as "the unlicensed practice of psychology" with *Omni's* lawsuit. I don't know where the $30,000 figure came from, but *Omni* sued me for *a million dollars* after I received an overwhelming number of answer sheets in a very short time (the test was taken by over 27,000 people after appearing in the April 1979 issue of *Omni*), most of them within the first few months after publication. I had problems with my computer (they were even more buggy back then) and it took me many months to catch up with my backlog. When I did I supplied *Omni* with a list of testees and they verified that I had, in fact, gotten results to most of them (some had moved during the period of delay); the lawsuit was settled and I didn't have to pay a dime (I'm sure glad they didn't get my million dollars&#160;:-) ). The cost of scoring was $2.50. How would you like to have to open all those envelopes, input the data from each answer sheet, score all these tests, and mail out results and interpretive materials for $2.50 a pop? As for the California Board of Psychology's objection to my IQ testing activity, it's unconstitutional. The First Amendment's right of freedom of assembly guarantees very-high-IQ people the right to form societies and select members any damn way we want; we sure can't rely on the standard tests to select at our target level. The abusive language above indicates that HowlinWolf has some kind of axe to grind. It should also be noted that his accusation of fraud is libelous. --Kevin Langdon <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.126.182.196 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.126.182.196_a941.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.126.182.196">contribs</a>) 22:27, July 15, 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<dd>The answer to your question is #2, 3, 4, and 5. Saying that you are aware of an article in such-and-such magazine is not enough. Show us the article. However, even if you did tell us which articles in which issues of the magazines you listed mention the Mega Society, I still doubt that would be enough. Just because it's in a magazine, even if it's mainstream, doesn't make it notable. We are an encyclopedia, not a magazine, and our standards are just a tad bit higher. Mentions in magazines are a factor in determining notability, but only one factor. Which brings me to #5, which granted you didn't apply an actual number to. Another factor for determining notability is whether "a lot of people are very interested in it" -- although again, interest alone is not enough. But I'm curious as to why you say it "should be pretty obvious" by now that a lot of people are interested in it, because it's certainly not obvious to me. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 01:15, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

That is a broad enough sample of "mainstream" to establish "notability." As for Google News, many "notable" organizations will not have generated news articles in the recent past; a search for "mega society" in Google Groups returns over 350 hits and in Google proper over 9000.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. Homebrew high IQ society of no notability. If people with high IQs are so smart, how come they don't realise what a bogus, discredited concept IQ is? -- <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_Owen_3dfc.html" title="User:Gareth Owen">GWO</a></li>

<dl>
<dd>You seem to contradict yourself when you appeal to a common sense notion of "smartness" and yet in the same sentence deny the existence of intelligence. However, this probably is off the subject of whether the Mega Society entry should be deleted; maybe we should move the discussion to sci.psychology.theory or comp.ai or you can email me directly. The only relevant point seems to be your use of the term "homebrew" which implies "slipshod" which is simply not true; Hoeflin (and Towers, and others) have done an enormous amount of first rate work in assembling and norming these tests. The details can be found here (<a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~miyaguch/hoeflin.html" class="external free" title="http://www.eskimo.com/~miyaguch/hoeflin.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.eskimo.com/~miyaguch/hoeflin.html</a>). <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanon_c331.html" title="User:Canon">Canon</a> 13:44, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> In fact, the concept of IQ has not been discredited. It's part of mainstream psychology. See *The g Factor* by Arthur R. Jensen. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Langdon_c518.html" title="User:Kevin Langdon">Kevin Langdon</a> 08:19, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Uh, if this is part of a campaign by Byrgenwulf and Jeffire against Langan and the CTMU (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Cognitive-Theoretic_Model_of_the_Universe_7557.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Cognitive-Theoretic_Model_of_the_Universe</a>), they should know that Langan and the Mega Society had a major falling out years ago (resulting in a court battle over the rights to the name "Mega Society").</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, it is not appropriate to call for evidence of notability on the talk page of an article and then put that article up for deletion in less than an hour. The Mega Society has been written up numerous times in the media. It is probably the best known high IQ society, after Mensa. Anyone looking into IQ societies and high IQ tests will immediately encounter references to it. I personally have known about it for 8 or 9 years. (And for the record, I have no association with it whatsoever.) Because Jeffire and Byrgenwulf have acted so hastily, who could possibly have time to track down offline articles from numerous periodicals over more than two decades before the vote is completed? I'm certainly far too busy in my personal life to do so in a few days.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In my experience, thoughtful Wikipedians do their own searches for evidence of notability and discuss their results on the talk page of an article, and only then bring it up for deletion when there is clearly no evidence of notability. On Wikipedia, editors bringing an article up for deletion have a responsibility to give valid reasons why they think the material is not notable, not simply claim it appears to be not notable. They also have a responsibility to allow time for an appropriate discussion; with a less-trafficked article it would be easy to band together and rush into delete it before those in the know even have time to find out about the vote. This is not a race to delete; this process should be handled with care and deliberation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I strongly encourage Byrgenwulf and Jeffire to read <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>. In particular, you need to understand the important difference between <i>notable</i> and <i>famous</i>. Just because an organization is obscure, does not mean it is non-notable. In this particular case, the Mega Society is highly notable for anyone wanting to know more about high IQ subculture. That is the appropriate context in which to analyze the Mega Society's notability.</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b>This deletion debate horrifies me. When I read 1984, where anyone whom the ruling elite didnt like was made an "unperson" and all records of him erased, I thought, thank God that's fiction. When I read about the old Soviet Encyclopedia, and how anyone who fell out of favor had his article (as well as his life) deleted, and all users were sent a letter by the NKVD telling them to cut that article out of the volume, I thought, thank God I dont live there. But this is chillingly real.</p>
<p>There are two aspects to my horror.</p>
<p>1. I have devoted my life to halping the ultra-high IQ societies gain the credibility they deserve. I first heard of the Mega Society almost 20 years ago, thanks to a cover story in New York magazine. Some of its members became famous, just by being accepted. It is as respected among us as MIT or Harvard are in the world at large. To find that there are people out there who have never heard of it is as shocking to me as when I moved to the Midwest and found people who have never heard of Wordsworth or Rodin. It means that perhaps my life so far has been in vain.</p>
<p>2. I was at first skeptical of Wikipedia, and the whole notion of a grass-roots internet encyclopedia. I've edited a few entries over the years, but I hesitated to devote much effort to work which could be deleted by the first vandal who came across it. But as time passed I became a believer. The thing worked. But now, in the one area I know about, I have seen just HOW it works. Nameless, faceless, ill-informed accusers can at any time delete an area they object to. They pretend to be a democracy but must out of necessity be an oligarchy. And, since no group of a few hundred people can know everything, they must out of necessity be ill-informed about most of the subject matter they consider for deletions. It's a sad (yet almost humourous) blend of Kafka and Joseph Heller. It doesnt much matter now. Wikipedia is young, and one of many souirces of information. But what happens when it becomes the gold standard? What happens when it becomes the Mega Society of the information world?</p>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Thanks for allowing comments. There appears to be very little advantage to deleting information and some benefit to keeping it. Why restrict the knowledge or information, unless patently fradulent? Editing, of course, is desirable, as with all submissions, but deletion actually subtracts value from Wikipedia, and retaining it can only add to it. I know nothing of Langdon, but if he is a fraud, or a racist, or the second coming of the Messiah, publish that information and the controversy in the Mega article. In fact, if he is all those things, it actually adds weight to it's inclusion, in order to keep Wikipedia readers well informed. Should we eliminate comments on Enron, or the NSDAP? It is all information, and it's relative value is it's accuracy, not it's politics, legal compliance, recent impact, or obnoxious opinions. Thanks again for soliciting comments!

<li><b>Comment</b> in response to Tox, who states, "In this particular case, the Mega Society is highly notable for anyone wanting to know more about high IQ subculture. That is the appropriate context in which to analyze the Mega Society's notability." This is wholly untrue. In order for any topic to be notable enough for inclusion in an encyclopedia, which Wikipedia is, it needs to be notable <i>period</i>, not notable just for people wanting to know about high-IQ subculture. A group of 25 people with extremely high IQs does not make a notable club. A group of 25 people with extremely high IQs that <i>does something</i> might, depending on what that something is. Some of the people wishing for this article to be kept stated that the group does some scientific research, but never explained what that research was. Magazine articles used to establish notability must do exactly that--<i>establish notability</i>--not just prove existence. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 22:56, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There is no such thing as being notable <i>period</i>. Values are subjective, so "notable" is in the eyes of the beholder. These "eyes" change as one descends into the bowels of an encyclopedia written above the eighth grade level. For example, here is a sentence extracted from today's featured article: "The only important British honours over which the Prime Minister does not have control are the <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_Garter_59cd.html" title="Order of the Garter">Order of the Garter</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thistle.html" title="Thistle">Thistle</a>, and <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merit.html" title="Merit">Merit</a>, and the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Victorian_Order_8658.html" title="Royal Victorian Order">Royal Victorian Order</a>, which are all within the 'personal gift' of the Sovereign." This is a fact that is "notable" only to (some) citizens of the UK. But this sentence is entirely appropriate in the context of an article on the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom_dd87.html" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">Prime Minister of the United Kingdom</a>. What is "notable" depends upon the context in which the article is likely to be looked at. In the Mega Society article's case, this context is likely to be the context of high IQ societies. I take it as established that the existence of the Mega Society in that context is "notable".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The new requirement that the <i>activities</i> of the society be "notable", as opposed to the <i>existence</i> of the society, strikes me as pushing an already ambiguous standard further into dangerous territory. The assembly of the society required bootstrapping over a period of years starting with <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mensa_International_ed5b.html" title="Mensa International">Mensa International</a>. Science has been defined as the process of "torturing nature for her secrets" and the study of many phenomena is best done where these phenomena are extreme. This is why we build high energy particle colliders, for example. Hoeflin and Langdon are pioneers in the area of testing for high intelligence, an area that traditional psychometrics largely ignores because there is very little economic incentive to explore it. Sometimes we need to look over the horizon a bit and go beyond immediate economic value. Assuming that intelligence is an important thing to understand, they are trailblazers in a potentially fertile area. The society is notable because it is <i>possible</i> in the same way that climbing <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Everest_bc8a.html" title="Mount Everest">Mount Everest</a> is notable because it is <i>there</i>. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanon_c331.html" title="User:Canon">Canon</a> 00:06, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The criterion about <b>scope</b> in the context of the proposed criteria for organizations in the essay on notability is clearly intended to exclude purely local organizations like my Boy Scouts troop. The scope of the <b>activities</b> of the Mega Society is international in that it (1) has members in more than one country, and (2) publishes a newsletter that is distributed to more than one country. One of the Wikipedia articles that I've contributed to is <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_Cove_State_Park_ccdf.html" title="Crystal Cove State Park">Crystal Cove State Park</a> which is as far from international as it is possible to get. Nonetheless, no one is suggesting it be deleted. However, this is descending into mere wordplay. I've read the essay on notability and I think it is quite clear that the Mega Society is notable as defined in that essay. I am willing to let the Wikipedia editors judge that for themselves based on the record assembled in this article. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanon_c331.html" title="User:Canon">Canon</a> 01:03, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, you fail spectacularly to see my point. Again, it is not enough that the Adaptive IQ Test exists; what needs to be "third-party verified" is that the Adaptive IQ Test is a project of the Mega Society, and not a single individual independent of the Mega Society.</dd>
<dd>The Mega Society article itself must make a claim as to why it is notable (not its talk page). All these wonderful things that you feel make the Mega Society notable should be in the article, so that people who might nominate it for AfD can see that it's notable and make their decision based on the article, not material provided after the fact. -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthenglish_4623.html" title="User:Northenglish"><b>NORTH</b></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorthenglish_32f3.html" title="User talk:Northenglish">talk</a></sup> 03:16, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment.</b> NORTH's concept of notability clearly concerns importance. However, importance and notability are not synonymous. Both notability and importance are subjective, but their respective sepectrums do not line up. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> discusses this to some extent. There are plenty of things that are notable but unimportant. For instance, if I overheard a conversation about so-and-so who died and clearly perceived this was some famous person, but did not hear enough information to acertain what they did, I might come home and look that person up on Wikipedia. Not being a fan of most team sports, if I were to find out it was a basketball player, I would find that person unimportant, however, I would clearly understand why they were notable and listed in Wikipedia. And, one of the major reasons they would be notable is that you are likely to hear their name and (if you don't know who they are, you need somewhere to look them up). That is why the importance of the topic itself is different from the importance of having the topic in Wikipedia. Notability is much more closely related to the importance of having the topic in Wikipedia than the importance of that topic in the grand scheme of things.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The same applies to the Mega Society. If they do absolutely nothing and have no important impact on society that doesn't matter so long as you are likely to encounter their name and need a place to look them up. Since they have been in major periodicals multiple times over the last couple decades, that is a definite possibility. Furthermore — and this is where context especially plays a role — if you were to research high IQ subculture (and/or measurement of high IQs) you would immediately encounter the Mega Society, the Mega Test, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Langan_efd6.html" title="Christopher Langan">Christopher Langan</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_Vos_Savant_486a.html" title="Marilyn Vos Savant">Marilyn Vos Savant</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mensa.html" title="Mensa">Mensa</a>, Kevin Langdon, and <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Hoeflin_3419.html" title="Ronald Hoeflin">Ronald Hoeflin</a>. I know because years ago I got interested in the subject and upon looking around the Web I quickly encountered all of those topics. Since high IQ subculture, including high IQ societies, is a notable topic, and the Mega Society is a highly notable element of that subculture, it becomes important to understanding the subculture itself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>NORTH, you keep harping on the argument that Wikipedia being an encyclopedia negates the desire to have an obscure topic in it. There are reasons not to have an obscure topic in a 20th century encyclopedia, but not a 21st century one. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_paper_encyclopedia_Wikipedia_is_not_a_paper_encyclopedia." title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_paper_encyclopedia Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia.</a> The reasons to leave the Mega Society out of a 20th century encyclopedia are fairly obvious: the physical constraints of searching through, carrying around, and storing a paper encyclopedia. Since with Wikipedia we no longer have those constraints, we can and definitely should include topics that are less obviously notable on a grand scale, but are highly notable in notable contexts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The obscurity of a topic makes an article on it more useful, rather than less useful. The less likely you are to know about a topic, the more likely you are going to need an article on it. The relationship between obscurity, notoriety, and importance of a topic, and expected information return from an article gets quite complicated (and would probably be highly interesting research on the information content of Wikipedia and its resultant utility). The ideal topic for a Wikipedia article (as far as information return is concerned) would be a maximally obscure, maximally notable, and maximally important topic. That would entail a topic that you have a high probability of not knowing about, that you have a high probability of encountering, and that has a high level of intrinsic information (ie its effect on the world is great). Of course, in the real world these parameters are going to affect each other and this post is already too long for an AfD to look at the interrelationship.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Suffice it to say, Wikipedia becomes useless if you can't catch the tail end of an NPR piece, see a reference to some organization in someone's CV, or thoroughly research the various aspects of a specific topic (ie high IQ subculture or Canon's example of the British Prime Minister). I want a Wikipedia in which I can do so. What use is Wikipedia if I can only look up what I would find in a 20th century encyclopedia? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/o/x/User%7ETox_f05a.html" title="User:Tox">Tox</a> (<a href="../../../t/o/x/User_talk%7ETox_d43e.html" title="User talk:Tox">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tox_85eb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tox">contribs</a>) 05:45, 17 July 2006 GMT.</small></dd>

("Mega Society" = 9,100 google web hits.) The Wiki article receives a steady stream of hits. That passes the notability test in my eyes.

<dd>This group does not do what it says it does. Many of the first people who said keep claimed that the Mega Society does scientific research. Now by admission of Kevin Langdon himself, that is untrue; research is done by individuals and then reported to the Mega Society. As far as has been <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified</a>, the only thing the Mega Society actually does is publish an online newsletter that receives little traffic according to the Alexa rank, and is thus non-notable.</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia. Its capacity is unlimited and, thanks to search engines, little-used entries do not clutter things up. That's why, as far as I know, notability has NEVER been an accepted criterion for deleting an otherwise valid article. Notability is not always immediately apparent. This is especially true of an organization. One of its members might later become famous, and it would be of great interest to historians to trace the people and ideas who were formative influences on him. An article about an organization to which he belonged could be of immense value. It is far from improbable that Mega might one day have famous or influential member. Also I should note that the criteria for notability of organizations are badly defined, if at all. (It's an ongoing project.) Take a look at all the college fraternities that have their own articles. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_social_fraternities_and_sororities" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_social_fraternities_and_sororities" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_social_fraternities_and_sororities</a> Are they notable? What about tiny state roads in the hinterlands of Washington State? Each one has its own article.

<p>Keep. Criticisms of the officers/founders are not relevant to the issue of the validity (and historical or current "interestingness" ) of an entry. Mega Society is a well-recognized entity with a history and with meaning within the high-intelligence organization world (HiQdom), and deletion of it would not serve informational goals. Similarly, deletion would set a worrisome example, if done for political or personal reasons. Norming/admissions standards are evolving (for the most part) with all HiQ groups, and the fact that some people might be grandfathered into organizations where according to current practice they could not gain admittance is an issue germane to the groups themselves (and not really of external concern). I see no value in deleting the group from Wiki and many strong reasons for retaining it.--M Stewart<a href="../../../m/s/t/User%7EMstewarthm_a3e5.html" title="User:Mstewarthm">Mstewarthm</a> 18:50, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>[b] "seem like an advert" (Mr. Beowolff)</p>
<p>Then a Mr. DaturaS complained: "Wikipedia is not here to perpetuate a farce"</p>
<p>Mr. DaturaS further complained: "Strong Delete Totally bogus "society" with only one active member"</p>
<p>Then he added: "Langdon is a known fraud"</p>
<p>Also: "This is about no one other than Kevin Langdon"</p>
<p>Then this from a Mr. HowlinWolf: "No qualified members as far as I can tell."</p>
<p>Then Mr. NORTH jumped in: "Delete per nom and Byrgenwulf; it is a non-notable club" [This can't be because of the small membership, which was the initial "reason," so this must be a different "reason."]</p>
<p>Then came Mr. GWO: "Homebrew high IQ society of no notability."</p>
<p>And then there's a Mr. William Pietri: "I can't help suspecting there's some vanity involved here."</p>

What the naysayers have been arguing, is whether the society has been previously noted. That is irrelevant.

<p>1) Is it "notable"? "Notable" means "worthy of being noticed, important", but the context is undefined and the words used in the definition are themselves ambiguous, subject to diverse interpretations.</p>
<p>Who might be interested in examining (and "examination", by definition, requires "taking notice") information about the Mega Society? "Examining" the group, its members or its claims does not mean doing so unquestioningly; it merely entails finding the information interesting/useful as data or conceptually. Interested parties might include:</p>
<p>Those interested, advocationally or professionally, in "high end" intelligence testing; this includes parents of children whose minds remain unchallenged in typical gifted programs, and educators/psychologists who specialize in assessments of and research on the extremely gifted. Many widely used IQ tests have ceilings at or below around 150 IQ (aside: If Kevin Langden did score "only" a 150 IQ, he may have done so on one of these tests); for the most part, this is all that is pragmatically needed, but such instruments fail for a small sector of the population. With the internet making homeschooling and distance university studies more feasible, determining which students might benefit from an educational plan outside the school's usual offerings demands higher priority. If the student is an adolescent, one may need some testing geared towards adults....an area where the ability and motivation to measure at the far right end of the bell curve has been (for various practical reasons) minimal. Even if the tests used by Hoeflin, Langdon and others are flawed, the theoretical constructs underlying these tests may be of interest to researchers in high-end psychometrics; better high end testing could emerge from a synthesis of methods and philosophies.</p>
<p>Historically, there has been an interest in how the extremely gifted develop, function in the realms of work/intimacy/internal fulfillment, over the lifespan; there has also been an interest in whether other, ostensibly unrelated, mental and behavioral traits are more common in those of particular intelligence at various points in the lifespan. Hollingworth, for example, wrote extensively about the social difficulties and correlated later personality traits in a cohort of profoundly gifted persons followed from childhood through maturity. Lewis Terman conducted similar research, and Grady Towers has summarized the findings in several articles (google his name!). Several researchers have looked for correlations between Jungian personality type and IQ, and found that the percentage of introverts increases as one moves up the IQ scale. A Polish psychiatrist, Dubrowski, interests a number of adult "gifted persons", due to his research linking developmental potential to innate mental traits (called "overexcitabilities"). High IQ groups (even ones with few members) may be *worth examining* for those interested in personality/behavioral/philosophical traits associated with varying degrees of giftedness; those interested in such correlations psychologists - but also, a growing number of adults trying to "come to terms" with how their own giftedness may have affected their childhoods and contributed to deeply entrenched attitudes during adulthood. Reading autobiographical statements in high IQ society journals, and (moreso) "reading between the lines" of less personal articles, may give interested parties greater insight into the personalities of the extremely gifted.</p>
<p>Grady Towers' article "The Outsiders" is a great place to start - and he culled some of his info (which basically supported Leta Hollingworth's claims) from members of the ultra-high-IQ societies.</p>
<p>For such people, I believe that the Mega society is "worth noticing", important - and thus, notable. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESol.delune_b60c.html" title="User:Sol.delune">Sol.delune</a> 00:48, 18 July 2006 (UTC)sol.delune</p>

<p>In April of this year, Mega Society’s founder, Dr. Ronald Hoeflin, was interviewed for over five hours by CNN for a one-hour special on genius. This documentary will probably air (on nationwide cable television in the U.S.) in September. It is probable that some discussion of Mega Society will be included in the final edit when it airs. To verify, I suggest contacting CNN’s Susan Mittleman, who is a producer with CNN's medical unit and conducted the interview. Bryan Vare 04:40, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. NORTH (and possibly others) are equating notability only with what a person or organization does. This is an erroneous equation, though perhaps understandable since most people and organizations are notable because of what they do. However, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Wadlow_1478.html" title="Robert Wadlow">Robert Wadlow</a> is notable only because he was the tallest (confirmed) man to have ever lived. His notoriety led to his fame. Similary (and contrary to what NORTH said) <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_vos_Savant_bc35.html" title="Marilyn vos Savant">Marilyn vos Savant</a> was notable because of her intelligence. Her notoriety led to her fame which led to much of what she did (such as her PARADE colum).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The Mega Society is notable because of what it is, not what it does. Indeed, its many listings in the popular media are not direct evidence of its notability, but rather that it <i>has been noted</i>. The fact that something has been noted shows that there are people who believe it is worthy of note, which is the definition of notable. Whether you think the Mega Society is worthy of note is not the point. It is whether enough people think it is worthy of note. Popular media attention is one of the best indicators we have about large numbers of people considering any topic, including the Mega Society, worthy of note. If enough people consider a topic worthy of note, then a Wikipedia article becomes useful. —<a href="../../../t/o/x/User%7ETox_f05a.html" title="User:Tox">Tox</a> 09:31, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> The burden of proof is on those making the claims (i.e., of active qualified members; of valid admissions criteria; of notability, etc.). There is already an article on all high IQ societies in Wikipedia. It may be a good idea to merge them all. <a href="../../../d/a/t/User%7EDaturaS_15a2.html" title="User:DaturaS">DaturaS</a> 15:27, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The idea that "Kevin Langdon hates democracy" is absurd. I've been in the forefront of the battles with authoritarian society officers that have taken place in a number of high-IQ societies from time to time (see "A Short [and Bloody] History of the High-IQ Societies" &lt;<a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~miyaguch/hard_iq.html" class="external free" title="http://www.eskimo.com/~miyaguch/hard_iq.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.eskimo.com/~miyaguch/hard_iq.html</a>&gt; and my "Intellectual Freedom Manifesto" &lt;<a href="http://www.polymath-systems.com/intel/hiqsocs/manifest.html" class="external free" title="http://www.polymath-systems.com/intel/hiqsocs/manifest.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.polymath-systems.com/intel/hiqsocs/manifest.html</a>&gt;). --Kevin Langdon 66.82.9.77 15:28, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Stalker</b> For the benefit of the Wikipedia editors that are reading this, we need to explain that the Mega Society is sufficiently famous to have developed stalkers. One of these is a gentleman named Paul Maxim. The story of his efforts is (partially) documented here: <a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~miyaguch/history.html#mega" class="external free" title="http://www.eskimo.com/~miyaguch/history.html#mega" rel="nofollow">http://www.eskimo.com/~miyaguch/history.html#mega</a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Mr. Maxim has been a thorn in the side of the Mega Society and several other high-IQ societies but he's computer-phobic and has not participated in online activities.

<li><b>Burden of proof</b> The issue of who bears the burden of proof in an argument is even more opaque than the issue of when something is sufficiently notable to be included in an encyclopedia.

<p><b>Comment</b>I'm a member and have been since 2000, the MegaSociety serves as a viable source of information for the severely gifted, especially for raising children and adolescents who have been designated as such.

<li><b>Comment for Closing Admin</b> Several people have said that they pitied the closing administrator. Instead, I feel envy. This is a great opportunity for him or her to make a contribution to Wikipedia that far exceeds this individual case. My dad was a professor of administrative law and from the time I was a kid he drummed into me three things that make a fair decision under administrative law different from an arbitrary decision by administrative fiat. They are notice, hearing, and (perhaps most important) reasons.</li>
</ul>
<p>1. <b>Notice</b> As it now stands, the parties affected by a deletion are not told about it. They must learn about it by chance. Yes, these parties may well have a POV. But they are also uniquely qualified to provide relevant information. And uniquely injured by an incorrect deletion. 2.<b>Hearing</b> The deletion procedure does indeed provide a good hearing, provided people are aware of it. Thank you for that. 3.<b>Reasons</b> If the closing admin writes up a short statement of reasons for his or her decision, this will help guide future administrators in future cases. As I understand it, there is no clear policy on notability. It may be applied differently in different cases, and whether or not something is deleted will depend on who the admin is. If reasons are given in this case, they may be used to guide future cases. Not as binding precedent, but for guidance, and, over time Wikilaw will evolve. Thank you and good luck.

<dd>Hi, Brian. Thanks for commenting. I appreciate your concern, but this isn't a trial; it's a discussion where we try to come to agreement. With certain exceptions for <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">biographies of living people</a>, the effect we have on article subjects is not a criterion we consider while editing. Instead, we focus on serving our readers. It's also important to understand that Wikipedia works through consensus, which is very different than the adversarial model of the western legal system. Respect for precedent and law is also not part of the culture, as you can see from the encouragment to <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">ignore all rules</a> and our spirit of eventualism. I hope that helps.

<dd>This may have been possible in the early days but I dont think it is now. Norbert Weiner once wrote that the limit of a small self-governing community where everyone knows each other and can reach consensus is about 100. You cant know every editor and I'm sure not every editor knows about this decision. You might well be a self-organizing system, but if you make a mathematical model of it, you might find that model predicts articles being deleted and then undeleted in an infinite cycle.

<li><b>Disagree wholeheartedly</b>. The article has information not readily available elsewhere. It's definitely worthy of remaining in a separate article as recently created. Has anyone wondered when a store opened or when it was closed, how many stores closed in 1990 and opened in 2002? What's your hobby? Is your hobby worthy of being deleted because, even though it may be informational, only a minority of users share your hobby? Several other articles have similar information. Will we delete the locations from other department store pages such as Macy's, Lord &amp; Taylor, Saks, Nordstrom, Foley's, Marshall Field's, The Bon Marche, Nieman Marcus, etc.? What about the airline pages where list of destinations are included? How about airport pages that list which airlines and destinations they serve? Should a department store chain close, then where would this information be found for future generations if this article is deleted? There is so much more information from the article that can also be found on the company's website, should it be deleted too? If we do this for all articles, no article would be more than a few paragraphs.

<li>I normally wouldn't respond, but this list is the result of so much work that I want to be sure of things. To be frank, I never have wondered these things about any store. True enough that general information like that found in Wal-Mart_statistics is useful, but the same stats on every store? Inclusion of other information for other stores is not an indication that inclusion here is valid. Anyone can edit wikipedia. Jimbo does say WP is supposed to be 'the sum of all human knowledge' (bad paraphrase), but this is stretching it. Finally, and I don't mean any offense by asking this: how is this a hobby?

<p>I am personally familiar with <i>The Politicizer</i> -- it is a satirical paper very much like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Onion_8d8e.html" title="The Onion">The Onion</a>. The article appears to have some major unfounded exaggerations. - <a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkomae_bf4b.html" title="User:Skomae">S.

<p>I am also personally familiar with the politicizer. It is exaggerated but I think that that fits in with the basic principal of the politicizer.</p>
<p><b>Delete</b> - Hardly any relevant GHits <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22The+Politicizer%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;safe=off&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22The+Politicizer%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;safe=off&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">here</a>. One issue is not enough to establish notability. I see no grounds for keeping. Further, the use of the phrase 'Do not Delete' rather than 'Keep' used by regular editors makes me wonder about the quality of the 'votes'. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 00:19, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that the nomination and original votes were actually delete votes, based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Politicizer&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=62949357" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Politicizer&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=62949357" rel="nofollow">the history</a>. I've fixed them above. That being said, this is entirely non-notable and unverifiable. And... "Started in the fall of 2005, The Politicizer is a world-renowned, award winning humor publication that works with the publishing company Conde Nast to put out a biannual color magazine." Does that mean they've published all of two issues, maybe three?

<li><b>Keep</b>, at least for a while. I appreciate the work that Tyrenius has done, and I'm willing to let these run and see where they go. I'm still very concerned that these have crossed over into <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT an indiscrimiate collection of information</a> territory. I don't believe that a street is inherently notable just because something important once happened there or something on it is important, any more than a pair of socks is notable because somebody important did something while wearing them. To my mind the street has to be known for something like <a href="../../../s/a/v/Saville_Row_59d5.html" title="Saville Row">Saville Row</a> or synonymous with something like <a href="../../../t/h/r/Threadneedle_Street_e5c7.html" title="Threadneedle Street">Threadneedle Street</a> or <a href="../../../d/o/w/Downing_Street_d755.html" title="Downing Street">Downing Street</a>. But it seems like there's enough potential for these articles to qualify. And it's also possible that my horizions are too limited; this is not a paper encyclopedia, so perhaps it's plausible that we should have 5,410 <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Street_b8b6.html" title="High Street">High_Street</a> articles, each with snippets of history. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 15:22, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Sorry, I was unclear. The <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Street_b8b6.html" title="High Street">High Street</a> article mentions that there are 5,410 streets called "High Street" in Britain. It seems to me that from the standard a number of people are arguing, there's no reason we wouldn't end up with articles on all of them. Personally, I don't think that important things happening in a place make the place important unless the place becomes synonymous with the events, like Chicago's <a href="../../../h/a/y/Haymarket_Square_8145.html" title="Haymarket Square">Haymarket Square</a>. Ditto having shops or galleries, unless, like <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rodeo_Drive_ab72.html" title="Rodeo Drive">Rodeo Drive</a>, the street becomes widely known on its own. Whether these two streets qualify under the standards I'd use, I can't say, but I don't yet feel that the articles demonstrate the quality I'm looking for. As to the other articles, quite a number of them seem to be containers for trivia, and I don't believe that <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">inclusion of articles</a> is cause for keeping similar ones. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 23:05, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

They are in the heartland of London's West End off Piccadilly and both are the location for significant premises and historic events associated with the arts.

<li>I see no evidence of any personal attack. Jpbowen has been most polite, restrained and friendly, while making the points he wishes to. A street <i>is</i> what is located in it: otherwise it is just a length of tarmac. There is a contradictory logic arguing that Oxford Street is "synonymous with the institutions in the street" while Dover and Albemarle Street "regardless of what is located in them, are not notable in themselves but merely addresses". In fact, if anything, it is the other way round. I'm not aware of any institutions in Oxford Street: it is merely an address (for shops). What research? Well, the famous associations with Oscar Wilde, Lord Byron and Whistler for a start. West End streets are rather like your claim for railway stations - they are all notable. There are other intermediary stages for stubs which are often better than going directly to AfD, e.g. a {{notability}} tag, which then gives editors a chance to improve the entry. If it is subsequently not improved, then the AfD is that much stronger. If it is done, then there's no need for the AfD. I realise you've made some very good and successful noms for AfD so I don't want to knock you, but I would urge caution when there is room for doubt. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 20:10, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. We are going to disagree, sticking to London - Oxford Street, Harley Street, Saville Row are synonymous with the activities and institutions connected to them, Pudding Lane, Sidney Street, Cable Street are famous for events that happened in them, Whitehall and The Mall qualifies under both. Dover and Albemarle Street do not have either, they are being included because they are the address of something notable. IMO that is comparable to including someone because they are related to someone notable. <a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENuttah68_2daa.html" title="User:Nuttah68">Nuttah68</a> 07:59, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think that's sophistry, or at least splitting hairs. If the street is the address of something notable, then it happened in that street. Last point is more comparable to including a street because it is joined to another street. Anyhow, let's just see how the AfD goes with new revisions. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 08:11, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Using the same logic, and the relations analogy, then one might say that the Kennedy family is not notable because only a few of them were really important. Rather than having an article on every notable address in a street, it makes more sense to have an article on the street as a whole, especially if, like Dover Street, there is a distinct character to it. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperJumbo_33a0.html" title="User:SuperJumbo">Jumbo</a> 09:21, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Thank you for all the lively discussion. Personally I believe any significant historic street with interesting associated events and buildings, especially if there are already Wikipedia links for them from other articles, is worthy of inclusion. This means many streets in a city like London, especially in the central area. Certainly a {{notability}} tag would have been more appropriate here initially in my view in any case. But some general guidance would be welcome. <a href="../../../j/p/b/User%7EJpbowen_d87e.html" title="User:Jpbowen">Jonathan Bowen</a> 20:52, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is unfortunate that users making comments on this page have no knowledge of the subject matter, in this case astrology. David Cochrane is the developer of Kepler, the number-two general-purpose astrology software. He is certainly notable on that regard alone. His credentials include being the curriculum director of a top astrology school, former president of the largest international astrology organisation, and advisor to another significant astrological body. He is notable by these credentials alone. His main book, <i>Astrology for the 21st Century</i>, has been selected as one of top ten books in <i>The best Essays about Astrology</i> category by the largest astrology bookstore <a href="http://www.astroamerica.com/topten.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.astroamerica.com/topten.html" rel="nofollow">[68]</a>. His other book, <i>AstroLocality Magic</i>, gets an honourable mention in its own category. He is notable by his books alone. He is also a sought-after speaker at various astrological conferences. He is one of the truly progressive thinkers among astrologers today, who is actively shaping a new astrological worldview. Furthermore, he is referenced on the <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">Astrology</a> page. The only marks against the page are that it was created by the person himself (which may be attributed to inexperience), and that it has no sources. These can be certainly remedied without resorting to deletion. All in all, David Cochrane is definitely notable, and only those having no familiarity with this field of study wouldn't recognise that this is so. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 12:08, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think you are mistaken in your impression. David Cochrane is an astrologer. The people I have contacted have been active on the <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">Astrology</a> page and have shown knowledge of the subject matter. Do we not want knowledgeable users to contribute to this discussion? Or would you rather have uninformed people vote in a democratic manner? <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 10:25, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am energetically opposed to voting at all on Wikipedia, and I'm not specifically seeking uninformed people. Instead, I believe that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> should allow any serious, thoughtful editor to evaluate the quality of an article. The AfD process allows us to get a relatively unbiased sample of people together for evaluation and discussion. If solicitation of participation is to be done at all (which personally I doubt) one has to scrupulously avoid anything that might pack the discussion. Astrology is a contentious topic, and I think soliciting participation only from one side of the debate is bound to introduce bias here. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 14:46, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I can sympathise with your view in principle. To clarify where I am coming from, however let me use the timely example of the planetary status of Pluto and UB<sub>313</sub>. You have to choose between the following two scenarios: (1) a group of astronomers will make an informed decision after deliberation, or (2) a larger group of laypeople, representing a cross-section of humanity (which may or may not include astronomers), will vote on the matter. Which way would you go? <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 17:29, 19 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree with the notion that you should let the people who focus on a thing make the decisions. Here we write an encyclopedia, so the people who decide what's in and out should be the editors. I believe that's how AfD already works. Were we building an encyclopedia of astrology, then packing the discussion with astrologers would be appropriate. But since we're writing a general-audience encyclopedia, it isn't. Better to focus your efforts on providing <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> information that demonstrate that the subject meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 18:21, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b>. To elaborate on William Pietri. Aquirata, Wikipedia does not restrict the editing of articles to experts on the article topic. This is because WP is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Who_writes_Wikipedia" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Who_writes_Wikipedia" rel="nofollow">open for anyone to edit</a>. It doesn't matter if the article covers a topic in <a href="../../../d/r/a/Drama.html" title="Drama">Drama</a> or <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biochemistry.html" title="Biochemistry">Biochemistry</a>, the spirit of a wiki is to allow anyone to edit. Now, if someone editing the <a href="../../../b/o/t/Botany.html" title="Botany">Botany</a> article claims to be a botanist, the community would probably take that statement at face value. They might give that editor a certain deference and respect, if his or her edits were helpful, NPOV, and <i>supported by several third-party sources</i>. But the article remains open for anyone to edit. This is how Wikipedia works, and there is little evidence that an exception to this whole process, this entire ethos, should be made for one subject. -<a href="../../../f/s/o/User%7EFsotrain09_ca86.html" title="User:Fsotrain09">Fsotrain09</a> 18:31, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks Fsotrain09 and William Pietri. I see this as an entirely different topic, which would have merits for a more detailed discussion at another time. The objection was raised not to an attempt to exclude laypeople from this page (which is not the case) but to notifying editors knowledgeable about the subject matter. My point is that a better decision can be made with those people involved. The laypeople nevertheless can provide valuable input with respect to WP standards, guidelines and policies, but those alone will not get you the best result. <i>"If the rules prevent you from improving or maintaining Wikipedia's quality, ignore them"</i>, according to <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>. The objective is to <i>improve and maintain</i>, not simply to observe rules. <a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquirata_0045.html" title="User:Aquirata">Aquirata</a> 10:49, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think trying to increase the amount of information in the discussion is always a good thing, but I believe that you unintentionally did it in a way that could have biased the discussion. That can cause biased articles, unintentional NPOV violations, and partisan behavior when others react. None of that is good for Wikipedia's quality. If you really must pull more people into an AfD (which I'd recommend against), it's better to get a group that's informed and neutral or one that is informed and balanced than to pick only a group of people who share your POV on a topic, no matter how informed they are.

<li><b>Redirect</b> - Assuming these conflicts do not escalate further and involve more countries/organizations in them, there is no reason this page should be seperate from the Israel-Lebanon crisis page.

<li><b>Keep</b> per the argument given by Sinooher. Plus we don't know if the current "crisis" will be contained to just Lebanon. As per my earlier AFD comment on the 2006 Israel-Hamas Crisis article, I feel using the term "crisis" is potentially POV and inaccurate -- especially with some parties already calling it a war. Recommend changing the title of the article to 2006 Middle East Conflict or something like that until or unless it is actually given an official name a la Gulf War. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 16:56, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Agree with Szvest's sentiments; I wish none of these pages were here, but Sinooher's argument is very valid; an article to tie the two (possibly more) itemns together is worthwhile, especially during the development of this situation. Perhaps when all is calm again, it may prove not to be needed, but until that is determined, let's keep this as a place to keep it all cohesive.

The information in this article has not been verified and is not reliable.

<li><b>Keep</b> I find the timing of this Afd a bit suspicious, as an admin (DeathPhoenix) has been involved in the process to render a final version of the article that conforms to standards. Nevertheless, there are other usenet groups on Wikipedia. Many entries are subject to more vandalism than this one and your statement "insufficient context for those unfamiliar" makes absolutely NO logical sense whatsoever. Work to improve the entry has been marred by ONE user: Chadbryant, and this situation is currently being dealt with. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthCrusader_aae4.html" title="User:TruthCrusader">TruthCrusader</a> 17:40, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I have removed unverifiable information and have provided links to verify the number of posts.

<li>It's much better now. But in my opinion the article is still sourced only to <a href="http://www.rspw.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.rspw.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rspw.org/</a> and I don't think that meets the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> standards, which say "Posts to bulletin boards, Usenet, and wikis, or messages left on blogs, should not be used as primary or secondary sources." Now, one might say that the newsgroup itself is its own source, but I don't see how you can use it as for general, overall statements about the newsgroup itself without performing <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:33, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> <i>"highly suspicious"</i>... No I am not affiliated with anyone involved in your apparent dispute, if that's what you mean by <i>"highly suspicious"</i>. However what I am aware of is that the article lacks sufficient content to meet Wikipedia's <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_style_guidelines_945d.html" title="Category:Wikipedia style guidelines">quality standards</a>. Not only was the information there unreliable, but no sources were even cited. The article has also been subject to numerous edit wars even after an apparent consensus was made. The continuous disputes with yourself and whatever other parties involved are for you to handle so it is irrelevant to the AFD. But just because the article is being nominated for deletion does not mean it can't be improved. Like I said in the edit summary, feel free to edit it.

<li><b>Keep</b>. None of the conditions mentioned in the nomination are valid reasons for deletion.

<li>True but irrelevant. A lack of sources is a reason for cleanup, not deletion. (Now, if sources simply don't exist, that would indeed be a reason to remove the unverifiable information, and, if that leaves the article with no content, <i>then</i> that's a reason for deletion.) <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 00:02, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>And it is a reason which appears to me to apply to this article, as <a href="http://www.rspw.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.rspw.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rspw.org/</a> is the only source, and I don't think it meets the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> guidelines. It seems to me that if this newsgroup is really important, there ought to be a book or a wrestling magazine article that says so, and if someone quotes that in the article with a proper citation I'm quite prepared to change my recommendation. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:28, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Inconsistency, which is to be expected. If you want perfect consistency and policy administered with the even-handedness of Solomon, you want a command-and-control encyclopedia. There is a good deal of content in Wikipedia which does not accord with Wikipedia's policies. As I write this, there is an article in Wikipedia entitled Andrew Greiner whose entire content is "Andrew Greiner is an amazing person." That is not an argument for keeping another article with similar content. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 23:45, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>If so then why has the entry for rspw been around for over a year, and had many comments posted by various editors, none of whom saw fit to nominate it for an Afd.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I see absolutely no reason for deletion. While professional wrestling as a mainstream medium in the entertainment industry (and, to a point, the world of sports) has wained in the last several years, becoming not as popular as it once was in the late 1990s/early 2000s, that does not mean that it no longer holds a legitimate place in popular culture OR on the Internet. Now, as per regards to that, rec.sport.pro-wrestling is one of several HUNDRED THOUSAND discussion groups on <a href="../../../u/s/e/Usenet.html" title="Usenet">Usenet</a>. Therefore, it stands to reason that even the most seasoned veteran, from the guys who put the first computer together in the 1960s to Bill Gates and his Microsoft cronies in the 21st century, would not necessarily know what the newsgroup is, or even what Usenet is if questioned about the subject. HOWEVER, that does not mean that an entry on Wikipedia for it must be deleted. To argue that this entry should be removed based on the fact that one person has had a personal agenda to see his information placed onto the article is ridiculous. The entry -- while copiously changed thanks to trolls such as Mr. Chadbryant -- still gives a valid, informative definition on what RSPW is as a whole. No one person should be allowed to sway the balance of a Wikipedia article, and it seems to me that Chadbryant is simply laying on an immature level of "You guys won't play the way I want to, so I'm taking my ball and going home." It's just that since this is Wikipedia, he has to have the approval of the group before he grabs the ball. Keep the article, but semi-protect it and make sure that Chadbryant is aware that he is not the only person on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDooby_Scoo_5416.html" title="User:Dooby Scoo">Dooby Scoo</a> 18:05, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. A lack of content or verifable sources has never stopped a Wikipedia entry before. If you write a letter, then before you mail it decide to add additional content, does that mean that the person you were sending the letter to should decide to ignore the whole thing if they were to find out what you did? This entire arguement has no substance. It appears to be more of a personal agenda by one or two persons rather than an actual question of the article; as a result, to delete it would not only be unjust and unfair to those who have attempted to keep it as legitimate as possible while removing material placed there by trolls, but at the same time it would say a lot in a negative sense for Wikipedia in general. Maybe I'm wrong, but I thought that this Web site advertised itself as a "free encyclopedia." I think I've even heard it called the one that "anyone can edit." With that in mind, sure you are going to have articles that lack content, or sources, or seem a bit awry. But that's going to happen to a lot of articles -- not just rec.sport.pro-wrestling. Looking at the history of the edit of the article, I can see where attempts have been made to keep the article in check with Wikipedia policy, as well as update it whenever possible. Given that this is a newsgroup on Usenet, however, and not say breaking news or anything current, that may have proven to be difficult in the past or it may even become difficult in the future. But if, for example, (and I know this is a bit of a stretch), the article on <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nixon_9d26.html" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> was not added to or placed with additional sources due to the fact that his Presidency has been over for quite some time and he's passed on for more than decade now, should that mean that someone should come along and request his entry on Wikipedia be deleted? Or should the entry be polished up with whatever facts may have been overlooked, or possibly the article could be written in a better format by those authors and writers who have had no only experience writing on Wikipedia, but offline as well? I guess what I'm trying to say in this long-winded statement is that the article, while flimsy and questionable due to a certain individual attempting to modify it in a way that seems to have been regarded as incorrect or trolling, that does NOT mean that it should come along and be removed. It should instead be kept to the highest standards that an article such as that can be kept (and let's face it, since it's RSPW that's not exactly the best, but whatever works) and it should also be scrutinized and watched carefully for when such trolls as the one or two individuals involve come along and attempt to change the article for their liking, either in a malicious attempt or other such immature behavior. --<a href="../../../w/r/i/User%7EWriters_Block_4394.html" title="User:Writers Block">Writers Block</a> 02:30, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The reasoning that "other articles lack sources so its ok" is fallacious in the extreme. That's analogous to claiming that because one person may have gotten away with murder, murder is ok. If an article lacks verifiable sources, they need to be added. If they do not exist, the article needs to be deleted as unverifiable.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Just because Stevie Richards wore an RSPW t-shirt doesn't mean it warrants an article on Wikipedia. In the discussion for Bleeding Was Only Half the Job, your argument (This is to TruthCrusader) was that even though Ron Jeremy has endorsed a project it doesn't mean that it is notable enough to be on Wikipedia.

<dd>Whether it was written by myself is not relevent as there is no Wikipedia policy saying an entry can't be written by the person who it is about.

<li>Am I right in understanding the tone of the article to imply that these are eruptions that are possibly unrelated to Krakatoa? In other words, a large eruption at Mt.

Either way, the term doesn't seem to be used as its own entity--Ghits produce 15 unique links, none of which imply anything other than Krakatoa's own historical eruptions.

<li><b>Keep</b> do not redirect to Krakatoa, perhaps redirect to a <i>types of eruption</i> article. A "Krakatoan eruption" is a class of eruptive event. I've seen it in some Volcanology books. It's also classed as "Super-Vesuvian". Essentially, there's a bunch of names for the different levels of eruptions, and "Krakatoan" is one of them. IIRC "Hawaiian eruption" is the least explosive. 132.205.44.134 22:36, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> the school. Merge discussions can go on the talk page, without this AFD. But since there's a request for comments, I'll make some. Given the lack of content, I would accept a merge <i>after</i> a proper target is established. This will mean completely redoing the district article. I consider <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cupertino_Union_School_District&amp;action=edit" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cupertino_Union_School_District&amp;action=edit" rel="nofollow">this code</a> to be unuseable for an average editor. A typical person wishing to update info for one school, wouldn't be able to make sense of it, but could manage to edit a single school article. Unfortunately, a high percentage of district articles are in the same bad shape. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 21:32, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Tables are the best form for organizing information of this kind, where the entries are identical except for variables on a few statistics and simple facts. We don't need prose restating "The mascot is X. The student population is Y." in a dozen different articles when a single column in one can record all of that, <i>and</i> make comparisons at a glance within the district. Whether the "average editor" knows how to use table coding is really irrelevant to what the best end form is to organize information, but I have to say that the use of tables and templates in articles that I wanted to edit is what motivated me to learn how to use them in the first place. On the other hand, if there is encyclopedic information beyond just statistics for each school, its entry within a district article could also be split into a subheaded article sections, which is very easy to do. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 21:49, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>This page should be changed to a disambiguation page, because there are already wiki articles on legal and moral rights. The writing on this page is also biased towards the belief in moral rights. Sodregat 19:27, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> This page has been around for a long time, longer than the other articles split off; it should never be deleted - other solutions should be addressed before resorting to deletion, like moving the GFDL to make room for a disambig, or addressing any bias issues on the talk page. Deletion is too extreme a measure to take with <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right.html" title="Right">Right</a>; that should only be as a last resort, after all other info has been carefully merged. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 19:37, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Convert to disambiguation page.</b> It would probably be most useful this way for people that search for "right" on Wikipedia. Perhaps the Wiktionary definition of the word could be the first entry in the disambig list. It seems that most topics touched upon in this article are their own pages, so little content would be lost. The external links at the bottom could be moved to more appropriate pages - such as "Human Rights Watch" to <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights.html" title="Human rights">human rights</a>. <a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabricationary_b588.html" title="User:Fabricationary">Fabricationary</a> 19:40, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Close discussion</b>, the fact that so many italicized "see XXX" blurbs are needed at the top is an indication that a disambig page is perhaps not unwarranted. However, such changes should be discussed on article talk pages, and I can't see how this article would be deleted even if a disambig page were moved to this title. -- <b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">H·G</a></b> (<sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumbleGod_dc3d.html" title="User talk:HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">words</font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HumbleGod_9674.html" title="Special:Contributions/HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">works</font></a></sub>) 19:43, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Alexa rankings and number of google hits don't really give the story about matchinight. Soccer is a growing sport, so it doesn't have huge numbers behind it, either in attendance or on the internet. But it is demonstrably growing. If you look at American soccer in and of itself, Matchnight is an important internet source of news and commentary, with growing numbers. The fact that its coverage out-performs commerical news outlets is in itself significant.

If there's any significance to the fact that these games had a slightly different format than other PS2 games, it's not established in the "article."

<li><b>Keep</b>. A category would not work best because there will be several non-notable games on this list that will never be covered by Wikipedia. The information on media could potentially be useful, say, to someone studying specific physical media adoption rates over time, or a comparison of file usage for indie and major developers.

<li><b>Keep</b> Anyone ABOVE who supports deletion please re-check the list and read the new introduction/description written at the top of the list. As it now stands, there is no way to merge this information into categories without losing a vast amount of information. We would need to create a massive number of game stubs and also somehow rectify the problem of games being released in 3 regions (4 counting the rare China PS2 games I can find nothing about) in occassionally different media. It would be nice if someday this could be made into a category, but with the sorry state of completeness, uniformity, and duplication among PS2 games and games in general, I think this list is extremely useful. Also, a very small number of game page infoboxes DO include BOTH game region &amp; game media information. At least until most games are given this same depth of info, I think this list should survive.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> Useful list, quite exhaustive, and as others said, many games are barely worth giving articles so a list will be more useful than a category.

<li><b>Keep</b> If I had seen the article without the preface - I would have questioned its usefullness/notability as well - but understanding the function it could serve as well as seeing the outlining for keeping the list discriminate (I think a big factor here) I am swayed to vote for keeping the article. The suggestion the list would go on forever is laughable - already PS2 media as a whole should be on the decline soon - and as CD based is but a small percentage of that in the first place I see no reason why this list couldnt be completely comprehensive with a little time and contributions from people. <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeusfaux_0fe6.html" title="User:Deusfaux">Deusfaux</a> 08:30, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hi again, y'all. I've tried to be a really good sport about this article and not mention the f#$cr^&amp;t word or any bias for or against Star Trek. I can't help but think that Trek gets extra-special treatment around here, and that squicks my fundamental ideas of fair play and the rule of law. I personally don't vote to keep articles I happen to like or articles on subjects I like if they grossly violate policy or what a Wikipedia article should be. I even transferred the article and its accompanying talk page to Memory Alpha, which is a Wikia (Wikimedia) project, and I didn't even have to do that. NO KNOWLEDGE WILL BE LOST. I'm starting to think that if this is a no consensus keep, it will need to go straight through AfD after a grace period of one month, and if it is a consensus keep, and I hope it's not, it will have to go to deletion review based on the flimsy evidence given in the keep votes. Honestly, I try to be a nice, reasonable guy, but this kind of thing really makes me wonder. The known laws of physics are do not apply in the TV shows and movies associated with Star Trek. That's not a revelation of any kind. Please, folks, do the right thing. Erik the Rude 11:37, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>the flimsy evidence given in the keep votes</i> — The "flimsy evidence" is not flimsy at all. And it is <i>the article itself</i> that cites sources. <i>Please, folks, do the right thing.</i> — Keeping an article on something that has been the subject of multiple independent published works <i>is</i> the right thing. Wikipedia encompasses human knowledge, and that includes human knowledge about fiction. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:52, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Erik, I find your comment somewhat condescending. Why don't you argue policy and guidelines instead of telling us what you will do if this AfD doesn't go your way? The relevant <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_guidelines_for_administrators_a507.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators">guideline for closing admins</a> says <b>When in doubt, don't delete</b> so I don't think the burden is on the keepers in this discussion. Imho, there's been no convincing argument to delete based on policy. The fancruft essay says that the problems are usually verifiable sources, NPOV, and avoiding OR. None of these seem to be a problem here (though I acknowledge there's not much beyond the one book). I don't think this article is any more marginal than an article on a certain cross-dressing street performer (<a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html#Baton_Bob" title="User talk:Kchase02">remember?</a>).--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 19:19, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Not quite sure what to make of this one. Article claims it's a notable music venue. Is it? Fall Out Boy played there, but then Fall Out Boy's played at a lot places. The article claims that the hall is second only to the Fireside Bowl, but then the Fireside Bowl itself doesn't have an article. I guess the question is, does the sum total of all the bands that've played there amount to notability? I say no. At the end of the day, it's K of C hall in some suburb in Illinois. I could be wrong, though. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 23:10, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, This particular hall has served and continues to serve the Chicago suburban music scene and was influencial in bringing Chicago punk rock into popular music. In addition to Fall Out Boy, early incarnations of Rise Against( Dreamwords Records) also got its beginnings at this venue. This article is obviously in it's early stages and will need a lot more references (which do exist) but it is of notable significance to the Chicago punk rock scene.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebno_4729.html" title="User:Thebno">Thebno</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThebno_327a.html" title="User talk:Thebno">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Thebno_92c2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Thebno">contribs</a>) .</small>

<li>PETE WENTZ: "We had a lot of the bands. I mean, the bands that we grew up with are starting to go places now. We have Spitalfield and then our little brothers, who are like from the same scene, The Academy Is. It was kind of a scene that was built around us and we kind of did it in Knights of Columbus Hall. We did it by ourselves where people wouldn't book us in the city, and it's really about the people and the younger kids. It's a place where we can still go back. I went and saw The Academy Is at the Knights of Columbus Hall and kids don't harass you and bother you and you don't feel like you are like this star or whatever. It was really cool because it just feels like home and people ask how you've been and congratulate you and stuff, but at the same time, it doesn't feel awkward. I love it, it's the best place I have ever been I guess."</li>

<p>Here is a direct quote from an <b>MTV</b> Article "It's pretty insane that a band that used to play Knights of Columbus [halls] in Arlington Heights, Illinois, is now up for a Grammy," said Pete Wentz of first-time nominees Fall Out Boy <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1517699/12082005/carey_mariah.jhtml" class="external free" title="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1517699/12082005/carey_mariah.jhtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1517699/12082005/carey_mariah.jhtml</a></p>

<p>There is a whole history behind how the Knights of Columbus became an environment where Illinois garage bands developed into mainstream punk bands, which didn't just happen over night. That is why I felt the need to create this page because it has never been properly documented before, and what better place than wikipedia. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebno_4729.html" title="User:Thebno">User:Thebno</a></p>

If he wants to be a dick, that's his prerogative. Regardless, allegations have historical value, especially allegations which are widely supported by one side of a major conflict.

<li>This was my first foray into Wikipedia and placed the article out of ignorance. I see now that it does in fact violate policy and would agree that it should be deleted. However, as a first time user, I doubt I'll be back as the posts here are fairly mean-spirited and not welcoming to newcomers. Wikipedia users must view themselves as an elite insiders club. signed by annpiacini and yes I haven't figured out how to include my signature, but doesn't matter really, does it?</li>

<li>That would have been more feasible if Cranbury School served grades K through 12. But, it's K-8, and restoring the category to the Cranbury page would be misleading - The District Factor Group category applies to school systems, not the actual municipality. The Cranbury School is New Jersey District Factor Group J - Princeton Regional Schools (which serves high school students in Cranbury) is New Jersey District Factor Group I. Therefore two factor group categories apply to Cranbury's student body. As for listing both, the problem is that Cranbury doesn't have its own high school - it sends its kids to someone else's school district, which is listed anyway as Factor Group I. A school district is as much of a local government as a city, borough, etc. itself - Local government articles are notable. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhisperToMe_201b.html" title="User:WhisperToMe">WhisperToMe</a> 17:58, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The <a href="../../../c/r/a/Cranbury_School_7f05.html" title="Cranbury School">Cranbury School</a> article is a carefully researched, thoroughly documented article that provides all sources regarding its backgound and claim to notability. Of the 105,000+ K-12 public and private schools in the U.S. (see the <a href="http://www.asd.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.asd.com/" rel="nofollow">American School Directory</a> for further details), under 3/10 of 1% of schools (based on your unsourced numbers) felt that they were willing to go through the rigorous selection proces to be recognized by the <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Ribbon_Schools_Program_4a5b.html" title="Blue Ribbon Schools Program">Blue Ribbon Schools Program</a>. The article on the program describes in depth the rigor of the selection process. You provide no source for your claim (or for your statistics) other than your personal feeling that the award is "rather easy to obtain." Again, the article makes an explicit assertion of notability, contrary to your claim. You need to provide a better justification for deletion, and providing objective criteria that the article fails to meet would be a start. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 17:07, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My bad for forgetting to quote the source, it was from <a href="http://www.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/2005/2005-statistics.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/2005/2005-statistics.pdf" rel="nofollow">this pdf</a> from ed.gov and the figure is for the award in 2005 only (the program has been running for 24 years by now?). Also, if most schools feel this is a rigid process (and unwilling to apply/nominate) then it means that the award is not even recognized from within the education sector? Btw, my feelings that it is "rather easy to obtain" is from the high number of successful selected schools (82%) of whose schools who are willing to go through this "rigid process". --<a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWinhunter_d2c4.html" title="User:Winhunter">WinHunter</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../w/i/n/User_talk%7EWinhunter_2903.html" title="User talk:Winhunter">talk</a>)</sup> 18:14, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Keep</b>. I am no longer so certain this article should be deleted. I don't know if it's possible for me to change my vote seeing as I originally nominated the article for deletion, but if it is, I am voting keep and hope it is kept. WhisperToMe and Alansohn have more than addressed any concerns about verifiability and turned the article into something which could really grow. I feel guilt and regret for having nominated this page for deletion-- partly out of genuine belief that the school was not notable enough for a Wikipedia article (a concern that I don't feel is totally addressed still)-- but mostly for petty and unwholesome reasons. I may disagree with WhisperToMe on other unrelated issues but his model behaviour on this article-- not just sitting around arguing, but actually showing not telling by improving the article-- has shamed and inspired me. I'm sorry I nominated this article for deletion.
