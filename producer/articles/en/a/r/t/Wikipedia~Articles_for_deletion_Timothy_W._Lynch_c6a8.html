<p>Person is utterly nonnotable. Has a job, for which he apparently has done nothing noteworthy. Wrote some amateur reviews for a TV show. After the notability tag was on article for a while and a discussion about it was attempted on the talk page, still nothing. Someone who wrote most of this article created the vanity article Kurt Beyer Films, which was a recreation of the Kurt beyer films article that was deleted as vanity a while back, I believe the newer one was speedied. This just looks like vanity, and the major contributor says he's a friend of the guy... Perhaps if it's up for deletion somebody can try to come up with real justification for keeping it instead of removing the notability tag as "vandalism". If not, then it should be deleted. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 13:39, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> So how is an "online Sci Fi critic" notable for an encyclopedia? You need to find an actual <i>reason</i> the person is notable, per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> standards. Until you can do that there's no reason to keep this. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 15:18, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> I made a reversion, per indicated. I agree that he does not meet the tests of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, unless you stretch some of them. However, I stand by my decision as Mr. Lynch has been extremely influential in the Star Trek universe, through both fans and producers/writers that have read his work. Unfortunately, I concede that there are relatively few concrete references currently to support this point. I'm still leaning toward a soft keep, despite the guideline. <a href="../../../j/r/p/User%7EJrp_d96f.html" title="User:Jrp">JRP</a> 15:38, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> in agreement with JRP's comments. Wrong to dismiss this article as vandalism and vanity since it was not written by or for the subject. Also, it is unfair to judge this article based on what happened with other articles (How does Kurt Beyer Films even play into this??) Editor who nominated for deletion appears to be biased based on his comportment on the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Talk%7ETimothy_W._Lynch_805f.html" title="Talk:Timothy W. Lynch">discussion</a> page, and on this page by not taking into account the new arguments presented on the discussion page and solely judging the article on a single case of vandalism (<i>Perhaps if it's up for deletion somebody can try to come up with real justification for keeping it instead of removing the notability tag as "vandalism". If not, then it should be deleted.</i>) <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlypanam_f023.html" title="User:Flypanam">Flypanam</a> 02:05, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Kurt Beyer Films plays into it because that was a vanity piece created in bad faith to put an article back in after it was already deleted as nonnotable vanity, and the person contributed to this article and seemed to be doing the same thing here. <i>"Not taking into account new arguments presented on the discussion page"</i> is false, I read your comments and found them wholly lacking. <i>"solely judging the article on a single case of vandalism"</i> is also extremely inaccurate, as that's not the sole thing I was judging on, which is readily apparent from my comments. Please try to keep discussion on the article itself instead of personally attacking me in an attempt to try to sway votes. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 14:13, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I did not personally attack you; in your original nomination for deletion you did indeed claim that there were no real arguments for keeping it made, and inferred that one act of vandalism on this article means that the whole article is vandalism. There were quite a few arguments made; even if you believe they were wholly lacking, others might not. We are all civil people here, and by no means did I mean to offend you in any way or accuse you of anything. However, in your accusations of "new" users who have been registered for nearly a month, with no connection to this page, and created before this page was even brought into question, and arguing with other editor's decisions, as well as in instances on the discussion page, it appears as though you are taking personal offense to the existence of this article, for one reason or another. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlypanam_f023.html" title="User:Flypanam">Flypanam</a> 22:48, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

The article still has some <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> issues which a good cleanup could address, and several good edits have been made toward this end in the past.

<li><b>Comment / Article Update</b> - Article has been updated with three points (in order of importance) which I believe may satisfy <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. First, that Mr. Lynch was a regular reviewer/colunmist for <i><a href="../../../t/v/_/TV_Zone_ff84.html" title="TV Zone">TV Zone</a></i> magazine, for several years in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Second, that he was a writer for the trivia video game <i>Star Trek: The Video Game</i>. (It's a Star Trek-themed <i>You Don't Know Jack</i>-style game.) And finally, that he wrote the forward to the nonfiction book <i>Net Trek</i>. The third is of debatable merit, but the combination of the first two seems to satisfy the guideline. <a href="../../../j/r/p/User%7EJrp_d96f.html" title="User:Jrp">JRP</a> 14:19, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Something in here <i>might</i> be notable, but we need details, and it needs to be verified. I'm not happy that his claims to have written for the magazine and book have been put into the article solely on the claims of the individual himself, largely because we've had problems in the past with people lying about sources during deletion votes and getting people to vote keep, only to find out the information was wrong later. I am not accusing him of this, but simply saying this has been a real problem here in the past. More importantly, these things still aren't quite the notability level necessary in my mind... Forward of a book is pretty short, and isn't really an author... he's listed as an "additional writer" of trivia along with a list of other people, and we don't normally have articles for trivia writers... a reviewer for a magazine typically also isn't at the same level as an article author. The TV Zone thing <i>may</i> be notable if he was a <i>featured</i> reviewer... i.e. someone whose name ran at the top of a review column on a regular basis, not anonymously and not as one of a rotating staff of reviewers. It depends upon how high profile it was. Even there, it's still not really quite up to the necessary level in my mind, though.</dd>
<dd>Anyone voting based upon the TV Zone claims would probably be best served waiting for the evidence of the exact nature of the reviews in TV Zone to be gathered and verified... of course that is really can only be a suggestion, and people showing up to vote can vote based upon what they see now.<a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 14:59, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> With respect to your comment about the forward (which, I admit, I haven't confirmed yet-- Amazon wants $103 for a copy used!), I disagree with you completely. Being asked to write a forward to a book is an indication of notability, not the reverse. Although it is, as you put it, "short", the point isn't the writing of it but rather that the publisher and the author felt that this person was notable enough that having him contribute some small part to the book would be an advantage. (Increase sales, credibility, etc.) So, I stand by (once verified) that being an important indicator of <i>notability</i>, per our standards. <a href="../../../j/r/p/User%7EJrp_d96f.html" title="User:Jrp">JRP</a> 01:33, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Actually, if you look at those results in Google, it's only 135 and then many duplicates of those 135, probably from old Usenet posts being mirrored across the web.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> First of all, I think it is worth noting that <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> has clearly got an agenda with regards to eliminating vanity pages, that is to say, anything which he doesn't deem notable. Anyone who has heard of Lynch's work will vouch for his notability within the community he writes for. Also, as <a href="../../../j/r/p/User%7EJrp_d96f.html" title="User:Jrp">JRP</a> pointed out via his citations, Lynch's work with TV Zone further expands his audience and justifies this article's existance. Sure he may not be notable to everyone, but those he has written for hold him in high regard and respect what he has done. I firmly believe that deleting this article would be a blow to media reviewers everywhere and would undermine the credibility of Wikipedia by virtue of restricting information to those who desire it. --<a href="../../../y/o/y/User%7EYoyaDiata_04ca.html" title="User:YoyaDiata">YoyaDiata</a> 21:43, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
