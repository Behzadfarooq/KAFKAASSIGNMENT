<li><b>Comment</b> I have just made a bold and <b>ruthless edit.</b> The previous version of the article, which is the subject of the discussion above the line, is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_people_believed_to_have_been_affected_by_bipolar_disorder&amp;oldid=10495430" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_people_believed_to_have_been_affected_by_bipolar_disorder&amp;oldid=10495430" rel="nofollow">this revision</a>. I have moved the unsourced entries to the Talk page. Since currently all of the entries are unsourced, that means all the entries. I have changed the lead sentence which formerly read "Here is a highly speculative and inaccurate list" to read "This is a list of people who have been cited by a credible source as probably having bipolar disorder.

<li>I believe the page now is worthy of a <b>keep</b> <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukeSurl_8333.html" title="User:LukeSurl">LukeSurl</a> 19:09, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I've consulted a second source, namely [<a href="http://www.bipolarworld.net/Bipolar%20Disorder/Articles/art14.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.bipolarworld.net/Bipolar%20Disorder/Articles/art14.htm" rel="nofollow">bipolarworld.net</a>. I belive this gives the list extra validity. However, due to the nature of Bipolar disorder it is inevitable that this list is going to be questionable, therefore I have added in the article an admission of this:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>"The nature of the condition means it is near impossible to obtain an definative list of bipolar persons, hence this is a list of those that are believed to be so. The fact that it contains many artistic geniuses can be interpreted in two ways, either that bipolar disorder occurs fequently in artistic geniuses or that people frequently associate mental disorder with genius in error, not understanding the nature of the gift."</p>
<p>I believe the list can be interpreted as a mirror on popular perception of bipolar disorder and not necessarily a definative list and such warrent its ambiguous title.</p>
<p>Furthermore I have excluded any living persons from the list to avoid controversy <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukeSurl_8333.html" title="User:LukeSurl">LukeSurl</a> 20:33, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Whatever the sources, it should still be <b>deleted</b>. I just looked at the pages referenced from which appear equally "highly speculative and inaccurate". For one reason or other most mental health pressure groups appear to collect spuriously referenced lists of highly speculative nature of famous people suffering their particular illness/condition. Probably worth an article...Beethoven turns up on every such list, whether autistic/ asperger, bipolar whatever, probably he was just an alcoholic, Schumann suffered from tertiary syphilis and not BPI(as per reference provided, etc, Again, please <b>delete</b> asap.<a href="../../../r/e/f/User%7ERefdoc_5ef2.html" title="User:Refdoc">Refdoc</a> 20:42, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, these lists are collected by those with a vested interest but doesn't that increase this articles validity on how Bipolar disorder is percieved? Perhaps the page could be <b>moved</b> to <i>List of people <b>claimed</b> to have been affected by bipolar disorder</i> with a brief discussion on the bias of said organisations?<a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukeSurl_8333.html" title="User:LukeSurl">LukeSurl</a> 21:05, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Furthermore, bipolarity and alcholism or syphillus are not mutually exclusive. Biopolarity, switching from depression to manic may be a cause, or an effect of alcholism, Schumann's syphillus may have caused a bipolar nature. "Bipolar disorder" was previously called "manic depression", and is therefore much easier to speculate on than first appears. For a person to have Bipolar II disorder requires only one major depressive episode in their lives. This is possible to determine with reasonable accuracy from historical records. Yes, if this is to be closer to a definate list then it should be reviewed on a case by case basis, but not deleted. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukeSurl_8333.html" title="User:LukeSurl">LukeSurl</a> 22:54, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><i>This is possible to determine with reasonable accuracy from historical records</i> This is wrong. While the criteria are laid out in stuff like [[ICD 10] ]and <a href="../../../d/s/m/DSM_IV_2543.html" title="DSM IV">DSM IV</a>, any such diagnosis requires huge medical skills, is often in doubt for a long time and may need to be revised at some stage. To make such a diagnosis form review of incomplete biographical data is presumptoous to say the least.<a href="../../../r/e/f/User%7ERefdoc_5ef2.html" title="User:Refdoc">Refdoc</a> 00:10, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nevertheless, it could be perfectly encyclopedic to say "<a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Gordon_Byron%2C_6th_Baron_Byron_062d.html" title="George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron">Byron</a> was profiled as a probable manic-depressive by <a href="../../../k/a/y/Kay_Redfield_Jamison_6145.html" title="Kay Redfield Jamison">Kay Redfield Jamison</a>." It all depends on whether you think Kay Redfield Jamison's views rise to the level of encyclopedic authority. We shouldn't present our personal speculation as fact, but it's perfectly reasonable to present well-sourced, authoritative speculation as long as we identify the source and led the reader assess credibility. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:18, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I would like to see the opinion of a specialist on this article. After the cleanup, the issue seems to be merely whether or not the list is speculative. I'm no psychiatrist, but one or two books I've read by very notable authorities on this field gave me the impression it is not really considered speculation to produce a diagnosis based only on historical data, or even in fictional material. By the way, Ben Stiller is still listed with no indication of source. <a href="../../../v/m/v/User%7EVmv_bc84.html" title="User:Vmv">vlad_mv</a> 01:14, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not very happy with the "cleanup." The so-called sources are web pages which themselves are very poorly sourced. The NAMI list is simply a list of people with "mental illness." The current page includes Faulkner, gives <a href="http://www.bipolarworld.net/Bipolar%20Disorder/Articles/art14.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.bipolarworld.net/Bipolar%20Disorder/Articles/art14.htm" rel="nofollow">BPW</a> as the source, but notes that Faulkner was "alcoholic." The BPW does list him as "bipolar" but really presents no evidence or sources at all. Being alcoholic and being bipolar are not the same thing! <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 03:01, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>I've added "TWF" initials to all persons listed in "Touched with fire" as well as a few links to relavent biographies of a few individual persons. Kay Redfield Jamison includes many more persons on her list but I decided not to add any more names. I've also got a quote from Ben Stiller himself who is very open about his condition, making him the only living person on the list. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukeSurl_8333.html" title="User:LukeSurl">LukeSurl</a> 16:53, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's perfectly without the mandate of an NPOV encyclopaedia to report that a famous person is commonly believed, or credibly cited, to have a particular medical condition. This goes for deceased persons as well, as long as we make it clear that the diagnosis is merely an estimate based on historical material.
