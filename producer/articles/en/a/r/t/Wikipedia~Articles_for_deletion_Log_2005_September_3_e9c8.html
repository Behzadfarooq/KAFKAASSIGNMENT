<li>Hi Zoe. Thirteen years ago the internet was small, restricted mainly to official academic and government users and nothing like it is today. For the same reason that early artifacts of print culture are important, e-zines from the early era of the internet are too. I hope this helps. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> 22:12, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. So far I've only been able to find one reference from an old BBS called <a href="http://www.flashdance.cx/txt/" class="external text" title="http://www.flashdance.cx/txt/" rel="nofollow">"NATTNAPPRAREN"</a>. By the time this zine was being published I had far removed myself from the HP scene, but Sdedeo makes a very convincing argument why this should be kept. History is important and bytes are cheap. —<b>RaD Man</b> (<i>talk</i>) 22:25, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Argh</b>. I put the tag "unsourced" on the article, and someone very quickly and helpfully put a link to the first issue of the e-zine. I checked it out, and the release date for rage turns out to be 1995. Furthermore, I was unable to find any later issues, and google (including google USENET) was unable to find anything about "Ruthless Anarchists Getting Even". IMO, 1995 is getting a bit late to be inherently notable. However, my residual affection for the subject matter means I cannot bring myself to vote as I should. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> 22:31, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Yes, there really was such a thing. As memory serves, it was used by the Mongols once, at least, along with incendiary cats (sad to say). The Mongols started a siege of a city, and demanded all the pigs and cats from the city. The city folk complied in hopes of getting the Mongols to leave. Instead, the Mongols tarred and set fire to the pigs as described, and tied burning material to the cats' tails. The poor panicked animals ran for home, and the city was burned down. I'd put this all in the article, but I don't have a reference to cite.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I once worked on a computer system for the Saudi Arabian Ministry of the Interior (their state police). One of the programs involved keeping track of a list of things which the Saudis considered crimes. I noticed a listing for "arson using an animal". I asked one of the Saudis working with us what this meant, and he said that it's a common crime in Saudi Arabia to tie a donkey to a cart, load the cart up with hay, set fire to the hay, and whip the donkey into your neighbor's fields. (Another crime was "whitearm", but I never did get an explanation for what that meant.) <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> 22:25, September 3, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Tutting is a dance-style--a subset of popping, which is a west coast "funk style"--that began to be referred to as such in the 1980s.

Hypothetically, perhaps a case could be made for a flat-earth - it is certainly a great test case for logic and epistomology. But there is no 'debate'. Who is actually debating this? Where? With whom? --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 17:13, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for recognizing the epistemological problems involved in ruling out a flat earth. Many people say "obviously it's false. Anyone can just build a rocket ship and see." (And again, no, I don't think flat-earthers are right.) To answer your questions in the order they were asked, 1) members of the Flat Earth Society and various fundamentalist Christians; 2) on various internet forums; 3) pretty much anyone else, especially creationists.</dd>

<li>Suppose it were true that an article on every single school in the world were ever likely to appear on Wikipedia. Suppose further that these articles would, in their number, "dwarf" all the other content of Wikipedia. Why would this be a problem? You don't have to look at articles you aren't interested in looking at.

<li>This is true, and subtrivial-but-probably-accurate articles are <i>almost</i> harmless. Wikipedia is not intended to be mainly used via the "random article" link. And it doesn't have an easily visible list of contents. But let me ask: if I go to the article <a href="../../../e/m/b/Embryogenesis.html" title="Embryogenesis">Embryogenesis</a>, in what way is my reading experience affected by the existence of <i>inaccuracies</i> in articles on other topics? If there is, say, a group of people who wish to contribute inaccurate articles about a topic that is of interest <i>mainly to other people who tolerate these inaccuracies,</i> should anyone be concerned? If so, why? <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:22, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'd definitely like to see a coherent answer to this. <b>Why</b> does it matter that WP has lots of articles about schools or any other marginally interesting thing? Surely our primary concern ought to be that the articles are well written, so that if someone were to look up X chool, they are not faced with nonsense or ugliness? Why would it matter if there were 64 million articles in Wikipedia, and 60 million were about schools? You keep saying it matters, guys, but you never actually explain why. Do you feel it is a question of <i>dignity</i>? Do you think it somehow reflects badly on you?</li>
<li>I don't understand your question, Dpbsmith, which is a pity because you are at least more thoughtful than most of the wannabe deletionists in this area. Your enjoyment of an article is not in the least affected by inaccuracies in other articles so long as it doesn't link to them <i>except</i> that if you read many very inaccurate articles, your faith in the accuracy of the article in question is damaged. This would seem to be an argument for accuracy (and by extension verifiability) and nothing much to do with whether articles should be included. If you are trying to argue that deletionists should be encouraged to spend more time ensuring that articles we have are accurate and less on trying to delete things they don't like, I wholeheartedly agree. If you are arguing that we should be encouraging people to contribute poor articles because others who tend to read them don't care about their mistakes (which you seem to be suggesting), then I don't agree. We should neither encourage nor discourage it, but should do our best to mitigate it by fixing up the bad stuff. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 02:38, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Tony seemed to be arguing that I shouldn't care about articles if they are not on topics of interest to me, because if they don't interest me I'll never see them and therefore they don't affect me. I'm saying, well, copyvios and inaccurate articles and POV and hoaxes <i>do</i> affect me <i>even</i> if they are on topics on which I would never consult WIkipedia. Therefore, I say, yes, I do have some interest in the quality of Wikipedia <i>as a whole.</i></dd>
<dd>Now, let's take this to the next step. Should <b>really low-quality</b> articles <b>ever</b> be deleted, simply because they are of low quality? This is tough, because we all recognize that Wikipedia articles are improved over time. <b>But not at the same rate.</b> There's no harm in a low-quality article about <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beethoven.html" title="Beethoven">Beethoven</a>, or <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddy_Holly_7119.html" title="Buddy Holly">Buddy Holly</a>, or <a href="../../../w/i/s/Wisconsin.html" title="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>, because a lot of people know something about these topics and they will get improved quickly. On the other hand, very few people know much about Heathcote Elementary School. If the first person to write about it write a good-quality stub, good. If not, it may be months or years before anybody gets around to writing one—and it will likely be an independent event, i.e. the new article will probably not have "grown" from the old one.</dd>
<dd>Let's suppose that, for some reason, there is a class of topic that is attracting the contribution of large numbers of low-quality articles. If they are being contributed faster than they are being improved, yes, that's a problem.</dd>
<dd>There are no absolutes here. School articles are less of a problem than they used to be, because there are more serious, experienced editors working on them than there used to be.</dd>
<dd>People can't believe the Wikipedia process actually works. Well, it does work—but not automatically and not without conditions. One of the conditions is that there really be "many eyes." The problem with "non-notable" topics is that they attract <i>few eyes.</i></dd>
<dd><b>At some point,</b> articles are deletable if they are about something that is <b>too</b> non-notable. As you'd expect, not everyone draws the line at the same place. And, as you'd expect, at the borderline, there is great contention. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:30, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>
<ul>
<li>Okay, I think I can respond to that. I think the point is precisely this: that school articles are generally of such high quality, or can be made so, that deletion of a school article is actually quite a rare and surprising event. For nearly 276 school article deletion nominations, we've only had 37 school article deletions--less than 15% of those listed.</li>
<li>So is the problem that most school stubs created are rubbish? Well no, I don't think that claim can be defended either. Here is a log I have just created linking to every school article created on Wikipedia in the past three or four days: <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_schoolwatch_New_2739.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/New">Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/New</a>. There are some duds in there, but I'd happily take on most of them and pilot them through a AfD with a very high confidence of keeping the result.</li>
<li>Okay, is the problem that most school stubs aren't being improved, and there are too few eyes? I think one has to adopt a very blinkered approach to article production to support this hypothesis. Firstly, I think it's highly likely that Wikipedia or some successor project is likely to maintain this knowledge base in some publicly editable form for many decades. Secondly, only articles that people want to edit ever get created. There is no evidence that some mechanical script, like the one that created all those articles about tiny blips on the US census map, is at work here.</li>
<li>But finally I just don't buy the thesis. Schools are public institutions, so there is plenty of verifiable information about them. There is no reason to support the hypothesis that lack of eyes will be a problem. Any reasonably well educated, reasonably bright person can look at any school article and determine whether the statements in the article are adequately sourced and neutral. There is no problem with school articles that cannot be solved by the normal process of editing. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 03:55, 10 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Three questions. 1) Is it <i>possible</i> that there <i>could</i> be a class of article that attracts a rate of creation of articles of low quality and has a very low <i>rate</i> of article review and improvement—so that, at any given time, the average article quality was very low? 2) Would such a hypothetical class of article be a problem for Wikipedia? 3) Are school articles an instance of such a class? Obviously your answer to #3 is "no." But what about 1 and 2? <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 11:14, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't buy 1 and 2, really. I think it's an interesting hypothesis but I don't find a lot of articles that are likely to be a problem for Wikipedia. A low rate of improvement is absolutely of no concern here; there is no deadline. I've got some concrete examples, too. Of the sixteen school articles created since midnight, UTC, I'd say three or four need cleanup, but the others are already pretty good stubs. Not bad going for their first day. Older schools get more edits and I think they tend to fare better at AfD. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 12:15, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete.</b> NN.

<li>5000 test is for authors, editors and photographers (i.e., people producing original work). He is none of these. The (admittedly vague) line dealing with this entry is "Widely recognized entertainment personalities and opinion makers" and, again, I don't think a local news anchor qualifies. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 12:41, 3 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. A news anchor does "perform" in a sense. Also, according to entry this guy is a CBS anchor for Miami-- news anchor for a major network in a city of some 375,000 people.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Non-notable, of local regional interest only.

<dd>No problems here. It seems that the more effective we get at writing decent school articles that end up getting kept at AfD, the more extreme in their "notability" demands for school content some people get. Now we've got to the point where a school isn't necessarily notable if a famous person went there. Never mind that people will want to read about it, the ever-more-unreasonable demands of a diminishing number now say that it mustn't have an encyclopedia article. I am left scratching my head and wondering what on earth some people believe an encycloped is intended to do if not present factual, verifiable information on subjects of interest. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 08:51, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Conditional <b>Delete</b>. If it is a legal term, then an entry/re-direct for such a term would indeed be appropiate and welcome.

<p>Okay, this one is tricky. Balslev is the founder of CasaSwap.com, which I'm not sure is notable enough for a Wiki article. If his company is, he is; if it's not, he's not. I think it was Lucullan who said that that he'd rather have people ask "why <i>isn't</i> there a statue of him?" instead of "why <i>is</i> there a statue of him?" Alexa rankings for CasaSwap aren't terribly impressive, but Google hits for "casaswap" minus "site:casaswap.com" make me wonder if I'm missing something. Anyone?

<p>if $NotableBandA breaks up, and $NotableBandB breaks up, and members from both groups join together to form $NewBand, but $NewBand falls apart before ever producing an album, is $NewBand notable? <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonflySixtyseven_c6ee.html" title="User:DragonflySixtyseven">DS</a> 14:42, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, $NewBand is notable if it "Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise extremely notable; note that it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such".

<li>Sure they do. It's at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Headstones_0e35.html" title="The Headstones">The Headstones</a>, and both previous bands are extremely notable in Canadian alt-rock.

<li><b>Comment</b> AGS is probably the largest government simulation on the net and as far as government simulations go, it is probably the most important one out there right now. It has made significant contributions and advances as far as Sims go and it has influenced several other government sims. I'm not voting on this one way or the other. If people want to vote it off because it's non-notable, then I don't have much of a problem with that even if I think they are incorrect in their assessment. What irritates me, however, is that the attempt to delete was initiated by (apparently) an anonymous source, who hasn't contributed to Wikipedia at all other than for this article and the government simulation article. It leads me to believe that this is all nothing more than an attempt to carry out a grudge. I won't really shed any tears if this article is deleted, though. It seems it's more trouble than its worth with all the trolls coming in. But I will say I strongly disagree with Carnadillo. His standards are a bit absurd. It's not clear how ANY simulation could maintain 50,000 members. That doesn't mean that all net simulations are not notable. Government sims with over 200 members are considered very large by their relative standards and within the simming community, a Sim with 200-500 members would be very well known. I would say notable Sims of the past include NGS2, AOL Senate Sim, and Senate Sim. <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakob_Huneycutt_27e3.html" title="User:Jakob Huneycutt">Jakob Huneycutt</a> 12:30, 08 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. While 500 members may not meet the vaunted "Carnildo Standard", the number is significant in that it is arguably the largest online government sim communities of all those mentioned.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I have no problem letting AGS have a wikipedia page. I DO have a problem with the nonsense and double standards going on with trying to have USG's page deleted. Especially when those voting for deletion are random people who have no right no pass judgment about a subject they know nothing about.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: This is simply not a flame war. All we would like is for our article to be able to be on Wikipedia. We did not expect a full out frontal assault from AGS in an effort to remove the article. We only want Wikipedia to be fair. Either keep both or delete both. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.115.55.215 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.115.55.215_b940.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.115.55.215">contribs</a>) 00:09, 18 August 2005.</small></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: There is no evidence to support these specious claims of "frontal assault from AGS"; in fact, the evidence that does exist suggests the opposite. AGS administrators have said on their forums that they encourage members to join other sims, and have even posted a link to the simulation in their web links. The announcement is <a href="http://www.forumforfree.com/forums/index.php?mforum=ags&amp;showtopic=58645&amp;view=getnewpost" class="external text" title="http://www.forumforfree.com/forums/index.php?mforum=ags&amp;showtopic=58645&amp;view=getnewpost" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Once again AGS should be allowed to keep their page. All the Admins of USG agree on this. We are however, miffed, that there is a huge deletion attempt going on against our page, brought on by ignorant people with nothing better to do. I implore Wikipedia Mods to end both the deletion attempt here, and against the USG page.</li>

<p>Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp is a major contributor to the arts community of the Great Lakes. Many, many orchaestra musicians trace their early training to this well-funded, well-regarded regional arts center. In essence, they have invented the fine arts camp for highly talented middle school and high school artists.</p>

<dd>OK, then perhaps listing those orchestra musicians in the same way that has been done for actors in <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neighborhood_Playhouse_55cb.html" title="Neighborhood Playhouse">Neighborhood Playhouse</a> would be a good start.

<p>As a prior BLFAC camper, I have a personal bias towards keeping this Wiki entry (it's not like this listing is some violation of the Wikipedia terms or anything). Truthfully, while I would agree with Wmjuntunen that BLFAC has had a significant impact on current musical talents, that is not the only reason it should be kept. The BLFAC instrument museum, in and of itself, is one of the few of its kind anywhere in the world, with both historical and reproductions of early musical devices. Additionally, BLFAC holds several contests each year such as the Falcone Euphonium Competition, as well as their annual Jazz Fest, contributing to the world's appreciation of music. Lastly, BLFAC, while in a no-name town in Michigan, has an impact well beyond the Great Lake region. Campers from not only all over the United States but also the world attend one of their sessions on music, theatre, piano, dance and art each summer. In most artistic circles, BLFAC is second only to Interlochen, which not only is also in Michigan, but is the world's premier artistic venue for high school age students.--Jigordon 21:53, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

The final editor has enough contribs and things, but this is their <i>only</i> edit in Wikipedia: space and is also discounted.

<li>AI, I agree that VfD is not the place to resolve NPOV disputes, but I have looked at your edits, and it is pretty clear that you are behaving very poorly.

What has religion to do with writing on Wikipedia? Apparently, these people who attack Scientology are not as good and innocent as they want to be viewed, and there is no reason why their true characters should be not portrayed on Wikipedia. Wikipedia accepts as information sources Usenet articles that could have been fabricated by anyone. Why not accepting a website that backs most of its claims up with official court and archive records? Note also that the anti-religious extremists never sued the RFW. If it would be true what Dave Touretzky claims, how come he did not sue them? He has money. There are even two attorneys portrayed as anti-religious extremists and the site is all over the Internet. I am sure they would represent their anti-religious extremist collegagues for free, if anyone of them would have a case. The problem is that Dave Touretzky and his friends are an anti-free speech advocates. They remove any critical data about themselves when they can. I had at least five websites with true and supporting information about Dave Touretzky on the Internet. I was informed that he goes after them and threaten to sue the ISP if they don't take the critic down, and the ISP don't want to be involved in legal actions, give in and remove the websites. Fine free world we live in. There is no free speech and that the RFW websites is bullied from Wikipedia is also a sign of no free speech. User Vivaldi rocks!</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I began and wrote the majority of this article and I wish to make my case. This is not an article against Jesus Christ or Christians. It is plain to see this due to the fact that it is written in a non-biased fashion (neither for nor against Christ and Christianity). This article was put up for deletion when it was only a few minutes old and when it had only two people and a small comment about the homeless. (The homeless comment is true if one were to ask the majority of city-dwellers, but I took it out of the article because it is not Wikiworthy) It is blatantly obvious that the article has been expanded and improved. It has even been added to by authors other than myself, thus verifying that others take an interest in this notable and odd personality trait. It is true that the article can be improved (and therefore one must "be bold" to update it) but the <i>original reason</i> for having this page put up for deletion is no longer applicable. It is my opinion that it should remain its own article. This is a very specific aspect of people who claim to be deities. Perhaps in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_self-proclaimed_deities.html" title="List of self-proclaimed deities">List of self-proclaimed deities</a> there could be a link to this page. It is a very thought provoking subject. One must ask, "Why choose Jesus out of all other people? Why do murderous people such as Charles Manson or Luc Jouret claim to be Christ (who said "blessed are the peacemakers")? What is it about Jesus Christ that causes so many people to think that they are his reincarnation? How does a murderous person ever come to associate themselves with Jesus?" (Such were the thoughts through which this article came to fruition.) I shall summarize what I have said: this is a thought-provoking article that can be added to (and has been added to already) and the original reason why it should be deleted is now obsolete. <a href="../../../e/d/u/User%7EEduard_Gherkin_af33.html" title="User:Eduard Gherkin">Eduard Gherkin</a> 23:32:27, 2005-08-18 (UTC)</li>

<p>There are oodles of fundamental errors and misunderstadnings. The potential is wrong, inner electrons screen the potential. There are no terms for spin-orbit coupling, no fine/hyperfine structure of any kind. These are approx 10^40 greater in magnitude than any effect from gravitation.

<dd>FWIW, I've seen, and read, similar conference proceedings which are of equal stature, containing "proofs" that special relativity is wrong, etc. so I don't consider publication alone to be a reasonable standard.

<dd><b>Delete</b>. As Pjacobi points out on Talk:Gravitational radiation of atom, the last sentence is wrong and the rest is irrelevant. Gravitational radiation is a relativistic phenomenon, so you cannot discuss it without discussing relativity (please tell me if I'm wrong; I'm not a physicist). The author's website it at <a href="http://www.webfinder.ru/vm/" class="external free" title="http://www.webfinder.ru/vm/" rel="nofollow">http://www.webfinder.ru/vm/</a> (in Russian) and the same text as Gravitational radiation of atom can be found at <a href="http://www.webfinder.ru/vm/abstract1.html" class="external free" title="http://www.webfinder.ru/vm/abstract1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.webfinder.ru/vm/abstract1.html</a> .

<p>Do we really need a stub/article on every single Nokia phone? Nokia has a phone archive with the specifications of every phone they ever made. Perhaps these articles contain a few worthless factoids about these phones, cant there be a Nokia phone's factoid page or something?

<li>(vote continues) and this guy's resume-padding, however offensive, isn't particularly notable. Moreover, Lokifer continues to pepper the stub with unattributed claims like 'he lied about being nominated for an Emmy' when the guy has explained how and when his work was nominated. Moreover, the claims of having participated in 'covert activities' aren't backed up by Lokifer's source material... the closest one gets is the Reporter using the words covert activities and not in a direct quote from the subject. The new inclusion of the usage of Photoshop to rework the posters isn't substantiated and runs counter to the guy's own statements about how he accomplishes his 'art' or whatever. Lokifer constantly expands the guy's crimes -- one university is mentioned in his links, but he expands that to 'universities.' He does the same thing where he finds a single quote where the guy lashed out against someone using his false military service as a soapbox, but then expands that to 'people' without substantiation. The page he links to clearly shows that the guy apologized to this Parrot person for doing so as well. Lokifer further expands the smear campagin by blasting an artist's conference as an 'anti-war-forum' when looking at the site, it was clearly a symposium of anti-war artists lecturing about technique and format to students who were there in for an artistic conference, not an anti-war rally. Lokifer complains that the guy posted a false bio on his webpage and then complains that it's since been deleted... would he be happier if the lies were still there? Lastly, to point out more semi-truths, it appears that this comicbook Stormwatch Team Achilles was cancelled well before this guy's revelations... all DC did was not publish the final issue... AND the guy clearly has published his second book of posters. It's pretty clear that Lokifer has spent a great deal of time stalking down this guy's lies and foibles online, but it's not clear that this guy's two-year-run of resume-padding is worth an entry in Wikipedia, especially not if it's going to be filled with so much politically-motivated personal bias and half-truths. <i>Carnifax 20:58, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</i>
<ul>
<li>Micah (oops, I mean Carnifax), correct any errors that you see, but don't delete them. The problem with tracking down most of the information about Micah Wright is that hard facts cannot be found, usually because Micah Wright deleted most of his posts in his forum and enough place online that he was quoted at now no longer existed. There's also the damning interview at KPFK on "Democracy Now" with Amy Goodman that was available for download on his website that's no longer available. What's so damning about the interview? He embellished so much about his fake military career (most of which I have included). Elsewhere (but included in the article with links) Micah has said, "(He has seen) a lot of nastiness in South and Central America during G.H.W. Bush's regime," and he has said, "After four years spent invading other countries as an Airborne Ranger in the U.S. Army." Besides Panama, what other "invasions" of Central and South American countries was the USA publically engaged in between 1987 and 1991? There are none, so they must be secret covert operations. I've been able to find two universities that Micah spoke at: USC and New School University. At both he spoke out against the war and he was an attractive speaker for the issue since he was claiming to be an ex-ranger. Now if you want to include nice things that he has done, please add them. I'd like to see what charities he has established or other equally good deeds from this man. However, since he built his whole persona on being an anti-war ex-Army Ranger, I see nothing wrong pointing out just how engrained and far reaching the lies went by using HIS OWN WORDS.Lokifer 21:34, 4 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Maybe you didn't see my comments above, criticizing his lies. My only point is that he's hardly famous and not worth an expansive entry in Wikipedia, much less an obviously politically inspired smear job full of POV and unsupported indictments. Your interpretations aside, Micah Wright never mentions 'covert activity' in any of the articles you cite. Referencing an interview which you can only vaguely 'remember' as 'damning' isn't quite the same a citing FACTS about what he said. You're also conflating quotes from two different interviews to concoct a charge against him: that he claims he "saw ugliness throughout Central and South America" during GHW Bush's administrations isn't the same as participating in covert activities... we all saw America Imperialism at work all throughout the Reagan/Bush years. Add that to the fact that the US Army (including Rangers, which he was pretending to have been) invaded Somalia in the same period of time, and I think you're stretching it to state that "invading countries" means that he categorically claimed to have been involved in 'covert activities.' It's a loaded POV accusation which you've jerry-rigged together by Frankensteining disparate quotes. Moreover, you make the same sins of exaggeration you're accusing him of when you say he told 'people' to shut up, rather than one person. Then again, maybe this is just the kind of grammar and logic problems which afflict all of your postings about this guy: 'gave a fuzzy photographs" being a prime example. Again, it's a borderline vanity page, and the current revision is so full of POV that it's next to useless. If he's forever banned from comic books and his career as an author is finished, then what's the point of pretending he's famous? As for what charities he's established or what good works he's accomplished, I have no idea... I haven't extensively stalked him online, unlike some... all I've done is read your version of his life and looked at the 'proof' you think you've compiled.Carnifax 23:51, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I just have a few things to say because this is a discussion of whether or not the article should be deleted. One, Micah never mentioned Somilia or Iraq, but specified that he was in Central and South America when he was "invading countries". Two, you claim that I have too much of a POV, but your use of the term "American Imperalism" is hardly non-POV and I think it clouds your judgement on my entries in the article. Three, the line about the "fuzzy photograph" is not something I made up on a whim; it is a quote from Dan Simon, publisher of Wright's book, that can be found in an article by <a href="../../../p/u/b/Publishers_Weekly_8028.html" title="Publishers Weekly">Publishers Weekly</a>, a credible source methinks, with a link provided to that article.

Does this negate the fact that any of these people should have articles because they are not well known (aka famous or infamous) enough? Lokifer 01:53, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It is not often that I put things up for deletion, but, looking through the recent changes, this article caught my eye. Does this referee deserve an article? I have checked the internet, and, despite being in refereeing for such a long time, he has only ever officiated over very few top-flight games; the BBC lists 16 Premiership games, but perhaps that was only from one season. Nonetheless, I can find nothing remarkable about his life, or any controversial or important decision that he has made; so, I do not really see why this guy deserves an article above any other run-of-the-mill FA referee. If there are compelling reasons, I would love to know (although I am not much of a football fan;) but I cannot see what is notable about him, other than his being a select referee. That should take up a line, not a whole page. <a href="../../../i/t/27/User%7EIt%27s-is-not-a-genitive_382d.html" title="User:It's-is-not-a-genitive">IINAG</a> 23:33, 24th August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> as I am unwilling to redirect this anywhere, and it's current content and likely any future content is rather mystical stuff between OR and POV. Obviously no redirect to <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">science</a>, and it doesn't claim to be <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protoscience.html" title="Protoscience">protoscience</a> or <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a> either, so no redirect to those nor to any of the hoaxes.

<p><b>Expand</b> As the first contributor of this article I find it odd that within minutes of beginning to sketch out it scope someone "helps" the process by suggesting the page be deleted. There is a certain body of writing on the construction of the term "controversial science," and the term itself is used a great deal by people with and without an overt POV. But that does in no way make the term itself controversial. I suggest to allow the article to develop and after a time come to a determination of whether or not it needs a redirect, and if so, to what other article. People familiar with this topic are likely to deem it anything BUT "mystical." <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 22:46, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Expand</b> Tend to agree with <a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> re <i>traditional</i> use, but there's an article there I feel.

<li><b>Merge</b> any useful content into <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a> (all of the examples discussed in the article are actually pseudoscience), then <b>redirect</b>. There is no particular reason to have an entry to describe the concept of science that is merely controversial, anymore than we should have an entry to describe that concept of a, e.g., "controversial legal decision" or "controversial book". (The article does talk a little bit at the end about how science is labelled "controversial" when it is not, for political reasons, but this is just a rhetorical device.) <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> 23:41, 3 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>This is not an article about "examples of controversial science," which may or may not belong under <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a>, but about the term "Controversial science" itself, and its evolution and dynamics.<a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 00:06, 4 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As it stands, the article doesn't really persuade me that the term exists in the sense that it is discussed in, say, academic circles. Rather, it's just a somewhat blanket phrase dealing with any kind of science that someone disagreed with — and that's just about the entire field! -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 00:12, 4 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is an exploratory article in a still-embryonic stage. I think that an argument can be made that this term has a life of its own, aside from what it describes, and that it is per se a worthy object of analysis. I may be proven wrong in the end but I do not think that a preemptory challenge to its exitence is either timely or useful at this moment. As it stands the argument may not persuade me either, but as material accumulates, and as others hopefuly contribute, a viable discourse may take shape. What's your rush? You tagged it literally minutes after I began to write.<a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 00:54, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete (?)</b> - While this entry was likely commercially motivated and probably could be deleted, the question of when a company (of whatever type) qualifies for an article is interesting. <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netflix.html" title="Netflix">Netflix</a> as a large public company and the originator of a business model is a given. I created a entry for <a href="../../../z/i/p/Zip.ca.html" title="Zip.ca">Zip.ca</a> as the largest equivalent in the Canadian market. There are a range of smaller companies down to the Bushidos of the world - are there any general Wikipedia recommendations for cases like this? Perhaps a small company like Technical Video Rental is more deserving of an entry because of its specialty inventory than a "regular" movie rental company of the same size? I've just recently separated out the actual list of companies from <a href="../../../o/n/l/Online_DVD_rental_b767.html" title="Online DVD rental">Online DVD rental</a> into a list article of their own (List of online DVD rental companies) - perhaps Bushido's mention there could be considered sufficient? <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 23:57:35, 2005-09-05 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't understand Doc's argument.

<li>My argument is this. If a double glazing company got this Alexa rating, they'd be notable - because few double glazing companies would get a higher rating - thus it would probably be one of the most notable businesses in its field . But the nature of the internet is that at least 2,000 of the 4,000 sites rated above this porn site will be other porn sites - thus this is not a high rating for a pornsite - thus nn. If every business with as little impact, turnover and staff as this one is likely to have were mentioned, then my local butcher (or glazier, to keep the analogy) would be worth an article. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 02:07, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Oh I think I understand your argument, now. However I cannot find any support for it. Looking at <a href="http://www.alexa.com/site/ds/top_500" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/site/ds/top_500" rel="nofollow">Alexa's top 500 list</a>, for instance, you'd think that if your assumption were correct about half of those on the list would be porn sites. Well actually that turns out to be completely untrue. There are some porn sites there, but they're pretty sparse. I think the main reason people will want to delete this is that it's a porn site. Well I disagree with that reason, too. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 02:41, 4 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>For the record, no I didn't post that on Wikipedia. I think the article belongs on Wikipedia because it's encyclopedic and neutral and it's about a fairly popular pornographic website.
