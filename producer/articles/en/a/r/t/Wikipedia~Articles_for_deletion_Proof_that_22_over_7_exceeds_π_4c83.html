<p>Wikipedia <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">is not</a> the place for something that's just a proof. A proof originally written by someone else and available freely belongs in wikisource, math articles can (and probably should) contain proofs, but a proof on its own isn't an encyclopedia article, and the article isn't <i>about</i> the proof, it is the proof and little more. This is an old article, around since 2003 at least, and I think our standards have tightened since then in a way that it wouldn't pass muster if created today.

<li><b>Stong Keep.</b> It is absurd to say a proof on its own is not an encyclopedia article. What about all of the <b>other</b> pages devoted mainly to mathematical proofs? Will you nominate <b>ALL</b> of them for deletion? What about <b>ALL OF THE ARTICLES IN <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_topics_related_to_pi.html" title="List of topics related to pi">list of topics related to pi</a></b>??

"Night Gyr", may I inquire about your experience with Wikipedia's mathematics articles? "Kiss the Lizard" very clumsily misses the point of this article. 22/7 is of course one of the earliest convergents in the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continued_fraction.html" title="Continued fraction">continued fraction</a> expansion of π.

<li>Our mathematics articles contain proofs to enlighten and back up statements, not just to be a collection of proofs. The first line of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Mathematics_Proofs_8043.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Mathematics/Proofs">Wikipedia:WikiProject Mathematics/Proofs</a> is "This is an encyclopedia, not a collection of math texts." The fact that there's a particular proof out there may be mathematically interesting, but the proof alone does not constitute an encyclopedia article. There are other places for such raw texts, and I listed several above. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> 01:35, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

If people don't understand why this holds more interest than a "proof that 4 exceeds 3" would, then they have failed to understand the article. Remember there was a time when people hadn't worked out the value of pi. Knowing that it's close to 22/7, but not exactly, might lead one to wonder whether 22/7 is an <i>over</i>-approximation or an <i>under</i>-approximation. This proof makes it clear that 22/7 is high, so the true value of pi is somewhere below it. Sure, we know now that pi=3.14159, approximately, but people had to work that out somehow. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 03:25, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, not necessarily. Reflect on the statement "intriguing and curiosity-provoking facts are notable" for a while, and now imagine the articles this policy could defend. It's not a pretty sight.
<dl>
<dd>Off hand, I cannot think of any hypothetical articles that could be "intriguing and curiosity-provoking" but "not a pretty sight". By all means, tell me what you have in mind, if you can. Perhaps I should add to "intriguing and curiosity-provoking", that this article could lead to insights that in turn lead to further discoveries. People who see this argument often wonder if this is the first in a long sequence of integrals with a neat pattern, that correspond to the successive convergents in the continued fraction expansion of π, just as this corresponds to 22/7. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 00:11, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>I don't think anyone disputes that the fact that 22/7 is really close to π should be included in Wikipedia. Whether a property of an integral cast in proof form qualifies is another matter. And whether the dozens if not hundreds of equally intriguing mathematical curios should have articles is yet another.</dd>
<dd>Then again, notability has never been a useful criterion on Wikipedia, and the "cui malo?" argument seems to apply aptly here. This proof is probably not any less notable than, say, any of the <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invalid_proof.html" title="Invalid proof">invalid proofs</a> we have on record. <a href="../../../8/2/2E/User%7E82.92.119.11.html" title="User:82.92.119.11">82.92.119.11</a> 20:19, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> The key problem here is that despite all the claims to elegance and such, there's no objective criteria for inclusion that we're using to justify this article. The other articles in <a href="../../../p/r/o/Category%7EProofs_4245.html" title="Category:Proofs">category:proofs</a> are either about methods used in proofs or specific proofs that are well known and specifically named. This proof doesn't have any historical importance attached to it in the way that a proof of a major problem in math is—mathematicians have known pi&lt;22/7 far longer than they've been doing calculus. "indiscriminate collection of information" applies because this proof becomes the equivalent of an "interesting fact" about a person--worthy of inclusion in the article on the person, but <i>not worth its own article</i>. On its own, it's unencyclopedic. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> 23:29, 16 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then we can conceivably expand the article to include other proofs of π&lt;22/7 that may have been used in antiquity (If my memory serves me correctly, I do believe there is a geometric demonstration of that inequality). Just because the article as it stands only includes one method of proof does not mean that it can never have more than one method of proof. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysprosia_bc6d.html" title="User:Dysprosia">Dysprosia</a> 08:30, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>"have known pi&lt;22/7 far longer than"</b> But what's important here is the method of proof, rather than just the fact being proved. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Hardy_e932.html" title="User:Michael Hardy">Michael Hardy</a> 01:01, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't have any really precise criterion (<i>please</i> don't use "criteria" in the singular!!!) for what proofs should be allowed, but this is a really pretty proof, with a verified and interesting story behind it. I don't think I'd really like to see the door opened to textbook-style routine proofs in general; certainly techniques can be outlined, but people who want the details probably should get the textbook. But I don't see why we can't have a few articles on proofs that are interesting in themselves (as distinct from the results they prove). --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 03:45, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a fine addition to the mathematical content of Wikipedia. I find the argument that a proof can't be an article unconvincing. As long as it's not crap, OR, etc., I see no reason why a proof can't be an article. I think the reason this article is not part of another is that it serves some purpose to have these standalone articles. I can easily envision other articles about famous theorems that would require separate articles on different proofs. I can even imagine that in the near future (a project I'm pondering), one would even need separate articles for <i>parts</i> of of an immense outline of a proof in addition to separate articles just for historical background (and motivation) about the theorem and proof. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 23:29, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Just to correct an inaccuracy above, I'm not at all convinced one can flatly state that this result was around before calculus. Archimedes and his peers certainly knew versions of at least the integral calculus and some geometric versions of special cases of the fundamental theorem. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 23:29, 19 March 2006 (UTC)
