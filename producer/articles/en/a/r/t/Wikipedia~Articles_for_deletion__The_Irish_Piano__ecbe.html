<p>In support of keeping the article, I would like to bring up a few points. The current Wikipedia policy on the notability of films (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(films)" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(films)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(films)</a> ) is currently nothing more than a "proposed" policy. As such, it is subject to substantial future revisions, and, in theory, has no present authority. It is not my intent to disregard it completely, however, simply to note that, based on the policy being subject to substantial revisions, and that it is still not official, deleting The Irish Piano page on Wikipedia is, at this point in time, a grossly premature act based off of something not yet even official policy.</p>
<p>I do understand, however, that film notability is necessary to maintaining the integrity of Wikipedia (much like films must meet certain requirements to obtain a page on IMDb). I do believe that The Irish Piano's qualifications make it inherently notable to be on Wikipedia. The biggest qualification is that The Irish Piano is debuting at a film festival; surely film festival features are notable enough to be listed on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>As for verifiablity, most of the page doesn't really need to be verified (i.e. plot, film references, etc.). I think the only aspect that may need verifiability is that it is in fact in a film festival. The McFarland Film Festival is part of a bigger city festival in McFarland, WI, known as the Family Festival. The McFarland Film Festival is going to be a part of the Talent Show, one of several activities at the Family Festival. The McFarland Family Festival website can be found here: <a href="http://www.mcfarlandfamilyfestival.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.mcfarlandfamilyfestival.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mcfarlandfamilyfestival.org/</a> I will add in this citation.</p>
<p>As for having a homepage on myspace negating notability, that's simply denying notability to a film that does not have adequate resources to make an independent website. A myspace homepage in no way affects the quality of the film and certainly doesn't stop it from being featured in a film festival, a surefire sign of notability; in short, a homepage has absolutely nothing to do with notability. I understand the arguments against keeping The Irish Piano on Wikipedia, and for the most part feel them to be reasonable, but I respectfully feel that that point is not. Also, where does the definition of notability specify that a MySpace homepage negates notability? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Deltajuliet (<a href="../../../d/e/l/User_talk%7EDeltajuliet_951e.html" title="User talk:Deltajuliet">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Deltajuliet_404f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Deltajuliet">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> No, showing at a film festival is not enough to meet the standards. Many, many (most?) independent films (especially short films, almost universally) are screened at a few festivals and never heard from again. There is no coverage of this film from any external sources, which is the very definition of non-notable. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 21:29, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>In supporting keeping the article, I think that certain parts of the notability policy are a bit off. I mean, some smaller movies released by movie studios don't even make it to 200 theatres and don't get much, if any, advertisement. Yet, they may become huge on video or on the festival circuit.</p>
<p>And also, this film has no external sources now, but what if sometime in the future it does, and may become huge, much the way that a film like "<a href="../../../e/l/_/El_Mariachi_5209.html" title="El Mariachi">El Mariachi</a>" did. Then the argument of whether this article should be deleted, if it does get deleted, will have seemed unnessecary. So, in closing, I believe this article should be kept. --FreedomHampster 21:45, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>At this point there's nothing that puts your film even in 200 theatres, or 20. It <i>may</i> become a big video hit, but <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>, and we don't cover things which <i>may</i> become notable. If it becomes notable later, the article may be recreated at that time. Right now, it's an unreleased film with no attention, no coverage and no distribution. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 22:02, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

I hope you guys are the next <i>El Mariachi</i>, and when that happens you can count on us to rewrite the article. But if we take the "one day it might be famous" approach, there's no end to it. I'm sure that before he shot a frame Rodriguez spent many hours with buddies and beers kicking the idea around. Before that, it was a vague notion he had on the bus. We can never cover everybody's sudden ideas and back-of-envelope sketches, so we've drawn some lines that we think will let us build a good encyclopedia. Luckily, there's plenty of room on the Internet, so don't be shy about putting your material up elsewhere. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 22:08, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is a film created by a couple of High Schoolers, it is an amature film...therefore expecting that the official site be anything more than a myspace is unreasonable...a website costs a lot of money to run and for an amature film that was not made to make money, a myspace should be plenty. The first festivle is a planned showing, but not the only one, there may be more in the future... {<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.82.175.40 (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.82.175.40.html" title="User talk:71.82.175.40">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.82.175.40_063b.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.82.175.40">contribs</a>) 02:58, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</small></p>
