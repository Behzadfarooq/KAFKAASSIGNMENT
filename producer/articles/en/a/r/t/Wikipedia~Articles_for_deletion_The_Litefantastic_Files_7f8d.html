<p>Time to come clean. I've been here since 2003, and not all my contributions have been... stellar. All the stuff I actually made up was either discovered or turned in by me when I reformed. However, there are still a lot of things I think probably deserve to be evaluated as to whether or not they deserve to live. They are organized alphabetically; articles accompanied by an asterisk have already been to the VfD before, but survived.</p>

<li><b>Merge</b> into <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_King_bf4f.html" title="Stephen King">Stephen King</a>, although that article is growing quickly or perhaps an article on Non-fiction writing by King. This list in question is intersting (I recently expanded it by 8 titles) only in that it shows an element of King's writing beyond the "horror" that he is known for. I'd vote (and participate in) an article dedicated to King's non-fiction writing (which is nearly twice as prolific as his fiction). This could include lists of subject headings for his Entertainment Weekly column, reviews, numerous articles in magazines such as GQ, Playboy, TV Guide, etc. Although, just how valuable are endless lists? <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELACameraman_422d.html" title="User:LACameraman">LACameraman</a> 07:10, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> "List of real people appearing in fictional context", <b>Weak keep</b> "List of mythical and religious beings appearing in fictional context" (which is much, much lower-quality and less interesting, but still has tons of potential if future editors spiff it up). No justification for deletion; "too long" is not a reason, in itself, to completely eliminate a page, and it confuses me that you'd list these with so many much less interesting and valuable pages. There are countless ways to combat excessive length, like subdividing alphabetically, or by work of fiction (i.e. "List of real people appearing in novels", "List of real people appearing in fictional television series", etc.!). -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 02:18, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
