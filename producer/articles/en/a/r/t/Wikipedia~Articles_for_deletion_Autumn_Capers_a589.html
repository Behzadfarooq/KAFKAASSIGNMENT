<p>This is an unsourced article about a high school talent show. It's currently unverifiable, however I think even with sources, it should be deleted for lack of notability. "Notability" is a dirty word to some, but the day that high school talent shows are encyclopedic is the day that Wikipedia is indeed an "indiscriminate collection of information". A tiny bit of it could be merged into the school article, but IMO there's no call for pages of information on this topic. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 19:45, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - In my oppinion, articles this like make Wikipedia what it is. I think the article is very useful. It is not only a tradition at the school, but a long standing tradition in the city of Hialeah. This article should stay.</li>
<li><b>Merge</b>- My Sister went to this high school and I went there for a month before we moved. I still live in the area, and I can tell you that outside of <a href="../../../h/i/a/Hialeah_High_School_a96e.html" title="Hialeah High School">Hialeah High School</a>, the talent show is UNKNOWN. Its not a tradition in the city of Hialeah, because Hialeah has two other schools serving it and students attending those schools don't know about Autum Capers (cause its a Hialeah High Tradition), so maybe its a tradition in the portion of Hialeah served by Hialeah High, and not in the portion served by <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami_Springs_Senior_High_School_6373.html" title="Miami Springs Senior High School">Miami Springs</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/a/Hialeah-Miami_Lakes_Senior_High_School_fbec.html" title="Hialeah-Miami Lakes Senior High School">Hialeah-Miami Lakes</a> High Schools. Autum Capers is just another school talent show that really has no meaning to anyone but its students and alumni. I lived in Hialeah for 10 years and didn't even know about it until my sister went to the school, and then forgot about it as soon as I moved. It's not worth of an entire article, but it is worth having its own section on the Hialeah High Page. <a href="../../../p/r/u/User%7EPRueda29_902e.html" title="User:PRueda29">PRueda29</a> 20:17, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Our article on <a href="../../../h/i/a/Hialeah_High_School_a96e.html" title="Hialeah High School">Hialeah High School</a> covers this at length (of anything, it could do with judicious pruning.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Im the author.There are dozens of articles on Wikipedia, on small things that people come searching for, I dont see what harm having a page about a pretty descriptive and comical talent show at a high school could bother someone. If i did a search for "the alliance of twelve" in Alias, i would find it, although there are dozens of people who dont watch Alias or care about. I just think articles like this are what make wikipedia a personal experience for people. Alexander Prieto--63.211.54.166 23:03, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Autumn Capers doesn't deserve a whole page. Alias is a TV program seen by millions of people around the world, Autumn Capers is an annual talent show no bigger than any other talent show, at any other high school in the US. It doesn't deserve an entire page all for itself as per <a href="../../../i/s/n/WP%7EISNOT_f5c2.html" title="WP:ISNOT">WP:ISNOT</a>. I <b>DO</b> think you should merge the information into the Hialeah High article, though, since its already there and it can be mentioned on there without objection.<a href="../../../p/r/u/User%7EPRueda29_902e.html" title="User:PRueda29">PRueda29</a> 23:11, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Why should an article be deleted just because people don't know about the event? Clearly, people do know about it and claim it to be a big event in the city. Just because you are ignorant and chose not to know about it doesn't mean you should keep others from learning about this event.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There's not need to insult others for their opinions. As for the article, it would benefit better from being merged with Hialeah High School; it'll still be mentioned, just not on its own page.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I've left the author a note suggesting that they create a Wikicities page for their school. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 20:45, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: This sums up the problems with the concept of notability. Autumn Capers is clearly notable to some of the people who go to Hialeah High School, the problem is that it is not <i>verifiable</i> to the rest of us. <a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrollderella_9ec1.html" title="User:Trollderella">Trollderella</a> 20:51, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Honestly, the event is huge in Hialeah High. It consumes like a whole week, and alumni come in to watch it and everything. Then Again, HML and Springs also have talent shows that are huge in their areas and tend to be a huge tradition at the schools, they're not all-consuming like autumn capers is at HHS, but that doesn't merit it its own page, just a nice long mention at the Hialeah High article. <a href="../../../p/r/u/User%7EPRueda29_902e.html" title="User:PRueda29">PRueda29</a> 20:55, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I strongly believe that a local activity which is of no material interest to anyone other than the people currently attending a single educaitonal institution has no real claim to being notable, and any entry about it is necessarily unencyclopaedic as it will be (a) substantially unverifiable to anyone but the particiapnts and (b) highly likely to change with time. Some local institutions spread (<a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby.html" title="Rugby">Rugby</a> football), some become notable due to their longevity (<a href="../../../e/t/o/Eton_Wall_Game_a9a0.html" title="Eton Wall Game">Eton Wall Game</a>), some exert an influence out of all proportion to their scale (<a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge_Footlights_136e.html" title="Cambridge Footlights">Cambridge Footlights</a>). But <a href="../../../i/s/n/WP%7EISNOT_f5c2.html" title="WP:ISNOT">WP:ISNOT</a> an indiscriminate collection of information. There has to be some kind of bar to entry. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> 22:07, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I strongly disagree that things should be excluded because of which group of people is interested in it. We should exclude most of this material because it is unverifiable, not because of who or how many people are interested in it. <a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrollderella_9ec1.html" title="User:Trollderella">Trollderella</a> 00:05, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
