<dd>I'm not trying to sell it - just have a base point with the information about it and links to it. I do the advertising in person, I don't need wikipedia to do it. My article seems unbiased - all it does is state information needed. In the article it mentions that I'm 15. Right now I don't have much provision in the way of non-free website.</dd>

So... I'm gathering by the link is... I could put it on my user page, and just direct my customers there?

<p>So, you're saying I mayn't? This is the exact text I would put there:</p>
<p>* [[Image:divinities.jpg|thumb|right|Front Cover Illustration]] [[Image:divinitiesback.jpg|thumb|right|Back Cover Illustration]]</p>
<p>Luke Sawczak's only achievement so far is his book '''''Divinities''''', a semi-fantasy novel written at the age of 15. He describes it as falling into the "historical fiction, philosophy, and fantasy" categories.</p>
<p>It was published on http://www.lulu.com on November 18th, 2006. Its two editions were published simultaneously. Its content was rated "Everyone" by the author using Lulu.com's standards and the description he gave for it is as follows:</p>
<p>"A plague primarily affecting women has cut down the population. Being that there are less than one hundred in the ravaged, plebeian, Latin country called Aedificia, they are worshipped as gods. Euchris Harandr, a confused, cold and insightful man, is led through his life by various underground people working to balance the genders, and he battles his own conscience and upbringing to try and discover what is right, as well as his religious struggle; concluding with the obliteration of Aedificia and the the starting anew of civilization, perhaps to failure, perhaps to a new life."</p>
<p>As of [[November 20]], [[2006]], the http://www.lulu.com/content/526783 Hardcover Edition] costs $25.14 USD and the [http://www.lulu.com/content/527578 Paperback Edition] costs $15.66 USD, though both editions can be downloaded for $8.00 USD each (as a [[PDF]] document).</p>
<p>I'll take your next answer as the final one on whether or not I may use any aspect, shape or form of Wikipedia to redirect my customers and give them the information about my book. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Lsawczak (<a href="../../../l/s/a/User_talk%7ELsawczak_a9d1.html" title="User talk:Lsawczak">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lsawczak_7803.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lsawczak">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>That exact text is commercial advertising to entice people to spend money on your product.

You're answering evasively, but I'll comply. One last clarification is that I did not intend the page to persuade anyone to buy the book, but rather that the only people to see the page would be people that already knew about the book from me in person and were looking for a method of buying it. Thanks for your focussed attention. I'll withdraw now. Delete the article as soon as you like. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Lsawczak (<a href="../../../l/s/a/User_talk%7ELsawczak_a9d1.html" title="User talk:Lsawczak">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lsawczak_7803.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lsawczak">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>I'm being far from evasive. I don't think I can be any clearer. Wikipedia is not a place for you to advertise yourself and/or your products. It isn't for your personal commercial use. If you want your friends to know how to purchase the book, send them to lulu.com. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy"><font color="green"><b>IrishGuy</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishguy_9a49.html" title="User talk:Irishguy"><font color="blue"><i>talk</i></font></a></sup> 03:55, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b>: completely non-notable, self-advertising, COI and spamming. Maybe should be deleted immediately under G11. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 07:23, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>"I'm being far from evasive. I don't think I can be any clearer." - Well, you could have directly answered my directly-asked question* instead of restating your previous generalization...</p>
<ul>
<li>("whether or not I may use any aspect, shape or form of Wikipedia to redirect my customers and give them the information about my book.")</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you see what I mean?... you didn't link your answer with my question. Tis like someone saying, "Is President A going to remain in office?" and getting the reply, "I heard that President B has some policies on cats." If there was a connection, "The thing which people hate most about President A is his policies on cats," then the other person's reply would have been an answer to the first person's question... ...but no matter.</p>

<li><b>Delete,</b> because it is not sufficiently notable and really for no other reason. Self-publishing is irrelevant--who cares who published it if it's notable enough. I think Lsawczak is trying to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">act in good faith</a>, but is just unclear on wikipedia 's purpose and policies. Considering the dates for his <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lsawczak_7803.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lsawczak">user account contributions</a>, we should probably remember to avoid <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">biting the newbies</a>.
