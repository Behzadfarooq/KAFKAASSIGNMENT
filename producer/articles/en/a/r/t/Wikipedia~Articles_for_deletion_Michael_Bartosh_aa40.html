<p>I hate to AfD an article right after the subject's died, but this page seems to be a memorial. It was created just after the death, and is the only page the author has edited. I don't think the subject is notable, but I'm hoping some people who know more about computers than me will have some more informed opinions.

<dd>True. That's actually the criterion I meant to use. I did spend about 10 minutes searching Google earlier, and I could not find any independent reviews other than those buyer feedbacks on Amazon.com. Wakemp has provided a review though, which is helpful to your case. In any event, I don't feel strongly about the delete, so I'm not going to pointlessly push my case.

<li><b>*Keep*</b> Why? From the guidelines; <i><b>The person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field:</b></i> Within his field of Macintosh support and development, this is absolutely the case - his book 'Essential Mac OS X Panther Server Administration', published by O'Reilly (<a href="../../../o/27/r/O%27Reilly_Media_64bd.html" title="O'Reilly Media">O'Reilly Media</a> of course being considered the quintessential and ultimate source for technical resources) was considered the "bible" and last word on the subject. While it's difficult to provide sources that verify with certainty that he was respected within the community (unless you join the lists he frequented and contributed to), he regularly assisted fellow Macintosh support and development professionals with technical issues and his contribution is vast, articulate, accurate and on the whole, unquestionable. His articles, posts to lists and multiple presentations, seminars and training sessions are most certainly widely recognized within his field and in many cases archived for future reference by the community.<br />

<i><b>Google Test -- Does the subject get lots of distinguishable hits on Google or another well known search mechanism?</b></i> Absolutely. Though there are more hits that are obituary-related now, even before his death, the subject had tens of pages full of unique hits. This is only a man "not notable" to those outside his profession, just as <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marc_Okrand_ff1e.html" title="Marc Okrand">Marc Okrand</a> is not notable to those neither nerd nor linguist. 216.254.21.13 05:37, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>He seems to be notable enough to have an effect on society through computer software, if not than might as well get rid of people like <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_O%27Hea_d6b0.html" title="Charles O'Hea">Charles O'Hea</a> who ever he is. <a href="../../../e/n/l/User%7EEnlil_Ninlil_fcee.html" title="User:Enlil Ninlil">Enlil Ninlil</a> 09:44, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
