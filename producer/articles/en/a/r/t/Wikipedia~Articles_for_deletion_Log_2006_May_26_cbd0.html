<li>How kind of you not to view this as <b>information for journalists</b>. You act like I live off words, not money! I need advertising from someone else, someone in control of the airwaves, not <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>, quite frankly. What makes you so powerful? I know of nobody that was obscure, and was helped by a Wikipedia article. Journalists in July will need to access this information all of a sudden, information about TTF-Bucksfan and the Fifth World Council, real world organisations, with real world people working for them, but if they make any comment about the information that is lacking, I'll tell them, <b>on national TV</b>, that <b>Wikipedia isn't really an encyclopedia</b>, and it isn't. It is just a bunch of envy-filled geaks that will talk about something when it already is, and thus they don't help democracy or global positive change in any way. They don't exist at all, for the purposes of democracy or positive global change through information, because the information you'll find there you can find elsewhere, and it is probably less biased. Wikipedia really doesn't deserve its nonprofit status. What makes a flat in Hurstville, Australia (read <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantium.html" title="Atlantium">here</a>), and that's all it is, more important than an Intercontinental Internet like the Cesidian Root, and the latter is just a corporation of my nation? Anyway, I won't give <b>nothing</b>, nothing at all to Wikipedia and its bosses, when I start that country out of thin air soon, and being a <b>Wikipedia Admin</b> won't get you a citizenship either! You won't be considered a <b>professional</b>, good enough to meet the standards of the Micronational Professional Registry, because if a professional information administrator thinks that the Cesidian Root doesn't deserve an article, but <a href="../../../o/p/e/OpenNIC_4d82.html" title="OpenNIC">OpenNIC</a>, a total joke, does, then <b>anyone can run a Wikipedia</b>, even I! I'm not breaking any rules here, or proposing articles that aren't already found in the Wikipedia, so if you are going to ax TTF-Bucksfan, then I demand you axe <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantium.html" title="Atlantium">Atlantium</a>, and virtually all the articles <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_micronations.html" title="List of micronations">here</a>.

<li><b>(Weakish) Keep</b>. I <i>don't</i> think this article suffers from any inherent POV problems any more than any other article about a fictional location or locations. (I mean, what? If a character is a superhero or supervillain, and has a secret hideout, that strikes me as extremely straightforward -- not a lot of room for POV there, at least not when compared to many other topics...) I'm not really sure how relevant or useful a list like this is, but secret hideouts, bases and headquarters <i>are</i> a long-standing staple of the genre, and many of them are fairly famous. I'm not really a big fan of "list of..." articles in general, but if List of teenage stoner movies is considered to be relevant, I don't see why this wouldn't be. (Not that I subscribe to the "well, we already have &lt;crap A&gt;, so we might have &lt;crap B&gt; as well" idea, either, but you get my point.) Obviously, the article is going to be in need of work and organization, but that's a separate issue. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 00:49, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I ABSOLUTELY think List of teenage stoner movies should be AfD'd.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Well, it's POV because... really, who are we to decide that someone is a supervillain? Maybe to someone, a teenage stoner maybe, he's a superhero. And don't get me started on the negative connotations of "hideout." This should be called "Differently powered individuals' workplaces." PS: <b>Delete</b>. <b><span style="color: #f33">·<a href="../../../r/o/d/User_talk%7ERodii_6c72.html" title="User talk:Rodii"><span style="color: #669">&#160;rodii&#160;</span></a>·</span></b> 02:16, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Heh! What with the weak keep and all, I don't really disagree all that much with deleting the article, but I'm not quite sure that your analysis of the POV aspects of the article is <i>entirely</i> valid. =) -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 02:28, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'd actually consider Wikipedia's description, or any other encyclopedia's description, a valid starting point, in the same way that I'd consider becoming familar with nuclear physics a valid prerequesite. Even if useful details are scarce, knowing what general approaches have been tried and how well they worked helps immensely when working on a new engineering project. I don't think Wikipedia's articles are a security threat, not because they aren't useful, but because their contents are already public knowledge, making attempts to restrict that information useless. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 14:07, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As the creator of this article, I see no reason for deletion. It is linked from and has links too the Rome: Total War article along with the other Modifications. I wish to know WHAT EXACTLY isn't right so I may correct it. Please be helpful and not petty.</p>
<p>Well as the creator of the mod i can say it is not small, being the 4th or 5th most popular for RTw with around 10000 downloads of all the diferent versions of it. If EB and RTR get articles, then so should mine. And i did not write it, it is not shameless self-advertising, the guy above wrote the article completely on his own initiative. If you feel that only a few RTW mods are deserving of having wiki entries then fine delete the entry for my mod, but my mod is popular, considering it has been around for a much shorter space of time than the other two. Lusted - creator of the mod.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. This reads like an advertising brochure and an installation manual, not a disinterested encyclopedia article. <b>Lusted</b>, if you want this kept, address <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFT_d8e1.html" title="WP:SOFT">WP:SOFT</a> and ensure that content is neutral and not advertorial in tone. Addressing negatives as well as positives in the article content is always a good start, IMO. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_e06e.html" title="User:Col tom">Colon</a><a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_Esperanza_bb00.html" title="User:Col tom/Esperanza"><font color="green">el</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_e06e.html" title="User:Col tom">Tom</a> 11:34, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Very, well, i will aks the person who wrote the article to make it more neutral in tone and add in negatives. I can understand any reasoning behind the move to deletion and apologise for the admittedly advertising tone of the article, even though i did not write it. - Lusted</p>
<p>EDIT: there, i've shortened the article down, reduced the advertising tone of it, the download links, the features list and added in a large negative aspect section. Is there anything more i can do to reduce the advertising tone of it? And im not sure what you meant by Wiki Soft, im only here because of the guy who created my article, and am new to the whol Wiki thing. - Lusted</p>
<p>Okay, if ound what you meant be Wiki soft, but as i've removed the links to the download servers for the mod, that should make the article comply with it shouldn't it?</p>
<p>DO NOT DELETE</p>

I do not think that there really is a good reason to delete it. There is nothing wrong with a small article about a mod. Quote: This is shameless self-advertising for a rather small mod for Rome: Total War</p>
<p>Totally wrong. This is not shameless self-advertising at all, and TE is not a small mod for RTW. If it were it wouldnt be in the Major Modifications Forum, and people wouldnt call it a Major Mod. -Hader, long time Player of TE</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Although the mod may be active and is widely played by a good section of the RTW community, the entire article reads like an advertisement, as stated above. If the mod's developers want to have an article for it, they can appeal, and rewrite the article for their mod in an unbiased way. For now, I believe that a delete is reasonable for the momment. - <a href="../../../x/x/5/User%7EXX55XX_7f22.html" title="User:XX55XX">XX55XX</a> 18:39, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, i've tried to make the article less biased, i've removed quite a lot from it and added in a negatives section, comments on how to make it more fair would be appreciated, and i will try to rewrite it make it sound less like an advertisement. - Lusted</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Lusted, I know very well that you are one of the developers of this mod, but if you want an article for your mod, make a it short, give pros and cons for the mod, and learn how to edit articles in general. There are instructions on how to edit Wikipedia. I assure that with some practice, you'll be writing your own articles that will be excepted by the community. Also, making a factions page for your mod is totally un-needed, as it can put into the current article. Throw in a description, include some features, a factions list, and official links. But remember, make it look professional and make it unbiased on your part. Thus, only then will an article be accepted by the community. But for now, I believe that deletion is imminent, so you can create a new page for your mod in the future. - <a href="../../../x/x/5/User%7EXX55XX_7f22.html" title="User:XX55XX">XX55XX</a> 20:02, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes it looks like it is. I qwould like to remind you i did not make this article, or the factions list, i have only edited it since it was written, and have tried to rewrite it to make it less of an advertisement, but i can only do so much as i am bound to be biased, though i will have a go at writing a new unbiased version of this article at some point.</p>
<p>Why should it be deleted soon if it is changed by Lusted to be a nonbias article? To me there is no point in deleting it if it will soon be changed. My suggestion, just keep it around and let Lusted change it. Then do what you must.-Hader</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I hate to say keep, but if Wikipedia has a list of movies that use the f-word, why not a list of songs about poop? I just might create a list of songs about butts to go along with it. The existence of such songs says something about the culture that produced them.

<p>Article was already put up for speedy deletion as spam, but the author responded with {hangon}, then removed that tag entirely. I suppose the article makes some claims to notability, what with the use of words "world-renowned" and whatnot, but as far as I can tell, it's just another fetish site among thousands and thousands. (It does have an Alexa rank of 55,772, which isn't terrible, but I don't think that's terribly notable for a porn site, either.) Furthermore, the fact that the article is apparently being created by the site's owner gives this one huge NPOV problems... and I'm not a fan of advertising in Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 02:03, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you want to create an article about a photographer, you go right ahead and create an article about a photographer. Right now you're advertising a porn site that apparently features his pictures, which is a whole different thing. As for being the Hugh Hefner of Europe... well, "Denys Defrancesco" gets about 16,300 Google hits, whereas "Hugh Hefner" gets 2,950,000. I think those numbers pretty much speak for themselves. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 02:07, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For the record, the Denys Defrancesco article was started <i>after</i> this one went to AfD, so saying that we already have one may be a little misleading. (That said, I do believe the guy is easily notable enough to merit an article, although it is very, very true that right now it's nothing more than a puff piece. I don't think the creator is all that familiar with Wikipedia yet, but I have <a href="../../../d/e/n/Talk%7EDenys_Defrancesco_7f6b.html" title="Talk:Denys Defrancesco">given him instructions</a> and hopefully he makes the changes.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The unbelieving editors on Wikipedia, such as Arbustoo, do not have the integrity or maturity to allow such an entry to stay on Wikipedia without distorting and perverting it beyond recognition. Given enough time, he and the others, who have a similar reputation for biased editing by trying to defame Christians, would only remove pertinent information, while opining on some 8th grade fight in the lunch room or editorializing about some alleged, college experimentation, ruining the article, and further lowering the overall integrity of Wikipedia. Therefore, it is certainly best if we delete this article. --Brian Faulken 06:47, <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_27.html" title="May 27">27 May</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (UTC)

<li>Sorry, copyvio has to be from a commercial website, not a HS or a HS district website.

<p>This may very well fall under speedy deletion, but I thought I'd go for a regular article for deletion request since the article has somehow been able to survive for over six months. Anyway, this appears to be either a biography of a non-notable person, a hoax, or a combination of both. It doesn't seem to make much sense either. But like I said, this article has survived for six months; did it just go unnoticed or is there something I'm missing? <a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">joturn</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">r</a> 03:30, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well the only significant thing he did as an individual is inherit things from his father (3rd par.) Everything else he did in a group, albeit sometimes small groups. I don't think it's notable to be "<i>among the barons</i> supporting the claims of Robert Curthose against his brother Henry I" (emphasis added). If you can explain to me why he's notable enough to keep as anything other than a redirect, then I'll change my vote.

<p><b>delete;</b> this thing looks like toy boat. i think someone upload to make look like real boat but made a hoax instead --RoF 03:41, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The article is genuine, and so is the photo. Just follow the links at the bottom to see proof. If you think that the image "looks like a toy boat," you might want to double click it and see if you still think that. You could also look at an older version of the image and see that it is an Official U.S. Navy Photograph of USS <i>Rankin</i> (AKA-103). Except for the number on the bow, the <i>Rankin</i> looks almost identical to all the other <i>Tolland</i> class AKAs. I airbrushed away the <i>Rankin's</i> hull number (compare the two versions of the photos) to avoid someone thinking that the photo and the article didn't match. Sorry if someone thinks it looks like a "toy boat." I do not think that it does. And is questioning a photo any reason to delete an entire authentic article? <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 03:57, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Agreed, there is not much information on the page right now; the word for that is "stub". I started the page because I read lots of references to Ken Leistner in various places and could not find a food source of information, so decided that starting a stub in Wikipedia would be a good way to cause</li>
<li>The "no such thing as a famous chiropractor" is a cheap shot. Leistner is not noteworthy because he's a chiropractor, but because of his writing.</li>
<li><a href="../../../f/b/b/User%7EFbb_fan_c791.html" title="User:Fbb fan">fbb_fan</a> makes an excellent point: Leistner is well known within the community. The fact that he is not well known outside of those in the know is not an argument for deletion - it's an argument for the article existing! Tjic 01:55, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. If it's a cheap shot, it's that of the editors of the article, who thought that Leistner's status as a chiropractor was such a noteworthy part of who he was that they made it the first thing in the article as of the date I write this comment. If Leistner is notable for something else, then that, rather than his chiropracty practice, should be the first thing in the article. Like I said, he could be notable, but the article as currently written doesn't make that case. How long do we have to keep the stub waiting for someone aware of Leistner's supposed notability to demonstrate it through an effective edit? As it is, the only articles linking to the Leistner article are of questionable notability themselves. -- FRCP11 04:35, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. If your objection to the article is the position of the chiropracter mention, perhaps a better solution might be to edit the article to come up with a more appropriate ordering, rather than deleting the article. Anyone can edit, after all, so feel free to change it (or at least discuss it on the discussion page). Though as I mentioned previously, if you read the entire article (which isn't that long, as you have observed), it's clear that his notability lies elsewhere. <a href="../../../f/b/b/User%7EFbb_fan_c791.html" title="User:Fbb fan">fbb_fan</a> 10:58, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. My objection to the article is that it describes someone who isn't notable. Someone complained that I described Leistner as a chiropractor, and I simply noted that what I know about Leistner I know from the article written by his fans. I have no desire to edit an article about someone whose fans aren't even willing to make a persuasive verifiable case about his notability. What I see so far is a chiropractor/personal trainer who writes a column for a non-notable magazine and co-owned a gym for six years. By that standard, I could include a hundred <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_Law_Review_4973.html" title="Harvard Law Review">Harvard Law Review</a> editors who've invested in their spouses' retail establishments. A couple of posters insist that he's "well-known in the community," but no one provides a cite for that, so it flunks <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>: personal experience doesn't bootstrap someone, and I haven't written a Wikipedia article about <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Stone_deaa.html" title="Ron Stone">Ron Stone</a> just because he's my second-favorite local <a href="../../../k/p/r/KPRC-TV_5f88.html" title="KPRC-TV">newscaster from my youth</a>.

<dd>There was a "cite" for it already. It was noted that he was a regular columnist for Powerlifting USA for 20+ years, has had a regular column in Milo for 13 years, was a columnist for Hardgainer, etc. It's not "personal experience" to mention these things. <a href="../../../d/s/r/User%7EDsreyn_6c32.html" title="User:Dsreyn">Dsreyn</a> 14:39, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. The guy who writes the column at the back of D.C. Lawyer magazine (circulation tens of thousands) for the last twenty years isn't notable, because even if the magazine is notable (and no editor yet thinks it's notable enough for its own entry), the columns aren't. Lots of non-notable poker players write columns for <s>non-notable</s> apparently notable poker magazines like <s><a href="../../../c/a/r/CardPlayer_c4a6.html" title="CardPlayer">CardPlayer</a></s> <a href="../../../c/a/r/Card_Player_Magazine_2c52.html" title="Card Player Magazine">Card Player Magazine</a>. Shouting to the rooftops that someone writes for a magazine whose own notability is in question is simply proving my point. Lots of dreck gets published because it's cheap to publish magazines that are mostly advertising. What stories did these magazines (and more importantly to this discussion, Leistner) break? What was their circulation? Were Leistner's columns advertised as a reason to buy the magazine? -- FRCP11 14:49, 1 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b>. Saying that the notability of these magazines in question is rather disingenuous, since you seem to be the only one questioning their notability at the moment. As far as advertising, Milo has none other than the inside and back covers, and Hardgainer had virtually none (a page or two per issue), so your claim that "it's cheap to publish magazines that are mostly advertising" doesn't apply to either. <a href="../../../d/s/r/User%7EDsreyn_6c32.html" title="User:Dsreyn">Dsreyn</a> 16:57, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Please <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. The notability of <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milo_magazine.html" title="Milo magazine">Milo magazine</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardgainer_%28magazine%29.html" title="Hardgainer (magazine)">Hardgainer (magazine)</a> and the red-linked <a href="../../../p/o/w/Powerlifting_USA_16d3.html" title="Powerlifting USA">Powerlifting USA</a> is legitimately questionable, especially given the failure of its supporters to demonstrate otherwise in response to my questions. If you want lots of people questioning their notability instead of just me, I can put them through the AfD process instead of just putting up an <i>importance</i> tag, and you would see lots of Delete votes. I'm doing you a favor by giving the two or three supporters a chance to fix the articles. -- FRCP11 17:04, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Advert for newly published first novel. No sign it's had the slightest impact on the literary world, and seems to be the sole product of its publisher, "Raise the Bar Press" -- in other words, self-published. Was Prod'ed, but tag removed by author with the comment <i>Book meets several notability criteria: ISBN, Wikipedian availablity (Google Book, Keplers)</i>. Doesn't seem to be available from Amazon.com, though. (The Kepler's reference is to a bookstore in <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palo_Alto%2C_California_ddd0.html" title="Palo Alto, California">Palo Alto, California</a>, where the author will be appearing in September as part of the store's "local and new authors" series.<a href="http://www.keplers.com/?sec=programs-events&amp;subsec=grassroots-tuesdays" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.keplers.com/?sec=programs-events&amp;subsec=grassroots-tuesdays" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>.

Secondly, it's an utterly irrelevant laughable pseudo-legal argument, since the point of the noting the lack of Amazon sales is not as an sort of requirement, but as an illustration of the lack of notability -- and a direct counterargument to claims of "availability".</li>

<p><b>Author response</b></p>
<p>Hello all, It is clear that this group takes its role as the guardians of the sanctity of Wikipedia very seriously. That is to be commended. As the author of Doublethink, I thought it would be helpful to address some the misconceptions that have been posted here.</p>
<p>I wrote the book to help build bridges in our very polarized country in order to get people of different political perspectives talking to each other again. In the fall of 2005, I was going through the normal route of talking to publishers and agents, when one of the agents explained that even if we got a deal the next day it would be 18 months before the book would hit the streets. Given that I felt the book could enhance the discourse around the 2006 election cycle, I CHOSE to self-publish instead.</p>
<p>As to your concern about quality, the book has been carefully vetted by over 60 readers over the course of its development. Many of them are published authors, professional writers, and industry leaders. I also worked with a professional editor in NY who used to work for the big publishing houses. Dr. Conlon did the copy editing as a favor to me because of our tight production schedule. Perhaps if you read the book yourselves, you would see that it is well-written, thoughtful, and provocative.</p>
<p>Clearly quality is often a matter of taste. These are two examples of works by self-published authors you feature on the site, that might not make the cut for me but others might reasonably disagree. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebus_the_Aardvark" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebus_the_Aardvark" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebus_the_Aardvark</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elfquest" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elfquest" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elfquest</a></p>
<p>I also CHOSE not to sell the book on Amazon. I feel they have been responsible for many of ills of the modern publishing trade just as I chose to print the book in the U.S. because I felt it made an important statement that was consistent with the message of the book.</p>
<p>As a marketing professional, I am experimenting with non-traditional ways to communicate with prospective readers and encourage reasonable discussion and debate. I do not view Wikipedia as a promotional outlet in that I don’t see it generating many sales but rather as a forum to encourage discourse on the subject of responsible government.</p>
<p>After all, The WikiProject Novels states “It also aims to encourage and promote the writing of articles on all types of Novels.”</p>
<p>It does not specify ONLY novels by famous authors or only books sold on Amazon nor does it say that ONLY long-time Wiki participants are permitted to post articles.</p>
<p>For example, Jennifer Government, also not a well-known work, is linked from the Nineteen Eighty Four page. It takes a neutral tone but was clearly written by an insider. I used this page as a model for my article&#160;: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Government" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Government" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Government</a></p>

I welcome your suggestions as to how to improve this article so that it would be considered appropriate for inclusion on the site.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I would suggest that the two articles you pointed out might have some issues, but they also have substantial references that give them a basis for notability. Should your novel reach that point, I'm sure that someone will be more than happy to replace the article at that time. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> 18:13, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Advice</b>. If you can make sure the novel gets multiple independent reviews in respectable newspapers or magazines, or notable awards (including winning the <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulwer-Lytton_Fiction_Contest_bd16.html" title="Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest">Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest</a>), you can rest assured that it may have its own article. We wish you and your novel all the best, but the nomination for deletion is regardless of the qualities of the novel; what we need is evidence of its reception (good or bad). --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 18:25, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thank you for the comments and encouragement but I am afraid I am confused. I thought the nomination for deletion was based on the assertion that it was an inappropriate advertisement, which it is not. If the issue is notability as defined by a certain number of mainstream reviews and literary awards, then I would recommend including that it on your FAQs. If it really is the case, I fear it would be necessary to remove many of the books which currently have articles on the site. It's incredibly difficult to get reviews in the Times, etc. and if you look at the publishing oriented sites, you'll learn that very few books get more than a few reviews. I've received one so far.</p>
<p>I haven't yet posted all the favorable responses to the book that I have received, but here is a small sample:</p>

<p>Doublethink presents a frightening and convincing scenario of how the world might look with a right wing philosophy taken to the extreme.

<p>As a conservative Republican who served at a Cabinet-level position within a Republican administration [at the state level], I found J.E.

The political facts inherent to Joe’s life stimulate one to privately self-examine their own beliefs and to come to terms with these facts, even if the decision is “not” to come to terms with Joe’s life. A story from which we all can gain insight.<br />

<dd>He coined the term "postanarchism", which seems like a pretty good start. I'd see him as passing BIO as a published author whose work has been reviewed, and "The person is known for originating an important new concept, theory or idea" for originating the term postanarchism and being one of the most notable scholars in the field. I wouldn't say that Todd May doesn't deserve an article as well. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 05:52, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There are some ambiguities in BIO when it comes to academics, which is why PROFTEST has been proposed. Even if Newman invented the word 'postanarchism' (which I doubt but am not going to try to disprove) the idea in question about poststructuralist anarchism has was clearly invented by Todd May, whose book on the subject came out while Newman was still a grad student and hadn't published anything. <span style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none"><a href="../../../m/g/e/User%7EMgekelly_7b5b.html" title="User:Mgekelly">mg</a></span><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../m/g/e/User_talk%7EMgekelly_f99d.html" title="User talk:Mgekelly">kelly</a> 06:21, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't know enough about Todd May to say what of his theoretical insights are "new", but I'd doubt it's all simple rehash. I definitely think he has enough weight in his field to merit inclusion. For instance, <i>From Bakunin to Lacan</i> gets 10 citations on Google Scholar <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=link:6uL9ck1XYesJ:scholar.google.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=link:6uL9ck1XYesJ:scholar.google.com/" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=link:s-khD1mExbQJ:scholar.google.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=link:s-khD1mExbQJ:scholar.google.com/" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> Additionally, one writer wrote a peer reviewed journal article specifically in response to him <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/cgi-bin/access.cgi?uri=/journals/postmodern_culture/v014/14.3smith.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://muse.jhu.edu/cgi-bin/access.cgi?uri=/journals/postmodern_culture/v014/14.3smith.html" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, which also indicates a fair degree of notability in the field. Anyway, PROFTEST isn't even an accepted guideline, so it's hardly a good tool in determining deletion. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 06:38, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's why I cited BIO as well as PROFTEST. The thing is if you pick up lines like "books receiving reviews" from BIO out of context, it makes every academic elligible for a page. Having an article about you published in a peer-reviewed journal is also small fry for an academic - certainly if the journal in question is <i>Postmodern Culture</i>! If it were in <i>Economy and Society</i>, I'd back down! From Googling, I think this guy gets more attention from the anarchist community than the scholarly community, and he's manifestly not of a level within the anarchist community to merit a Wikipedia article, so basically the guy's <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">non-notable</a>. <span style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none"><a href="../../../m/g/e/User%7EMgekelly_7b5b.html" title="User:Mgekelly">mg</a></span><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../m/g/e/User_talk%7EMgekelly_f99d.html" title="User talk:Mgekelly">kelly</a> 06:52, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd><i>Postmodern Culture</i> is probably the most well known periodical related to postmodernism. Which is to say, he has a degree of notability among people in that field, which is clearly a much smaller field than that covered by <i>Economy and Society</i>. And he is fairly well known (if not entirely popular or revered) amongst anarchists, which is only to say his notability shouldn't be determined solely by his achievements as an academic. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarge_Baldy_6bdd.html" title="User:Sarge Baldy">Sarge Baldy</a> 07:02, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Although, as I say, Newman is unusual in publishing so much so early in his career, publishing two books on reputable presses is par for the course for <i>any</i> contemporary academic within the first decade or so of activity. If this allows for inclusion, most academics will get articles. The reason I think that this shouldn't lead to academics is that academic book publications are typically bought mainly by university libraries and have readerships barely in triple figures, hence do not indicate true notability. <span style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none"><a href="../../../m/g/e/User%7EMgekelly_7b5b.html" title="User:Mgekelly">mg</a></span><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../m/g/e/User_talk%7EMgekelly_f99d.html" title="User talk:Mgekelly">kelly</a> 16:43, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Here is an example&#160;:Richard Rhodes describes the NKVD evacuation murders of imprisoned political enemies in his book on Ensatzgruppen killings, Masters of Death: The SS-Einsatzgruppen and the Invention of the Holocaust:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>“Despite the deportations, Barbarossa surprised the NKVD, whose jails and prisons in the invaded western territories were crowded with political prisoners. Rather that release their prisoners as they hastened to retreat during the first week of the war, the Soviet secret police had simply slaughtered them. NKVD prisoner executions in the first week after Barbarossa totaled some ten thousand in the western Ukraine and more than nine thousand in Vinnitsa, eastward toward Kiev; comparable numbers of prisoners were executed in eastern Poland, Byelorussia, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. These areas had already sustained losses numbering in the hundreds of thousands from the Stalinist purges of 1937-38. “It was not only the numbers of the executed,” historian Yury Boshyk writes of the evacuation murders, “but also the manner in which they died that shocked the populace. When the families of the arrested rushed to the prisons after the Soviet evacuation, they were aghast to find bodies so badly mutilated that many could not be identified. It was evident that many of the prisoners had been tortured before death; others were killed en masse.” In some cases, cells crowded with prisoners had been dynamited, badly mutilating the remains.” As you see this wasn't the Katyn Massacre.--<a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">Molobo</a> 14:52, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> as per the missed arguments of the nominator. 1) and 2): this is not about the Katyn massacre, but about the Soviet cleaning-up of their prisons during and immediately after the German invasion.

<dd>The problem is not only referencing, but the POV style too ("execution" is preferable to "massacre"). And most important, the title is too broad, because it deals with only a specific period of time and a specific place.

You see I'm a journalist for an entertainment in my country and I don't have much time for typing an article about this band.

<li>(This is a copy of the argument I posed to Mr. Dashiell) I can understand your claims that it is nothing but a vanity article, but would like to dispute that. I simply like to keep a running summary of the comics history in an easily readable, editable, and accessable format. Wikipedia is all that and more. Yes, I am the comic's author, but I have tried my hardest (and imho, succeeded) to write from a neutral point of view. As for the notability issue, there are plenty of webcomics listed that may or may not be less "notable" than Bench 37.<a href="../../../d/u/s/User%7EDustin_S_85a1.html" title="User:Dustin S">Dustin Sanders</a> 1:26 p.m., May 26 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Not notable. Try a Google for "Bench 37" and almost every link is irrelevent.

<li>I created the page. A few things:</li>
</ul>
<p>1. This is not the final product for the page. There are several additions that will justify its existence, I noted that on the discussion page, patience is a virtue and there will be enough information for its existence if you give me the time. 2. Eastern Suburbs are still registered within the NRL but their marketing name has changed to the Sydney Roosters, while they were known as Eastern Suburbs during that time this is highlighted on the page, furthermore all references to Eastern Suburbs RLFC is linked to the Sydney Roosters wikipedia site. 3. This page also with the other seasons is linked onto the Sydney Roosters page. 4. If someone is willing to make a NSWRL 1909 season etc page I am more than willing to back down from this. However my efforts are concentrated soley on the Sydney Roosters, one of the largest and the oldest club in Australia. If someone was willing to help me with a NSWRL 1909 season page I'd direct my attention to that, but that task is too big in itself.</p>
<p>My goal is to build the Sydney Roosters wikipedia site to be the most comprehenisve rugby league club site of all, and to make it one of the most comprehensive wikisites altogether. This ties in with that.</p>
<p>If you give me more time, additions will follow.Cheers. Sbryce858 06:59, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

It isn't designed to promote my site Heck take my link off then. But how many people know what is considered to be a Disney Mountain Ride. some people think other rides and attractions inside of any of the Disney Themem parks should be considered a Mountain Ride and That is not true.

<p>First, I appreciate that on first blush, this may be on the edge of what is clearly defined by the guidelines, however I appreciate your considering my view as to why it should be included. I did read the original notice of deletion prior to creating this entry, and agree that to create an entry 2 days after the sites launch was extremely premature, and I would have recommended it for deletion had I been around at that point. I feel that there is enough here presently to merit inclusion, both based the quality of this entry as well as in the track record of this project. Note that I am actively fleshing out this entry as I am able to collect information.</p>
<p>The intent of this entry isn't advertising, rather my intention is to provide relevant information about a project that I think represents the best of what the internet is all about. Free literary content in a time when long established SciFi sites are closing down (for example <a href="http://scifi.com/scifiction/" class="external text" title="http://scifi.com/scifiction/" rel="nofollow">SciFi.com</a>). For people interested in Flash Fiction, Speculative Fiction and easily accessible Science Fiction, the content here exemplifies all three. There is currently only superficial information available about the authors, and my intention is to provide more in-depth bios here. The content is being translated independently into multiple languages and being reposted around the world by people who have been inspired by the content itself. I think that in this era where online publication of quality fiction is fast becoming as relevant as print publishing, this site represents a significant and ground breaking contribution to the Science Fiction and Flash Fiction genre, and as such, deserves to be included here. --Ssmith@alignsoft.com 14:25, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

When I discovered 365 last fall, I looked here to find more information about the project and the writers, and didn't find any. I'm trying to rectify that now, and I'm a little unclear on what constitutes notability. The site has been specifically noted in print in Popular Science magazine, as well as unsolicited mentions online from the likes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Ellis" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Ellis" rel="nofollow">Warren Ellis</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_doctorow" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_doctorow" rel="nofollow">Cory Doctorow</a>, both signicant members of the literary community, and both with their own entries on this site. The authors are being invited to large SciFi conventions to speak as panelists, which I think legitimizes what they're doing. One of the authors has content in print in a brick and mortor retailer, and another has a book of short stories available in paperback online, a format that authors like Cory Doctorow have embraced as being a viable means of distribution. --Ssmith@alignsoft.com 15:03, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Herein lies my confusion - the guideline here: The barometer of notability is whether people independent of the subject itself (or of its manufacturer, creator, or vendor) have actually considered the content or site notable enough that they have written and published non-trivial works that focus upon it. ^ Examples: The webcomic When I Am King has been reviewed by The Guardian, Playboy, The Comics Journal, and Wired.</p>
<p>If this is an indication of notability, then shouldn't having been reviewed in Popular Science meet the standard here?</p>
<p>If a webcomic like 'When I Am King' rates an entry, I don't see how 365 does not. If you look at the Alexa data for the 2 sites, demian5.com (the host of wheniamking) rates 768,036, while 365 rates 341,431 --Ssmith@alignsoft.com 15:22, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well - it looks like I'm on the losing end of this discussion, and i must say I'm disappointed. There doesn't seem to be much to do at this point but give in to the inevitable.</p>
<p>If this was a commercial site flogging a product, then I wouldn't be here trying to make note of them. Rather this is what I think should be a model for literary distribution on the internet, and an excellent example of the free sharing of meaningful ideas. With so many people flogging crap, I think this stands head and shoulders above the examples I think you're lumping it in with. When I stumbled onto it last fall it was single handedly responsible for inspiring me to start writing again after a 10 year hiatus. I think that if you spent some time reading the content there you'd appreciate the value and might be a little more receptive to my trying to put the project and it's authors into a more formal context.</p>
<p>I must say that the fact that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_I_Am_King" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_I_Am_King" rel="nofollow">When I Am King</a> rates an entry, and this does not simply blows my mind.</p>
<p>If I'm to understand correctly, another mention in a tangible publication of some significance is enough to meet the burden here? I will bring this back to the table when it does meet your guidelines more completely, and I'd prefer not to waste anyones time.</p>
<p>Thanks for your attention. --Ssmith@alignsoft.com 19:33, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Your comment "this is what I think <i>should be</i> a model for literary distribution on the internet" is very revealing. Whether ot not you are associated with the site, your intent to promote it comes across very strongly. I think that that prompted the unanimous rejection of your article as much as the lack of references.<br />
Wikipedia is not a place to promote anything. It's a place to describe things in a neutral way <i>that don't need promotion.</i> (See <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a> for more information.) And I would suggest that you—and anyone in your position—should contribute to Wikipedia for a while, fixing typos and adding information to existing articles—and thereby getting a good feel for how Wikipedia works, and what it's culture, philosophy and goals are—before starting to create articles about your favorite website, band, author etc. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeStepanek_8612.html" title="User:GeorgeStepanek">GeorgeStepan</a><a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeStepanek_Esperanza_f30c.html" title="User:GeorgeStepanek/Esperanza"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeStepanek_8612.html" title="User:GeorgeStepanek">k</a>\<sup><a href="../../../g/e/o/User_talk%7EGeorgeStepanek_0414.html" title="User talk:GeorgeStepanek"><font color="gray">talk</font></a></sup> 00:45, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is not intended as promotion - it happens that some of the content I felt was relevant and was readily available as a starting point was from their website. You'll notice that I was evolving the entry continually trying to collect more outside information right up the point that it was slapped with a deletion notice. I honestly wasn't aware that i'd find myself defending the validity of the article before i'd had a chance to flesh it out. As for spending more time here, I've been consuming the content for ages, however this is the first time I've actually tried to contribute to it, and it's obviously not going so well. I picked this as it's an entry I went looking for myself not that long ago, and I'm in a position where I can assemble the relevant content. I had thought that what I had to offer here had some value, and I'm sorry you don't seem to agree.</p>
<p>Like I said, there's content in here that's equally if not more questionable as to it's validity and relevance. I do, however, appreciate that you have to be fairly aggressive in your efforts to keep the signal to noise ratio up, so I don't begrudge you this rejection. I think I'd be taking it a bit better if there was some acknowledgement of the fact that I am making an effort to contribute, and if there was some help being offered instead of a page of 'read the rules' and 'Delete' badges. I have no more spare time than I'm sure any of you have, and I've read the rules and thought that I was following at least the spirit of them as the letter is somewhat vague. My field is software development, not law, so I'm used to a little more latitude in the implementation.</p>
<p>In any event, i think this is done. I still would appreciate confirmation that another review in a print publication would meet the burden, and I'd also like someone to acknowledge that 5 authors producing 280+ works of short fiction at least in theory should rate as more respectable than a web comic that's described as 'a wordless infinite canvas webcomic', citing Playboy as one of it's references in print. I'm not being hostile, I'm just a little frustrated and dissappointed, and I hope you can appreciate that.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Now that it is going to be staying for the forseeable future, please provide suggestions and input (on the discussion page?) as to how to make it better. RE: Honorable Mention - Since Zelda Collector's Edition is in strict terms a re-release (which this list tries to avoid, as re-releases are not inherently "special") - this actually WAS a limited release and the methods of obtaining it were notably "special". Although your guess is as good as mine as to how else to show that the game is only on the list for special mention (retitle the header to that?) <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeusfaux_0fe6.html" title="User:Deusfaux">Deusfaux</a> 22:57, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, <s>but recommend ditching the "Superior Editions" and "Special Mention" headers.

<ul>
<li>I'll try again. To make the list discriminate, re-releases (games that get another production run usually at least a year after the original) are not included. That's because so many games get one. Quite often, marketing departments will slap these with names like "special edition" (see: Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition). "Collector's Editions" again, are often just literal collections of games (in a series or with a shared theme). This list tries to only cover games that are actually special or have significant collector value - this is almost always based on the edition's limited availability. Re-releases are not limited in the same sense as something like World of Warcraft Collector's Edition was. However, in the case of Zelda Collector's Edition, while it was a collection of re-releases and thus nothing inherently "special" or "collectible", it's limited production run and method of obtainment make it noteworthy to list here. So basically I was trying to make a way of including games that might not normally be in the list, but deserve a special mention. If you have a better suggestion (starring them or something) please come forward with it. Please see the article's discussion page for further commentary. <a href="../../../d/e/u/User%7EDeusfaux_0fe6.html" title="User:Deusfaux">Deusfaux</a> 15:39, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>I believe the article is useful for those who are interested and are researching topic of russian online music sellers. 'Spamming' is still an issue but if you want I'll stop editing the wiki article on allofmp3 (though I still don't agree it was spam). If you keep 'deleting' this article I'll consider leaving wiki for it's not a fair online resource with 'double standarts'.

<p>This relatively new list is too similar to the well-developed "Notable Figures in Western Films" list.

<p>hi there! First of all, I have to mention that I am new to Wikipedia so would really need some suggestions how to get my article on the list. I have edited the page as suggested. Below the page I have listed their website so I am not sure if I am violating the copyright. Please suggest how can I get this article listed in Wikipedia. Also, I am narrating the website in 3rd person. I am relating the company to Malony Crawford that does not exist any more and was a 100 year old company. Also, I am not associated with the company ..just that being a Tulsa resident wanted to write a lil note about the compoany to get it recognition worldwide. The Company has a few patents on the innovation of process technology that they use to manufacture Heaters. Thanks, -Andy</p>

<li>Hmm... I see this a couple of different ways... I would say... <b>Keep</b> on the grounds that, A: The list DOES discriminate; only songs with 20 words or more are allowed (hence why that Pink Floyd song isn't on there), and B: It IS an interesting list that has taught me something (albeit trivial) about music. It's also certainly fun to show someone, so they may see just how long some artists are willing to make their song titles. However, it is true that MANY things can be made into a list, and if lists like this are typically removed from Wikipedia, then go ahead and <b>Delete</b> this one. Off topic, but I have a backup copy saved for my own enjoyment should the article be deleted, and I recommend everyone who enjoys it do the same while it's still up, cause it looks like it's going to burn. <a href="../../../f/i/c/User%7EFiction_Alchemist_0e1d.html" title="User:Fiction Alchemist">Fiction Alchemist</a> 71.100.15.41 08:08, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

</dl>
<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>.</p>
<p>For its size, this debate is astonishingly good-humoured. Clearly, for me to write a closure that deals with each editor's comments individually is impractical, and would not be useful. Nevertheless, it seems apparent from reading this (yes, I did) that those who would delete really do have things on their side. SlimVirgin's points are easily the best argued reason for keeping, but many of those arguing to keep use, for the most part, arguments that really are just weak. Those who say "we keep sexual perversions and Pokemon" are certainly the weakest: as ever, those points belong in other debates and are not very useful in dealing with <i>this</i> article since they are referencing unrelated topics. Several other "keep" interpretations are successfully rebutted: Jayjg's and Yamaguchi's (the latter urging us to keep based on his/her personal speculations), Zer0faults's, and the key parts of DyslexicEditor's; various editors cite these also. Mackensen appears to be making an obscure point about trolls, and anyway relies on a rebutted argument. Perhaps he means that we should keep it to prove to the more trollish parts of the world that we are able to turn their work against them, but we don't need to prove that to them: we have 1,000,000 articles to show them. Stephen B Streater's is almost self-contradictory and the later editor who relies on it equally so. Dread Lord Cyberskull seems to comment solely on the nomination, rather than taking account of all the editors who went before him. (There are various phrasings of most of these.)</p>
<p>Some of the delete arguments are weak too, though, most particularly that the article is associated with "disruption". SlimVirgin makes a point to Blnguyen that we have many articles about people to which things have happened, and that is an important statement. But the various characterisations as a storm in a teacup, a minor incident, self-referentiality, news reportage are signally unrebutted by anyone; noone even seems to make an attempt to disagree with them. Even, (dare I say it) the (non-)notability of the individual isn't really contested, with no impugning of Phil Sandifer intended. The point in response to DavidGerard's comment is important. If this topic has made multiple headlines (it is unreasonable to use a continuous tense here) in a month, say, then perhaps we can reconsider. In the meantime, if Wikimedia needs to report on this at all, <a href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/" class="extiw" title="wikinews:">Wikinews:</a> is just down the road. Also observe that there remains the possibility of adding part of a sentence in generic terms to some more-obviously useful article about real-life harassment of project volunteers.</p>
<p>Now, I suppose I am about to outrage approximately 41 people, but really I don't think there's a lot of value in a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">Wikipedia:Deletion review</a> at this moment, unless someone really thinks I have this totally wrong and that it needs to be fixed <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">urgently</a>. It got speedied and restored repeatedly (in a rather poor manner), has been through DRV and had probably the most comprehensive, blood-free AfD of any article ever, and trying to turn the handle again right now is unlikely to achieve anything much. I'm not trying to appoint myself as the Final Authority, but the avenues are largely exhausted until such time as something about this shifts so significantly that a large proportion of 108-ish people have their minds changed.</p>
<p>Finally, a procedural note. I didn't participate here, but have followed the debate with interest. I did, some days ago, reverse an early closure of the debate, a course of action supported on the talk page. I don't think that re-opening a debate that (evidently) had reasonable mileage left in it leaves me with a conflict of interest, particularly as I have not otherwise joined the discussion; it was more interesting to follow it as it progressed and weigh the arguments.

<li><b>Rebuttal</b> The subject is barely a published author - based on the works referenced in the wikipedia article, he has written two short articles for an obscure online-only webcomics studies website plus he is co-author of a short 4 paragraph response to someone else's article about comics. The subject has been barely written about by a marginally notable writer - Cory Doctorow writes two brief posts about the police/snuff stories/wikipedia incident on the boingboing blog, which publishes 5-8 new posts or so a day (this might have taken Doctorow perhaps 5 minutes total for both posts); the incident is a very localized and obscure example of thousands and thousands thousands of incidents that are related to issues of academic freedom or freedom of creativity. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 19:32, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><s>*<b>Delete</b>, very interesting story, but not encylopedic...yet anyway.

Phil's story is a bit more mild, but I can see why police might be concerned enough to check it out. On the other hand, Phil also seems to be the victim of harrassment.

<li><b>Keep</b> I originally was gonig to vote delete but then came across about 300+ articles on google talking about the situation and subject. It creates an odd situation when we as Wikipedians need to vote how notable someone we already know is. Oddly enough perhaps while he shouldn't be notable, his presence as a Wikipedia Admin is causing it to spread quickly on the internet. I think people should step back perhaps and not view this as a fellow admin, but as a person on the net that now has over 300+ articles written about not only his comics but also now this police involvement and judge it from there.

<li>If you don't think 400 Google hits is notable, you should be talking to Zer0faults, not me. I was just pointing out where he probably got the "over 300+ articles" figure.

<li><b>Comment</b> Did you or Zer0faults actually read through your supposed 400+ google search results - even just the first couple of pages to check the names? There is more than one "Philip Sandifer" - There are multiple hits for a healthcare executive, a farmer, a transportation engineer and a "hotshot truck driver" character in a 1950s movie ("Daddy-O"), which seems to have the lion's share of hits. Furthermore, many or most of the hits for the Philip Sandifer we're actually talking about appear to be his postings to things like forums, amazon.com, or email listservs <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 23:10, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Further comment</b> The above comment of mine refers to the search for "Phil Sandifier" made by Jayjg and Rory96. "Philip Sandifier" turns up a better search result but there are are many hits for a Christian musician of the same name and also there are numerous hits of the forum/email kind <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 23:22, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>: The slate was wiped clean when the article was transferred? That's good in a way, because here I will say the thing that really bothers me about the article before I offer up the Wikipedia-reason. Stalkers are out for power. They are like rapists, in that what they want is to own the person they're bothering. Having an article about the effects of the stalker's actions would be nothing but sheer joy and reward for the person who wrote the U of F president. Let's not give the arsonist the pleasure of watching the fire. As for the deletion guideline reason, it's pretty simple: charges and allegations are not notability/fame. Phil was accused of being a bad person, and that caused a tempest in a teapot. It is illustrative, and it is interesting, and the article was well written, but it doesn't rise to encyclopedic level. Were Phil kicked out of his program or arrested, then he would become a cause. Essentially, the question is whether this goes beyond the local (and web local ... meaning us) to the regional and whether it represents a new offense or a reiteration of an old one. To me, it does not rise to the level of encyclopedic yet, and we should be happy that it doesn't. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 20:19, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Geogre, we don't know who did this to Phil, so I'm speculating, but my guess is that they're not at all happy with this article, because what they did has backfired, in that they didn't harm Phil at all (the reverse, if anything), and it may backfire even more if this lawyer gets hold of the records. So although I agree with your arsonist reasoning in general, I don't think it applies in this case. In any event, we shouldn't create or delete articles with that kind of thing in mind. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:33, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>One of the votes below is to move to namespace and preserve it in the accounts of stalking. I understand that Phil could have offended folks with some other activity, that it might not have been Wikipedia related, but it seems to me that we only know about this incident because we're Wikipedians and so is he. I.e. I doubt any of us would have encountered the story through the Florida papers. In my own day, we had a director of composition who was having sex in his office during office hours with a 19 year old student while going through a divorce and had advertised for "bi-curious females" to have a threesome and video session with, and his ex-wife leaked all this to the press. It raised a whole raft of interesting ethical and academic questions, and it ran in the newspapers (three of them) for 2 months and made a mention in <i>The Chronicle of Higher Education.</i> Then he got caught double billing the U. and got fired. No one remembers this now, except those there at the time. My point is that my U. refused to act on personal actions and free expression to terminate this guy, so the U. <i>failed</i> to really create news. It was juicy, and it was racy, but the measure of it is after the events have concluded. If we preserved this in a namespace 'tales of stalking' or 'how to save yourself' file, it would be cool. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 23:19, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>To second your point: I think WP must recognize that like a news service, an encyclopedia is an <i>observer</i> (of notable news or facts, respectively). In both cases it is imperative for the neutral observer not to create news or facts while observing, just like in science a good sensing device must not influence the phenomenon being sensed. I think, hard as it may be to resist, WP must have a <i>higher</i> threshold of notability for anything related to itself, lest it create a feedback effect and thereby create new facts by its own reporting action. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 19:11, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think besides from the sources, it's primarily notable as a source of the abuses of schools. For the whole argument over wikipedia admins vs. this or that, well I don't know if that's notable here (sure other websites that collect internet drama would like it), but really to me it's about school abuses and police abuse. I've read many other stories where they've done the same thing (however it's been in high school, middle school, and similar things but not about stories in elementary school like someone accidentally brings a hunting knife to school and school policy says to turn the knife in and that's what the kid did once he got off the bus, but the school suspended him and tried to get him expelled for following its own rules). Schools also basically say kids have no rights of free speech (this sentence is my opinion summary of some news articles I saw). I don't want to dig the articles up, but this story is one example. Sure, enemies will try to defame someone, but how an organization responds to it is but. I once had an ISP with a static IP and I got in an argument with people once and my IP never changed and they sent in fake abuse reports 6-12 months after, constantly and I would disconnect my cable modem and the reports came in when it was actually disconnected, and still the ISP just believed it without checking. Same is for Florida University. Oh well, I rant. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDyslexicEditor_aec8.html" title="User:DyslexicEditor">DyslexicEditor</a> 04:00, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>So why does Phil get an article and your kid who brought his hunting knife to school doesn't? Why don't you, for that matter? This thing about abuses of educational institutions' legal paranoia <i>may</i> be notable (but only when a secondary source runs an article about them, if we try to write an article by collating a load of news stories about different people we're doing <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> by synthesis).

<dd>Bah! Celtophobia ain't a made "up word", and besides, even if it were, the rules by which it is formed are so obvious that it is just a short-hand way of writing a more complicated title.

You can have articles on amateur soccer players and college squash players, but not on a topic like this where shelves and shelves of books have been written.

The top scorer is the wikipedia article, and that has only existed for a few weeks/months.

<dd>I see Calgacus' point though: whatever the name something like "Celtophobia" certainly exists. I have had some nasty experiences in England myself, but I've never been clear whether it was just anti-Welsh or more generally anti-Celt and in the circumstances it wasn't really feasible to enquire. There could be room for a decent article here, but deleting the current article wouldn't stop anybody creating a decent one later on. Rhion 15:02, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>For sure it's a word that has been used, but it's not in either of the online dictionaries I have checked. It's the viability of producing a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a> article I think is the problem, not a definition of it's meaning. It's not the scope of an encyclopedia to be a dictionary, defining the meaning is easy. But is there enough material out there to produce anything other than a stub article? Without verifiable material then it is not a viable article. At the moment it's just a lot of POV, none of which is verified and the article contradicts itself anyway. I can't see it getting any better. Just because something is a <i>concept</i> doesn't automatically qualify it for an article. Just because there are British people who are anti-Welsh or anti-Irish and French people who are anti-Breton (presumably) doesn't necessarily qualify them as <i>Celtophobes</i>. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 15:43, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not getting the verifiability stuff. Any advanced English speaker knows the word is a compound and can work out what it means. And as no-one can possibly deny that prejudice against "Celts" has existed and to a certain extent still exists, the article is fair game. That for me is the bottom line. I hope someone will reopen the article in future, and write something "verifiable". - <b><a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> (<i><a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalgacus_321f.html" title="User talk:Calgacus">ΚΑΛΓΑΚΟΣ</a></i>)</b> 23:42, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You seem to be under the impression that verifiability is the same as definition. Have a look at <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglophobia.html" title="Anglophobia">anglophobia</a>, they are struggling there.<i>Football hooliganism</i> and <i>devolution</i> are just two examples given. Neither of these are <i>Anglophobia</i>, and neither are verifiable as such. How about <i>football-opponent-o-phobia</i> as you think all <i>compound</i> phobias that have a <i>meaning</i> are <i>fair game</i>. The problem is that the <i>Celts</i> are not a discreet ethnic group or nation, so Celtophobia is almost impossible to identify and therefore verify. You cannot claim that every anti-Scottish or anti-Welsh event is <i>Celtophobia</i>, prejudice against one celtic nation is not necessarily a bias against all. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 03:33, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hey, I never claimed that bias against one "celtic" nation is celtophobia, did I? So let's not be arguing over something irrelevant. Moreover, while the status Celts have as one nation may be disputed, the Scots, Irish and Welsh have been linked with the same "scientific origin" (i.e. common language) since at least the 18th century, and thus have been able to generate collective prejudice. They also share, BTW, the status of the non-English of the British Isles, which implies some kind of identity since the 12th century, when the Normano-Angevin monarch of England had a finger in every part of it. While I admire "<i>football-opponent-o-phobia</i>" as a nice attempt at <a href="../../../r/e/d/Reductio_ad_absurdum.html" title="Reductio ad absurdum">reductio ad absurdum</a>, it isn't very relevant, since the first part of the compound is not Greek (nor even Latin), football-opponent is itself an English compound, and football-opponent is not an ethnic group, nor any like group - i.e. nationality, racial group, gender group, disability group - that is likely to be subject to the prejudice (etc) that experience of the suffix -phobia tells any advanced English speaker the suffix -phobia would designate. - <b><a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> (<i><a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalgacus_321f.html" title="User talk:Calgacus">ΚΑΛΓΑΚΟΣ</a></i>)</b> 10:25, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think you missed my point. First my point about football is that agression against English football fans was used in Anglophobia as an example, but agression against supporters of opposing fans is not necessarily relevant to their nationality, your comment about <i>football-opponent-o-phobia</i> is the point as I am making. It was an example of how difficult it is to produce good examples, even with something as well accepted as Anglophobia. Secondly the point about bias against one celtic nation is that in order to get good verifiable sources on <i>Celtophobia</i> one has to find examples of bias against <i>all</i> celtic nations, and the source would have to explicitly claim that this was <i>Celtophobic</i>, bias against a single Celtic nation would not be enough for it to constitute a source for <i>Celtophobia</i>. Your grouping together of some of the <i>Celtic nations</i> does not constitute evidence for <i>Celtophobia</i>, and where do the Bretons figure? If you are arguing that <i>Celtophobia</i> applies to these nations because they are the <i>non-English</i> nations of the British Isles, I would argue that this is <i><a href="../../../x/e/n/Xenophobia.html" title="Xenophobia">xenophobia</a></i>, because they are disliked because of what they <i>are not</i> (ie they are not English), rather than <i>Celtophobia</i>, which would ba a dislike of them because they <i>are</i> Celts. The Normans oppressed everyone, including the English, by the way, and I think 12th century Normans would themselves identify as <i>non-English inhabitants of the British Isles</i>. You don't seem to be addressing my point about verifiability. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 12:13, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wobble/Alun, what's all this stuff about "bias against one celtic nation is that in order to get good verifiable sources on <i>Celtophobia</i>"? This doesn't seem like an appropriate argument addressed at me, as I haven't been saying the opposite. Anyways, there are lots of books about Celtophobia. Perhaps this is just more obvious to me, having read them. One that comes to mind is the rather good <i>Celtic Identity and the British Image</i> , by Murray Pittock. It's not hard to read Celtophobia in action either, just pick up a few history books written in England (or "Lowland Scotland" for instance) dating from the 19th century, or 50 decades before and after, from your local 2nd hand dealer. Or consider <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Pinkerton_cf7b.html" title="John Pinkerton">John Pinkerton</a>. This is Celtophobia, addressed against people identified by the author as Celts. Alun, it is not up to me to deal with the Bretons. In British insular culture they are largely irrelevant, just consider the term "Celtic fringe", perhaps itself a moderate example of (British) "celtophobia". Your problem with this article seems to be the content, rather than the topic. Perhaps someone will come along and write decent content, and he won't need to deal then with any of this "verifiability" stuff which you're so concerned with.
<dl>
<dd>You seem not to understand the proper meaning of the word <i>Celtophobia</i>, though you claim its meaning should be obvious. You appear to be suggesting that it is <i>Celtophobic</i> to dislike only some Celts (eg <i>British</i> Celts), but <i>Celtophobia</i> <b>must</b> include a dislike of all <i>Celts</i> and things <i>Celtic</i> simultaneously. If you exclude <i>Bretons</i> from the list, then it is not <i>Celtophobia</i>, is it? And it is a <i>cop out</i> to evade an answer about Bretons with <i>it is not up to me</i>, because you have chosen to defend the article, so I would suggest that it is indeed up to you. You are talking about Norman/English expansionism, subjugation, cultural domination and ultimately assimilation; and applying an innapropriate <i>label</i>, this did not happen <b>because</b> these people were <i>Celts</i> (as <i>Celtophobia</i> would have it), but because they <i>happened to be in the way</i>, it would have happened to whoever was there, irrespective of whether they were <i>Celts</i> or not. The motivation was a good old fassioned <i>land grab</i>, you are choosing to interpret it as <i>Celtophobia</i>. Yes, you are spot on, my problem is exactly with content, which is what I said right at the start, it is unverifiable and a simple definition is not good enough as this is not a dictionary. It's also worth taking a look at <a href="../../../-/p/h/-phob-.html" title="-phob-">-phob-</a>. The OED online does not have a listing for this <i>phobia</i>, so that's three dictionaries I've checked. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 00:38, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hey, are you now defining the word? It has to include Bretons does it; well, I'm sure it does, in the same way "celtic fringe" includes Britanny. Please do a little reading too of what I've written. Just because a few dictionaries don't have it, doesn't mean it doesn't exist, and just because you've not done any reading, doesn't mean that this article has to be a dicdef. Check <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=celtophobia&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=celtophobia&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" rel="nofollow">google books</a>, it has 6 hits. - <b><a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> (<i><a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalgacus_321f.html" title="User talk:Calgacus">ΚΑΛΓΑΚΟΣ</a></i>)</b> 07:38, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think the 12th century is a bit of a red herring - there was no real concept of "Celt" as such at that time, and as Alun says the Normans didn't really care who owned the land if they wanted it. However there is, as Calgacus says, plenty of 19th century material aimed at Celts in general rather than a specific variety of Celt for a fully verifiable article, though whether the appropriate title would be "Celtophobia" or something else is another matter. It's an interesting subject which should be covered by Wikipedia. Rhion 11:03, 29 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You make a good point, I don't think it is necessarily <i>celtophobia</i> as much as xenophobia. The 19th century was full of misunderstandings/deliberate distortions of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Darwin_74f3.html" title="Charles Darwin">Darwin's</a> model for <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_selection.html" title="Natural selection">natural selection</a>. These people believed they were dominant because they were superior, and believed that natural selection <i>proved</i> this. This is what led to vile concepts such as <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugenics.html" title="Eugenics">eugenics</a> and of course ultimately to <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Socialism_62c4.html" title="National Socialism">National Socialism</a> and the <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_solution.html" title="Final solution">final solution</a>. It's as much the product of imperialism and and political dominance as anything else. The motivation was to define themselves as superior to everybody, not just the Celts, this is what led to things like <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_South_Africa_in_the_apartheid_era_ac13.html" title="History of South Africa in the apartheid era">apartheid</a> for example, and I bet you can find many instances regarding <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Raj_db3a.html" title="British Raj">India</a> as well. <a href="../../../w/o/b/User%7EWobble_51f3.html" title="User:Wobble">Alun</a> 05:28, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>How kind of you not to view this as <b>information for journalists</b>. You act like I live off words, not money! I need advertising from someone else, someone in control of the airwaves, not <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>, quite frankly. What makes you so powerful? I know of nobody that was obscure, and was helped by a Wikipedia article. Journalists in July will need to access this information all of a sudden, information about TTF-Bucksfan and the Fifth World Council, real world organisations, with real world people working for them, but if they make any comment about the information that is lacking, I'll tell them, <b>on national TV</b>, that <b>Wikipedia isn't really an encyclopedia</b>, and it isn't. It is just a bunch of envy-filled geaks that will talk about something when it already is, and thus they don't help democracy or global positive change in any way. They don't exist at all, for the purposes of democracy or positive global change through information, because the information you'll find there you can find elsewhere, and it is probably less biased. Wikipedia really doesn't deserve its nonprofit status. What makes a flat in Hurstville, Australia (read <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantium.html" title="Atlantium">here</a>), and that's all it is, more important than an Intercontinental Internet like the Cesidian Root, and the latter is just a corporation of my nation? Anyway, I won't give <b>nothing</b>, nothing at all to Wikipedia and its bosses, when I start that country out of thin air soon, and being a <b>Wikipedia Admin</b> won't get you a citizenship either! You won't be considered a <b>professional</b>, good enough to meet the standards of the Micronational Professional Registry, because if a professional information administrator thinks that the Cesidian Root doesn't deserve an article, but <a href="../../../o/p/e/OpenNIC_4d82.html" title="OpenNIC">OpenNIC</a>, a total joke, does, then <b>anyone can run a Wikipedia</b>, even I! I'm not breaking any rules here, or proposing articles that aren't already found in the Wikipedia, so if you are going to ax TTF-Bucksfan, then I demand you axe <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantium.html" title="Atlantium">Atlantium</a>, and virtually all the articles <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_micronations.html" title="List of micronations">here</a>. They don't have a more important nation. If you delete Cesidian Root, I'll demand similar treatment of the lesser <a href="../../../o/p/e/OpenNIC_4d82.html" title="OpenNIC">OpenNIC</a>. --<a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndigoGenius_daff.html" title="User:IndigoGenius">IndigoGenius</a> 15:36, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Made-up subculture? First of all, all cultures are made by human beings, and Fifth World culture is no different in that respect, but when you call it a subculture, you are also implying it is <b>inferior</b>. I disagree. Only time will tell, however, that I'm right and you're wrong. The Tallini Family (TTF) is really a cyberstate, and is not a registered or incorporated company within any jurisdiction. Yet it has over $15,000 worth of credit with Centurion Bank (aka <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Express_352b.html" title="American Express">American Express</a>). It has existed with bank credit since 17 November 1998. The Tallini Family is also listed in the Nafta Register on this page: <a href="http://www.globalcontactinc.com/media/nafta/b.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.globalcontactinc.com/media/nafta/b.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalcontactinc.com/media/nafta/b.pdf</a>. You will need to perform a search to find it here under "Tallini" or "Tallini Family". The Kingdom of Bucksfan, or more comprehensively, TTF-Bucksfan, is an offshoot of The Tallini Family or TTF, and it came about in November 2001. Although this entity later formed the Cesidian Root, it is still registered as the owner of several TLDs of the now defunct Public-Root. If you go to the INAIC organisation's website at <a href="http://inaic.com" class="external free" title="http://inaic.com" rel="nofollow">http://inaic.com</a>, and you enter the TTF, TALLINI, BUCKSFAN, BUCRAFAN, CESIDIO, 5WC, SAVOIA, ITALIANA, AMORE, and UNIVERSITY TLDs in the WHOIS, you will discover that TTF-Bucksfan owned these TLDs in said root, so we use them perfectly legitimately today, although the INAIC/Public-Root was less than an ethically run enterprise. The Fifth World Council (5WC) was started in July 2002 by TTF-Bucksfan, and several less stable micronations. It is an international governmental and nongovernmental organisation. Today it has a strong and populous Italian micronation as a member (Impero), an Australian environmental organisation (The Earth Society), an Indian business (Zion Business Alliance India or InfoSystem), and several independent individuals. It has funded or encouraged alternative root email research that was never before done in the Public-Root, probably email experiments that were never done before, period. The Cesidian Root started September 2005, but it was not a full root until November 2005. It is essentially a corporation of TTF-Bucksfan, registered with the Micronational Professional Registry, and is accredited by the Fifth World Council Accreditation Agency, that is, by several micronations, organisations, and individuals. <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_DNS_root_3904.html" title="Alternative DNS root">Alternative DNS root</a> is not an easy business, since you are basically competing against an illegal monopoly created by the <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_Department_of_Commerce_1767.html" title="US Department of Commerce">US Department of Commerce</a>, and most nation-states, even territories of the same, do not have a tendency to "rock the boat." In our extremely short existence we have gone beyond the <a href="../../../d/e/v/Development_stage.html#Beta" title="Development stage">Beta</a> stage. We have gone from being a non-root of two servers, to a full Intercontinental Internet with seven servers. We have offered our services to territories so far (e.g.: the <a href="../../../%C3%A5/l/a/%C3%85land.html" title="Åland">Åland Islands</a>), and to organisations whose TLD application was refused by ICANN (e.g.: the <a href="../../../s/r/i/SRI_International_6d40.html" title="SRI International">SRI International</a>). In July we will try a different approach, but I cannot reveal company secrets. It will be a better and probably more successful approach, however. The Cesidian Root allows full resolution of a perfect copy of the <a href="../../../i/c/a/ICANN_9b5b.html" title="ICANN">ICANN</a> root (we scan the ICANN root every day automatically), a full copy of the <a href="../../../o/p/e/OpenNIC_4d82.html" title="OpenNIC">OpenNIC</a> root, we resolve China's 3 special TLDs in <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punycode.html" title="Punycode">Punycode</a> form, and we resolve another 13 special Cesidian Root TLDs besides these. We hope to be able to cover our expenses, as there is nobody greedy in our intermicronational and multinational corporation, and to make a decent profit in the future, doing what we love to do and are great at. But we are basically in the business of serving governments and jurisdictions not served by the current system (we want to provide a meaningful public service), and serving also those who are denied both a territorial space, as well as a virtual space -- like <a href="../../../t/i/b/Tibet.html" title="Tibet">Tibet</a>, for example, but we would be happy to help the <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurd.html" title="Kurd">Kurds</a> too. We also hope to offer TLDs within a good traffic Internet to hobby or nonprofit groups, and in fact I have offered our services to the <a href="../../../h/a/m/Ham_radio.html" title="Ham radio">Ham radio</a> group without success in the past. We are here to serve, and hopefully make the world a nicer, and less nastier place. With ICANN, such groups could not be served with their $250,000 TLD fees. ICANN exists only to serve for profit and greedy groups, and monopolies already in charge. --<a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndigoGenius_daff.html" title="User:IndigoGenius">IndigoGenius</a> 19:06, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you follow some of the links on the site and so on, you will find pages explaining that modern human rights laws mean that anyone can legally declare themselves emperor-king of their own nation, even if that nation comprises of one person or a handful of people. After they declare themselves king, they get to set up weirdly designed websites to proclaim their sovereignty e.g. here are some links from the 5th World portal <a href="http://5world.net/" class="external free" title="http://5world.net/" rel="nofollow">http://5world.net/</a>&#160;:

<dd>The Fifth World Council, which is more than TTF-Bucksfan, supports the Cesidian Root, the most advanced Internet on the planet (no hype). The Fifth World Council also supports other efforts of Fifth World nations. Fifthworlders also exist without any micronational connection, so you can say it is a supermicronational citizenship, in a way. The <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> organisation can become a member of the Micronational Professional Registry, not the Fifth World Council (that is a little more involved), because the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> is a member, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_State_572b.html" title="New York State">New York State</a>, and many other states and organisations you have heard about.

We are a crank if you think freedom <b>comes from above</b>, and has nothing to do with forces within you. <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Jefferson_1b17.html" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> would disagree with that assessment. The Cesidian Root can also run a <a href="../../../t/l/d/TLD_c509.html" title="TLD">TLD</a> for the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> organisation, even a <b>.wiki TLD</b>. We cannot guarantee mega traffic yet, but you shouldn't completely discount us, or the nations/organisations/people behind the effort.

<li><b>Reply.</b> It looks the same as before. Still fails non-notable, neutrality, and original research.

<li><b>Comment <i>still</i> Delete</b> I took another read of the article and find no improvement. The explanation(s) offered on the article's talk page indicates that this is simply a slang expression thus should be <b>Deleted</b> as a slang <i>dicdef</i>. There are indeed religio-cultural aspects in some manifestations of mental illness or anti-social behavior but this "phrase" is not the appropriate object for an article about such disorders. I disagree, however, with the person who claims this is a "personal attack against Christianity." It's actually too poorly formulated to be much of anything at this point. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAnde_B._3091.html" title="User:Ande B.">Ande B</a> 22:40, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So in other words, you believe that this term is justified for inclusion in Wikipedia because of the actions of certain factions of the Christian religion? Might as well claim we need more articles portraying the KKK in a positive light because some criminals are black. Also, the usage of Christian Psychosis in that sense is not one based on psychological research, but rather anti-religious bias.

I acknowledge that the motivation for some or even many delete votes may well be simple knee-jerk hostility to anything seen as a negative opinion of any part of so-called Christianity. But motivation is not what counts here, what counts is whether the article meets minimal standards for inclusion and it does not. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAnde_B._3091.html" title="User:Ande B.">Ande B</a> 00:16, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Reply</b> This article is ostensibly justified as not being an attack on Christianity because it is NOT a political article but rather a psychological one. A justification under free speech (which technically does not apply on Wikipedia to begin with, hence why we are allowed to delete any articles whatsoever) would imply that it was a POV article, and deletable for that in addition to non-notability. Wikipedia is not for opinion pieces, that's what blog sites are for. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">Tjstrf</a> 00:18, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Suggestion to those who want it kept.</b> Rewrite the article under the title Religious psychosis, add more citations, and emphasize the psychological aspect. It should then be able to pass both NPOV and notability. That should eliminate the apparent bias in the title, and in that way keep you from having reactive christians jumping on the article. If you can't find the citations, then it fails notability regardless. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">Tjstrf</a> 00:37, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comment</b>This article is vastly different. This is an article that outlines a psychological term. There is a specific islam-judeo-christian idea of faith that drives people to do things that a rational thinker would not do. This is often accompanied by psychological afflictions such as temporal lobe epilepsy or schizophrenia. While the term schizophrenic is a medical/psychological phrase, many times it is used to refer to someone's outlandish behavior by the general public or laymen, sometimes derivitives like "schizo" and the like are used, that does not invalidate the term schizophrenic itself. The same is true for christ psychosis. To rename this religion psychosis would no longer exemplify the idea that is central to the article, that of faith as laid out in the book of hebrews and the consequences on the mind of holding that belief. I feel those that are moving to have this article deleted are greatly unaware of the reality of the situation. I recommend reading <a href="../../../v/i/r/Viruses_of_the_Mind_a623.html" title="Viruses of the Mind">Viruses of the Mind</a> and watching Richard Dawkins' documentary: The Root of all Evil? and reading up on modern neuropsychology (and its relationship to archaic freudian psychology) before passing judgement, anything else would be a highly uninformed judgement and a promotion of ignorance and democratic 'truth' on wikipedia. I agree the article needs some improvement, but to delete is inappropriate! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolidusspriggan_50b5.html" title="User:Solidusspriggan">Solidusspriggan</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/l/User_talk%7ESolidusspriggan_e01e.html" title="User talk:Solidusspriggan">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Solidusspriggan_429b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Solidusspriggan">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p><b>Counter.</b> The idea that usage as a "layman's medical term", which is itself an oxymoron, qualifies it as an encyclopedic usage is no more true of calling christians psychotic than it would be calling homosexuals psychotic. Even then, since hate organizations which are notable in their own right, such as the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westboro_Baptist_Church_20ea.html" title="Westboro Baptist Church">Westboro Baptist Church</a>, use such rhetoric, a hypothetical article on the term homosexual psychosis might be notable as a propoganda term <i>within context</i>, while this is not. Additionally, Wikipedia does not exist to make value judgments, merely cite the judgments of other official organizations. Further, Solidus's insistence that this term must be written about under the name Christian psychosis rather than religious shows that his interest is solely in the defamation of the Christian faith, <i>not</i> the inclusion of a psychological theory. His final appeal to keep the article "for the sake of truth" is simply a disguised form of the statement "but Christians really are psychos!", an opinion that is no more permissable in an encyclopedia seeking to maintain the NPOV than the sentiment that brands all Muslims as terrorists. Do not let a few POV pushing antitheist zealots undermine the wiki system. Thank you, and may reason prevail. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 05:57, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep</b>I don't see anything as "layman medical term". I contend that your homosexual example is flawed, there is a perfectly sound darwinian explanation for homosexuality and for the ability of religious belief, however there is no Darwinian explanation for christianity itself. Beyond that, "faith" that is referred to here is something unique to the judeo-christian-islam religions. Buddhists, Hindus, Janists, etc do not have this same concept of faith. The Freudian citation is sound, the Freudian idea is almost wholly focused on christianity and Western relgion in general. The "faith" referred to in this article is that which as solidus said is laid out in the book of Hebrews: "Faith is evidence for things unseen" This statement in itself claims that the very act of believing makes something real. Well I believe everyone above voted to keep this article....OH IT DID'T CHANGE. I must be crazy! Sounds like all those voting to delete are the biased, attacking, and hypocritical ones. Solidus is the only one here with any sense. (as is the guy that said "keep for the sake of free speech" to delete this article would be a grave mistake and an example of the bias and innaccuracy wikipedia is criticized for. Because some sensitive religionists didn't want a compound word that could possibly imply there was something wrong with the people like <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saddam_Hussein_75a3.html" title="Saddam Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_Robertson_25ef.html" title="Pat Robertson">Pat Robertson</a>, <a href="../../../o/s/a/Osama_Bin_Laden_e170.html" title="Osama Bin Laden">Osama Bin Laden</a> because of either their religious convictions motivated them or justify their actions.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Insults don't help your cause and the rest of your argument indicates you haven't read or haven't understood the above discussion. Wikipedia is not a place for the creation or popularization of invented terms that have been created for the express purpose of propogating themselves through WP. The article is a bad faith abuse of WP. The supposed term has no existence outside of the article. "Free speech", as Tjstrf has clearly stated above, is not a legitimate argument here because POV articles are against WP policy and WP is not obligated to host every proposed article. There are bulletin boards, usenet, and blogs for those types of things. But I suspect you already know that and are simply looking for an argument.

<p>"""keep""" Richard Dawkins used terms defining mental illness when describing christian faith. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 134.53.27.72 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_134.53.27.72_09f5.html" title="Special:Contributions/134.53.27.72">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>Comment - The above unsigned "Keep" vote was made by 134.53.27.72 (see the edit history), whose only edit on Wikipedia at that point was this vote. <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.12.116.71.html" title="User:64.12.116.71">64.12.116.71</a> 21:10, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<b>keep</b> Firstly I must say that to discredit someone just because it is there first edit is highly irrational. If it were done to everyone who made their first edit I imagine very little would ever be written. This user obviously has some concern for the terrible and unbalanced attack on such a presently appropriate article, with the rise of fundamentalism and all, a terrible thing to delete.129.15.127.254</p>

<li><b>Reply</b> First, the poster was not "discredited" unless you believe that by being "revealed" as having a previously un-used ID is some sort of insult. Second, it is <i>not</i> irrational to note a poster's prior history of contributions. Third, you have no idea whether the poster has any concern about anything, you have only seen that a post has been made. Fourth, the rise of fundamentalism is not the issue under discussion. Fifth, nominations for deletion are not conducted by "vote". Sixth, it is an easy thing to convince others to attempt to "stuff the vote" on WP, even though the votes are not actually counted or binding. Seventh, because deletion requests are not made by popular vote but by reasoned analysis following sufficient discussion, it is helpful in considering how much weight to give to some comments to be able to compare the poster's history re reasonability and quality of prior contributions. Eighth, the ISP identifier for the above comment (129.15.127.254) is a shared one on a college campus so it is imposible to determine a more specific identity but the user's talk page has a number of warning templates indicative of an account which has been used in the past by those with a tendency to disregard WP ethics and courtesies. Ninth, it is the practice of these sorts of discussions to discount the comments of first time posters. Tenth, the article was created in bad faith in a deliberate attempt to misuse Wikipedia and that bad faith alone is sufficient to warrant deletion. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAnde_B._3091.html" title="User:Ande B.">Ande B.</a> 03:43, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As a general policy, a first edit should NEVER be on a VfD page. Also, since Wikipedia does not exist to promote or counteract any social agenda, (except that of collaboration and freedom, if those can be considered "agendas") an article whose existance was primarily for the sake of "curbing the rising tide of" <i>anything</i> should be deleted or rewritten as soon as feasibly possible, since such an article would be a misuse of Wikipedia for personal activism. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 04:51, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge with Mechanical Maniacs or Creation of a New Article</b> - For the record, i'd love to know how something as big as the Megaman teams in the Megaman community ISN'T notable for a Wikipedia entry. Obviously, I don't think the teams should have indiviual articles, but considering theres not only a "Team" for each Megaman game out there (including the minor ones), but some of them, such as this Sinister Six and Mechanical Maniacs, are large and well respected sites in the Megaman Community.</li>

<p>As for the vanity claim, apparently the entire group of the Sinsister Six were suprised by this entry on Wikipedia, therefore I doubt that they had anything to do with the creation. --User:Ace_Spark 10.17 03 June 2006 (GMT)</p>

<li>As one of the founders of Omega Nu Alpha I can attest to its existence. The Alpha Pi chapter of Theta Chi Fraternity was closed in late 1999 and five former members began a new Fraternity titled Omega Nu Alpha. In 2005 we formed a governing group called the National Fraternity Assembly which is currently in progress to open 5 additional chapters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recognition of existence by the North American Interfraternity Conference is not required to operate a Fraternity. The Alpha Chapter of Omega Nu Alpha participates in the University of Minnesota's local IFC as noted here <a href="http://www.begreek.org/IFCchapter.cfm?chapterID=12" class="external text" title="http://www.begreek.org/IFCchapter.cfm?chapterID=12" rel="nofollow">University of Minnesota IFC - BeGreek.org</a>.</p>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> Rose no longer runs her official site, she did last year but got way too busy this year. It's run by someone else. The biography was taken from her official site which is not run by her and therefore cannot be vain, which I looked up and you called Rose conceited. Actresses have MySpace's now days. Rachel Hurd-Wood has an official one why can't Rose? It doesn't look like it's ran by her as it's all done in thrid person. Besides Skandar Keynes is running his official site. Skye Sweetnam used to run her official site. Whats wrong with people running their own official sites? She really is an actress with those upcoming projects. IMDb.com doesnt have a lot of people listed. I think you should leave the page alone. --<a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELoserkidemx3_c2ae.html" title="User:Loserkidemx3">Loserkidemx3</a></li>

<p>You know what. Having read your above link, you are absolutely right... for now! Once it is big enough, we'll be back. Otherwise, no need to be rude. I have actually put ALOT (read: too much) time into this stupid religion thing. Obviously I needed to read more wikipedia policy. I appologise in advance, bu I will probably re-post it one more time later just to show some friends, otherwise, I lay the issue to rest.
