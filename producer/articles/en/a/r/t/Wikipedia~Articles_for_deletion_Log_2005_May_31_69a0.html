<li>Er, no, I don't. It's just that if you read the article -- what little there is -- it's kind of obvious that the entry is specifically about Star Wars blaster pistols, not blasters in the more generic sense. In any case, that's a fine redirect in my book. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 09:56, 31 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Sorry, shouldn't have doubted your SF literacy. Still, when we talk about an article, I think it's important that we use as general a context as we can.

<li>Don't worry about it -- like I said, it's a fine redirect in my book. I just didn't think about it beyond "this is a useless Star Wars article, should probably point to the more relevant Star Wars article".

<li>I guess my point was that for an amateur seeking notability, it's a low number. Were she an amateur with 10,000 paintings, she'd be showing up on <a href="../../../o/u/t/Category%7EOutsider_artists_42f9.html" title="Category:Outsider artists">this list</a> soon enough. But with 100, no such luck. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilthecow_3225.html" title="User:Philthecow">Philthecow</a> 13:37, May 31, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You're entitled to your opinion, of course, but <i>10,000 paintings</i>? That's incredibly high, almost ludicrously so. Picasso is generally known as the most prolific famous painter, and he produced about 13,000 paintings over an 80-year career. <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_Vermeer_814d.html" title="Jan Vermeer">Jan Vermeer</a>, the best-known painter of his era, has 34 paintings attributed to him. So, 10,000 paintings is an extraordinary feat which maybe .001% of painters ever reach... I'd say it's similar to 50 movies for a director, 30 albums for a band, 100 books for a writer, etc. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 14:33, May 31, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>*wry smile* Ten thousand perhaps a bit of an overstatement. I just meant that ludicrously prolific amateurs (see <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Finster_888e.html" title="Howard Finster">Howard Finster</a>, with 46,000) are much more likely to be worthy of an article than average sorts. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilthecow_3225.html" title="User:Philthecow">Philthecow</a> 13:28, Jun 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Hell, <i>I've</i> painted nearly twice that many paintings (and they're in collections in four countries), but I don't consider myself notable enough for an article. Note too that this article <i><b>has previously been speedy deleted</b></i>. Content was the same, but indicated that the artist was still alive.

<li><b>comment</b> I don't know whether this article is verifiable or not. The fact that it has been rewritten following a speedy delete with basic facts changed does not speak well for it. I want to comment on the idea that Google is the arbiter of notability. Google, as a reflection of the content of the WWW has some very serious biases toward recent events, curious events, and internet-related events. An enormous number of notable things have happened with minimal notice on Google. It's a very useful and readily available tool, but not the end of the line. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 20:14, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article appeared almost 4 years ago as a simple dicdef. Over the years, people have added material on <a href="../../../i/s/o/Isotropic_radiation.html" title="Isotropic radiation">Isotropic radiation</a>, <a href="../../../i/s/o/Isotropic_manifold.html" title="Isotropic manifold">Isotropic manifolds</a>, <a href="../../../i/s/o/Isotropic_antenna.html" title="Isotropic antenna">Isotropic antennas</a>, and <a href="../../../i/s/o/Isotropic_bands.html" title="Isotropic bands">Isotropic bands</a>. These should have been separate articles, and indeed Isotropic Antenna already was. I've created stubs for the others, and the original dicdef is now on Wiktionary. Since there's no ambiguity to disambiguate (no two articles with the same name), there's no point in converting the article into a dab page. Die! Die! Die! Die! ----<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac R</a> 03:33, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>.

<ul>
<li>But people don't look up "isotropic" -- they look up "Isotropic radiation", etc. OK, maybe somebody might type in just "isotropic", because they can't remember what isotropic thing they're looking for. In which case a dab page might make it <i>harder</i> for them to find what they're looking for. Suppose they want "Isotropic fornicators" and whoever wrote that article forgot to add it to the dab page. They're out of luck. But if there is no dab page, searching for "Isotropic" gets you all the articles with "Isotropic" in their title -- much more reliable. Let's save disambiguation pages for page names that are actually ambiguous. ----<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac R</a> 04:36, 31 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Comment: I'm sorry I thought the article's notability was clear when I had originally written it. Morello was a leading member of the Morello crime family, arguably the first Mafiosi crime family in New York, and the last leader of the Morello's before it was absorbed into <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Masseria_9f27.html" title="Joe Masseria">Joe "The Boss" Masseria</a>'s organization where he remained his top advisor until his death during the <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castellammarese_War_640a.html" title="Castellammarese War">Castellammarese War</a>. I apologize if I forgot to add my references and I can certainly add several websites.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Mikkalai. While there is certainly confusion between Giuseppe and Peter Morello (of which there are both conflicting sources over weither Peter is an alias for Giuseppe) to include all the Morello family (an article I'm planning to add later this month) would be quite large and might be better served by seperate articles considering the different careers of all the Morellos (Antonio's partnership with Lupo The Wolf's Black Hand operations, Nicholas's leadership of the family during the Mafia-Camorra War, as well as Vincenzo and Ciro Terranova's later role during the rise of the National Crime Syndicate to name a few) however merging Giuseppe and Peter into one article might make more sense. <a href="../../../1/5/2/User%7E152.163.100.197.html" title="User:152.163.100.197">152.163.100.197</a> 04:18, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Leanne. With all due respect anyone who is the least bit knowable on organized crime history would at least admit Peter Morello was a notable figure in pre-Prohibition organized crime. Besides being a member and final leader of one of the earliest crime families in the United States, Morello was the top advisor for Joe Masseria. It was his murder that would lead Marranzano and the other American mafiosi to begin the Castellamarese War. Unless it is official policy, I don't believe a lack of Google hits should be qualifications for deletion or verifiability, as opposed to no google hits, however the external links provided should establish his notability and I suggest for anyone voting on the article to at least read the refernces provided to judge weither or not this article is indeed notable. Many of the articles I have contributed on this subject have been high level mafiosi on an otherwise less documented period of organized crime that unfortunatly have little website hits on popular search engines such as Google. I had thought that with these articles significant subjects like these might have more Google hits and that by writing, at least a small article, that someone on Wikipedia who is a bit more knowable on the subject might be able to contribute a bit more to the article. If this topic is inappropriate for Wikipedia then I apologize however I should mention that, while I agree articles such as Street Fighter, Pokemon, Star Wars, etc., article may not interest myself as much as another fan it doesn't make the articles less significant to those with an interest in the subject. I should also point out that the majority of organized crime articles, at least of which I have found, are reasonably well researched and certainly notable topics (certainly not any I would classify as "hoods") of which very few are stubs. While you are obviously entitled to your opinion I would appreciate any Wikipedian with a knowledge of organized crime to offer their opinion on the matter. <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.12.116.197.html" title="User:64.12.116.197">64.12.116.197</a> 17:10, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Honestly I think it would be a shame to delete this article. It seems the main arguments for its deletion are notability (based on low google hits) and verification. These look like they've been provided and, while my own opinion is inconsequential, Peter Morello was an important mafiosi both before and during Prohibition and an important figure in the Castellammarese War. The article could use some expanding, possibly merging Giuseppe and Peter Morello, or the Morello crime family. <a href="../../../2/0/9/User%7E209.213.71.78.html" title="User:209.213.71.78">209.213.71.78</a> 19:21, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>We do it on VfD because the ugly hack is necessary to manage the large number of VfD nominations (it keeps the VfD pages themselves from getting unmanageably huge and difficult to edit), and to make linking to individual VfD discussions easier. If you follow VfD, you'll notice that a significant number of editors—usually, but not always, newer writers—can't figure out how to add a page to VfD even with the detailed guide at the bottom of the page. It's not nice for us to throw new editors in at the deep end that way in the article space, too.</dd>
<dd>Concatenating whole articles—particularly multisection articles like these—produces a composite that...well, it just isn't pretty. Several navigation templates from the subarticles are duplicated, the interwiki link list is broken, and a number of other problems arise that just aren't kosher by the Manual of Style. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 16:36, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Will be happy with whatever Wikipedia moderators decide</b> I have just taken a more detailed look at your deletion policy and have read what you mean by 'Not yet/non notable' and fully admit that it would be rather pointless for me to even attempt to disagree with it being notable or not. I understand given the nature of the article and it's subject [I] that it's hardly of the utmost important it be kept up, so I will be fine with whatever you decide to do with it given the article's admittable obscurity. Apologies. ---Gareth Brown 18:00 June 6th 2005</li>
<li><b>Indifferent, but wouldn't mind it staying</b> Hello, I thought I'd better do the right thing by signing up so I could explain. This wasn't actually written by me, but by a rather zealous friend of mine, who's got a bit ahead of himself writing about a website that isn't even open yet. I quite like it, the website will be up soon and more people will find and view it but surely that will give this article more reason to stick around. It is quite genuine, however I didn't write it but accept responsibility for it if I must and would have no problem if Wikipedia sees it necessary that it comes down. ---Gareth Brown 08:26, June 6 2005</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I feel it should be kept. Where's the harm in letting everyone know who the guy is? With all due respect I feel the word 'Vanity' is unfairly placed since no-one knows whether it was Mr Brown himself who actually wrote the article and not a friend/colleague/etc. Please give this some consideration. --James O'Connell.

<li><b>Do NOT Delete</b> This is more a note to the WP administration. IMHO, using a majority vote as a criterion for deletion is quite idiotic. Just imagine if real life would go by similar rules. For example, in 1948, the wish of the 60 million Arabs to "sweep the Jews to the sea" (in the Arab's own language), that is, to sweep the 600 thousands Jews that lived then in Israel would have been easily materialized.</li>
</ul>
<p>Luckily, and unlike Wikipedia "policies", in real life, the Jews in Israel (now 4+ millions) can, at least if the rest of the world would not come to the Arab's rescue as it did so many times after they attacked Israel and the wheels of the war turned against them, to sweep the Arabs (now over 100 millions) to the sea.</p>

<li>Highly POV, therefore probably unsuiitable in its present form.

<li><b>Comment</b> The schoolwatch folks have become well organized making votes for deletion on schools pointless. Failing the organization of an anti-schoolwatch type group, this is policy by brute force. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 13:30, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I must admit I'm a little puzzled by this line of argument. People who want school articles kept are entitled to one vote and only one vote. Furthermore, no school deletion discussions are initiated by people who want to keep schools. The rate of submission of school articles for deletion has rapidly accelerated in the past couple of months. In April, only 20 schools were listed for deletion, in May, 75. So far in June we've has 27. If one starts a discussion on deletion of a school on Wikipedia and a lot of regular Wikipedia editors show up saying they want that school article kept, presumably this means a lot of Wikipedians want that school article kept. This is precisely the purpose of VfD--for people to discuss whether they want articles deleted or not.</li>
<li>On <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_schoolwatch_4cc0.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch">the school watch page itself</a>, it's vote-neutral. All school-related VfDs are listed there, and anyone can pop it in their watchlist. It doesn't favor pro-school people over anti-school people. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 16:18, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Please observe this sentence from the school watch page: "This is a campaign to ensure that articles on schools are allowed to develop on Wikipedia". That's not NPOV. It's a campaign. The fact that there is no concensus on the debate regarding inclusion of secondary schools juxtaposed with the statistics regarding the number of such schools that have been VfD'd but passed (all of them, recently) is in the least, interesting. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 17:12, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Please observe my rebuttal above. On your claim that there is no consensus on schools, observe: in the past 94 school deletion discussions that have reached a conclusion, only two articles have been deleted. Of the 28 pending (unfinished) school deletion discussions, only one article (about a school political organization started by a student), is headed for deletion. Wikipedia has spoken. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 20:19, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I pointed out the fact that the schoolwatch group/list is a campaign to retain school articles. There isn't any debating that. It's very clear from the sentence I quoted. If you wish to debate this further, then the next course of action would likely be to study the votes that have been cast for all of the 94 schools you note above, and see if there is consistency among the pro-keep or pro-delete populations. If there is consistency in one group vs. lack of consistency in the other, then it would appear there is a focused group intent on pro-keep or pro-delete. I suspect there is a focused group of pro-keep people, and not one for pro-delete. If that's the case, then it is not Wikipedia speaking. Instead, it is a focused minute sub-group of Wikipedia that is speaking. That becomes policy by brute force, not policy by concensus. For what it's worth, I'm generally in favor of articles on schools. Schools are verifiable entities, and if we are to include a requirement of basis in notability, they are considerably more notable than obscure cartoon characters that have individual articles. I'm just not in favor of policy by brute force. That undermines Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 13:40, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>You're losing me here--what is the problem with the existence on Wikipedia of a group of people who consistently vote to keep school articles?</li>
<li>On the subject of focus, you may note if you have a look that 2/3 of all VfD listings for school articles in May were made by one editor and 2/3 or all VfD listings for school articles in June were made by another single editor. This is clear evidence of a focussed campaign to delete schools. And you know what? I couldn't care less. If Wikipedia wanted to delete schools this would be the way to go about it, a couple of dedicated editors rooting out school articles and proposing them to a receptive VfD which would duly delete them.</li>
<li>But these things can backfire. When some editors engage in focussed activity (such as the two-man deletion campaign that has accounted for the huge rise in VfD listings--from 20 in April to 75 in May and 27 so far in June), where there is not popular assent, it is inevitable that there will be an equally focussed backlash. People who care about the articles being systematically listed for deletion will tend to spot the pattern, watch for repetitions and engage in their own repetitive behavior. There is nothing wrong with this, and if the people engaged in the campaign for deletion don't like seeing this happen then all they have to do is stop listing school articles for deletion in this extremely focussed manner. We'll all go back to doing whatever it was we were doing before the deletion campaign and in time the success rate for school deletion listings may rise from its current value (between 0% and 3% depending on the sample timescale you use) to something like its former value (perhaps around 30%).</li>
<li>We cannot separate the opinion of Wikipedia from the social dynamics of its operation. When I say that Wikipedia has spoken, I literally mean that this is how Wikipedia resolves problems like this. A brute-force push in a direction that Wikipedia doesn't want to go, such as the deletion campaign, will tend to result in an equal and opposite reaction. This is Wikipedia. Learn to accept it and love it.</li>
<li>You describe the practise of consistently voting keep for schools as "policy by brute force". I cannot accept this characterization. Those voting to keep schools are simply expressing their opinion. They are not forcing others to vote keep or not to vote delete, they are simply expressing graphically the strength of feeling against the deletion of school articles. That they also have the best arguments may also help. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 14:22, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I did not describe consistently voting to keep schools as "policy by brute force". I described an organized group of such people, working without there being an opposing such group, as "policy by brute force". On the rest of your points, I agree and disagree to varying degrees. On the original point, you made a statement that the schoolwatch group was neutral; it isn't. I think I've demonstated that effectively. That was my original point. I think it best we leave this debate in its current state; this is not the place for it. Thank you. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 14:46, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well this brings us back to the question of what is an organized group. I stumbled across <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_schoolwatch_4cc0.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch">Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch</a> because I already subscribed to the <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_112c.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch">Wikipedia:Watch</a> service, whose purpose is precisely to provide unobtrusive alerts in users' watchlists for events of interest. So I subscribed to that subpage, and sometimes I update it by adding or subtracting links to schools that someone else has listed for deletion, and that is the sole extent of my involvement with anything that can be called schoolwatch. Does the act of subscribing to, and updating, an article in project space constitute "organized activity?" Clearly the act of doing so does not require one to vote in a certain way, or even to vote at all, which is my point about schoolwatch. No matter what it says on the page, it is vote-neutral.</li>
<li>I've repeatedly stated this, and you've continually attempted to represent schoolwatch as some kind of focussed campaign, an organized group attempting to subvert Wikipedia. It isn't, and you've demonstrated nothing. Anybody can add Schoolwatch to their watchlist. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 16:29, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>My response:</b> Wikipedia isn't the place to post your data. It isn't encyclopedic stuff. Wikipedia is not a web server, and what you're doing is reformatting data and posting it for people to look at - that's best left to you on your own server. If it isn't encyclopedic information, it simply dosn't belong here! I don't mean to deride the idea of an index of airlines by traffic, etc - I think it would be a good resource for the Net. I get the impression from articles such as <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_7e69.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not</a>, etc, that this just isn't the forum for what you're doing. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Prior_aa25.html" title="User:Ryan Prior">Ryan Prior</a> 01:39, Jun 1, 2005 (UTC)

<li>You fail to see the point. I may have churned some numbers, but this is not my data. You appear to think I am treating wikipedia as some kind of data server. If that is the case, may I know how different this is with every other page in wikipedia? Why do people assume pages with text is more encylopedic then pages with a table or a list, when the former is similarly often reformmatted/rewrittern text available elsewhere?</li>
<li>I am personally a geographical graduate with speciality in international transport systems. When it comes to aviation analysis (and including something as mundane as trying to understand why airlines and governments are having bitter disputes over city pairs as we can see in newspapers), one often need to find out which airlines are flying the route in question, the frequency of routes (which translates to capacity), and also the actual numbers of passengers carried. This information is not always easily available in one location, nor is it readily available to all for free. And do these "raw sources of data" present these stuff in a manner which allows one to quickly get an overview of traffic flows from one airport?</li>
<li>You have not responded to my questions above. How do you explain all pages in wikipedia which are mere lists? Or tables in which the data was simply copied wholesale from just one source? Are you going to get them all removed, considering they appear to require even less number churning than is required for this page?</li>
<li>Last but not least, I am quite disturbed by the kind of language you use in dismissing work you do not appreciate. Calling it "nonsense", "unverifiable", and even "seedy" was quite an insult, unless of coz it is your intention to do so.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 08:17, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> not enclyopedic. There already is a format for listing destinations that should be just fine for this airport. The data in the table would be hard to maintain since airlines frequently change schedules and do not announce reductions in service. In any case, the article title is wrong since it is a list of the number of flights and not pasenger traffic. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 05:50, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Firstly, I did mention I will be adding passenger traffic figures later. And passenger traffic, btw, do also include routes and traffic frequencies, so in what way is it "wrong"? Secondly, the data is not hard to maintain, because airlines dont change schedules as frequently as you think. Most airlines make big changes at most twice a year, and new routes and suspensions do make it to the news. In addition, the information posted can be easily updated at anytime. Third, I was the same person who expanded the list of airlines in <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore_Changi_Airport_b9da.html" title="Singapore Changi Airport">Singapore Changi Airport</a> to include destinations served. When I considered the possibility to expand it further to also include annual traffic figures broken down by city-pair, etc, as well as the fexibility of seeing data by airline or by city, it clearly becomes impossible to keep expanding that list in the airport page. Hence the creation of new subpages to present these in full. I suppose if I merge the entire data back into <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore_Changi_Airport_b9da.html" title="Singapore Changi Airport">Singapore Changi Airport</a>, then the content suddenly becomes "encyclopedic"?--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 08:17, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

It may be difficult for those who have not been to this region to understand the relevance of the article. <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore_Changi_Airport_b9da.html" title="Singapore Changi Airport">Singapore Changi Airport</a> is a major air hub that serves at least two very important trans-oceanic routes: the "Singapore-India" route and the "Singapore-Australia" route which is part of the <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kangaroo_route.html" title="Kangaroo route">kangaroo route</a> (This route is so important that it was given a special name). The many travelers who fly these routes would agree that the article is relevant and notable. Similarly, those who fly between Singapore and different cities in China, would find the information useful. Often, this is not about planning a specific trip, but rather, this route-focused information is always something good to know and be updated about, as air travel has become so much a part of our lives.

<dd><b>Comment:</b> The proponents of deletion here do not think that the topic is irrelevant. It is notable and important, but it is not encyclopedic data (however high-level it is). What would be encyclopedic would be a page on the method used to extract the sort of data presented here from the raw data provided elsewhere. Wikipedia is not an archive; I would not go to a page about a highway and, every day, post the number of cars that travelled. On the page about SlashDot, I would not put up the number of words in every slashdot-referenced article day-to-day and run statistical analysis on those numbers. Those could be valuable activities, and there is notability abound because of the importance of those figures. However, the information is not encyclopedic and, unless sources and methodology are cited, the figures themselves are not verifiable (and/or can be considered origional research.) <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Prior_aa25.html" title="User:Ryan Prior">Ryan Prior</a> 12:59, Jun 1, 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I strongly refute several assumptions and generalisations in the above statements:
<ul>
<li>Presenting facts for the purpose of an encyclopedia is quite different from explaining the methodologies used to obtain them. Do you have articles in wikipedia directly explaining how a page like <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a> is written? An encyclopedia presents facts, be it in textual form or otherwise. It does <b>not</b> create them, <b>nor</b> does it spell out how an article is created other then the listing of sources used, etc.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>You entirely missed the point there. Read what I write before you strongly refute me. The creator of this article has interpreted it and processed data in order to write his page. I do not suggest a page about the method for creating the page; and you are right when you say that Wikipedia does not, and should not, have a page explaining how <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a> was written. However, we do have a page explaining how <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protein_synthesis.html" title="Protein synthesis">proteins are made</a>, and how a <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quicksort.html" title="Quicksort">quicksort</a> works. Spare me for a moment, if you would, your pointless ranting about how air travel is not like biochemistry or data sorting. A page about how something is done can be and often is encyclopedic. Thus, a page explaining how to take traffic figures and, by analyzing them, find yearly air traffic motiffs <i>would</i> be encyclopedic.

<li>Wikipedia <b>IS</b> an archieve, and indeed, it is even being celebrated as being a medium which is able to track and record facts as they pass us by in a way more dynamic then any physical medium could. If wikipedia could present trends over temporal scales, would this be considered an "archive", and hence worth removal?</li>
<li>Using daily traffic data on a motorway to compare with this page appears to suggest your unfamiliarity and overall ignorance when it comes to transportational studies. Anyone with enough years in academia would have pointed out, that the "significance" or "worthiness" of data is not fixed on the temporal scale. You cannot assume daily traffic on a highway is as useful as one for passenger volumes on an airline. Temporal scales are often tweaked according to noted patterns in movement numbers. Aviation traffic, for example, tend to have seasonal swings which span a calender year. Motorway movements, on the otherhand, tend to have traffic patterns repeating itself on a weekly basis. Obviously, the scale chosen similarly depends on the research objectives as well. But it is quite obvious that no one can simply start plucking random examples to deride the value of another. Proof to us that annual passenger figures are as useless as daily traffic figures on a motorway, and then we shall talk.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I don't like your argument here. I did not choose highway traffic because it's just like air traffic. I chose it because it is similarly unencyclopedic. The only potentially encyclopedic facts are the conclusions which rise from those facts. I know you'll say this is an interpretation. I say no - this is a listing. An interpretation would say, "In 2004 when X corporation moved to Singapore, traffic increased in January because of the movement of businessmen." A listing says, "November 2003, X passangers. December, Y passangers. January, Z passangers." In my humble opinion, the interpretation has encyclopedic potential while the listing does not. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Prior_aa25.html" title="User:Ryan Prior">Ryan Prior</a> 20:32, Jun 2, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Your comparison with SlashDot is equally disturbing. This list aims to show the traffic flow into and out of the airport on an annual basis, with the number of flights updated on an ad-hoc basis. Is this the same as your comparison with SlashDot? This page does NOT aim to list every single nitty-gritty data out there. For example, we could start listing flight numbers. We could list flight times. We could list types of aircraft used, and the capacity and number of seats for each. And in fact, these ARE important information as well in much aviation analysis. But no. It is kept to reasonable editing limits to include only the destinations, frequency of flights, and the pasengers carried annually to meet its primary objective. Your SlashDot analogy in seemingly trying to present me as an inclusionist is obviously a shot in the dark.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Once again, please grasp my point. If I were to log the number of words on every referenced SlashDot article, the listing would be quite simple (like, say the frequencey of flights to and from a Singapore airport). Useful analysis of these might yield the fact that SlashDot-referenced articles are getting shorter, which might suggest either that online reporting's style is changing or that SlashDot's editors are getting lazier and click past drawn-out articles. Neither of those are true to my knowledge; I speak hypothetically here. The numbers do not have encyclopedic potential, while the conclusions drawn from them might. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Prior_aa25.html" title="User:Ryan Prior">Ryan Prior</a> 20:32, Jun 2, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Last but not least, I again notice your shaky foundations when it comes to "defining" what is encyclopedic. You know claim any information presented here which does not have a source is naturally "unverifyable", and inevitably "unencyclopedic". I suppose I must have dreamt up the number of flights and passengers carried yesterday night, or I got my dog to walk on my keyboard to get the numbers?</li>

There is much work to do, but if anyone has really taken a careful look at our current and/or previous websites he must have noticed that we are developing and moving further all the time, little by little. It would be but waste of time to remove UCA from Wikipedia, since it will anyway sooner or later get more than those few Google hits and anything else ridiculous that seems to make some people suspicious. We are growing and developing all the time. If you take a serious look at what UCA is all about and what it has accomplished so far, you will see this is far from hoax of any kind.</li>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_United_Citizens_Alliance_f57d.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/United Citizens Alliance">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Why this entry should stay</span></h4>
<p>It has been suggested to me that I should write a short essay outlining why I feel that despite the number of negative votes here, the UCA entry should remain on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Let me first explain that I am new here, as is my roommate Natalia, so if we’ve breeched Wikipedia etiquette I apologize.</p>
<p>I think I should begin by addressing some the primary concerns being expressed here:</p>
<ul>
<li>1.The UCA has very little web presence on Google and other search engines</li>
<li>2.The UCA has not been featured in very many media sources</li>
<li>3.The UCA has only a couple hundred Citizens, only about half of which are employed directly by the various UCA agencies, and is therefore not big enough to be notable.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, lets begin.</p>
<p><b>1. The UCA has very little web presence on Google and other Search Engines</b> - This is very true, when you type in United Citizens Alliance almost nothing comes up about us. The reason for this is two-fold: <b>a.</b> The UCA has not been featured by a great deal in the media (which I’ll address in a moment), and <b>b.</b> Almost every website controlled by the UCA is under construction or offline at the moment.</p>
<p>I suppose that Natalia couldn’t have picked a worse time, with respect to our web presence, to post an article about us here. Until January the UCA had an extensive set of websites for several of our agencies; however, we recently were able to finally arrange permission to use .gov and .mil subdomains I our websites. (I’m not going to get into the long and miserable headache that was, but after several months of negotiations, deal making, and proving that we were who we say we are, we were finally granted the ability to use -.gov.uca.cc and .mil.uca.cc.) We’re in the process of applying for the domain uca.int so that we can use .gov.uca.int and .mil.uca.int subdomains, but that is probably year or two off, because of ICANNA’s strict regulations.</p>
<p>The point here is that the decision was made by Allied Web Services that since we are changing over to new servers and new URLs anyway, we might as well take a few months to completely reconstruct our entire web presence and switch over to systems that are easier to update and more cost effective. The result of this decision is that all of our websites spent about a month in complete non-existence, and only a few are back up in any capacity at all. The websites we have back up have not been up long enough to be found by Googles “webcrawlers” and although we have submitted the sites to about 18 search engines, they have yet to show up. Anyone who has dealt with web site building I’m sure knows how tricky it is dealing with search engines.</p>
<p>I expect that as more of out websites come back online, and Googles webcrawlers find the sites, or accept our submission of them, we’ll begin to have a great deal more “hits” on the search engine.</p>
<p>The real point here is that, of course, not having a large presence on google does not by itself mean much of anything, except that our websites are down and not many people are talking about us right now.</p>
<p><b>2.The UCA has not been featured in very many media sources</b> – I would remind people that the UCA is officially about 3 years old; and during that time we’ve put our focus on <b>doing</b> rather than <b>talking</b> about it. I don’t know how many people here have worked in the world of public relations, but stories don’t just end up on the news. (At least not the stories that organizations would want about them. LOL)</p>
<p>Every major organization, and most minor ones have a Communications Director and a public relations staff. The PR people are there to issue press releases to media sources and oversee the organizations “image.”</p>
<p>The for the first 2 years of the UCA’s existence Hegemon Wolf had no interest in hiring a communications staff or issuing press releases of any kind. The organization, like many others, began with a charter and a group of dedicated people. At the time he didn’t feel we were organized enough look good in the eyes of the media, and elected to wait until we had more <b>actual</b> accomplishments “on our belt” before making a big issue of it to the press.</p>
<p>Last year, after a review of our progress since the initial charter was created, Hegemon Wolf authorized the OHA to begin interviewing people for positions on the Communications staff, and although we have not made any permanent appointments to the Communications department, we have people serving in interim capacity working to assemble a press corps and have begun issuing releases to select media outlets.</p>
<p>Several months later <b><a href="http://www.tejo.org/angla/kontakto.jsp" class="external text" title="http://www.tejo.org/angla/kontakto.jsp" rel="nofollow">Kontakto</a></b> magazine, an international magazine published in Esperanto, became the first media source to publish an article about us to a wide audience.</p>
<p>My real point here is that being well established does not necessarily mean that you will be well know to the media, and our communications department is far behind the rest of the UCA organizationally speaking. And of course the reason that the communications department is behind is because we’ve been a bit busy out in the world actually making a difference and helping people, not just issuing press releases about every insignificant thing that we say or do, as many organizations a lot more well known than us spend time doing.</p>
<p>I’ve added to the UCA entry’s “successes” section to better reflect the kinds of things we’ve accomplished so far. However I am pasting it here as well –</p>
<p>The UCA does not have a long list of accomplishments comparable to that of the United Nations as of yet, however in the short period of time since its creation it has gone from being a small handful of people in the west, to a successful international organization with Citizens in countries all over the world. Also, through diplomatic agreements and relations with unrepresented peoples, the UCA government now represents and works directly to the interests of almost 800,000 people worldwide.</p>
<p>The UCA Allied Service has also actively participated in humanitarian aid programs, disaster relief, and assisting law enforcement agencies in combating slavery.</p>
<p>Currently the Allied Services, in direct coordination with the Freedom Alliance Foundation, are raising money and training personnel to send to South East Asia to implement some of the UCA's long term disaster relief and aid programs, which include the building of a large "creche" to serve as a home for many of the displaced and orphaned children currently living under deplorable conditions in underfunded orphanages and refugee camps.</p>
<p><b>3. The UCA has only a couple hundred Citizens, only about half of which are employed directly by the various UCA agencies, and is therefore not big enough to be notable.</b> – Now there is the real question, isn’t it.</p>
<p>Is the UCA big enough to be “notable?” <b>No</b>, if you have to be a large and well-known organization to be notable, then the UCA doesn’t fit the bill.</p>
<p>But I think that there is a more important concept to consider here. <b>Should an encyclopedia be a just collection of material about things that everyone already knows a lot about; or should an encyclopedia also include material about subjects that are important on their own merits, and by that virtue are things that people SHOULD know about?</b></p>
<p>I think that a good case can be made that showcasing information about little-known subjects that are of informative and of value in their own respect.</p>
<p>Now that leads to the question does the UCA entry qualify as being of informative value in its own respect? I can’t objectively answer that. (I believe I can, but I know that as a UCA employee and proud citizen, I can’t be considered truly objective.)</p>
<p>So I have to let you all weigh the issue and decide for yourselves. If you still question the existence of the UCA, despite my explanations of your concerns above, there is not much I can do for you, except ask you which is really a more logical conclusion –</p>
<p>1. A small group of people, for unknown reasons, are perpetrating a hoax to get people to believe in an international organization that doesn’t exist. When they aren’t making any money off the scam, and in fact are spending large quantities of money on office spaces, buildings, equipment, training personnel, buying web domains, and publishing websites, printing IDs and other citizen documentation, etc… (What on earth would be the payoff of such a hoax? It’s not even for publicity because until a year ago we weren’t actively seeking publicity, and even now we aren’t seeking a great deal of it.)</p>
<p>2. The UCA is a legitimate organization that is doing exactly what it says its doing, and you’ve just not heard of it before now.</p>
<p>For that matter, what makes an organization “real?” Is an organization that has numerous offices, employees, etc real? Does an organization that actively implements humanitarian aid programs, some of which in joint ventures with national government agencies, really exist “only in the minds of one or several people.”</p>
<p>I suppose you will have to decide that, since it is now my understanding that only people considered “established Wikipedians” will have their votes considered here, which precludes me from urging people who know more about the UCA, that while they may not be active contributers to Wikipedia use it on a regular basis, to come and vote here to keep the entry from being deleted. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrishkincade_cbe2.html" title="User:Trishkincade">Trishkincade</a></p>

<dd>The best way you can convince people is evidence. The only evidence we have that this organization even exists is your webpages and this article written by people from that organization.

<dd>I certainly think you have some compelling arguments, but I have to agree with <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> above... we need evidence. And I believe at the moment this is severly lacking. Consider from Wikipedia's guidelines on <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">article verification</a> under <b>Obscure Topics</b> (which I believe this, if legitimate, would fall under): <i>If an article covers a subject which has never been written about in published sources, or which has only been written about in sources of doubtful credibility, it is difficult to verify the information. To do so would require original research, and it has been agreed that Wikipedia is not a place to publish original research. Insistence on verifiability is often sufficient to exclude such articles.</i> You'll notice it states that articles can, and are, excluded because they can not be verified. Providing an EIN from the FAF is nice, but there's precious little information about the FAF itself and that being the case I would hardly consider it a reasonable resource to use for the verification of this article's content. Not to mention the difficulties in using it to verify the existance of the UCA. I hardly believe if I go to the FAF and demand payroll information related to the UCA I'm going to receive it. I notice your reference to <b><a href="http://www.tejo.org/angla/kontakto.jsp" class="external text" title="http://www.tejo.org/angla/kontakto.jsp" rel="nofollow">Kontakto</a></b> (which seems legitimate as far as I can tell, anyone else know anything about it?)... but once again I see it is lacking some vital information. If this magazine published an article about you, then surely you can provide us with the article's title, page numbers, the month or volume, the author of the article, etc. Provided with this information, your argument becomes significantly better. Now those of us screaming unverifiable will have something solid we can search for and conceivably find. Please let us know when that information is available. Until some verifiable, solid information is available I don't think the article meets the requirements necessary to keep it. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirGeneral_34ab.html" title="User:SirGeneral">SirGeneral</a> 23:25, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It actually seems to say that Chuck Smith acted as agent, and that the translation from the English was by somebody called Joel Amis. Anyway, regardless of Chuck Smith's exact personal involvement, this article is a manifesto <b>written by Trish Kincade</b>. And it is published by the Esperanto movement (who also provided the translation); they are clearly an interested party because of Trish Kincade's promise that the main language will be Esperanto (stated in the last sentence of the red introductory bit). To pass the test of noteworthiness, there should be some mention of them which is written and published by disinterested third parties. <b>Delete</b>. 80.229.160.150</li>

<dd>I'd say vote for delete, I like the idea, but it obviously isn't ready for such a long article. If the article was a stub mentioning the intensions, then maybe I'd vote to keep. PS.

<dd>I've taken the liberty of significatly shortening the article. Perhaps that is an adequate compromise to keep at least some vestige of the article here, rather than deleting it completely? <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrishkincade_cbe2.html" title="User:Trishkincade">Trishkincade</a></dd>

<dd>But at this stage it's still a vanity article, regardless of its length. <b>Delete</b> now.

<li><b>Keep.</b> If it was just one guy in Wisconsin, maybe that would make it a vanity article. But it would only be a vanity article until it expands.

<dd>But its mention in print was a manifesto by Trish Kincade herself. All that happened was that because they said they'd use Esperanto, Kontakto translated and published this manifesto for her. It isn't exactly as if an independent journalist wrote an article on them. I used to be in the Esperanto movement myself, so I know from experience how the Esperanto media will make a big deal of any expression of support for the language, no matter from how inconsequential a source, and this one seems to be no exception. The only people voting Keep here seem to be either the few people directly associated with the organisation (Trishkincade et al) or Esperantists (Chuck Smith, Cprompt). 80.229.160.150</dd>

<dd>You give two reasons why you don't think the article is vanity: (a) they seem to have several members, and (b) they were mentioned in print. Your point (b) has been dealt with by the above reply. Regarding (a), I think you are applying an unreasonably low threshold. If I were to create an article about a certain playground game I invented and played with a bunch of friends back at school, it would rightfully get deleted as vanity, but probably that game was known to more people than this organisation is. No, they would need to expand further before it were to stop being a vanity article, and <a href="../../../w/w/i/Wp%7Ewwin.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="Wp:wwin">who knows whether that will happen?</a>.

<li><b><i><a href="../../../m/a/n/Manifesto.html" title="Manifesto">Manifesto</a> is usually defined as a public declaration of principles and intentions, often political in nature. In context it is usually used to denote something that referrs to what an organization or group</i> plans <i>to do, rather than what they have done or are currently in the process of doing. There is an important difference there. The article in Kontakto was submitted to them</i> at thier request <i>and consisted of a press release outlining the history of the organization, what it has accomplished so far, and what projects it is currently involved in.</i></b></li>

<li>If I wrongly used the word <b>manifesto</b>, my intended point was nonetheless that it was something that you wrote yourself. That point still stands.

<dd>No, as I have mentioned before we had not made a habit of issuing press releases until we were asked to do so for Kontakto magazine. The Hegemony is not planning on issuing a press release regarding our diplomatic relations until the formal treaty for the UNOP Commission is signed, and the OHA Communications department is fully staffed, including a new press secretary. <i><b>(Speaking of which, the OHA is accepting Press Secretary applications, if anyone is interested LOL)</b></i><a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrishkincade_cbe2.html" title="User:Trishkincade">Trishkincade</a></dd>

<p>The UCA Allied Service has also actively participated in humanitarian aid programs, disaster relief, and assisting law enforcement agencies in combating slavery. <i><b>(exp: In 2003 the Allied Service participated in a joint endeavour with a county sheriffs department in Wisconsin to conduct a raid on a building where people were being held in captivity for labor (ie slavery).

<dd>No this was not covered in the local news. The women who were rescued did not want any publicity to further disrupt thier lives, and so a press release was never issued. (At the time we weren't really that prepared to deal with the kind of publicity that would have been generated by a press release on the incident anyway.) <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrishkincade_cbe2.html" title="User:Trishkincade">Trishkincade</a></dd>

<p>Currently the Allied Services, in direct coordination with the Freedom Alliance Foundation, are raising money and training personnel to send to South East Asia to implement some of the UCA's long term disaster relief and aid programs, which include the building of a large "creche" to serve as a home for many of the displaced and orphaned children currently living under deplorable conditions in underfunded orphanages and refugee camps.</p>

It has a few Allied Service offices in it. We're still in the process of moving all of our area offices into the building, so the interim capitol isn't fully staffed. Once it is, between ITRD Commission projects using most of the building for research and development, and the UCA political offices, the building will be staffed with over 300 people. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrishkincade_cbe2.html" title="User:Trishkincade">Trishkincade</a></dd>

<p>A previous version of this article and 6 related articles were nominated for deletion on 18 May 2005. (<a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Harmonics_Theory_9b87.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Harmonics Theory">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Harmonics Theory</a>). After much reflection, I concluded that the community concensus was to delete the current versions. During the discussion period, two sandbox versions were created. In the previous vote 4 people explicitly endorsed the first sandbox version, however, many of the objections raised about the original article could be said to apply equally to the sandbox version. Concensus on whether Wikipedia should have <i>any</i> article on this topic remained unclear. This is a procedural nomination specifically on the sandbox version(s).

<li>I recall the sandbox version being vastly superior to the article presented. The theory, no matter how left-field, is worthy of an article due to how well-known it is in certain fields. For those reasons, I think that it should be <b>kept</b>, though I acknowledge it may still need considerable work. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 01:39, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</i></small></font></li>
<li><b>Delete. No original research.</b> If it's well-known in "certain fields", why can't I find <b>any</b> references to it besides those written by Mr. Tomes himself? Where's the peer-review? Where are the verifiable sources on the subject <b>not</b> connected with Mr. Tomes (which includes negative reviews of the theory that are instigated by Mr. Tomes)? Actually, let me correct myself: there <i>is</i> a "harmonics theory" concerned with the effect of nonlinearities in electrical power systems - see <a href="http://engr.calvin.edu/PRibeiro_WEBPAGE/IEEE/ieee_cd/chapters/CHAP_2/c2toc/c2_frame.htm" class="external text" title="http://engr.calvin.edu/PRibeiro_WEBPAGE/IEEE/ieee_cd/chapters/CHAP_2/c2toc/c2_frame.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.jessler-gsell.de/DE/0_harmtheor.html" class="external text" title="http://www.jessler-gsell.de/DE/0_harmtheor.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. This has <b>nothing</b> to do with Mr. Tomes' <s>crackpottery</s> theory or this article. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESoundguy99_5970.html" title="User:Soundguy99">Soundguy99</a> 03:06, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Non-notable crackpottery of the kind that appears to be particularly seductive to those not well versed in the physical sciences. The sandbox article is better, but as always, we delete because of problems with the subject, not the article. This subject can't be rehabilitated into an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 05:30, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How so? There is no requirement that the model described by the article be correct for it to remain in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../n/_/r/N_ray.html" title="N ray">N ray</a> is perhaps the archetypical example of a model that is incorrect but noteworthy enough to show up in most science texts. The idea behind Wikipedia or any other encyclopedia is that someone wondering about a given topic (be it <a href="../../../l/i/m/Limestone.html" title="Limestone">limestone</a> or <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop-tarts.html" title="Pop-tarts">pop-tarts</a> or harmonics theory) can get a concise description of what it is. In this case, any NPOV article will be along the lines of "harmonics theory is a model that claims <i>X</i>, and that is not accepted by mainstream science". The only question is whether harmonics theory is notable enough for people to look for it in the first place.--<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 20:21, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As you say, <a href="../../../n/_/r/N_ray.html" title="N ray">N ray</a> is notable enough to show up in most science texts. What science texts is <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harmonics_Theory_c757.html" title="Harmonics Theory">Harmonics Theory</a> notable enough to show up in? You are seriously proposing that Wikipedia be the first encyclopedia and in fact the first respected reference of any kind to write up this crankery? That's the very definition of original research. If the physics community has no interest in exploring or debunking Harmonics Theory, it is the height of arrogance for WP to decide that it has notability that the experts themselves do not grant. I assume you're familiar with <a href="../../../e/n/r/Enrico_Fermi_bd69.html" title="Enrico Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a>'s famous put down, "It's not even wrong". I think that applies well to Harmonics Theory. (Oops, I see that linas beat me to it. It was Fermi, not Erdos.) For crank theories like this, being included in a serious wikipedia article is like winning the lottery. Some crank science is notable enough that it should be included in WP because of notoriety or widespread public discussion (for example, <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Cube_3125.html" title="Time Cube">Time Cube</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_Design_39cd.html" title="Intelligent Design">Intelligent Design</a>), but WP should not provide a soapbox for non-notable crankery to try to gain legitimacy. I have no ill will toward you, and I realize that you had to work hard to try to create an encyclopedic article out of the idiocy that was the original text. Unfortunately I just don't think it belongs in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 05:21, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Abstain</b> again.</s> Mostly, this boils down to difficulty demonstrating either that HT is or isn't notable.
<ul>
<li>Arguments for deletion:
<ol>
<li>Notability status is controversial (per previous VfD discussion). Certainly it isn't referenced much outside the discussions of cycles enthusiasts.</li>
<li>As the /Sandbox version wasn't acceptable to at least one person with strong feelings on the issue, it seems likely that contested edits by both sides will occur in the future, making the viability of the article questionable.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Arguments against deletion:
<ol>
<li>The /Sandbox version I created is, to the best of my ability to create, something encyclopedic and NPOV, that doesn't itself contain original research.</li>
<li>If harmonics theory is deemed notable, or at least is hard to demonstrate to be non-notable, then the article has merit.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>I'm puzzled at statements that the /Sandbox version is original research, as it provides a second-hand reporting of the views held by Mr. Tomes and the followers he controversially cites, as opposed to containing the vast amount of original discussion of the model that the original version had.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I see multiple problems: 1) There does not seem to be a community of scholars pursuing this topic. That makes it "original research". 2) its dressed in pseudo-scientific clothing, while asking to be taken seriously. This means its intellectually dishonest and intentionally misleading. 3) It makes wild-eyed unfounded assertions. If the first sentence of the article said something like "Harmonics theory is a wacky but popular bit of pseudoscientific culture jamming...", then there might be grounds for accepting as an article. But it doesn't appear to be popular, and it sure ain't <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_jamming.html" title="Culture jamming">culture jamming</a>. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 22:39, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>I could understand these objections if made to the original harmonics theory article, but I frankly fail to see how you derive these statements from the current version (formerly Harmonics Theory/Sandbox). To address your specific statements:
<ol>
<li>The original version of harmonics theory was indeed <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>. The version at Harmonics Theory/Sandbox2 still is, as it contains a lengthy presentation that duplicates much of the information in Mr. Tomes's web documents. I fail to see how the current harmonics theory page is <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a> - it presents a concise summary of the claims and mechanism without going into any form of derivations or detail. To call it a republishing of Mr. Tomes' work is an exaggeration of extreme proportions.</li>
<li>The current harmonics theory article (formerly Harmonics Theory/Sandbox) makes no claim that harmonics theory be taken seriously. To the contrary, where the summarized claims of harmonics theory are listed, the discrepancy between these claims and the view held by the vast majority of scientists is clearly noted. Any sane person reading this article will correctly perceive that the tenets of harmonics theory are not accepted by most scientists. What is misleading about this?</li>
<li>I fail to see any "wild-eyed unfounded assertations" in the present version of harmonics theory. As far as I can tell, you're still looking at the old version (written by Mr. Tomes).</li>

<li>To rebut:</li>
<li>1. The article itself states that it is original research: <i>Harmonics theory has been embraced, to a small extent, by individuals and groups interested in non-mainstream, "alternative" science, but not enough for others to work on or extend it.</i> If no one else is bothering to pursue the thing, then it is original research.<a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 00:12, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Let me try to explain this concept to you as simply as I can: An article containing <a href="../../../k/l/i/Klingon.html" title="Klingon">Klingon</a> <a href="../../../o/p/e/Opera.html" title="Opera">opera</a> would be original work. An article noting that Klingon opera has been composed would not be. Am I making this distinction sufficiently clear? If an encyclopedia article about HT is to exist at all, it must present enough information about HT to indicate what HT is, so that readers can decide whether to bother following links to external information. I believe that the current version of harmonics theory has pared back HT-related material to the minimum possible while satisfying that constraint.

Its possible that the article on N-rays is poorly structured; I did not study it carefully. N-rays deserve an article because its an infamous episode in the history of physics research that most young physics students learn about. The HT article is misleading by presenting the subject matter as if it were science, when it is not.

What's actually happened is that Mr. Tomes has claimed that HT predicts them while not showing any form of derivation from the physical properties of the systems involved, either in response to my requests or those of his Usenet critics. Thus, saying "HT predicts X" is considerably less accurate than "HT claims to predict X". Similarly, it does seem to meet the definition listed under <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a> (claimed by its proponents to follow the scientific method, claimed by most other people to not, very limited following), so I'm puzzled as to why this was removed if the article is to be NPOV. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 04:56, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>The present version is full of garbage. Saying "it is claimed" everywhere does not make something NPOV. It makes it wrong when the evidence is incontovertable, such as in the case where Christopher states that I claimed to predict a particle of mass 34.8 Mev. I *did* predict a particle of mass 34.76 Mev before the discovery of a particle. The evidence still exists in google and the link is in the page Harmonics Theory/Sandbox2. There are many other similar errors in the main article now. I would rather have that page deleted as it is rubbish for anyone who wants to seriously investigate Harmonics Theory as many do. Harmonics Theory/Sandbox2 should be made the main page and people should discuss the necessary changes to make that acceptable. My vote is to <b>change to</b> Harmonics Theory/Sandbox2 and make the necessary changes to satisfy people of NPOV. See also Talk:Harmonics Theory for many more criticisms of the present article. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayTomes_e0c9.html" title="User:RayTomes">Ray Tomes</a> 02:39, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>In my opinion, the changes you wish to make (Harmonics Theory/Sandbox2) will land this article right back into <b>vanity/original research</b> territory, which is what got the original article deleted.

The Tomes article has generated a lot of quite disproportionate controversy &amp; having looked at his web pages, he does seem to have something, a something that might be treading on a few established toes.

<li><b>KEEP</b> latest version (edited from Sandbox2). I have been reading a bit of physics recently dating back to 1920s (the 'Born Einstein Letters' are very interesting). Significantly there is quite a lot of references to de Broglie and Schrodinger, and the wave nature of matter (Schrodinger was very unhappy with Born's probability wave interpretation, believing that matter was a wave structure of space). My point in mentioning this is that 80 years on, Physics still faces many problems, and the wave aspects of matter have largely been ignored (Milo Wolff and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carver_Mead_f52e.html" title="Carver Mead">Carver Mead</a> are two notable exceptions). So it seems to me that it is important that these wave aspects of matter interactions are explored and their knowledge presented in Wikipedia. And one very central aspect of wave interactions is Harmonics Theory. I find the latest version of the page to be well written, in a sensible matter of fact style that suits an encyclopedia entry, so I think it is important that the page is kept.

After being replaced by the original sandbox2 page somewhat modified, it has had 5/7 votes for keep. This supports my contention that it is a better page. Several people have criticised the style of this later page. It would be very helpful if they actually quoted the parts that offend them and said why. Then the page could be ammended to be more acceptable. I repeat that saying NPOV!

During the second, current VfD, sandbox received 2 supporting and 6 negative votes, and those negative votes were based on the twin objections of <b>original research</b> and <b>non-notability</b>; the negative votes felt the article was still below the bar of acceptability. After your wholesale replacement of the page, sandbox2 got 5 positive votes, 3 from suspiciously new and single-minded contributors (<i>i.e.</i>, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppet_9d8b.html#.22Meatpuppets.22" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppet">meatpuppets</a>), 3 new negative votes, and one previous positive vote changed to a negative vote.

</ul>
This is a closing statement by me aimed at those that will sit in judgement. Most of the objections to the article are not really about presentation. They are an objection to its mere presence. The most oftenly made statements are along the lines that: it is not published in peer-reviewed journals; it is "original research" meaning not published elsewhere; that it is crackpot or rubbish; that claims are made that are not supported. I suggest that the correct reason for the deletion votes is <b>I didn't learn about that at school</b>. That is unfortunate, but it is not too late to learn now&#160;:-)
<ul>
<li>The claim of unsupported assertions is difficult to deal with because when supporting material was added it (not surprisingly) increased the size of the article. When it got too big it was split, and this too was criticised and a reduction requested. How can these criticisms possibly both be met?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Peer reviewed journals. There exist no peer-reviewed journals relating to cycles. The FSC did have one which ceased publication before Harmonics Theory was ever published. Something that I am fairly sure is not understood by anyone here that has voted for deletion is that there is a very substantial body of interdisciplinary cycles research from <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_R_Dewey_45eb.html" title="Edward R Dewey">Edward R Dewey</a>, Alexander Chizhevsky, Raymond Wheeler, Piccardi, Simon Shnoll and others that show that there are a lot of things happening in the universe that are not explicable by any existing theories before HT. For those that want to investigate this, I strongly recommend reading the excellent paper by Edward R Dewey available at <a href="http://www.cyclesresearchinstitute.org/dewey/case_for_cycles.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cyclesresearchinstitute.org/dewey/case_for_cycles.pdf" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>. Dewey was a very careful researcher and took frequent advice from statisticians, physicists and others (as you will see in the article). AFAIK, there does not exist in the world today a living English speaking person that would be capable of being an adequate referee for a physics journal for this material. Therefore it ought to be accepted that it is impossible to meet this request and the question of original research examined instead.</li>

<li>Original research is defined as quote: "It does not refer to original research that is published or available elsewhere (although such research may be excluded if editors consider the source to be disreputable or inappropriate)". This does not apply to the Harmonics Theory. It has been published elsewhere. It has been published by the Foundation for the Study of Cycles (in its time the foremost organisation concerned with cycles) in its conference proceedings. It has been published in the proceedings of a number of other conferences, including ones supported by Apeiron Journal and a Sierra Nevada University in California. I have spoken on the Harmonics Theory in conferences: FSC, Irvine, California; FSC, Princeton; Russian Academy of Sciences, Pushchino, Russia (this was a special seminar on Harmonics Theory only); Cycles conference, Stavropol, Russia; Moscow University, Moscow; Sierra Nevada University, California; FSMN Auckland, New Zealand; and others. Without exception I have received high praise from these audiences ranging from "this is the best presentation of cycles that we have ever heard", "you should be given a nobel prize" and from a group of physicists, astronomers and bio-physicists "we are convinced there is something in your theory". Many of these conference proceedings have been published. In Stavropol I was an invited keynote speaker to a conference with perhaps 500 participants. Such invitations are not issued to crackpots.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Claims <i>are</i> supported. After Christopher Thomas criticised my claims re prediction of a new particle, I found that my post to google is still able to be seen from 1994, before the discovery of a particle was reported in 1995. I also showed that despite his claim that it is not a particle, the words particle are used by the original paper and later ones. In fact a search on google for "particle 33.9 Mev" finds more than a thousand references. The Harmonics Theory has considerably more succesful explanations and verified predictions than GR had until some 40 years after GR was first put forward. There are also a number of new tests with clear predictions of Harmonics Theory that have been put forward. Much of this has not been put in the article because of requests for restricting space.
<ul>
<li>The various people, including me, who question your predictions mainly object to the fact that they seem to be pulled out of thin air, as opposed to being derived by the usual manner of applying the model of a new concept to a <i>physical model of the phenomenon being studied</i>. I've tried to explain this to you several times, but you appear to not be willing to accept that this is needed for a scientific prediction. Regarding the KARMEN paper, despite multiple attempts at explanation, you don't seem to understand what the paper is actually saying. It doesn't claim that the particle interpretation it proposes is correct - merely that it <b>might</b> be correct, or might <b>not</b> be, while suggesting follow-up research to settle the question. I have several published, refereed papers under my belt - believe me when I tell you that I know how the process works. Finally, please consider the possibility that when a large number of people are concerned with the methods you've used to draw your conclusions, that their concern might actually be well-founded. If you apply a properly rigorous approach to your research, you might find that your work is more accepted. Among other things, this involves fully deriving predictions in the way that I've described to you, and when announcing (and publishing) results, starting out with the assumption that they're <b>not</b> the result of your model, and methodically examining and ruling out other explanations until only your model remains. Claiming that there are no alternate interpretations merely suggests that you haven't considered any, which is frowned upon. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 07:54, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>When I added extra pages to give the derivation of the mathematics and the redshift in greater detail this was criticised. The explanation of the redshift prediction is clearly contained in the two parts (1) Mathematical derivation of harmonics (which has been fully researched and checked by PRF Brown) and is presented in its entirety in the first diagram of the current page (the rest is just arithmetic but was deleted in the first round) and (2) The redshift recognition that the fundamental wave corresponds to a frequency halving (z=1). If you are looking for a whole lot of complicated differential equations, there aren't any. Redshifts are predicted for (1+z)^H=2 where H is a strong harmonic. That is it. I attached a graph that shows the exact spectrum but that was on a page that has been deleted. Isn't it ironic that the only person here that has actually checked the maths of this has had his vote disallowed for being new. He came on wikipedia to place the harmonics theory article and was not allowed to vote for it to be kept. This means that wikipedia policies are not working. I intend to look at this aspect of wikipedia policy after the dust settles. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayTomes_e0c9.html" title="User:RayTomes">Ray Tomes</a> 22:56, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

To make that demonstration <b>does</b> require the "complicated differential equations" that you seem to object so strongly to, as without <i>showing</i> that your idea of how harmonics interact springs forth from the dynamics of the system you're applying it to, you end up lacking a rather critical part of the foundation for your subsequent claims. When writing your math page, you put a lot of effort into answering a question that wasn't asked, while continuing to not address the one that was. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 23:02, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Christopher, I never claimed that "harmonics interact with each other", that is <b>your</b> claim. I told you that it is wrong and that you had not understood. Waves generate harmonics because of <i>non-linearity</i>. These harmonically related waves then do the same. There are two aspects to the theory that should be understood:
<ul>
<li>Firstly, the idea that that waves generate harmonics in the manner described is taken as an axiom. This is just as Einstein did with the speed of light in all reference frames. He looked at what happens if this assumption is made. In both HT and SR the consequences of the axiom are a wealth of explanations of previous problems and verified predictions of new phenomena. This is what sets HT apart from things like the big bang which invariable fails in its predictions and needs tinkering and epicycles. There are no complicated differential equations in this part, just combinatorials. In both SR and HT the axiom is able to be understood in terms of existing theory once some mental blocks are removed. In the case of SR the mental blocks are still there in the general community as you are probably well aware.</li>
<li>Secondly, it is desirable to see how HT fits with existing physics. That is a difficult job and not claimed by me to be fully accomplished. I have listed the areas that need more attention, but that material has been deleted. In the case of GR and QM the fitting together is still not accomplished to everyone's satisfaction, so this should be no surprise. Complicated differential equations <b>are</b> likely to be required to achieve such a union of domains. I have made and can make more suggestions in this regard but it is well beyond the scope of a simple article. It simply needs noting with something like "The question of how HT might mesh with GR is an open question". But it is in general accord with GR but not the big bang. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayTomes_e0c9.html" title="User:RayTomes">Ray Tomes</a> 00:23, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Claims of Crackpottery, Pseudoscience etc. - Ignorant people state such things when they have no logical arguments. One such ignorant person made a "list of crackpots" in about 1994 with my name on it. One person complained that he was <b>not</b> on that list. He said that he too was an original thinker and deserved a mention. He was added. The list includes genuine crackpots and good researchers. This list has been perpetuated over many years. I challenged a particle physicist who had a copy on his site. He spent three months investigating the particle prediction mentioned above and his conclusion was that my prediction was justified by Harmonics Theory. He agree that I was practicing science, was not a crackpot, and saw that it was just a different branch of science than what he was familiar with. There have been several other similar cases with physicists and astronomers.</li>

<li>There is no such thing as a proven theory; all theories are unproven. However Harmonics Theory is as well established by its successful predictions which cannot be made by any other theory (Thomas point above) as GR is. It has been accepted as highly useful by a number of qualified people. An encyclopedia should contain exactly this sort of thing so that people that hear about it or are searching for related concepts can find out more. If an encyclopedia does not include articles on lesser known areas of knowledge then it is quite useless. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayTomes_e0c9.html" title="User:RayTomes">Ray Tomes</a> 22:56, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>People who quickly form opinions after a glance or two at articles that are in fields that they know nothing about and then vote for deletion are not performing a service for wikipedia. If wikipedia is to only have the LCM of what people know then it does not serve its intended function. People want to look up an encyclopaedia to find out answers to questions that they do <i>not</i> know the answers to. That means using experts wisely. It means presenting material that not everyone agrees with, but labelling it as such. I refer to the <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">astrology</a> article. This is almost unreadable because the anti-astrology astronomers and physicists (who actually have never done any study of astrology) put so many disclaimers on everything. It is enough to mention once at the start that astronomers and physicists believe astrology to be bunk and that they have also never studied it. That is the truth. Then leave it to the astrologers - it is their subject and they may be deluded, but they have a mass delusion that they can agree about and that is what people go to that article for. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayTomes_e0c9.html" title="User:RayTomes">Ray Tomes</a> 06:39, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>An encyclopedia is <b>not</b> a scientific document. It is about all branches of human knowledge and astrology as it is practiced is such a branch. The fact that it is bunk is not relevant to its right to be in an encyclopedia. You do want your beliefs reported as fact - give the same right to others with a single disclaimer at the front. If you disagree with this, then would you accept the same sort of thing being done to the big bang article as the astrology one? I can promise you that it has an equally large number of unsupportable statements. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayTomes_e0c9.html" title="User:RayTomes">Ray Tomes</a> 22:56, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The big bang has been peer-reviwed and has stood the test of time. Astrology has not; neither has Harmonics Theory. <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">Wikipedia:Cite sources</a>. It's unfortuniate that the scientists involved can't find a place to get the research peer-reviwed. But it's really not our problem. It is Wikipedia policy that facts must be verifiable or presented in as high unverifiable (like <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astrology.html" title="Astrology">Astrology</a>).

<li>The problem is not _when_ you made your claim. The problem is that your claim was never a scientifically derived prediction, for reasons which I've tried to explain to you repeatedly. You will find that you actually _do_ need to show the steps that I've mentioned if you want a prediction to be taken seriously. Otherwise it looks like you pulled arbitrary numbers out of the air until you got a match by chance (which folds back to the "cherry picking" problem mentioned on the talk pages).

<li>Christopher,you have changed your story and claim repeatedly on just this one issue. And you never acknowledge your errors. When you say "you actually _do_ need to show the steps that I've mentioned" you are a pretender. Your claim was entirely different. How can I add material that shows how I derived the prediction when I am fighting a rearguard action of having it all deleted as fast as I add it? I am happy to add material showing exactly how I derived the prediction, although much of it is already in the original prediction sci.physics article in 1994. But you are not really looking for what you say. You are really slinging mud. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayTomes_e0c9.html" title="User:RayTomes">Ray Tomes</a> 00:01, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The big bang predicted a CMBR of 50 K. Before that Eddington predicted 3 K based purely on the temperature of intergalactic space resulting from scattered starlight. Now the big bang is claiming an accurate prediction! It is bunk. The explanation has been known nearly 70 years and needed no big bang theory that is out by over an order of magnitude. What you find in articles on the big bang is revisionist history not the facts. It fails every test and a new epicycle is added.

I put this somewhere before, but cannot find it, so am adding something similar again. <b>My request to anyone that would pass judgement on Harmonics Theory is that they read this article first.</b> <a href="http://www.cyclesresearchinstitute.org/dewey/case_for_cycles.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cyclesresearchinstitute.org/dewey/case_for_cycles.pdf" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> The Case for Cycles by Edward Dewey (0.9 MB pdf file). This 36 page document is a review of Dewey's findings over 25 years. He followed the format suggested by nobel physicist Richard Feynman. This is really the CYCLES BIBLE and is a must read for all serious students of cycles. From Cycles magazine 1967. If people vote on deletion or carry out deletion without reading this, then they certainly do it from a place of ignorance. The fact is that most people are not aware of interdisciplinary cycles research and the tremendous results it has achieved. Dewey is foremost of those achieving these results. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayTomes_e0c9.html" title="User:RayTomes">Ray Tomes</a> 00:32, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)
