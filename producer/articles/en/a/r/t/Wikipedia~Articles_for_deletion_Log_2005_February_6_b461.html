<p>Thanks Niteowlneils&#160;:-) This is a list of street names of drugs. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a slang or idiom guide</a> and the article is a plain list without encyclopedic contents.

<li>Either <b>keep this content</b> at this page, or move it over to List of street names of drugs. Of the two lists, this one was certainly done better. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 00:15, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>We should have an article on "street name" in the non-drug sense. Some owners of shares of publicly traded companies choose to have their stock held in the name of their broker-dealer rather than in their own name. The issuing company sends dividend checks, annual reports, etc., to the broker-dealer instead of directly to the shareholder. Such stock is said to be held in <b>street name</b>. Googling for "street name" +stock produces more than 70,000 hits. I'd say: move this content to List of street names of drugs, then make <a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_name.html" title="Street name">street name</a> a stub about the financial meaning, with a note directing people to the drug article. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 08:03, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Mostly concur. Merge this to List of street names of drugs, turn this article into the financial sense, with a note at the top cross-referring to the drugs one. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 08:26, Feb 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I feel that deleting this article is unjustified. It accurately represents the definition of queg that me and many of the people I know would consider to be the correct one, and there have been no contesting definitions. <i>(this is a left-over from an earlier attempt to vote for deletion of this page made by 82.32.54.39) (cacycle)</i></li>

<li>I've heard of "seshes" and "the munchies". But obviously I'm not in the select few hundred people on the entire planet that have heard of "quegg".

<li><b>Delete</b>. A biographical article should mention birth-dates, accomplishments, etc. When someone finds himself writing an article about a person that just mentions one fact about him, in this case one fact that is currently in the news, it should trigger the question: should I be writing an article about this person, should I be looking for an article into which I can insert the one interesting fact about him, or should I be writing a new article on <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journalistic_ethics.html" title="Journalistic ethics">Journalistic ethics</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_of_the_press.html" title="Freedom of the press">Freedom of the press</a> (which already exist in this case) which might be a suitable place to mention this information? If you decide one of the latter and mention the person in an existing or new general article, a Google search on your guy will probably turn up that place. It isn't necessary to have an article dedicated to him. We need to have some kind of concept of an "index". Encyclopedias have them. Redirect pages don't quite work the same way. It shouldn't be necessary to keep proliferating one-fact articles, when all we really need is the ability to index mentions of people and things in other articles. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 22:04, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

If the outcome of the vote is a consensus to delete, the article will be deleted whether or not it has meanwhile been redirected by GRider. I would say, however, that the redirect while the vote is in progress makes it more cumbersome for editors to read the article and learn any facts it might contain which bear on the school's notability.

<li>IMO the only thing can be said is kind of promotional and boasting stuff. The term implies that the rest of the design doesn't care about any values, and only these smart guys (who coined the term) decided to put (or find) some value into mindless and valueless world of design. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 21:03, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"valueless world of design"?? sounds like your criticism is just that you don't agree with the premise of this perspective. that's a POV, but not a reason to omit an entry. that'd be like deleting the entry on <a href="../../../p/o/s/Postmodernism.html" title="Postmodernism">postmodernism</a> just becuase you don't agree with the theory. Having an entry on VID is not "promotional" nor "boasting" - its a multi-disciplinary academic field that deserves description. Its practioners don't imply that the "rest of the design" (whatever you mean by that) doesn't care about values - the purpose of the field is make the value-implications of design apparent. Just as scholars of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Participatory_design.html" title="Participatory design">participatory design</a> might be interested in "usability," scholars interested in Values In Design also point to the importance of "autonomy," "freedom from bias," "trust" or other values of moral/ethical import in the design of a technology.

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Absolutely not: Wikipedia is very explicitly <b>not</b> a place for "any idea that a person might come across, no matter how obscure." Wikipedia is intended to be an encyclopedia within the recognizable meaning of the word. It is a secondary source which documents well understood, well accepted, knowledge. A controversial topic may be encyclopedic by virtue of being widely held or notable; complex belief systems that are held by large numbers of people are covered in detail. Emerging concepts, new artistic movements, promising bands, recently released political books, and "memes on the rise" are not.

</li>
<li>First, please be more careful with words: "term" vs "idea". The term may be acepted, while the idea may not. Second, wikipedia is for things of notablility, not a junkyard of all possible ideas. But we are discussing the specific article. I claim that the <b>term</b> "ViD" is hardly notable. I can coin scores of such: "virtue in design", "humanity in design", etc., all relecting basically the same idea. the question is: if the idea is notable, what is the notable term for it? <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 03:35, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The reason that I recommended redirecting to <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Quayle_b44e.html" title="Dan Quayle">Dan Quayle</a> is that the spelling bee incident is usually what people are referring to when spelling it as <i>potatoe</i>, at least in my experience. It wasn't an example of a POV or insult. – <a href="../../../b/e/g/User%7EBeginning_2e6d.html" title="User:Beginning">Beginning</a> 21:15, Feb 6, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Redirecting <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potatoe.html" title="Potatoe">potatoe</a> to <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Quayle_b44e.html" title="Dan Quayle">Dan Quayle</a> is neither POV nor insulting. The particular association of this word with this person is a simple matter of fact, not a point of view. It is a fact that some people associate the word with the person significantly more so than mis-spellings are generally associated with particular people. (The author of the article and pretty much all of the participants here apparently do, for starters.) The insult would be to say that Dan Quayle <i>is</i> a potatoe (or even a potato). But a redirect does not <i>necessarily</i> imply identity, especially since redirects can result from <a href="../../../d/a/_/WP%7EDA_a8a0.html" title="WP:DA">mergers</a>, and shouldn't be assumed to imply it. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 03:43, 2005 Feb 7 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Given the obvious disagreement of where it should redirect, I think I've done what's necessary and sufficient by rewriting the article to read as follows, to serve both those readers who have innocently made the same mistake as Dan Quayle, and those who are looking it up specifically in search of a description of the Dan Quayle incident. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 23:10, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I see problems with redirecting to <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potato.html" title="Potato">Potato</a> in its present state. Two classes of users might look up <i>potatoe:</i> A) those who are simply making the same mistake <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Quail_b990.html" title="Dan Quail">Dan Quail</a> made, and B) those who are using it as an entry point for the Dan Quaille incident, perhaps because they can remember how Dan Quale spelled "potato" better than they can remember the correct spelling of his name.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Currently, the way the <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potato.html" title="Potato">Potato</a> article is structured, the class B user redirected to <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potato.html" title="Potato">Potato</a> might well be baffled. It's not obvious at a glance that the page really will lead them to what they seek. If they don't give up right away, and can't guess that <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potato.html#Miscellany" title="Potato">Miscellany</a> is the right subtopic, they will need to scroll down and skim past six screensful of Burbank russets and shepherd's pie before reaching the link to Dan Quayl.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>We could solve this by moving the brief Dann Quail note-and-link to the <i>top</i> of the <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potato.html" title="Potato">Potato</a> page, but we then annoy class C—the users interested in potatoes, who are now confronted by a crumb of J.

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My feeling is that <i>potatoe</i> is truly ambiguous in that it can be either a simple misspelling or a reference to a famous news item, and therefore a disambiguation-like page is appropriate. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 14:00, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>The article is not finished</b>. I plan to add at least twice as much and streamline (cleanup) the rest according to your definition of style. Sephira: You seem to avoid putting too many links on a page, perhaps for pragmatic reasons, perhaps for private estetic reasons - in which case I would argue if such law is appropriate in so colourful community.</li>
<li>One can argue about <i>empyrical evidence</i>, but it's little unfair, becase we lack the machinery to read people thoghts and provide a transcript, like telephone wiretap order result.

Ask yourself in presence of <b>evidence</b>, why not?</li>
<li>It's <b>not original research</b>, 90% of the idea is copied directly from the book, I only streamlined it and fixed in places where it didn't <i>click</i>.</li>
<li>I am planning to <b>add quotes from the book</b> to give some reference and flavour (it show very interesting technique of presenting narration, in scenes when Ariste is talking or working with the <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daimonion.html" title="Daimonion">daimonions</a> and many things happen at the same time). The daimonion concept is a central plot device and is so brilliant <b>I</b>n <b>M</b>y <b>V</b>ery <b>H</b>umble <b>O</b>pinion, that it <b>deserves to be mentioned separate from the book</b>. Hence, <b>it deserves a separate article</b>.</li>

Even if it then proceeded to elaborate on that plot device in the context of the novel, the article should be deleted, since we don't need separate articles for things invented by novelists for their creations, unless they become more generally notable (e.g. <a href="../../../g/r/o/Grok.html" title="Grok">grok</a>).

<li>Comment: It makes me sad to notice that articles touching on human sexual behaviour are voted to be deleted much easier than articles on other subjects, no matter how unimportant in an "encyclopedic" sense they are. I hope no one makes his judgement by his personal disgust against an article. I addmit that these things have been a problem on Internet. The problem is to find correct and objective information on sexual behaviour related things when wanted and only when wanted, and I see Wikipedia as the best place for this. wikipedia being the worlds number one source for objective information. --<a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEasyas12c_219d.html" title="User:Easyas12c">Easyas12c</a> 17:39, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Comment: I don't think a general encyclopedia needs to probe the outer reaches of weirdness when it comes to human behaviour in general, or sexuality specifically. For example, I'm sure there are a variety of different forms of <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannibalism.html" title="Cannibalism">Cannibalism</a>, and we could disgust almost everybody (and fascinate a few, I suppose) by having articles describing each of them in detail. This article isn't quite that bad, but flatuphilia must be several standard deviations from the norm of sexual behaviour. If you have some evidence that it isn't, then by all means present it. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 17:49, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Apparently between inclusionists and people who believe essentially that all forms of sexual behaviour are notable and fit for an encyclopedia article, Wikipedia <b>is</b>, in fact, going to be the on-line Encyclopedia of Unusual Sexual Practices. I don't know if this is because fetishists are over-represented amongst Wikipedia editors or whether it is a bending-over-backwards to be open-minded. Hopefully the latter. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 17:37, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> It is safe to assume that most people with paranormal thoughts/desires who cannot express them outwardly will seek refuge as anonymous internet users; they usually become heavy users. So it is logical to follow that the percentage of fetishists within the online community is MUCH higher than that of the offline population. This argument could answer BM's question of fetishists being over-represented amongst wikipedians; but could also be used as a supporting notion to Keep the article since wikipedia is an <b>online</b> encyclopedia which serves the online community with all its deviations.I personally don't support this because I think wikipedia should represent the better side of the online community and not the darker. I think that the result will be in favor of keeping the article which is a shame really because wikipedia will lose credibility when an article like this pops up as a random page on some innocent first-time-user's screen. <a href="../../../o/m/a/User%7EOmar_Filini_43d3.html" title="User:Omar Filini">Omar Filini</a> 18:19, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It amazes me how people describe entities as notable or not notable based on google search results! As I said the internet is a great medium for the spread of pornography, especially perverse pornography .. and thus you will find that almost all of your wildest sexual fantasies are found notably by google the great! You will get 105,000 search results for Fart Fetish (Notable) but only 59,000 search results for Nobel Laureate <a href="../../../n/a/g/Naguib_Mahfouz_211a.html" title="Naguib Mahfouz">Naguib Mahfouz</a> (less notable) and just 13,700 for Dr <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Nujoma_aa29.html" title="Sam Nujoma">Sam Nujoma</a>, The president of Namibia (Much less Notable) ... Does Wikipedia benefit from propagting pornography in the same way that pornographic sites do??? I bet not, but you know, THAT is PRECISELY why you will find so much porn on the web!! not because it is Notable!! but because it is a business!! and no one will pay to read a webpage about <a href="../../../t/o/g/Togo.html" title="Togo">Togo</a>'s or <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algeria.html" title="Algeria">Algeria</a>'s president, simply because they contain REAL factual information that is not for profit and will thus be selectively propagated! so the 8150 reasons argument is truly falacious! if Wikipedia editors will cast their votes based solely on google search results, then wikipedia will just be a well written version of the whole internet with all its rubbish .. and just a few of its gems concealed within the folds of pornographic and commercial information. <a href="../../../o/m/a/User%7EOmar_Filini_43d3.html" title="User:Omar Filini">Omar Filini</a> 01:30, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Centauri I really agree with you, and I believe in including all sorts of information on wikipedia!

<p>IMMUNE SYSTEM This page needs to be deleted because most of it is factually incorrect. Every sentence on the page is mistaken or misguided. Two examples: It talks about the alternative complement cascade as involving C2, C3, and C4. This is PLAINLY WRONG. It talks about the "B" in B-cells as meaning "Bone Marrow", Again this is WRONG. ALL blood cells originate in the bone marrow, not just B cells. It talks about not knowing how the immune system distinguishes "self" from "nonself". But we know EXACTLY how that happens. It talks about innate v. learned immune systems yet gets it wrong again.It talks about neutrophils completly incorrectly. It goes on and on and EVERY sentence contains a factual error or a misguided notion of what the immune system is. It is INCORRECT everywhere it puts words on the page. ANYONE can check this by looking at a good immunological reference text. Please, it is an Embarrasment to your organisation.</p>

<p>Ahhh...look, I did in fact insert some factual elements into the page to illustrate the point...Please keep the page then, but make it a stem and start again. Believe me, what is there is utter rubbish. Completely misguided and misleading. ALL of it is mistaken. It is an extremely poor attempt to describe the immune system and reflects badly on Wikepedia. I have NO time to do it. Those in the Wikepedia organisation should be concerned about this type of garbage masquerading as fact and should be able to look after it themselves. But please in the interests of truth and reputation DO something about this page.

<p>A 26-year-old who was born last year. Google yields lots of hits for various people with that name, including, for example, a Mr. Cristian Villalobos who is <i>Superintendencia de Valores y Seguros, Chile</i>. The article fails to cite sources and thus gives no indication as to which particular one of them it is purporting to be about. It also fails to establish notability. I'd rewrite, but I have not discovered enough about the other Cristian Villaloboses to determine whether any of them are notable. Moreover, from the talk page:</p>

The result of the debate was DELETE.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, in my experience Joy is scrupulously fair when closing votes, and I support her decision at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Joeflynn_690a.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Joeflynn">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Joeflynn</a>.

<p>This article was on VfD 2005-01-05 and the admin closing the case decided on "no consensus". I don't think the article has improved since and the main contributor opposes merging to <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perpetual_motion.html" title="Perpetual motion">perpetual motion</a>. He now "clarifies" in the article, that it doesn't fall <i>within the definitions of perpetual motion typically offered</i>. So, seemingly, it falls into other definitions of perpetual motion, obviously the weasel-worded ones which will be accepted by the US PTO. He further clarifies, that he can't give further explainations, due to non-disclosure agreements and the like.</p>
<p>In summary, I strongly suggest deleting this article as quackery, and will be the first re-adding it to the Wikipedia, if and when Parallel Path becomes a commercial success and/or gets a publication in an IEEE Journal or another serious source.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. It seems that on the previous occasion the article was submitted to VfD under the title Joeflynn. (See <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Joeflynn_690a.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Joeflynn">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Joeflynn</a>.) Admin <a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoy_Stovall_1ade.html" title="User:Joy Stovall">Joy Stovall</a> processed the vote. It seems to have been Delete:7 (counting the nominator, who unfortunately didn't actually vote, but did say it was original research, or a hoax); Merge:1; Keep:3 (2 were marginal/weak keeps, and one was the author of the article, who at that point had only edited this article and the VfD on it.) This was construed by Joy as "no consensus to delete"; but she did change the title to Parallel Path, with the comment that Joeflynn was a nonsense title. I think the conclusion that there was no consensus was surprising, and that Joy was rather bending over backwards to keep the article. To arrive at a "no consensus" conclusion, she had to (1) count the Merge as a Keep; (2) give no consideration to the fact that 2 of the 3 keep votes were "weak"; (3) perhaps not count the nominators comment as a Delete; (4) ignore the fact that the only strong vote to keep was from the author; and (5) not have an opinion herself (or have a Keep opinion). If admins interpret this situation as "no consensus to delete", it looks like it basically has to be unanimous except for the author to delete an article. Hopefully, this time it can be deleted. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 18:27, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>To be fair to <a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoy_Stovall_1ade.html" title="User:Joy Stovall">Joy_Stovall</a>: A Merge <i>is</i> a Keep, as after a <a href="../../../d/a/_/WP%7EDA_a8a0.html" title="WP:DA">merger</a> the original article title <i>is not deleted</i>. It's merely a Keep with extra toppings. And, whilst Wikipedia is not a democracy, 7/11 <i>is</i> less than 2/3, the standard guideline threshold. <b>Merge</b> to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_perpetual_motion_machines.html" title="History of perpetual motion machines">History of perpetual motion machines</a> (where it can join the long line of people and companies and their excuses) if notable enough.

<li>I understand how a Merge needs to be implemented. My question is how a vote in which there is only one outright Keep vote from the author of the article, with most other votes being 'Delete', and with 2 'Weak Keeps', and 1 'Merge', can be tallied as "no consensus to delete", with the outcome being that a "Merge" tag is placed on the article, easily deleted by the author, as actually happened. The sysops always point out that VfD is not actually a "vote", that they are trying to find the consensus, and the content of the discussion counts. But here we have a case where the sysop just mechanically tallied up the votes (and apparently didn't have any opinion of her own) and arrived at a ridiculous result. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 14:48, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm convinced its the same 2/3 sock puppets that keep having a go at this article, under different names. I note they are never able to provide any reason for deletion, or show how or why it contravenes WIKI content guidelines. The emphasis always seems to be on 'votes for deletion', devoid of any reference to why this should happen. If all the votes for deletion are coming from the same 2/3 sock puppets, using different names, then what value so they have, exactly? There is no concensus for deletion of this page, among independent WIKI readers - only the sock puppets vote 100% delete. This page has been nominmated for deletion once already and survived, it should not be possible for the sock puppets to nominate 2 weeks later. It was a keep last time, to keep re-nominating every 2 weeks until the sock puppets get what they want, is simply absurd. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimharwoodx_16da.html" title="User:Timharwoodx">Timharwoodx</a> 20:33, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Humble, you are right. I overlooked the merge tag that Joy placed on the article, which got deleted by Timharwoodx. I still think it was a bit of stretch for Joy not to find a consensus to delete in the last vote, but having arrived at "no consensus to delete", it was a good decision to put the merge tag on there, and it was bad faith by <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimharwoodx_16da.html" title="User:Timharwoodx">User:Timharwoodx</a> to delete it.

<p>I presume I'm the only person on this thread to have seen a working flux core motor. I mean, you can make them for $50 with a laser cutter, whats the problem? Stuck on circuitry? Maybe I should copy some of these comments, and drag them up in 10 years time, when flux core motors are used everywhere in everything. I am still amazed that a device that is 100% in accordance with the laws of physics, shipping in mass production to commercial products as I type, should cause so much controversy. The customers are happy, and no refunds have been requested thus far. I'd love to say what products it is in presently that you guys are buying, but that would be a betrayal of confidence on my part. The system claims only 69% magnetic efficiency, as I set out in my Nexus article, published in several different languages, internationally. The idea a magnetic field at 69% efficient is some form of 'perpetual motion,' is so deeply stupid as to be comical in its sheer ignorance. Now we've had this request for deletion nonsense twice, may I point out thus <b>Perpetual motion machines are a class of hypothetical machines which would produce useful energy in a way science cannot explain (yet).</b> Since this systems only deals with fields that are 69% efficient, that is well below 100%, and does *NOT* enable it to be accorded to the category perpetual motion, as per the WIKI definition. A vote to merge is a vote to keep, and as I have demonstrated, perpetual motion is the wrong category. There is no new physics here <b>WHATSOEVER</b>, or indeed an electrical energy gain claimed. Just a clever commercial engineering implementation of flux manipulaton.

<dl>
<dd>That presumption would seem to be correct, unless you're willing to tell us what devices incorporate this technology. Preferably commercial, off-the-shelf products, please—even just one would help. The technique is patented, so I'm a bit troubled by the perceived need for complete secrecy.</dd>
<dd>A second concern is that I'm finding the explanations of the technology to be a bit difficult to understand. I'm not exactly sure what is being claimed. Other web sites describing the devices (including the one from Flynn Research<a href="http://www.flynnresearch.net/Table_of_Contents.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.flynnresearch.net/Table_of_Contents.htm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, and the article by Tim Harwood<a href="http://www.fortunecity.com/greenfield/bp/16/flynnsharwood.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fortunecity.com/greenfield/bp/16/flynnsharwood.htm" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>) don't seem to make the capabilities and functional mechanism of the device entirely clear, though perhaps I'm missing something.</dd>
<dd>Finally, the technology's credibility isn't helped by the company it keeps on the web. A Google search for <i>"parallel path" Flynn</i> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22parallel+path%22+flynn&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22parallel+path%22+flynn&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> turns up only 81 hits. Of the subset related to Flynn's device (about half) most are sites devoted to over-unity type devices (<a href="http://www.fortunecity.com/greenfield/bp/16/content1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fortunecity.com/greenfield/bp/16/content1.htm" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>, <a href="http://jnaudin.free.fr/html/qedynmnu.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://jnaudin.free.fr/html/qedynmnu.htm" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>, <a href="http://www.zpenergy.com/modules.php?name=Downloads&amp;d_op=getit&amp;lid=9" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.zpenergy.com/modules.php?name=Downloads&amp;d_op=getit&amp;lid=9" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>, <a href="http://members.chello.hu/elektro/meg1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://members.chello.hu/elektro/meg1.htm" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>, <a href="http://www.freeenergynews.com/Directory/Organizations/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.freeenergynews.com/Directory/Organizations/" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>) or conspiracy theories (<a href="http://jnaudin.free.fr/html/qedynmnu.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://jnaudin.free.fr/html/qedynmnu.htm" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>).</dd>
<dd>As <a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> says, many editors here would be more comfortable if this device were mentioned in, say, an <a href="../../../i/e/e/IEEE_472a.html" title="IEEE">IEEE</a> publication. I suspect most would probably settle for a story in <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popular_Mechanics_bb04.html" title="Popular Mechanics">Popular Mechanics</a>, actually. When I hear hoofbeats I think of horses, not zebras. When I hear about a new ultra-efficient technology being sold only in secret and only discussed by its inventor and some over-unity enthusiasts, it triggers some skepticism.</dd>
<dd>Incidentally, I would urge you to avoid using the term sockpuppet unless you really mean it. It's an unnecessary and unwarranted slur against the editors in this discussion. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> | <a href="../../../n/a/m/User_talk%7EName_00f8.html" title="User talk:Name">Talk</a> 03:54, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This is one of my first articles I wrote from scratch, and apparently it offended more than a few other users, and I apologize. I'm new at this, and you hold much higher standards than I thought. I won't damage your community any further with more contributions. 63.226.184.127 12:04, 2005 Feb 7 (according to history <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 05:23, 2005 Feb 8 (UTC))</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I am sorry if you got the impression we don't want your contributions. You shouldn't see this as something against you, but against the article. Many people here believe articles are a product of the comunity and therefore have no single authors. So they may not see this as <i>your</i> article, but simply as an article that should get deleted. As least that is how I think. I am a newbie on Wikipedia, and I have done things which others have undone afterwards. It may seem harsh at first, but we get used to this processes. I hope you stay. <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a> 19:42, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Just to echo <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a>: My very first article ever, back when I was anonymous instead of pseudonymous, was nominated for deletion as soon as I wrote it. I didn't take it personally. (After all, <i>I was anonymous</i>.) I argued the case for the article on its merits (as an anonymous user, no less), all the while editing and expanding it in response to the VFD discussion, and at the end of the process the article was in fact retained. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 05:23, 2005 Feb 8 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: actually it's not the <i>article</i> that's the problem, it's the <i>topic</i>, which is a phenomenon that sounds funny and gets almost no google hits. The article is actually much better written than a large proportion of wikipedia. So please don't get upset that it was (mis)identified as nonsense or a joke, because we do get a lot of those around here. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 01:28, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Many people may have construed this article as a joke, but it isn't. It's an unusual phenomenon, but it does exist. There are certain people who have unusual or irrational phobias, that are so unbelievable, you naturally dismiss it as a joke. There are even weirder phobias. You may have seen talk shows about this topic, where people speak out about fearing for their lives in the presence of dogs, clowns, or are even afraid of touching mushrooms, or lettuce! These strange, offbeat phobias are reality, and this article is legit, trust me. And the existence of those Yahoo groups devoted to the subject, with hundreds of members, should back up the article's credibility. And yes, some members of those groups are extreme telelogophobics who have even had nightmares involving certain "scary" logos. Just thought I'd shed some light on this.</li>
<li>Delete: prank. "This article is legit, trust me." Sure buddy. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWile_E._Heresiarch_9879.html" title="User:Wile E. Heresiarch">Wile E. Heresiarch</a> 04:45, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well, delete the damn thing then. See if I care. So much for "free content" and "diversity". Sheesh! I mean I try to explain the whole thing and get flamed for it. Just shows what kind of people frequent this site.</li>

<p>This page was already deleted after a vote. I have moved the archive of that process to the bottom of the page. Please tell me if that is the correct thing to do in this circumstance, this is my first VfD. The current revision does not demonstrate any significance.

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b>. This article seems to have been re-created after having been deleted as a result of the earlier VfD basically for the reason that you state. That makes it a candidate for speedy deletion. I see from the history that you added the {{delete}} to it, which was correct. An anonymous editor removed it, probably the same anonymous editor who recreated the article, although the IP address is different. I'm replacing the speedy-delete tag, but I have no confidence it will stay there without a battle. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 21:38, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>It wasn't deleted before only because it was a stub or sub-stub; among the reasons it was deleted before was that college dormitories generally are not notable and the article didn't establish that this dormitory was any exception. It still does not. It should be speedy-deleted, per Wikipedia policy, as the recreation of an article that has been deleted through VfD. If the previous decision was incorrect, or someone wants to argue that they have a new version that does not have the problems of the previous version, it should be submitted to <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_undeletion_ecb6.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion">Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion</a>, where the burden of achieving consensus will be on those who want to reinstate the article. Otherwise, anybody can re-create an article at will and argue that the new version overcomes the objections of the previous VfD, and VfD will have no meaning at all. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 14:32, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. "It's a dormitory" isn't encyclopedic. If there's something special about it that makes it notable, then the article should say so. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 02:29, Dec 27, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. So someone famous might have slept there. Well, so what? We're not going to create articles on the beds that Albert Einstein slept in, so this doesn't make it notable. If this had, say, won an award for it's architectural design or was a major landmark then it would be worth keeping, but the current article has nothing of note whatsoever in it. Since Wikipedia has a decent search engine facility, we don't need this substub as anyone searching the name would get Caltech anyway, which has enough details on these houses to suffice. Some of the other houses aren't stubs, but I'd vote Delete for the rest of these houses too. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 17:40, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> IMHO this article, <a href="../../../d/a/b/Dabney_House_8221.html" title="Dabney House">Dabney House</a>, and <a href="../../../r/u/d/Ruddock_House_bf2e.html" title="Ruddock House">Ruddock House</a> all meet the speedy deletion criterion of "Very short articles with little or no context." I have refrained from voting on this for a day to see whether the contributor was going to write articles on these dorms, but it appears as if these one-sentence statements are it. These dorms could be <b>listed</b> under <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_Institute_of_Technology_ed1e.html" title="California Institute of Technology">California Institute of Technology</a> if they are not already, but it's not even worth describing this as a merge, since rewriting the single-sentence articles into a list is essentially the same as just creating the list. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 22:18, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I was going to see whether the dorms were already listed at <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_Institute_of_Technology_ed1e.html" title="California Institute of Technology">California Institute of Technology</a> and list them there if they were not. All eight dorms (yes, <a href="../../../l/l/o/Lloyd_House_a6cb.html" title="Lloyd House">Lloyd House</a> and friends are inaccurate) are aleady listed; see the <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_Institute_of_Technology_ed1e.html#Housing" title="California Institute of Technology">Housing</a> section. In a nice tabular format. With a little picture of the logo/coat-of-arms, name of membership, colors, slogan, motto, and a link to the dorm's website.
