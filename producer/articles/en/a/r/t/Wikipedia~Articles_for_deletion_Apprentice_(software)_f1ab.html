<li><b>Keep</b>, and I've practically never even played it. I had been intending on going to bed and was hinting when I deprodded it that I would be willing to go back and add references later, but so it goes. Anyway, the program is somewhat handicapped by the fact that it has a very generic name and, for obvious reasons, Wizards of the Coast's official websites would not want to bring too much attention to it. Additionally, many commercial sites make money selling real cards, and so would downplay a free alternative. Even in spite of all that, it seems that it was fairly important "back in the day," and is even still used today to some extent. It easily satisfies being written about by other sources. To wit:

<dd>...I could post more Google hits, but I think the point is made. As a further argument, this article was spun off the main Magic: The Gathering article (where occasionally people would try and put in information hawking this, which at least says something about player base), and I for one would prefer to have a place to move it to rather than have it pile up in the already over-long main article. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowFire_df7e.html" title="User:SnowFire">SnowFire</a> 04:34, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I was in a hurry last night and grabbed some Google links quickly. Again, let me stress that I am not the right one to serve as its defender, as to my knowledge it is relevant <i>even when I have not really played it</i>.

<dd>WP has articles on plenty of games that no one plays anymore and were utter commericial flops; their only reviews were perfunctory "this game exists and sucks," and even that may be hard to find if the game is old enough. I think that even such commercially published games are still worth an article, and I think that Apprentice is a step above that. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowFire_df7e.html" title="User:SnowFire">SnowFire</a> 14:04, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>All of those links appear to be from Star City Games. How about non-Magic related sources? <b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan">Andre</a></b> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan">talk</a>) 19:45, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I offered some non-SCG links above in my original post; it's just that SCG happens to be easily searchable. As for non-Magic sources... er... how to say this. If you read the article, you'll note that Apprentice is simply an implementation of Magic: The Gathering's rules. Unlike, say, <a href="../../../t/h/e/Magic%7E_The_Gathering_-_Battlegrounds_e2e8.html" title="Magic: The Gathering - Battlegrounds">Magic: The Gathering - Battlegrounds</a>, which was more a spinoff and may well have had people buy it without familiarity with the license, the set of people interested in Apprentice coincides pretty exactly with those interested in Magic.</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The real problem with this software is the whole premise around the software -- its a card game now made into a computer software that emulates game activity. You can't have a review of this type of software. Its like asking someone to review Microsoft Word based on an essay they wrote using it. You can't 'grade' or judge a software like this -- its purely a utility for players of the card game to use. I myself has used this application before switching to Magic Workstation but nevertheless. <a href="../../../m/r/m/User%7EMrMacMan_b672.html" title="User:MrMacMan">MrMacMan</a> 09:07, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Starcitygames is a reliable source. There are other sites that also mention it. For all I know, Scrye and Inquest had articles about it, but even if they didn't, I'd still say it meets Notability from association with M:TG. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 16:48, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Sometimes, yes, that is all you need. Take any number of articles on professional sports players, or politicians. Individually, I can't imagine how most of them are really notable, but they still have articles.

<dd>This equates significance of a major league sort and MTG. They are not equivalent.

<dd>You are misinterpreting his argument. He never claimed MTG and politics are equivalent; he merely used an example in which <b>sometimes</b> association is sufficient. Obviously, the degree of notability of the mother topic and the "distance" of the daughter topic from it are relevant, and I don't think MM was trying to say otherwise.</dd>

<dd>That said, even though MTG may only be "minor-league" notable, Apprentice is not a fork of unencyclopedic minutiae, and I think MTG is still notable enough to support it. Wikipedia is not paper; it can afford to go into some detail. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowFire_df7e.html" title="User:SnowFire">SnowFire</a> 00:06, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Hmm, well, as to whether Magic is the equivalent of any major league sports, I'd say yes, it is somewhat. 6 million players worldwide. Over a million a year in pro-tour prize money (plus who knows how many hundreds of thousands of prizes awarded in other tournaments), who knows how many millions in sales? It may not be a football or a baseball, but it's not something to be ignored. Same reason why people didn't go for deletion of pro-magic players earlier this year. However, as Snowfire said, the primary purpose of my argument was NOT equivalence, but illustration. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 04:42, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
