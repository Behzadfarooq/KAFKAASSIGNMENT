<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This page does not violate any of the major standards set by the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion policy</a>. Furthermore, the precedent is a terrible one. Club sports do not by default indicate not notable, esp. if there is not varsity equivalent. As Ultimate is an extremely popular sport (estimated that over 100,000 people play Ultimate in the United States alone <a href="http://www4.upa.org/files/2006_Fact_Sheet_low.pdf|" class="external text" title="http://www4.upa.org/files/2006_Fact_Sheet_low.pdf|" rel="nofollow">UPA Fact Sheet</a>), Ultimate is a notable sport, and the college level is one of the priemier levels of Ultimate. I really don't see the worth in deleting the page, as it could certainly be of interest, it is not vanity, it is of relatively high quality, and does not violate any Wiki standards. I strongly push for a keep. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetromoxie_17e8.html" title="User:Metromoxie">Metromoxie</a> 20:52, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This page does not violate any of the major standards set by the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion policy</a>. I find it ridiculous to consider the deletion of a highly recognized and respected team in a very large and active sport especially at the college level. This article provides extensive insight into the teams successful history and can be of interest to any ultimate player at the college level. I too, strongly push for keeping this article. - Shane, Brown Student

<li><b>Keep</b> As previously stated, club sports without varsity equivilents are certainly of note. I am not, nor have ever been a member of the team, but it is a strong and positive symbol Brown University that reflects prevailing attitudes about athletics, community and independence. I find it innane that this article would be considered for deletion. The contributions that B-Mo has made to ultimate fribee as a sport are significant and their accomplishments are more than worthy of record on Wikipedia. Their success as individuals and as a team are NOT exaggerated, as a recreational ultimate play in DC, strangers would ask me with admiration in their eyes, "So, do you know Zip?" -User: petercirincione

<li><b>Keep</b> I already posted a "Keep" above, but wanted to expand a little. I mostly add and edit articles about literature and writers, but the thing that has attracted me to Wikipedia from the beginning is its inclusiveness. I ofent use it in my own writing as a first choice source of information. I could easily imagine myself drafting a novel with people playing Ultimate Frisbee mentioned in passing and then deciding I needed a couple of facts about how it is played-- club sport at college-- who plays it-- Ivy leaguers and others-- what do they call themselves? Brownian Motion for heavens sake! This is exactly the kind of odd quirky info that a fiction writer thrives on. <a href="../../../m/s/u/User%7EMSueWillis_ad2d.html" title="User:MSueWillis">MSueWillis</a>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The club team precedent seems unreasonable; Ultimate has a very large player base these days yet there are no varsity ultimate teams I know of. As club teams go, Brown is certainly notable; the team won nationals last year and on another previous occasion and gets significant name recognition from Ultimate players across the country. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobinmarcus_4f40.html" title="User:Tobinmarcus">Tobinmarcus</a> 19:28, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>I would be happy to add references where applicable. Could you suggest some areas that need references in particular (I originally thought that the "external links" at the bottom would suffice, but I see now they are insufficient&#160;:)? I would also strongly urge you not to vote for deletion if it is a matter of reference; the page was never given a "need references" tag; had it been, with suggestions, I would have gladly help build a bibliograpy. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetromoxie_17e8.html" title="User:Metromoxie">Metromoxie</a> 22:25 May 13 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well for one thing, some media source that shows the group won a national championship would go a long way toward getting this article out of AfD. Every fact in the article needs to be referenced with reliable sources. The group itself can be used for some information, but external sources are needed to confirm all these facts. <a href="../../../f/a/g/User%7EFagstein_330b.html" title="User:Fagstein">Fagstein</a> 07:35, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Re the use of "interesting": Please note that "interesting" is not a criterion for keeping. You have to explain what makes the club <i><b>notable</b></i>.

<li>Interesting in the sense that it is useful can be criterion for keeping. If it is useful, then it is, arguably, encyclopedic, and thus wiki-worthy. Secondly, as the defending national champions in a large college sport, I would argue that notability has been proven. I would ask, at this juncture, why are they "not notable"? By asserting that they are not notable, but by not giving justification, it is really impossible to defend the article. To quote the great Jerry McGuire, "Help me help you (understand why this subject is notable)"-- <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetromoxie_17e8.html" title="User:Metromoxie">Metromoxie</a> 04:20, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Interesting article on Brown ultimate team. We have many articles on college teams (and need a lot more), some of which can be seen here <a href="../../../c/o/l/Category%7ECollege_athletic_programs_b3fc.html" title="Category:College athletic programs">Category:College athletic programs</a>. However, this is a perennial powerhouse and recent <b>national champion</b> in a sport where college level is the peak. Ultimate fans will want to know about the team. In my view, that positively reeks of notability. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 21:20, 14 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Continuing in this vein, I found several interesting and well established articles about college clubs. For example, the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dartmouth_Outing_Club_a5b0.html" title="Dartmouth Outing Club">Dartmouth Outing Club</a> has, for quite some time, had an article (which, after reading it, I would agree that it whole-heartedly deserves). There are over 350 college teams that participate in the UPA Championship series (see the reference to the UPA factsheet in the article), and Brownian Motion reached the pinnacle of this compeition this past season. As JJay implied above, if this doesn't show notability, I don't know what does. -- <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetromoxie_17e8.html" title="User:Metromoxie">Metromoxie</a> 04:35, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
