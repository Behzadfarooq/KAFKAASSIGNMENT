<li><b>Keep</b> When determining a sites notability, the amoung of people adhering to that religion must be considered. Considering that most Shi'a live in non-western countries, the site has a remarkably high Alexa rating, even higher than <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Islam.org_8dc6.html" title="Al-Islam.org">al-Islam.org</a>, in fact 3-4 times higher rating. And then it should be noted that <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Islam.org_8dc6.html" title="Al-Islam.org">al-Islam.org</a> is the highest ranked Shi'a site by Yahoo. Now, add to that a google seach gives almost 70k hits, and it becomes very hard to argue that this is a non-notable <b>shi'a</b> site. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> - <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStriver_9f65.html" title="User talk:Striver">talk</a> 20:04, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Using the definition of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N" class="extiw" title="w:N">notability</a> as there being multiple, independent, non-trivial published works, then it is very easy to argue that it is "non-notable".

<li><b>answer</b> It looks like the site has had a considerable re-work on their site map structure, and that explains all the error links. I requested the AboutUs.org link to be translated in case it provided clues as to were to find coverage, it's not unusual to include such things. Ie, i did request it to be translated as a RS. And in either case, it is a RS <i>about</i> what they say of themselves. #3 of the Shi'a sites on Alexa tells a lot and it is a clear indication of notability, going above <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Islam.org_8dc6.html" title="Al-Islam.org">al-Islam.org</a> (#1 according to Yahoo) and also above <a href="../../../s/i/s/Sistani.html" title="Sistani">Sistanis</a> page, both being very well known Shi'a sites. Only that is enough to establish notability. I mean, it goes even above Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting! We don't care were it is in six month, we are looking at it's notability now. Even if it goes to zero notability in six month, it will still be notable for historical purposes. The external link at <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abd-Allah_ibn_Umar_9639.html" title="Abd-Allah ibn Umar">Abd-Allah ibn Umar</a> was put there as a link to the Shi'a view of the person. Is that supposed to work against this site's notability? Strange logic. Again, <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Islam.org_8dc6.html" title="Al-Islam.org">al-Islam.org</a> a site that is #1 of the Shi'a sites according to Yahoo has an Alex ranking of about 45k, while this site has 15k, making it 3 times more popular and visited than <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Islam.org_8dc6.html" title="Al-Islam.org">al-Islam.org</a>. Of course does the numbers of this site change, how is that a argument against its notability? In either case, all of this is really redundant, <a href="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=180817" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=180817" rel="nofollow">this</a> should alone suffice. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> - <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStriver_9f65.html" title="User talk:Striver">talk</a> 14:50, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Now, considering that rafed.org has a arabic text would explain why it's hard to find long texts that cover the site in English, but that is only a guideline requirement.

<dd>I argue that this shows a flaw in the WP:WEB, and this should not surprice anybody considering that it is still in a guidline phase and has not been accepted as a policy. The bottom point is that wikipedia does not cover non-sense, small and trivial issues. We have a consensus here that this site is among the very top of the Shi'a sites regarding popularity. This is enough to establish that this is not a trivial site, no mater how lacking WP:WEB is. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> - <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStriver_9f65.html" title="User talk:Striver">talk</a> 14:42, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not arguing that we should scrap WP:WEB, of course not. Rather, i'm saying that this seems to be a case that is somewhat of a exception. You see, a large Christian cite will have no problem finding third part full coverage in English, while an Islamic site will have more trouble doing the same. Specially if it is a Shi'a cite. This is most probably natural bias, i mean, is it really so surprising that we have trouble finding English coverage for a mainly Arabic Shi'a Islamic site? Nobody here have tried to make an Arabic search. And we do know from the statistic and numbers available that a Christian equivalent site would have plenty of third party coverage in English. So, is it good or bad for wikipedia to delete a decidedly notable Shi'a site, only due to a lack of English coverage? As for wrting an article, we do have some facts already that are attributed to third parties, such as the Saudi Arabia ban and the numbers. And adding self-evident facts need no third party sourcing, we don't need somebody to tell us that it has a multi language Qura'an and that it has severa language and sections. I agree that we wont be able to have a large and FA article, but we can most surely have a decent stub. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> - <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStriver_9f65.html" title="User talk:Striver">talk</a> 15:17, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But a <a href="../../../s/t/u/WP%7ESTUB_7484.html" title="WP:STUB">stub</a> needs to have potential for expansion - you can't put all the available information in and say that it's a stub, as there's no way it can grow. You raise a good point with the foreign language coverage, it's possible there will be Arabic sources with more coverage of it. We could really do with someone who can speak the language to search. But I'm reluctant to include an article because it <i>might</i> have additional sources, and the onus to find them is on the people arguing to keep. And although you could add self-evident facts, as they have not been mentioned (to the best of our knowledge) in any outside sources, they aren't <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> aspects of the site.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Im not sure why this article is being deleted. But if it is popularity or significance that is being debated, I can note that the institute that runs the Rafed.net website is a large institute that has branches in 3 countries (Iran, Syria, Lebanon). (says it here in Arabic: <a href="http://rafed.net/aalulbayt/m8a.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://rafed.net/aalulbayt/m8a.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>). The thing with Arabic websites is that they arent very google friendly. Try finding any website using google. Youll have to do a lot of diging. It seems google is set up in a way such that it doesnt have the search capabilities that it does in English or other languages. Maybe it's the way they put Meta tags on Arabic pages or something. But anyway, google isnt a good measure of things when dealing with Arabic websites. And even if you argued that it isn't popular enough, I'd argue that the website is a portal to a ton of information regarding the Shi'i faith. I'd definitely keep it.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 16:48, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Zereshk just confirmed my suspicion, the problem is not that this site is not notable, the problem is that it is hard to establish this using English googel. It's popularity is not in question, and it's hard to argue that it is non-notable in the entire world, just because it has a lack of third party coverage on the english internet.

<dd>That is why the article may assert that the subject website is a "popular Shi'a" rather than "popular Islamic" website ... it's popularity is in a narrowly defined field ... note that neither Alexa or Google have a category of "Sunni" wesites, although both have categories of "Sufism" and "Islamic Organizations" (subject website is not listed by either <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_directory.html" title="Web directory">Web directory</a> in the latter category, although its parent organization might be), but if any wesites in the Top (pick any number between 1 and 5) of any of these categories have articles in Wikipedia, then they either have some claim of notability other than "popularity" that satisfies <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, or else they should be AfD'd as well.</dd>

<dd>I dissagree, the "top ten list" is not page ranking based on Google hits, it is a third party assertion to it's notability.
