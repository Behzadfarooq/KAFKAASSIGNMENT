<p><b>A CHALLENGE TO OTTO4711's PROPOSED DELETION FROM SAMUEL KENSINGER FRANCIS</b></p>
<p>This is <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Kensinger_Francis_01d2.html" title="Samuel Kensinger Francis">Samuel Kensinger Francis</a> writing. I will first address the questions about the veracity and verifiability of my magazine, HERO, which I published and co-founded in 1997-2001. I will include several articles on the internet which verify my role as such, and will be happy to supply Wikipedia with printed copies of the bound edition of the magazine if necessary to prove same. Finally, I question the motives of the user OTTO4711 and her reasons for proposing deletion—seems she has an <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> problem of her own.</p>
<p><b>HERO MAGAZINE AND PROOF OF ROLE, 1997-2001</b></p>
<p>For the record, I have printed mastheads from HERO Magazine in my possession which verify my co-founding and as Publisher of HERO Magazine from 1997-2001. In addition, a complete volume of the periodical is stored in perpetuity by the New York Public Library and also the Library of Congress. I can also guide you to the following articles elsewhere on the internet which verify my role as Publisher and Co-Founder:</p>
<p><a href="http://directmag.com/mag/marketing_straight_talk_gay/" class="external free" title="http://directmag.com/mag/marketing_straight_talk_gay/" rel="nofollow">http://directmag.com/mag/marketing_straight_talk_gay/</a></p>
<p><b>EXCERPT FROM <i>DIRECT MAGAZINE</i></b></p>
<p><i>"While some analysts see a trend toward nationalization of the marketing media as a reflection of what's happening in the mainstream and as a reflection of the greater acceptance of the lesbian and gay market, there are still some small "pop and pop" operations running. One example is Sam Francis, the founder and publisher of HERO, a magazine for gay men who are more interested in a relationship than in a lifestyle.</i></p>
<p><i>The publication began as a Web site, but turned into a print product. Despite its origins, banner ads have not worked for Francis to acquire subscribers. Instead he uses a mix of rented mailing lists, inserts in gay-male specific catalogs, and such Web-based subscription services as enews.com. His own site can also accept subscriptions, which he sees as an important gateway to the market.</i></p>
<p><i>A 200,000-piece mailing gets a 2% response, with a special "Gay Wedding Guide for Men" issue providing a 60% response spike. While his current subscriber base is 14,000, Francis believes his marketing mix can bring the base up to 100,000 in 2001, which he says will make it the gay magazine with the largest circulation in the country.</i>"</p>

<b>REGARDING THE WIKIPEDIA USER 'OTTO4711' and her <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a></b></p>
<p>The user OTTO4711 has no e-mail address for direct contact. I question the user "OTTO4711's" motives in proposing my article for deletion. If you'll check their browsing history, he/she also browses Wikipedia for other notable gay celebrities (and personal friends of mine), including <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chip_Arndt_7750.html" title="Chip Arndt">Chip Arndt</a> &amp; <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reichen.html" title="Reichen">Reichen</a> Lehmkuhl (of the Amazing Race), my mother in law, actress <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conny_Van_Dyke_cba8.html" title="Conny Van Dyke">Conny Van Dyke</a>, and my partner Bronson Page, "proposing them for deletion" for superfluous reasons. This user seems to just be going through and editing the entries of my friends and familiy specifically, and seems to have an axe to grind. I respectfully request that this user's account be de-activated as I believe SHE has a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>.</p>
<p><b>SUMMARY OF CHALLENGE TO DELETION</b></p>
<p>My accomplishments in founding HERO Magazine, an award-winning, national publication (who's entry is also in Wikipedia) stand for itself and are unqualified. The entry is relevant and should not be deleted.</p>
<p><i>—Posted by <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Kensinger_Francis_01d2.html" title="Samuel Kensinger Francis">Samuel Kensinger Francis</a> 12/08/06</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Wow. That was pretty impressive. Way to cast aspersions with no foundation in fact whatsoever there, Sam. If you actually check my browsing history, you'll see that I have thousands of edits to articles regarding gay people, gay movies, gay topics, etc. and try to better them. I've written several dozen articles on the topic. Plus, I'm a big queer so I have no problem with gay people in general.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I proposed your two articles for deletion because of issues of verifiability. I stumbled across your article because it was in <a href="../../../l/g/b/Category%7ELGBT_people_from_the_United_States_7299.html" title="Category:LGBT people from the United States">Category:LGBT people from the United States</a>. It struck me as odd that a home improvement show like <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extreme_Makeover_Home_Edition_5347.html" title="Extreme Makeover Home Edition">Extreme Makeover Home Edition</a> would have a personal trainer so I checked the website and found no verification of your affiliation with the program under multiple versions of your name. Similarly I checked the Sirius radio page and found no verification that you "host a fitness program." I could also find no verification of your affiliation with HERO. You have now provided verification of some of the information that is included in the article and I therefore <b>withdraw</b> my nomination for deletion. The next thing that should happen is that an editor who is not you and not related to you by blood or marriage should merge the two articles on you into one and properly source it. I will not do so because although I certainly bear neither you, your spouse, your mother in law nor any of your friends and relations the slightest malice, your suggestion of some sinister ulterior motive on my part leads me to take a total hands-off approach.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have removed the equals signs that you placed above your response because placing them there causes your response to become an entry in the day's table of contents separate from the nomination itself and it should not be. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 02:46, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And just to address your somments about your mother-in-law's article, I made four edits to it, two of which were minor cosmetic changes and one of which was to restore something that I had removed after further research turned up a source fo it. I never had any quibble with her article and I think that I improved it. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 02:59, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> The NYPL and the Library of congress have permanent copies of almost anything, and if all there is of this is one volume, and that's the only places there are, that puts it at the very lowest level of notability for a journal. I don't like being bullied, so I tried to skip over that part and just look for any information. (The web cites, by the way, are from suitable places for unverified press releases)<a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 04:50, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>REPLY BY SAMUEL KENSINGER FRANCIS TO DGG RE: HERO MAGAZINE</b></li>
</ul>
<p>As you are a librarian, please note that HERO Magazine was named "One of the 10 Best New Magazines" by Library Journal, one of your industry's own publications. In addition, HERO was named "One of the 10 Best Magazines" by magazine expert and University of Mississippi journalism professor Samir Husni, who is also known as "Mr. Magazine" and widely considered one of the most authoritative voices on magazines in the world. HERO was subscribed to by dozens of public libraries around the United States, and the world. SamFrancis 12:43, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
