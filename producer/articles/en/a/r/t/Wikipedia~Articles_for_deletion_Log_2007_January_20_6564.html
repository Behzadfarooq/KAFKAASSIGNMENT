<p>Since the definition given is very vague - "a saga is a long story", that's all - it looks as if any TV series, any movie, book or video game with sequels can be listed there.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I have updated the introduction for the article from wiktionary and other sources. This article needs to actually define <a href="../../../s/a/g/Saga.html" title="Saga">saga</a> and maybe expand it to a full article status is possible since saga is currently, and correctly so, a disambiguation page. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 03:06, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> still far too ambiguous to have any merit. The word SAGA, and hence any attempt to base a list on it, is hopelessly POV outside of the strict original definition.

<p>I am nominating for this to be <b>deleted</b> as because it doesn't give itself a reason for notability apart from the listing non-notable "celebrities". Dr Tobias Funke 01:10, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Clean-Up, but Keep</b> Seems notable to me.

<li><b>Delete</b> it pains me to say so because commendable it is but it just does not give sources or a reason to be notable enough for a premier event which is not say it might not be in the future but now it isn't.

<dd>The endgame did occur twice in the 1971 Taimanov match and once between them in the interzonal tournament the previous year. It is also the second most common type of endgame (see <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endgame.html#Table_of_the_most_common_endings" title="Endgame">Endgame#Table of the most common endings</a>). The external article you link to states that Fischer was especially good at playing the side with the bishop (with those three impressive wins over Taimanov, for example).

<dd><b>Comment</b> - This was one of Fischer's candidate matches which was a requirement to challenge the chess champion, Boris Spassky in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a> (please see our Wiki article on <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Fischer_d4b3.html" title="Bobby Fischer">Bobby Fischer</a> and the paragraph, <i>The road to the world championship (1969-1972)</i>.

It is over time that this endgame has been proved to have a weakness (as all new winning variations usually do).

<li><b>Translation</b> I had AltaVista translate a paragraph from the Russian source, and it does say that the endgame is named after Fischer:
<blockquote>
<p>Many generations of chess players made their first motions on the board with the aid of the brilliant textbook of the second champion of the peace Jose Raoult Capablanca. There among the wise councils of great knots are similar: in the ends the boat and elephant, as a rule, are stronger than the boat and horse, as a rule, this the sufficiently open nature of position. Then in the match Robert Fisher- Mark taymanov (1971) were played several endgames surprising on the beauty precisely with this relationship, after which this relationship began to bear the name - Fisher endgame. Specifically, this end obtained computer. Although in its cold memory all parties of Robert Fisher are stored, to demonstrate anything similar for computer it was impossible. It is here necessary to note the very good protection of blacks. Motions: 24....Kg", 35... L.d', 47....fshch - this is evidence of the deepest penetration into the secrets of position.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I have a reasonably strong acquaintance with post-1980 literature chess endgame theory. Fischer-Taimanov 1971 (4) is generally considered a technical masterpiece (see Kasparov, My Great Predecessors, vol. <u>5</u>4, pp. 389-93); Kasparov does cite its influence on his generation, <i>but more for the pure bishop vs. knight ending</i> (p. 393). Also see Shereshevsky, Endgame Strategy, pp. 179-81. Are we going to have articles on Fischer-Unzicker, Siegen 1970 (another masterpiece), or Capablanca-Tartakover, NY 1924 (whose influence can be seen in the final game of the Kramnik-Leko WC match or Topalov's win against Kasimjanov in the 2006 WC)? Nonstandard, even in the Russian literature. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillbrock_ae1b.html" title="User:Billbrock">Billbrock</a> 16:06, 21 January 2007 (UTC) P.S. Fischer botched a won ending in game 2 of the same match: Balashov called 50.c5?! "a surprising error for a player of such a high class"; and Kasparov writes that Fischer's 52.Ra2? "shows that Fischer has lost the thread of the game" (MGP 4:383). <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillbrock_ae1b.html" title="User:Billbrock">Billbrock</a> 16:11, 21 January 2007 (UTC) corrected typo <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillbrock_ae1b.html" title="User:Billbrock">Billbrock</a> 23:10, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> No one doubts Fischer's contributions to chess. (There is plenty of information about Fischer in WP.) The issue is whether or not the endgame of rook and bishop versus rook and knight (with pawns) is commonly known as "Fischer's endgame", and whether or not it is notable (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>), which says that there should be two independant sources in order to be notable. Fifty years before the 1971 match, Capablanca's 1921 book <i>Chess Fundamentals</i> states that the bishop is better. The endgame is also discussed thirty years earlier in Fine's 1941 <i>Basic Chess Endings</i>. Recently, this <a href="http://www.chesscafe.com/text/mueller09.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.chesscafe.com/text/mueller09.pdf" rel="nofollow">article</a> by endgame expert Karsten Muller discusses three games between Fischer and Taimanov in 1970 and 71, but does <b>not</b> call it "Fischer's endgame". Also recently, <i>My Great Predecessors</i> by Kasparov discusses it but does <b>not</b> call it "Fischer's endgame". The only source we have been able to find is the Russian one, and it is a little wishy-washy. The translation says that "it began to be called...". Perhaps it did began to be called "Fischer's endgame", but the name doesn't seem to have stuck. I favor deletion on the basis that it is a non-notable stub. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba73_9231.html" title="User:Bubba73">Bubba73</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba73_7087.html" title="User talk:Bubba73">(talk)</a>, 17:55, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

We certainly wouldn't tolerate an article on, say, an individual inning of a baseball game, for example. Besides, given the wealth of information on Fischer, including a number of full-length books, we should have plenty of sources for this if it's something he's famous for, but I couldn't even manage a single Google Books hit for either "Fischer's endgame" or "Fischer endgame". <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 04:46, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If anyone seriously believes that before Fischer, folks didn't know that R &amp; B (in the general case, with many exceptions) were stronger than R &amp; N, they're naive. If someone can't articulate a particular contribution to endgame theory made by Fischer in game 4 of the Taimanov match, this article should go. Game 2 of the same match is notable only for the atypically blunder-filled play of both players; the Palma 1970 game was well-played but otherwise non-notable.</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> OK I've been looking further into the guidelines, policies and various other bits connected to video games.</p>
<p>The Video Games Wiki (yes I know it's not policy but seems to the "considered" viewpoint on what should and should not be done with video game articles) has the following to say: <i>A general rule of thumb to follow if unsure: if the content only has value to people actually playing the game, it's unsuitable.</i> I'd say this article fails that test, I do not see how content such as: <b>Light Arrows are also featured in The Minish Cap as an arrow upgrade. They are the first item ever that can be missed. If Link doesn't save Gregal before officially visiting the Wind Tribe, Gregal dies and Link will not get the Light Arrows ever.</b> is of much interest to someone who is not playing that game.</p>
<p>It also says that other content that might be moved to a gaming wiki includes: <i>Lists of mere statistics, items, or other minutiae. The HP or weight class of a character is not important to the article; neither are all the swords available in the game.</i> I'd say this article seems to fail one as well: <b>Bottles are an essential part to many of Link's quests.

<dd>You consider this encyclopedic (this is random, I could pick 100s of other examples) - <i>The Mirror Shield is also required in order to solve several puzzles in The Wind Waker. In The Minish Cap, whenever an enemy fired a projectile and you block it with the Mirror Shield, the shield emits a small damaging beam of light (roughly equivalent to half the power of the Four Sword) back to the enemy. Interestingly, this is the first time an item cannot be obtained on the first playthrough. Only when the is finished can the Mirror Shield be obtained. Therefore, it's rather useless in The Minish Cap. It is formed by Biggoron eating the normal shield and spitting it out a few days later.</i> Really?</dd>

<dd>how about <i>Ooccoo is a being who acts like a warp item in Twilight Princess, much like Farore's Wind in Ocarina of Time. She will let you set a warp point in a dungeon by staying there and having her son, Ooccoo Jr., warp you outside and, if used again, back to the original warp point inside the dungeon. Unlike other warp items, she must be found again in each dungeon. She also doesn't appear in the final two dungeons or return with Link to already completed dungeons for storyline reasons.</i></dd>

<dd>and clear this is not a games guide <i>In The Wind Waker, Link can buy All-Purpose Bait at Beedle's Shop Ship and store it in his Bait Bag. It is purchased in groups of three servings. A purchasable group of this bait will occupy one pouch in the Bait Bag, regardless of how many servings are left. Throwing some bait on the ground can cause pigs to dig there; throwing it near a rat hole causes rats to offer various helpful items for purchase. It can also distract Miniblins, and if thrown onto the sea near Fishman, he can fill in Link's Sea Chart and offer advice about the area.</i> and I've seen some wonky "what about article X" views but you think that compares to an article on one of the world's major religious leaders? really? --<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_laptop_cca9.html" title="User:Larry laptop">Larry laptop</a> 01:48, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

There is no encyclopedic reason for a list of items within games, there are game wikis and gamefaqs for that reason. In addition, the definition of "game guide" per WP:NOT suggests that anytime something is useful primarily only to someone actually playing the game, it's not encyclopedic. In all honesty speedy delete criterion for "no context" and "no notability asserted" may well apply to the numerous lists of this kind, descriptions of game items offer us no commentary or context to ascertain why they are important. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 05:48, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm as much a Link boy as the next guy that never in his life owned a Nintendo, but I think that the article in itself should stay, since there is clearly enough material to warrant an article, on a subject that seems reasonably notable. Surely, a thorough clean-up could solve the game-guide issue. It just seems like a such a waste to delete what is clearly hours of well-intended work. The article desperately needs a clean-up, sure enough, to remove game-guide content as well as to make it less sprawling, but deleting seems unjustified.

<dd>In universe description is a nono based on the writing about fiction guidelines not just the wp:not a game guide criteria. Basically, an article must provide context in addition to content in order to fulfill the encyclopedic requirement. Things written from an entirely in-univese perspective about fiction also tend to result in confusion when they don't assert the character is fictional or why they're important in a more general sense. For example writing that a character is "the captain of the 124th lancer division of the galactic empire" could result in confusion, whereas "In sci/fi story Admiral soandso is the leader of the 124th lancer division, the protagonist's unit..." makes it explicitly clear the universe and importance to the story of the character. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 22:34, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That's true, of course, and the article does in fact do that. (Actually, looking over the list it seems that much of it is not in-universe at all.) Being in-universe is not grounds for deletion, anyway, since that can easily be corrected. What I don't understand is <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">User:Friday</a>'s supposed alleged link between <i>in universe</i> and <i>game guide</i>. <span style="font-size: 10px">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 23:07, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think it can be fixed- that's my point.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I could be a chode here and cherry-pick AfDs to counter your claims, but I'd rather give everyone an opportunity to view the entire picture, as it were, on AfDs relating to lists like this one. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Computer_and_video_games_Deletion_Archive_c2cc.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Computer and video games/Deletion Archive">Here is a list of every Computer and Video Game related AfD in the past several months</a>. It's a lot of data to digest, but then again so are all the AfDs you seem to have arbitrarily picked. The one thing that is clear in this list, however, is that <b>the "consensus in community-wide discussions" you talked about doesn't exist</b>. I've not kept clear count, but it seems to be a roughly 60-40 split on the delete/keep results for "list" CVG articles. Even if you ignore the other CVG-related "list" articles that have <i>never</i> been nominated for AfD you cannot possibly shape a 60-40 margin into a "clear consensus". Trying to justify the deletion of this article because some <i>other</i>, <i>somewhat similar</i> articles were deleted is lazy at best, and just doesn't fly in an AfD discussion. Just like <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">inclusion is not an indicator of notability</a>, neither is exclusion. -- <a href="../../../i/k/n/WP%7EIKNOWBEST_f5b0.html" title="WP:IKNOWBEST"><font color="black">Y<b>|</b></font></a><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">yukichigai</a> (<sub><a href="../../../y/u/k/User_talk%7EYukichigai_f252.html" title="User talk:Yukichigai"><font color="blue"><b>ramble</b></font></a></sub> <small><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_Viewpoints_and_Arguments_65e4.html" title="User:Yukichigai/Viewpoints and Arguments"><font color="red"><b>argue</b></font></a></small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yukichigai_f895.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yukichigai"><font color="green"><b>check</b></font></a></sup>) 09:00, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Far from being "somewhat similar" and "arbitrary", the above is an essentially comprehensive list of AfDs in the past year dealing with exactly the same thing: lists of widgets and doohdahs from video games with no notability outside the community that plays the game. Any random chump can "include" an article in WP, which is why <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">WP:INN</a> exists. It requires consensus and at least one concurring admin to delete an article, which is why ignoring precedent on AfD is silly. <span style="white-space:nowrap">— <a href="../../../k/a/u/User_talk%7EKaustuv_9271.html" title="User talk:Kaustuv">Kaustuv Chaudhuri</a></span> 09:31, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>This is not a "comprehensive list", it's a cherry-picked collection. As for <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">WP:INN</a>, read my above comment: just like inclusion is not an indicator of notability, lack of inclusion is not an indicator of non-notability. If we start relying on "precedent" then the entire AfD process becomes moot; there will be no discussion, just people citing previous AfDs. Articles for Deletion discussions are to be done based on the individual merits of each article, not on what has come before. Citing a handpicked collection of previous AfDs as "precedent" is tangential, misleading, and just plain wrong. -- <a href="../../../i/k/n/WP%7EIKNOWBEST_f5b0.html" title="WP:IKNOWBEST"><font color="black">Y<b>|</b></font></a><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">yukichigai</a> (<sub><a href="../../../y/u/k/User_talk%7EYukichigai_f252.html" title="User talk:Yukichigai"><font color="blue"><b>ramble</b></font></a></sub> <small><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_Viewpoints_and_Arguments_65e4.html" title="User:Yukichigai/Viewpoints and Arguments"><font color="red"><b>argue</b></font></a></small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yukichigai_f895.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yukichigai"><font color="green"><b>check</b></font></a></sup>) 18:01, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Minutia from the game. I'm sure a summary within the main article would do the trick. This is far too extensive for a general encyclopaedia.

<li>Good Lord, I didn't realize the version I read was after a major overhaul. The version when the AfD tag was applied is downright scary. Still, while Zelda is notable, weapons of Zelda don't get much in the line of reliable third party coverage and the likes, and the article as it stands still strikes me as mainly trivial. It's much better than it was, but it seems like there ought to be a way to condense it far more. GassyGuy 09:10, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> or at worst relist the AFD. I can see why contributors were up in arms about the previous version, it had eschewed all traces of wanting to be an encyclopedia article and was running wild. <i>However</i>, unlike most (if not all) of the examples given of weapon-pages deleted, LoZ isn't a single game which happens to feature weapons or items, it's one of the longest running still-active game series. Since a great deal of the weapons feature in different games of the series, a page about them seems perfectly reasonable. Master Sword has a seperate article, could it not be merged in? If the article is kept, it certainly needs continued cleanup and referencing, but I think this does justify a stay of execution.<br />
As a side-issue, since RuneScape was mentioned, can I point out that the contributors to <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html" title="RuneScape">RuneScape</a> themselves voted for deletion or merge of many of the articles they themselves worked on. Despite of a lack of familiarity with the policies and guidelines and having to cope with one of the most heavily editted articles on WP with an army of anons who've never editted before bombarding it constantly, the RS contributors are well on the way to getting the article to GA status and have tried to reign-in the sub-articles.

Rather thank taking offense, it's <i>worry</i> more than anything that any RS article which may get listed for AFD immediately conjures the thought "It's those bloody RS fanatics again!", especially when so many rogue articles appear from new contributors being bold, but which weren't wanted by those trying to build the RS series within the policies.

<dd>With all due respect, we don't have to prove no one would be interested, all we have to prove is that this information is not of encyclopaedic merit. There are many useful things or things people are interested in that we cannot cover (per WP:Not a howto guide, a directory, ect.) In fact WP:Not is entirely about things that, while useful/interesting/important do not belong on Wikipedia. The trimmed article is better, but I still think it asserts no significance. why is that sword *Important* is the key question here, and why is it important beyond the context of the game itself? This is still material primarily of interest only to people actually playing the game. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 16:43, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Per my reasons above for the simular Zelda list, lists of items provide no useful context or information regarding the notability or importance of the items. If a guide WERE to (for instance a well-sourced list of iconic gaming items) then that might be different, but this is a game guide. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 05:51, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have been bold and merged it with the article, pointing this page as a redirect. The list is just a bunch of names, without importance or extra information, so there's no reason to keep it outside of the article. I'd suggest closing this AfD and continuing to discuss it on <a href="../../../t/o/m/Talk%7ETom_Clancy%27s_Rainbow_Six%7E_Vegas_fb4c.html" title="Talk:Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas">Talk:Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas</a>. --<a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalcorian_ed64.html" title="User:Falcorian">Falcorian</a>&#160;<sup><small><a href="../../../f/a/l/User_talk%7EFalcorian_1ea8.html" title="User talk:Falcorian">(talk)</a></small></sup> 18:43, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>delete</b>. Unlike the Zelda list, there is no information in this article to justify a list. But still, how is this a game guide? A game guide is an <i>instruction manual</i> (this is quite clear at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>) and this list says nothing about how to play the game. <span style="font-size: 10px">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 19:19, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>It doesn't have to be an instruction manual, anything "primarily of use to someone actually playing the game" is suspect.

<li>As noted above, game guides aren't purely instruction manuals. Game guides often contain miscellaneous lists that would be of interest to a player but not to a general reader.

<li><b>Delete</b> He's not there yet. GS is tricky to interpret, some are acknowledgments in a paper &amp; some are just citing the papers. Since this is biomedicine, I use PubMed: there are only 3 real articles, the other 11 listed with his name are other people. all three of them he were with his professor. the most recent was in 2001. There is no indication of any scientific work since then. I am very ready to accept any claim of notability for a researcher, but 3 pubs while a grad student and none since is below the average. Didn't even go for a post-doc, which is sort of the minimum qualification for a bio researcher. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 04:17, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have an idea <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a>. Why not <b>contribute to Wikipedia by adding these toll roads</b> instead of taking the <b>easy way out by deleting via a weak AFD?</b> You know, Wikipedia would operate much more smoothly if everyone would constructively contribute to the encylopedia.

<li>[<b>Comment:</b> My point about the incompleteness (real word?) was a reply to the question immediately before, <b>not</b> a reason for deletion. I am not prepared to add other countries and their toll roads because, quite simply, I have neither the time nor resources, and it is most definitely NOT much easier to add them than submit an AfD - anyone know how many toll roads there are in France for example?

I, personally, was unaware of the Dyer Critique, but I will definitely add it to me research. Other words with 'OAI' halloaing, hilloaing, holloaing, hulloaing, psoai, stoai, also please refer to: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unusual_English_words" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unusual_English_words" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unusual_English_words</a> Below is my original posting: I wrote this article. While I do have the sources in my library, (old, dry books that are on the verge of disintigrating, quite sadly) and do not question the existence of the word myself, I admit that what I cannot meet is Wikipedia's standards of verifiability <b>(but I see that others have now added verifiable sources)</b>. My books cannot be scanned, due to their fragility, and I have made countless efforts to photograph the pages, but no amount of lighting, or steadying can capture the characters properly. However, as for issues you have noted in this article: I myself have been trying to track down these authors, but to no avail. I can be quite certain these books are from the 1700s, as they meet the criteria for dating books of this time, however the authors themselves are difficult to trace. I believe that since they may, themselves, have been dealing with Black Magic or writing about it, they may have either have written under pen-names, or in other cases were ordinary, non-authoring citizens. As for the 'an unpublished manuscript by an unknown author' I agree, that it sounds quite suspicious, and my only explanation is that, to my embarassment, I have an original, but partial manuscript which I have dated to be from the early 1700s. Unfortunatly, I cannot find mention or clue of the author, or to the piece itself. Finally, the alligarto was my own typographical error, and the chimera is a mythical animal mentioned in philosophical pieces (Descartes' Meditiations comes to mind). Scientists have since named a certain biological anamoly 'Chimera' due to the original mythical meaning. I am, myself, writing on a book that will be about 'aploximodoais', and other such words that had once appeared in texts, but then ceased to exist. Perhaps then, I will try to change this article, as it will then have a verifiable source, though the source would be myself. I should also note, I am not affiliated with the MySpace user account. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.81.87.152_59fa.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.81.87.152">24.81.87.152</a> (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.81.87.152.html" title="User talk:24.81.87.152">talk</a>) 21:40, 20 January 2007 (UTC).</small>

<dd>I wanted to take a closer look at the -oai- vowel grouping also. Of the six words provided above, four are alternate spellings of hallooing (present participles of halloo, to call on hunting dogs), one is a valid plural of psoas, and one is an improperly formed plural of stoa (which could allow stoas or stoae, but not stoai). Regardless, the term under discussion is not formed from either the addition of the present participle -ing nor from the pluralization of -as to -ai. I cannot envision any etymology that would permit this term. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 06:01, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Mentioning a rivalry on a high school's page is fine. But having an entire page devoted to it is another thing.

<li><b>Keep</b> - This rivalry is notable to the entire San Francisco Bay Area which has millions of people in it and notable rivalries have millions of people knowing about it too. Why can't this article get it or other high school articles get it? And isn't the point of Wikipedia to create an informative online encyclopedia based on created topics that might not be easy to find online? Wikpedia English has over 1.5 million articles now. Their are probably only about 100,000 high school rivalries in the US. Would it make a difference at all to have 100,000 more articles. That's just a fraction compared to the whole Wikipedia English website. Every rivalry also has a deep history to people and is a tradtion and Wikipedia doesn't discourage users to not write about a local tradition. This article should be able to stay on Wikipedia and all articles that have the same rivalry topic should stay on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../g/n/d/User%7EGndawydiak_9bad.html" title="User:Gndawydiak">Gndawydiak</a> 06:21, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Your first sentence basically states the problem. It is known locally and that is all. It would be like having separate articles on every principal of every high school or every superintendent of every district. There has to be a limit somewhere. We already allow any high school to have a page. I just don't see the point in going beyond that and including non-notable rivalries such as this one. What's the problem with just including the information in the pages themselves?</li>

Writing about every principal and superintendent for every school and district is different. Rivalries people care and listen about it and high school rivalries shouldn't be limited. It shows the rich history of their culture and city or town and shouldn't be discouraged from creating their own article on it and shouldn't just be limited a section on the school's article where it can't flourish like an article. Their are hundreds of thousands of alumni of these school's that would feel the same way as I do and probably the general public of the Bay Area and Northern California would feel the same way. --<a href="../../../g/n/d/User%7EGndawydiak_9bad.html" title="User:Gndawydiak">Gndawydiak</a> 07:03, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> To begin with, an article of this nature is going to be a magnet for original research; this particular article has no citations. Secondly, rivalries of this nature, especially at the high school level, are simply not notable. The fact that the rivalry concerns schools in a big city makes no difference, it may be somewhat notable locally but notability needs to extend outside of the locale where the rivalry exists. Almost all high schools are going to have these 'rivalries' and many high schools are going to have multiple rivalries and most of the time these rivalries are going to be rather subjective as rivalries of this sort are, quite frankly, rather arbitrary constructs. I doubt, though am unsure, that there are articles on rivalries between major national teams or college teams, either, and for good reason. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 00:10, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

I take this deletion as really offensive and if this article is deleted, I'll bring it back no matter what anyone says and I'll fight for it.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I just looked over what you should look over before nominating an article for deletion. I says that some articles start out bad if they were just created. This article got a deletion notice five minutes after getting it created. This article needs to have a clean up instead of a deletion because as I stated before, the "attacking" user gave this article no chance and is letting it drown in the water with no mercy at all. This user took it to an un-needed level and any administrator who believes in me should remove the deletion and put a clean up tag instead.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Ok I'm going to shut up after this comment because I'm tired of dealing with these users. What I want to say before I stop is that this article shouldn't be on for deletion just after 5 minutes of its creation. Woohookitty went and over reacted and nominated it for deletion instead of following the Before nominating an AfD and reading that you should consider putting a clean-up tag instead. If he/she put that up, the article probably would of changed over a while making the article better than it is. Now this article is going to be deleted because of an over-reaction of an administrator that didn't look over the deletion policy. This article is notable to millions of people and can be supported by countless articles about this in newspapers. This article can't be merged with <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce-Mahoney_Trophy_9841.html" title="Bruce-Mahoney Trophy">Bruce-Mahoney Trophy</a> because these articles are different things but have some similarites but are different topics. I am sorry for my behavior for this debate but I over-react when somebody does something personal to me and I felt like I have to fight for this because this administrator didn't give this article a chance. Again, I am sorry for my behavior and you may accept this apology or not. If this article is reviewed by anyone else, look at the things that matter about the article and not my behavior or behavior of others.

<dd>Gndawydiak, the process can be frustrating. When I first began with WP, an article could begin as a seed and grow with time. However, the huge volume of junk that is submitted each day has forced WP into a defensive posture to battle the junk and spam. As volunteers we have to be efficient in nipping the junk in the bud ASAP. Now I develop my articles off-line and cut &amp; paste something substantial enough to avoid the deletion process. This is respectful of the efforts by dilligent volunteers who are looking out for our mutual interest in having a credible WP. It is the spammers etc. at whom you should direct your anger.

<dd><b>Comment</b> To establish notability you need multiple reviews, the article supplies only one and that one source is rather non-notable itself. Also, there is no independent biography; I believe the biography you consider to be independent is a biography on a Writer's Union website, in other words that biography is likely to have been submitted by Victor himself since he is a member of that union. This is supported by the fact that that biography gives Victor's email address for responses... --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 01:39, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

At some point this must be deleated, however until we see such a flurry of titles that this becomes unmaintainable or unneccesseray, I vfeel that this article should be updated periodically to help out the consumer. <b>EDIT&#160;: I Compleatly agree with DGG</b> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_75.82.220.77_318d.html" title="Special:Contributions/75.82.220.77">75.82.220.77</a> (talk) 18:57, 21 January 2007 (UTC).</small>

Browsing through the organization's website, I don't see any evidence that they did anything notable such as organized a significant protest.

<ul>
<li>Most of the results for a search on "Action Iran" anti-war beyond the first four or five are irrelevant. The article cites seven sources, two are from the organization, one is from the group Action Iran merged into, one is from Internet Archive which accepts submissions from anyone and doesn't meet <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, the remaining three are from anti-war websites.

<ul>
<li><i>one is from the group Action Iran merged into</i>: that only implies that the groups have a common interest, it does not provide any evidence that prior to the merger, they should be considered as a single organisation; the Internet Archive is <i>in-depth</i> material (to some extent) - it presents a video; <i>the remaining three are from anti-war websites</i> - so are you claiming that anti-war websites are not reliable sources? That's your personal POV. <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Callinicos_a381.html" title="Alex Callinicos">Alex Callinicos</a> may call himself a "Marxist", but he nevertheless has a reasonably solid wikipedia page. <a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBoud_7cef.html" title="User:Boud">Boud</a> 20:54, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Please read: <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28organizations%29_0596.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (organizations)">Wikipedia:Notability_(organizations)</a>. It is sufficient that the scope of the organisation is international (which it clearly is) and that it's verified by a third party (which it clearly is, by several third parties). It may have been a small organisation, in fact this seems fairly clear, but that doesn't change the fact that it was a "third-party-confirmed" organisation whose "scope of activities was international". i've written this in a more structured form on the talk page Talk:Action Iran. <a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBoud_7cef.html" title="User:Boud">Boud</a> 20:54, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Well New Hall is (or at least was) pretty luxurious by British student accommodation standards (double beds, satellite TV etc.) but I don't think there's anything architecturally significant about it and it's only been there since 1993. I've really no idea if any of the other buildings are of any particular significance beyond age and <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_William_b388.html" title="Prince William">former royal inhabitants</a>. Hamilton Hall is probably the most recognisable building (if only because of an appearance in <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chariots_of_Fire_e5ad.html" title="Chariots of Fire">Chariots of Fire</a>) and that's no longer a university building anyway. <a href="http://calvin.st-andrews.ac.uk/external_relations/news_article.cfm?reference=676" class="external autonumber" title="http://calvin.st-andrews.ac.uk/external_relations/news_article.cfm?reference=676" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> -- <a href="../../../i/s/l/User%7EIslaySolomon_7ae5.html" title="User:IslaySolomon"><font color="#153E7E">Islay</font><font color="#1589FF">Solomon</font></a> <font color="#153E7E">|</font> <a href="../../../i/s/l/User_talk%7EIslaySolomon_7b55.html" title="User talk:IslaySolomon"><font color="#006600">talk</font></a> 21:35, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>conditional keep and holdon</b> If the legal requirement for certification can be sourced, then this is clearly notable. They appear to be an important regulatory and industry body.

<li><b>Keep</b> if it can be sourced and clean up. The article wording at the moment implies more than the BIIAB is. It is not a regulatory body, it offers training (along with many others) to meet the regulations. <a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENuttah68_2daa.html" title="User:Nuttah68">Nuttah68</a> 17:16, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Nuttah68, I've made a cleanup pass to clarify that it's only one body offering liscensing, but it seems that they do do a fair share of the governmental training for certain required certifications. I'd compare it to ServSafe in the US, yes there are other food safety training programs availible, but ServSafe is definately the primary certification I've ever encountered (though that might be geographical). As such I still think it's probably notable. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 20:52, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> The yearbook is pretty notable in college basketball circles. Using <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factiva.html" title="Factiva">Factiva</a>, I found 232 newspaper articles referencing the guide, including 26 that mention the title of the book in their headlines or lead paragraphs. At least 99 libraries carry the yearbooks, as well (according to <a href="../../../w/o/r/WorldCat_6cab.html" title="WorldCat">WorldCat</a>). The article <i>is</i> kind of spammy, but it doesn't appear to be a straight cut-and-paste job.

<li><s><b>Weak Delete</b> - Potentially notable, but no attempt at verifiability at all. Perhaps it can be cited, but someone needs to do it before this AfD closes.

<ul>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> - With the current references, I'm revising my vote to Keep. Good job tagging and cleaning it up! Hopefully more information can be added later to expand this article. It'd be good to see a History section about where it came from, and why it's referred to as the "Bible" for basketball. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a></li>

<p>First, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">wikipedia is not a memorial</a>. There is a lot of precedent for deleting lists of otherwise non-notable people who died in a particular event. Even if casualty lists were acceptable, this list is downright weird. First, there is almost no information provided about these people. Although this is supposedly a list of "academics" it includes people like hotel managers, consultants, doctors, etc. In most cases there isn't even a date of death. Second, almost everyone is unsourced and thus impossible to verify. If a person listed here was kidnapped or killed, how do we know that this had anything to do with his being an academic? <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 08:58, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This topic -- the violent purge of Iraqi intelligencia -- is worthy of encyclopedia space, but I find a list of the particular targets problematic at best. In addition to the nominator's concerns about the broadly inclusive view of "academics" taken by the list, I am concerned about its premise. Tracking everyone in any field who has been <i>threatened</i> in what is essentially an active civil war is simply beyond the scope of Wikipedia. With verification also uniquely unlikely, <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> issues seems a plausible hazard as well. With all that said, this might be an idea to revisit after the situation calms down in the region and some more objective reporting can occur.

<li><b>Move</b> to Academic intimidation in Iraq since 2003 (perhaps, open to other suggestions) and delete the list. The introduction could be a start to a real article. The list is not our responsibility and it's just a bad uncategorized list of non-notable people.

<li><b>Delete</b> I fully agree with Serpent's Choice, the broader topic of the purging of Iraqi intellectuals is certainly an encyclopedic topic. However, a list of this sort is too problematic. What, precicely, constitutes an 'academic?' How are we going to verify all of this, especially those being threatened... and what constitutes a threat in this instance? And, to add some really dark humor, isn't this unmaintainable too? --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 00:21, 21 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree that the topic definitely warrants an article. It is one of the most disturbing things I've seen on wikipedia. The problem is that the list doesn't really tell us very much about what is actually happening. Were these people targeted because of their profession? Their politics? Their sect? Were they targeted randomly? Who is doing the "threatening"? Are Shi'ites and Sunnis being targeted equally? If we want to create an article about it we need to do more research and not just use the existing text as a starting point. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 00:33, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>'<i>keep</i> and improve as needed. I guess I'm the only one, but perhaps my comments may be useful in recreation. I do not find the definition of academics very much over-broad: they are almost all of the college lectures or faculty; the new list might be specifically limited to that, and then have list of Physicians, etc.etc. I think perhaps threatened is too broad a term, for who there is not? Killed/kidnapped is more verifiable. OR it is not, it is compilation from sources, as is the rest of WP. I cannot understand ""the list is not our responsibility" Our responsibility is encyclopedic coverage , limited of course to those articles where someone is willing to do the work. The list would look more professional with a more sophisticated table. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 03:36, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This 'event' was insignificant. An internet search shows only one page (the cited source) that mentions this tasting (apart from the dozens of pages that just mirror wikipedia). The source in turn just cites two articles in local newspapers (Phillips, Rod. Battle of the bottles. Ottawa Citizen, October 19, 2005; Schreiner, John. Millenium tasting. Kelowna Daily Courier, October 22, 2005.) The event is about as important as a village flower show and does not merit an encyclopedia entry. <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunquam_Dormio_ecde.html" title="User:Nunquam Dormio">Nunquam Dormio</a> 09:09, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Insignificant content? Maybe, but then maybe not. The Hanson article also talks about a 1981 Ottowa tasting. While I love Bordeaux I do think it's interesting to see them go up against lesser known wines in a blind test with sometimes surprising results. I would vote to delete the page for copyright reasons but would hope to see the Hanson article referenced from some other wiki page. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmoulding_bdc0.html" title="User:Smoulding">Steve.Moulding</a> 17:34, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>All substantial edits on this article have been made by what is probably a single editor (one registered user and, later, an IP address). The only other edits by the registered user involve inserting references to Arkatents into other articles (such as <a href="../../../l/2E/l/L.L._Bean_f8ac.html" title="L.L. Bean">L.L. Bean</a>. The registered user removed a speedy deletion tag at least nine times. The bulk of the article now is actually camping tips copied from the Arkatents website and now there is language in the article about Arkatents retaining rights to the material. The information about the company (such as company history) is a relatively late addiion to the article. Originally, the article was little more than just a link to the website. There is still no information about notability. I shared <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> information with the editor after I realized they were not going to stop removing the speedy deletion tag and there is still nothing in the article.

<p>Individual moves are the subject matter for news articles, not encyclopedia articles. While the subject matter is clearly worth including in the article on <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Beckham_f822.html" title="David Beckham">David Beckham</a> and possibly <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Galaxy_796e.html" title="Los Angeles Galaxy">Los Angeles Galaxy</a>, I think we should really wait until the dust settles to see if this has real historical significance in and of itself. Perhaps it is a shame to delete outright this work, but I think that a transwiki of the article to wikinews, and merging of appropriate parts to David Beckham and elsewhere would be appropriate. Otherwise, this is a pretty dangerous precedent of encyclopedia articles on individual transfers. (This is a repeat nomination. The <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_David_Beckham_move_to_Los_Angeles_Galaxy_2496.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/David Beckham move to Los Angeles Galaxy">first nomination</a> (which had four calls to merge and one to keep) ended in a speedy keep because the article was linked from the front page, but with no prejudice for renominating the article for deletion once it was off the front page.) <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotforaday_000c.html" title="User:Robotforaday">Robotforaday</a> 12:28, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article has not asserted the notability of the person in question, and many people have lived a 'pioneer lifestyle', or had great 'gardening skills'.

<li>Calling someone "a regional celebrity" does not mean they're notable (and I suspect that Peeples Valley, Arizona is not a particluarly important 'region'). I can find nothing in this 'biography' that is out of the ordinary, given the time and location, and nothing on the topics for which she is supposed to be famous - healing and gardening.

Google Scholar and Google Books are much more useful, but didn't help in this case. Looking at the article on the book, we she she gets one of 16 chapters in it. Using special:booksources by clicking on the ISBN, we can go to the Library of Congress website and learn that the book has 137 pages, so there should be roughly 8 pages on her in that book. Local history museums are generally a source of content that is at least as reliable as the typical newspaper, and that is what the linked web-source is. Sources don't have to be notable, the article's topic does. However, the history museum webpage is only a passing mention, so we only have one source thus far. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 03:26, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Vacuous article. All it contains is a table listing some countries (not all countries in the world), and whether they "have gun control" and if so, since what year. Of course, this table is a complete oversimplification of the issues; gun control is not as simple as a yes/no, and there are no sources. Merging is proposed to <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gun_politics.html" title="Gun politics">gun politics</a>, but this would be bad because the article contains nothing worth keeping. <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gun_politics.html" title="Gun politics">Gun politics</a> should perhaps be written with a more worldwide view, but that won't be assisted by including this table. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 12:59, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as it has no useful information to merge.

<li>Yeah, that would make sense. I'm not sure this topic is suited to a list at all, to be honest, given the specific nuances of each country's policies.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I had hoped my comment on the talk page would prompt someone to turn it into what it should be but the actual list has since been added to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_in_British_music_304d.html" title="2006 in British music">2006 in British music</a> anyway. — <a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnemoneProjectors_565e.html" title="User:AnemoneProjectors">AnemoneProjectors</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/n/e/User_talk%7EAnemoneProjectors_b870.html" title="User talk:AnemoneProjectors">talk</a>)</small> 20:54, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> &amp; <b>Rename</b> to "Top UK Singles in 2006" which more accurately reflects the information in this article. The article could use an introduction that provides a little bit more context, but this is a valid list topic.

<li><b>Keep</b> as useful list. It is not indiscriminate information as it uses #1 and top 10 singles as criteria. It provides information that a category doesn't and is useful. Needs sourcing but a useful list. It should certainly not be speedy deleted under any criteria that I could see and it would certainly be concerning if someone would speedy delete an article like this. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 01:52, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Unnecessary and arbitrary, in that: the #1 songs are already covered in the established series of articles xxxx in British music, and the other placings are rather arbitrary: why all the top ten singles? Why not the top 20? 40? 50? 75?

<li><b>Comment</b> Actually, there's no need to even initiate the discussion re: merging this to 2006 in British music, because the top 20 singles are already covered on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_in_music.html" title="2006 in music">2006 in music</a>. So it's basically a pointless duplication of other articles - how many different places need to host this information? GassyGuy 04:35, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Is a list of all the top-10 singles a copyright violation? If it's not, then a specific article for this has some (limited) merit. Pending clarification of copyright, <b>redirect</b> to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_in_British_music_304d.html" title="2006 in British music">2006 in British music</a> as plausible search term. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEludium-q36_1333.html" title="User:Eludium-q36">Eludium-q36</a> 10:50, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I wouldn't say that it is not notable—it is attributed as the first anime convention in the United States—but there aren't enough independent non-trivial articles from a reliable source to pass <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>.

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> How can something written BY THE PERSON, HERSELF have 'no reliable sources and no verifiability'? I've known Jenn, in person, for ten years, and I can verify it all... and by the way, who 'verifies' me or my writing? If I'd've written this same article instead of her writing it herself, it *might* have been OK? So she and her WEBcomics are (naturally) only known for their WEB presence, and that's evidently not sufficient. This is as opposed to Wikipedia's 'presence'? At any rate, I VOTE (despite those who want all the 'power' for themselves, and who do not want to listen to the mere audience who READS the article) to have Jenn's article deleted because SHE wants it that way, NOT because there isn't demand and merit. Wikipedia may appear useful and objective on the surface, but ultimately, it is just another web community with the underlying motivation being a power trip for a few select people. So much for Wikipedia's credibility. Unfortunately for those people, whether you delete or keep the article... Jenn 'wins'. That's pretty remarkable, considering all she was trying to do was get her info out there for those who are interested in her and her work. ...My edit of the main entry was admittedly accidental, but I can't say that it bothers me much at this point. xoxo</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> To hell with your "this is not a ballot." Jenn has requested her own deletion, and she's got legions of fans who will follow her to the ends of the earth. "Not notable," my arse.</li>
<li><strike><b>Delete</b></strike> Reluctantly, at the request of the subject, but this is the only one I'm going to play along with. I really hate the deletionist mindset of too many on Wikipedia. This isn't a paper encyclopedia. It is uniquely situated to be a repository of a wide expanse of cultural phenomena that may prove all to ephemeral in nature, with future historians struggling to find information -- this is perhaps nowhere more pronounced than with bands, especially ones in countries that don't have an equivalent of the Billboard 100 (so you're in country X, therefore you're non-notable by definition and must be deleted? The feedback I've gotten from some seems to be an unapologetic and resounding 'yes'). [snip flaming rant.

<li><b>Re-write</b> Just because the subject of the page wants it deleted, should it be?

That would leave a gap from references in other pages that linked there. The page is linked to by at least 8 other content pages. Rather than being deleted, the page should perhaps be <b>rewritten</b> and <b>updated</b> by another wiki user. For example, the current version doesn't list the subject's organising of the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transgender_Day_of_Remembrance_2ba9.html" title="Transgender Day of Remembrance">Transgender Day of Remembrance</a> Webcomics Project (and I have just added a link to this on that page. --<a href="../../../l/a/u/User%7ELauraSeabrook_2642.html" title="User:LauraSeabrook">Laura Seabrook</a> 25 January 2007 2:57 (GMT +10:00)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> If Ms. Dolari isn't a public figure, as some would seem to suggest, then she has a right to privacy which includes protection against publicity of her private life. If she is a public figure, then aren't some of you just a bunch of pompous asses for trying to delete a entry just because you aren't <i>personally</i> familiar with its subject. Ms. Dolari is well known in the web comic community and has made many convention appearances. If, however, she doesn't want to be associated with Wikipedia anymore, then you should respect her wishes. --Wiscesq 17:01, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Re-write</b> What <a href="../../../l/a/u/User%7ELauraSeabrook_2642.html" title="User:LauraSeabrook">Laura Seabrook</a> said. I'm sorry Jenn's feeling are hurt at the VfD, but it seems to be a bit of an over-reaction. (Can someone pull their permissions to any information from Britannica, actually? That's an interesting question...) Jenn's editing of her own page aside, she's notable and I'd say to keep her. I understand her feelings to pretty much flip wikipedia the bird (and on a personal level, support it entirely). On an editor level, though, I think the page should stay. -- <font color="green"><b><a href="../../../i/p/s/User%7EIpstenu_5894.html" title="User:Ipstenu">Ipstenu</a></b> <i>(<a href="../../../i/p/s/User_talk%7EIpstenu_7a4a.html" title="User talk:Ipstenu">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ipstenu_a5b5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ipstenu">contribs</a>)</i></font> 19:32, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>delete - I am disapointed that this disscussion even came up. I go out to Jenn's pages more often than I come here. Jenn asked to be deleted. I think she is more than noteworthy enough to be listed, but you may not be noteworthy enough to do the listing. The first entry argues that her web comics MIGHT fail? How could such an argument be taken seriously based on your own guidlines? GChapman.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Whoever's taking charge of this portion of the wiki seems to have it in for the person who was working on the Texas roads list. Such personal vendettas are unbecoming.

This crusade against Texas highway detailing must <i>end,</i> even if this is the only way to do it. - Doc Mackie 19:00, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> although the article needs more references, this is a valid concept with applications in web usability (I know there have been quantitative studies) and search engine optimization. The term itself is not necessarily used in formal style guides, though. It should be possible to write an article about these aspects. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 17:37, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Right now, the article only has a single reference, which appears to be the originator of the term. This article has been up for AfD twice before, in November <i>2004</i> and this past August. If this is all we get in two years of editing, what hope is there that this can be turned into a useful article? No one has bothered to find new sources, even since the August AfD. This suggests either the references don't exist, or the article is simply never going to be updated to meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 21:45, 20 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>True, but I can't find that the article was ever tagged for cleanup, expansion, lack of references, or any of its obvious sins. It really seems like we should do something with a concept that's a <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECONTEXT_5f0d.html" title="WP:CONTEXT">recognized longstanding guideline</a> for our own project. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 22:14, 20 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And incidentally, Dvorak is in no way the originator of the term; here's a <a href="http://charon.sfsu.edu/OVERLINKED.HTML" class="external text" title="http://charon.sfsu.edu/OVERLINKED.HTML" rel="nofollow">1995 citation</a>, published in another form <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.01/chandler.if.html" class="external text" title="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.01/chandler.if.html" rel="nofollow">in WIRED in 1996</a>.--<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 22:19, 20 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thanks for that info. Still, those only indicate the concept existed. Nothing suggests it to be notable, and those links do nothing but explain the concept again. Maybe this should be turned into a redirect to another article on web design, but it still doesn't seem to be enough to exist on its own. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 22:30, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep some of them, delete others</b> - having read many of the Wodehouse books, I would say that Aunts Agatha and Dahlia, Fink-Nottle, Roderick and Tuppy Glossop, Anatole and Roderick Spode count as major (recurring) characters. (Anatole even appeared in <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schott%27s_Miscellanies_b7bb.html" title="Schott's Miscellanies">Schott's Miscellanies</a>...) From WP:FICT: "Major characters (and places, concepts, etc.) in a work of fiction should be covered within the article on that work of fiction. <b>If an encyclopedic treatment of such a character causes the article on the work itself to become long, then that character can be given a separate article.</b>" (my bold text). Rather than repeat the same info about every character in each book in which they appear, better to have a separate article on each character. On the other hand, I agree that all the minor characters' articles can go, as can the country houses. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 17:47, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Fine, though I think you are overly generous in bestowing the title of major character, which of course WP guidelines do not define. But there are more of these things than I thought. There may be over a hundred. I mean, Wooster's prep school (fictional) has its own article! This is going to take a while.

<li><b>Merge</b> most to minor characters in PG Wodehouse and redirect. I suggested this ages ago and was rebuffed, it remains, in my view, a good idea.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Don't delete any. The larger ones stand on their own and are well written.

<ul>
<li><b>keep almost all the characters</b>. What counts as major? That isn't in WP:FICTION. The presence of characters (or locations or themes) that occur in more than one novel are central to the overall structure of PGW's fiction. As is, there are three degrees of significance. The major characters, who have their own articles. (I think all of these are in more than one book; PGW normally made quite sure his major characters would appear repeatedly. Then, the "minor" characters. These sometimes appeared in more than one book, but were never central to the continuing themes. These do not have their own articles. They mostly have sections in the 5 related articles</li>

<dd>so there are no articles on minor characters to delete. Then, the really minor characters, who do not appear in in these lists, but only in the List of P.G.Wodehouse_characters, with only a few words of information each. Many of these would probably deserve their own sections--only the Blandings series has been excerpted thoroughly. I admire the restraint of the prior editors on these pages. There are only 61 articles on main characters. It may be possible to find a few to dispute, but the inclusion of Madeline Bassett and Bingo Little and the Drones Club in the first batch of AfDs does not bode well for the judgement of the deletors.
<dl>
<dd>I would be prepared to concede Daphne Braythwayt, Watkyn Bassett, Daphne Winkworth and Boko_Fittleworth from this group. keep only a redirect to the sections among the minor characters. For those who unfortunately do not know them all, I think it reasonable to make a preliminary judgment on the basis of the length of the article.</dd>

<dd>That sounds reasonable. Still, it could be redirected to an article say, "Organizations in the Wodehouse stories". Most of these articles are not long.

<li><b>Put most into the minor chars page</b>, then move back out into separate articles if enough info emerges. This is how I did the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_characters_in_the_Blandings_stories_14f3.html" title="Minor characters in the Blandings stories">Blandings</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_characters_in_the_Ukridge_stories_d0a0.html" title="Minor characters in the Ukridge stories">Ukridge</a> and <a href="../../../p/2E/_/P._G._Wodehouse_minor_characters_7368.html" title="P. G. Wodehouse minor characters">Minor Chars.</a> pages - ploughing through all the books/stories, adding any data spotted as I went along (the first two of these are almost done with, just having trouble finding the last few books). It soon becomes obvious which characters rate their own page, when a lot of info is built up about one person. I think these pages work pretty well, carrying lots of useful and interesting info without becoming too unwieldy - I hope some day to add similar for the Mr Mulliner and golf shorts, and may need to merge the school and Psmith stuff out of the main Minor Chars (which covers the misc novels) into their own page. Admittedly, the selection process was a lot simpler with the Blandings books, as a hardcore of characters appear in at least half of the books, in various configurations, and with Ukridge only the man himself got the full treatment. There's also a locations page which is fairly populated already - <a href="../../../p/2E/_/P._G._Wodehouse_locations_7feb.html" title="P. G. Wodehouse locations">here</a> - and would probably be the right spot for most of the places; I put some of the Jeeves places in there a while back, with basic info, but never got round to removing the old pages - the Black Shorts may not be a neat fit though... <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnnyZen_ed5b.html" title="User:JohnnyZen">JohnnyZen</a> 09:20, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> You will note that the policy for minor fictional characters is merge into a list, not delete wholesale. I am especially concerned with the article on Roderick Spode, whose deletion would result in a missing link on the Oswald Mosley article. --<a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeenbr0_52bb.html" title="User:Skeenbr0">Skeenbr0</a> 05:44, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> It is inappropriate to throw away this much information, especially given the magnitude of notability of the author. Several of these articles that I've seen separately VfDed don't stand up on their own, but could easily hold their own weight as sections of a larger article. -- <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrangelv_5bf8.html" title="User:Strangelv">Strangelv</a> 16:19, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>(<b>comment</b> this will never be settled, since a few more PGW fanatics would sway the consensus-- There probably are a few left who haven't joined in WP. The only thing to do here is to compromise on sections of an article, with appropriate redirects. The sections can, of course, be as long and detailed as the ingenuity of those fans who are here can make them.--but putting sections for the characters without even sections but just a name on a list must come first--as well as a more accurate check of some of the golf stories etc. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 00:11, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Pure speculation, violates <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">WP:CRYSTAL</a>. COD4 probably is in the works, but there has been no official statement. The web article used as the source is a non-notable reference that makes an ambiguous claim to an unknown reliable source. The COD4 article contains nothing as it stands except rumour, which is what we don't want on Wikipedia. Additionally, the <a href="http://www.callofduty.com" class="external text" title="http://www.callofduty.com" rel="nofollow">official site</a> has not been updated to reflect COD4 in development.

<li><b>Comment</b>: You also have to consider that even with more sources stating the development of <i>Call of Duty 4</i>, there are still no <b>reliable sources</b>. The information presented thus far are based off leaks. This does not do many favours for its accuracy or authenticity, especially as the <a href="http://www.callofduty.com" class="external text" title="http://www.callofduty.com" rel="nofollow">official site</a> has not listed the game nor any news of it. It could be months before <i>anything</i> is released. There's little point in keeping a stub with no conclusive content; we should follow normal procedure and delete the article until something substantial comes out. Why keep something around that is potentially misleading? --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd">Scottie theNerd</a> 14:44, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article was originally nominated for deletion <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Renaissance_Papacy_a841.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Renaissance Papacy">here</a> as a POV essay of original reasearch. To solve these problems, it was reduced to a few sentences, which led it to be kept, many editors saying something to the effect of that they hoped it would be expanded. In the more than three months since, next to nothing has been done with it, and it remains a stub that contains no information that couldn't be included in <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">Pope</a>. Contrary to the statement on the tag, it has been tagged for expansion since October 2006. If this article were expanded, it might be useful, but as it stands, I don't see that it does any real service to the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeimstern_8a02.html" title="User:Heimstern">Heimstern Läufer</a> 17:56, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Please leave this article alone. I am researching Billy's history and I plan to add more information in the near future. He fought in the 1930's so I have some work to do to add detail.

<li><b>Userfy</b> (is that really a word?) to Darrlyxxx's page to complete, as suggested by wangi. However, I think Billy only fought a few boughts, and may be just merged into his brother's article--maybe you know more as his grandson, he in addition to his brother were both rather well thought of though. Let me know, Darryl, if you eventually find more, but I'd be surprised if you do, at least in amateur or professional boxing. Please just work on your user page until you find more.

<li><b>Comment</b> Can we have more than "seems like a non-notable boxer" as a nomination for deletion? This was an important and colorful era of boxing in that part of the world, it gets a lot of play even in the world professional boxing press in America. I don't think Billy is quite Wikipedia-worthy, because he only fought in a few matches. Still, "seems like" is just POV. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 20:36, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Billy Warnock is not notable. He appears to have fought main events, but too little is known of him to make him notable. His brother Jimmy would make the notability test since he was a ranked contender. Mentioning Billy as a piece of trivia in a bio of Jimmy, were it to exist, would suffice.--Matt1978 22:21, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> To whoever posted the above info, please try to keep a proper format as the way you posted it really disrupts the AfD. Also, the sources above don't really seem to establish notability since they aren't from legitimate enough sources, are there any newspaper articles detailing why this man is important? And, although we are willing to accept sources in another language, it is generally important to have at least one or two sources in English since this is the English Wikipedia and the average editor should be able to read the sources and know that they establish notability. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 01:35, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Article about a non-notable, unimpressive make-believe country. Survived a <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Aerican_Empire_40bf.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aerican Empire">seemingly votestacked</a> AfD several months back... there were a large number of Keep votes coming almost exclusively from unestablished users or IPs, including self-proclaimed members of the club.</p>
<p>A couple of quotes from the article itself:</p>
<p><i>"Annually, the Empire holds story-writing contests, role-playing and wargaming days, and such events as the Dog-Biscuit Appreciation Day Scavenger Hunt."</i></p>
<p><i>"Nationally recognized holidays (and "niftydays") within the Empire include 2 January Procrastinator's Day, 27 February *Oops* Day, 19 March What the Heck is That Day, 14 April Tempting Fate Day, 25 May Towel Day, 28 August Significant Historical Events Day, and 26 October Topin Wagglegammon, The Niftiest Day of the Year."</i></p>
<p>Google yields <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=&amp;hl=en&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=Aerican+Empire&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_nlo=&amp;as_nhi=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=&amp;hl=en&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=Aerican+Empire&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_nlo=&amp;as_nhi=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;as_rights=&amp;safe=images" rel="nofollow">513 results</a> for "Aerican Empire", but most seem to be passing mentions, directories (mainly <a href="http://lom.4t.com/members/index.html" class="external text" title="http://lom.4t.com/members/index.html" rel="nofollow">stuff like this</a>), the website for Aerican Empire, or Wikipedia links. It seems to me like a small group of individuals (the X dozen belonging to this club) trying to force notability and best the system, by getting it listed as many places as possible.</p>
<p>The Aerican Empire website itself states that anyone can become a citizen by filling out a simple <a href="http://aericanempire.com/citform.html" class="external text" title="http://aericanempire.com/citform.html" rel="nofollow">webform</a>. <a href="http://www.aericanempire.com/pep2.html" class="external text" title="http://www.aericanempire.com/pep2.html" rel="nofollow">Here's</a> a complete list of "citizens", which seems to number in the upper two-digits.

<li><b>Rewrite <s>or Delete</s></b> Not an actual nation, just an organization created for humorous purposes by a bunch of kids.

<li><b>Comment:</b> I cannot see any argument for deletion. How it was created, or whether it is technically a nation are completely irrelevent. It has featured in multiple, non-trivial sources as the subject, as displayed in the references section of the article, and is therefore notable. The fact that past AfDs have been badly handled is not criteria for deletion, just criteria to renominate, as this has been. Irrelevent of how 'silly' the groups culture, rules and joining procedure may seem, this deserves a place in the encyclopedia, and isn't even particuarly badly written. Even if it was badly written, it is not original research, it is of a NPOV and it is verified. I think this matter may well come under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#CENSOR" title="WP:NOT">this <i>policy</i></a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b> The problem here isn't notability. This topic may indeed be notable, the sources do seem to indicate this, so an article on this topic isn't necessarily unjustifiable. The problem is that the article is written as if this place <i>actually existed,</i> the article presents the Aerican Empire as being real.

<dd>Once again, this is not a fictional empire. This is real and affects the lives of real people.

<dd>Any individual could sit down and make infeasible claims to whatever land they wanted, but that doesn't make it true, nor does it automatically merit an article. Getting 100 people (or 150 -- whatever insignificant number we're arguing over at this point) to fill out a short web form to join a club is not that impressive. There are small MMORPGs with 5,000-10,000 players that have been deleted for lack of notability/significance, and this group is a LOT smaller. Age is not criterion for inclusion, either.

<dd>I've always taken "not made up in school one day" to mean it shouldn't be posted that day. After all, arguably, Microsoft was made up in school one day, and then it was built upon for years.

<li><b>Comment</b> The Aerican Empire has serious goats of sovoverignty it is not fake or a "political exercise." The silliness favtor is to not scare people away from joining. I happen to know that the government is very active and they are undergoing elections as we speak. It wasn't made up "one day in school," it is a concept that has been refined and retuned over the years by and for the citizens of The Aerican Empire. The Kurds of Northern Iraq want their own nation yet they don't have one. Then why do they refer to the territory as Kurdistan? It's even well documented in Wikipedia even though they're not internationally recognized. Don't point out the humorous nature of the Empire as a sign of it being fake because you'll be very wrong. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrud3w4re_51ff.html" title="User:Crud3w4re">Crud3w4re</a> 18:58, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> I'm the first to admit I'm biased about this (you'll see my name in the page's history) so I won't vote keep, but to respond to some of the comments made above (this being a discussion and not a ballot: 1) CZJ's comments seem to mostly attack the humour elements of the group, while Wiki has plenty of articles about other silly societies. 2) The number of members is not in the dozen or two digits; it's currently just below 150, which while not huge is significant, and also justifies the number in the article as actually being a low estimate. 3) I freely admit that the writing is unencyclopedic, but that's because I'm not a great author. This does not invalidate the topic. There have been requests made in the article's talk page and elsewhere for other writers to help change the article to wiki standards. 4) The Empire *does* genuinly exist, although I doubt many people here will believe me. You are allowing your biases of seriousness to determine what you will accept as realistic; if a group of people believe something is a nation, then in a very real sense, it is one. Most importantly, the article cites sources from recognized news sites and does present genuine information to readers. Whether the information is a bit silly has no impact on whether or not this is a real group. The article can and should be changed to better fit wiki standards but it should not be deleted. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimcrow_b867.html" title="User:Timcrow">timcrow</a>

Aerican Empire claims the entire planet (plus mars). Given the sheer silliness of that claim, they don't have any defined territory whatsoever. They're not a nation, they're an organization created for humorous purposes. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 17:03, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>First, they dont claim all of Earth, they claim several well-defined small areas (and a couple of poorly defined small areas). Similarly, only a small portion of Mars is claimed, and precise coordinates are available. These territories aren't defined in the article but they are deifned in the website; if it would improve the article, I'd be happy to add the details to it. And again, I really feel that "silly" is a matter of perspective, and neither an objective nor a neutral label. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimcrow_b867.html" title="User:Timcrow">Timcrow</a> 17:23, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The Aerican Empire has nearly 100 active citizenry but many have had their citizenship revoked due to inactivity so there has been maybe over a thousand citizens altogether. While most micronations are unrealistic or never last Aerica has existed since the 1980's and it continues to grow and strive towards its goals. How can anyone deny this? It has its own .com website. It has an extremely active citizenry and government. The Aerican Empire is one of the oldest fully functional micronations in existence today. Aerica is a model micronation of what many want but what very few can ever aspire to become. To delete this page would be a direct insult to micronationalism and to every citizen of Aerica.</li>
</ul>
<p>I fully object to the deletion of this page. What reason is there to delete a glorious nations Wikipedia page? When people are interested in seeing examples of successful micronations they will want to read about The Empire of Aerica. The Empire of Aerica has also been mentioned many times via newspapers and I heard even on television a few times. The documentation can all be found on the official website.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Since the AfD began, the article has really begun to contradict itself. Before the AfD was filed, "<i>records no longer exist[ed] to indicate what the purpose of creating the Empire was.</i>" Suddenly, that changed to state that the purpose for creation was "<i>a nation which might one day merit international recognition of soverignty (sic).</i>" Conflicting information still exists in the article, stating that it really did begin as a joke: "<i>the goals and ideals of the Empire matured. The Empire slowly abandoned most fictional elements and worked towards becoming a political entity rather than a hobby.</i>" So, which is it? Were "the records lost" or did it intend on becoming a nation from day one? Because of these blatant contradictions, I'm having a really hard time taking any of this seriously, and wonder if other parts of the article have been glamorized. --<a href="../../../c/z/j/User%7ECzj_f490.html" title="User:Czj">Czj</a> 19:22, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm sorry, I thought the idea here was for the article to get rewritten and improved. I've been working on it. I don't see the contradictions myself. The records were lost (they were all five-year olds, after all), but the goal was the same as today.

<dd>That is my very point. The records were <i>regarding</i> the purpose of creating the nation. It was unknown, <i>because</i> the records had been lost. They're still lost, but suddenly it becomes known that the purpose all along was to create an internationally recognized entity? No offense, but something like this wreaks of "it's being made up as we go". --<a href="../../../c/z/j/User%7ECzj_f490.html" title="User:Czj">Czj</a> 19:34, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The original records said that records had been lost, becuse young kids didn't bother writing things down. However, given that the founders are still alive, we have the ability to ask them. This doesn't consitute proper record keeping but, since we're trying to make the article sound more like an encyclopedia and less like prose, it seemed reasonable to change it to read what the stated goal had always been. I see this as a pretty minor change, but I can see how you might disagree. The point is, there's no contradiction, merely use of a different point of view (records kept on paper versus ask somebody who was there). <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimcrow_b867.html" title="User:Timcrow">Timcrow</a> 19:45, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Tim, My reference to The Aerican Empire as a 'glorious nation' was based on my own view of the aticle. I thought it sounded glorious when I first read the article in its entirity so I saved it to my watchlist.&#160;:) I have come to the conclusion that this micronation has dropped all fictional aspects (if there was ever any fictional element?) and is now an active and widely known micronation. I haven't read anything fictional in the article and so I must say that I don't know what Czj is referring to exactly. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrud3w4re_51ff.html" title="User:Crud3w4re">Crud3w4re</a> 19:38, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> This 'micronation' has no legitimate claims to any sovereignty over anything, is not recognized by any official body, has no currency, etc. It is a made-up organization with a insignificant number of members who claim a bunch of outlandish, unsubstantiated things. It is certainly not an <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empire.html" title="Empire">empire</a> under any standard definition of the term. Furthermore, <i>much of the article is unsourced.</i> It's, quite frankly, little more than a practical joke that has gone on too long to be funny. The lack of a substantial number of members comined with a few trivial sources does not establish notability. It is not a country and it will never be one. As it stands, unless better sources can be supplied and the article gets properly sourced and unless the article is written to reflect what this really is then it should be deleted. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 19:44, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Again according to Webster, "multiple territories under a single authority." Seems like it fits to me. The word "empire" is actually pretty circular, if you look it up, since an "empire" is just a body ruled by an emperor and an "emperor" is whoever rules an empire. Blame the English, not us. I will, however, see what references I can put in to specific points; thank you for suggesting that. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimcrow_b867.html" title="User:Timcrow">Timcrow</a> 19:51, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I have witnessed a very organized movement and (not to speak out of POV) but quite frankly it would have the best chance of any micronation to become a soverign state. This micronation was even discussed and wrote about in many reputable media outlets and you still dispute the article? hm While I have favored deletion of other micronational articles I do believe that this article is well founded. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrud3w4re_51ff.html" title="User:Crud3w4re">Crud3w4re</a> 19:49, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

The fact that it is not fully sourced is not criteria for deletion. Are you honestly saying that articles in The New York Times, The Montreal Mirror and The Boston Pheonix, not to mention featuring in numerous books on the subject of micronations, are trivial sources?

<dd><b>Comment</b> Several things; first of all I do admit my choice or words was poor when I called the cited sources 'poor.' There are valid, legitimate sources listed. However, if you'll look at some of my previous comments I had already admitted as much and had stated that notability has seemingly been established. You will also note that I have not been supporting a total delete, rather I've indicated that most of what is in the article needs to be deleted and rewritten (i.e. delete the article and start from scratch). The topic does seem to deserve an article, but the article as it stands needs substantial work and much should be deleted. Also, in reply to Crud, this micronation has, quite frankly (and I recognize that this particular point doesn't have any bearings on this AfD), absolutely no chance of ever becoming a recognized and sovereign state (I'd be happy to discuss why elsewhere, say on my talk page, since this has no real implications for this AfD). However, this doesn't mean there should not be an article on the subject. Also, in reply to Tim, by empire I was referring to the concept of empire in political science, not the simplified definition supplied by Webster's Dictionary. However, again this doesn't have direct implications for the AfD since the word 'Empire' is part of a proper noun rather than simply being an adjective (ie. saying "The Aerican Empire is a micronation" is fine, saying "the Aerican Empire is an Empire" is not. Finally, in response to Milburn, of course my previous comment had POV; we are arguing our interpretations of policy and such here. INPOV only fully applies to actual article writing; your comments are also POV (for example, it is your pov that this micronation has the best chance to become a sovereign state, it is also your pov that the article should be kept as is and it is my pov that it should be rewritten). All in all, please try not to be so hostile to other editors because they don't share your view in an AfD and I will do the same. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 22:55, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Response</b>: In regards to the notability of sources: 1) Being listed among a short list, when literally hundreds if not thousands of these microstates exist, is still a feat of some small note. 2) Le Soleil, The Montreal Mirror, and the Leader Newspaper Group, all of which made the Empire the main focus of their articles, are all papers with readership exceeding the million mark. None of them are widely internationally-read (although Le Soleil sells fairly well across Europe) but none of them are small. Also, just to explain why this material isn't in the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micronation.html" title="Micronation">micronation</a> article in the first place, the discussions at that article have long-since concluded that in general the article is dedicated to the phenomemnon and individual states should have separate entries, to keep the main article from growing too long.

<li>Actually, that could just be taken away. Nadar is a very well known academic--that she has a crummy Wikipedia article is a lapse that should be corrected. People write articles <i>about</i> her, as I said before, the record is not just what she wrote.

<ul>
<li>Well, none of that is apparent in the article. I never have any problems with people properly sourcing an article and editing it during an AfD to provide encyclopedic content. However, as the article stands, there is no indication that she is "important" (by whose standard?) or "a very well known academic" and, as I said, very little to distinguish this person from any other academic. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 04:37, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> My bad, it seems academics write articles about unimportant topics, and I had made the mistake of assuming that if she was important enough to be the topic of articles, in addition to writing her own, that this was some assertion of notability.<a href="http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/726/profile.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/726/profile.htm" rel="nofollow">[58]</a><a href="http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-5893.2005.00251.x" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-5893.2005.00251.x" rel="nofollow">[59]</a><a href="http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-5893.2005.00252.x" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-5893.2005.00252.x" rel="nofollow">[60]</a><a href="http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-5893.2005.00252.x?journalCode=lasr" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-5893.2005.00252.x?journalCode=lasr" rel="nofollow">[61]</a> All those books<a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_b/102-9917388-0722530?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=laura+nader" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_b/102-9917388-0722530?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=laura+nader" rel="nofollow">[62]</a>, all those seminars and articles <i>about</i> her<a href="http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/726/profile.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/726/profile.htm" rel="nofollow">[63]</a>, all those invitations to speak, to travel the world addressing people, all about her, all her writing<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=allintitle:++%22laura+nader%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;pwst=1&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=allintitle:++%22laura+nader%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;pwst=1&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[64]</a>, and the only thing that matters is she is Ralph's brother, so she can't be looked at in her own right. Interesting enough, Wikipedia doesn't have an article about their older brother John, who is also an anthropology professor. Why not? He's not notable? Or he's Ralph's brother?

<li>I don't know why you need to be so sarcastic. If you can re-write the article so that it meets the content <a href="../../../p/o/l/WP%7EPolicy_4cef.html" title="WP:Policy">policies and guidelines</a>, then please do. I have always been willing to reconsider an article if it is rewritten so as to contain encyclopedic content. That otherwise non-encyclopedic entries are rewritten so as to meet the standards set in the policies and guidelines is sometimes a wonderful outcome of an AfD nom (even though that goal should never be the reason to nominate an article for AfD). If this topic is as encyclopedic as you contend, your energy might better be spent revising the article so that it is meets the content policies rather than getting angry at me for nominating the article. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 22:50, 22 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But that's not why you nominated, you nominated it because you contend she's not notable, because she's Ralph Nader's sister, not that the article needs rewritten. And, the fact that she meets some of the criteria for notable, namely there are non-trivial articles <i>about her</i>, did not change your nomination, in fact, you simply reiterated that there is no indication she's notable--apparently her credentials don't count for notability. She is a major mid to late 20th century academic. So what if her brother is more famous than she is? If the article is crummy, tag it crummy, not deletion. And, since all I can offer are her credentials, and they don't meet your standards for notability, there's no benefit to my revising the article to simply include the credentials you already reject wholely. Nader's notable. In this case a google check would have confirmed that quite readily, and no time would have been spent discussing it, but all time could have been spent correcting the article in any way necessary. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 00:23, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Laura Nader is definitely notable on her own, without her brother, her notability does not come so much from celebrity (not a household name) but she is very important in the field of anthropology, and perhaps the foremost scholar of the Anthropology of Law (from the special edition of the American Anthropologist she edited on this topic in the 60s to her book The Life of the Law)--she has put forth theories such as the User Theory of Law, and written extensively about the role of "harmony ideology" (the ideas harmony is necessarily good and conflict/complaining/dissent are dysfunctional and bad) and its spread &amp; role as a mechanism to silence and to colonize and its relationship to arbitration and Alternative Dispute Resolution started at the Pound Conference in the 60s by the chief justice of the Supreme Court . Also, a couple examples of her frequently cited anthropological work relate to the anthropology of science (the book Naked Science) and her work about the behavior, roles and responsibilities of anthropologists (the most well-known example, and probably best-known thing she's written, "Up the Anthropologist!", which was extremely controversial in anthropology at the time it was published &amp; helped start some important changes in the way anthropologists do anthropology, telling anthropologists that they needed to not just study "down" (study the relatively powerless), but also to study "up" (study the relatively powerful, the corporations, the insurance industry, the pharmaceutical industry, the list goes on and on)). And the list of Laura Nader's very important contributions to anthropology also goes on and on, she's contributed to many areas of anthropology, from her work on energy, to children, to her important formulation of controlling processes and ideas about cultural control (her Mintz lecture published in Current Anthropology, called "Controlling Processes: Tracing the Dynamic Components of Power" among other articles) are just a few examples. Her scholarship is also marked by its being always relevant and comparatively accessible in a time when anthropologists (especially academic ones) are increasingly writing in elitist and jargon-filled terms that hides whatever real relevance their work may have to the everyday lives of real people. I have an encyclopedia of anthropology from decades ago that already had an entry about her. I know a good amount about her work but nothing about Wikipedia content policies or anything like that otherwise I'd try and help fix it up a little. I know it's not well written and doesn't describe Laura Nader's work very well but I thought the idea of Wikipedia had to do with overtime people contribute things they know and it's all a work in progress though some things progress slower than others. (By the way, I thought her older brother's name was Shafeek, and I think he studied anthropology but I didn't know he was a prof, though I know he died some time ago, I think I read somewhere that he gave up on trying to go to law school to work and help pay for Ralph to go.)<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 169.237.76.117 (<a href="../../../1/6/9/User_talk%7E169.237.76.117.html" title="User talk:169.237.76.117">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_169.237.76.117_d392.html" title="Special:Contributions/169.237.76.117">contribs</a>) 04:38, 25 January 2007.</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The article is much improved. Despite what might be insinuated by others above:</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>My objection was not based on who her relatives are, but as the article stood previously the only distinguishing factor was the familial relationship (which doesn't necessarily mean a lot outside the US). Absent that, there was <i>nothing</i> in the article to show how she was different than any other prof at any other school any other place. Most profs will publish, and one would expect that most profs works will be cited in other academic texts or journals, so the lack of any other factors seemed telling at the time.</li>
<li>The decision or final approval isn't mine - that's why I brought it to AfD, so everyone could have some input. As with most any AfD discussion, I'm willing to abide by with whatever consensus achieves. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 07:16, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Is notable author of cultural essays and opinion pieces promoting new policies and ideas concerning medical politics.</p>
<p>Breaks important cultural news on his website www.glassshallot.com. Was the first print journalist to chronicle David Lynch's meditation cult presentation and Abraham Cherrix's fight with the Virginia government over the right to use alternative medicine over chemotherapy.</p>
<p>I've been following Mr. Baer's work for years and he is one of a group of young cutting edge writers who is not afraid to shed some light on issues that provoke thought, such as patient advocacy, cultural criticisms, and insightful (and entertaining)essays. A prolific writer already, I look forward to Mr. Baer’s future pieces with enthusiasm. 128.125.12.140 18:49, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>This is a tough one to deal with under WP:BIO. I see that he's written in a lot of different publications, and on a number of different topics. But, I'm having problems with the guidelines, as it appears he's a freelancer, and thus sells to those publications (or perhaps is invited to write for them, depending on the process). Problem is, WP:BIO requests multiple, non-trivial sources that are ABOUT the person involved, which seem to be missing; it also asks for independent coverage of a published author's works, also not available that I could find. Journalists are tough to place, unfortunately, and freelancers even more. At what point does a freelance journalist become well-known? Having said that, the article needs work and actual links to references. <b>Neutral</b>, as the guidelines don't help and he's published enough for me to not be able to flat-out say delete.

Do you consider writing a best-selling book about 9/11 important? No one is claiming importance--we are showing you that the policy needs to be adjusted for cases like these. Tony Fox stated Neutral above and closed the admin, stating that the guidelines don't help in the case of an influential staff journalist and notable independent writer. He's right. The article should be edited as any other and left to stand. That's why the note was removed from the top of the edit page, only because the argument is now closed.

<p>Kesh, Do you alone have the power to save or delete this article? It seems like other people have a lot to say on this matter. One published work in the NY Times may not be notable, but when a writer is regularly engaged to write for many publications of this caliber, year after year, it is because he is a notable writer. Here, if you'd like to see it, is one notable NYT article by this author. It's the NY Times's first ever large article about the proliferation of Wi-Fi internet access. Check their database to verify this. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/open/thisweek/12wifi-OPEN.html" class="external free" title="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/open/thisweek/12wifi-OPEN.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/ref/open/thisweek/12wifi-OPEN.html</a> There is also a strong literary and critical component to this author's work, as evidenced by the books mentioned and the work for the New Republic, Atlantic, and other literary publications with strong histories of publishing the country's most important voices. I'd love to convince you, but you're just one user, as am I, and hopefully this will come to a consensus one way or the other. I just took a previous user's comment as inspiration and googled the subject and found that USA today sent their reader's to Slate's 2002 "In Defense of the Viola," written by Adam Baer. Here's the link: <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/columnist/hipclicks/2002/2002-01-11-hipclicks.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.usatoday.com/life/columnist/hipclicks/2002/2002-01-11-hipclicks.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.usatoday.com/life/columnist/hipclicks/2002/2002-01-11-hipclicks.htm</a> His thoughts on Apple Computer's iPhone marketing strategy was also recently quoted on the popular Web site Kottke.org here: <a href="http://www.kottke.org/07/01/iphone-roundup" class="external free" title="http://www.kottke.org/07/01/iphone-roundup" rel="nofollow">http://www.kottke.org/07/01/iphone-roundup</a> (scroll to the bottom). What, to you, would render this writer notable? Could he write for more publications? Be more influential in the field of patient advocacy, technology, or culture? These aren't sarcastic questions, but people outside the realm of publishing and academia should not on their own be able to verify whether or not a writer is notable--that is, if they aren't familiar with this field. The career speaks for itself. The recent cancer op-ed for the LA Times alone generated enough buzz around the media to turn Abraham Cherrix into a national story this past summer. This is a writer with an important hold on a number of subjects. I would urge you to consider Tony Fox's thoughtful comments above as well as those of the people who commented on the talk page. Here, too, are writings from the LA Times on this author:</p>

<p>HEADLINE: Chemotherapy and the failure of war on cancer</p>
<p>BODY:</p>
<p><br />
Re "A fight to say no to chemo," Opinion, July 29</p>
<p>Adam Baer's commentary heart-wrenchingly captures the dilemma faced by so many folks with life-threatening diseases who are treated by very imperfect and harsh regimens. Many of these harsh treatments cure people and are backed up by peer-reviewed studies in recognized medical journals. Even so-called alternative treatments are receiving scrutiny through a special institute created for this purpose at the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>Still, prisons in the United States house quacks who have hoodwinked people in their most desperate hours by promising cures using feel-good approaches. Unfortunately, the U.S. arm of the law cannot reach to other nations to cull out quacks who endanger the lives of our citizenry.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for publishing this valuable message. Every other day it seems we are bombarded with cancer walks, marathons and postage stamps, yet there is very little coverage of the failure of the war on cancer during the 35 years since it was declared.</p>
<p>This failure comes as no surprise to someone like me, who has watched a family member be blasted with radiation and chemotherapy, then die a few years later from another cancer caused by the treatment.</p>
<p>I can only advise others to question the medical hierarchy and not be afraid to just say no to these torturous, toxic treatments.</p>

<dd>First, the information shouldn't be pasted here. That's a lot of text that has little to do with the AfD <i>discussion</i>. Just keep your quotes on the page itself, and we can read them there.</dd>
<dd>Second, regarding your statement: <i>Kesh, Do you alone have the power to save or delete this article? It seems like other people have a lot to say on this matter.</i> So far, we have a comment from an IP user which does not address policies at all; my Delete reasoning; a Neutral comment from TonyFox; your comments regarding "importance" but not policies; and Mikebeef's comments that sources exist, but not where to find them.</dd>
<dd>AfD is a discussion about whether an article meets policy. Right now, myself and TonyFox are the only ones who have addressed this. It would be helpful if some other editors would weigh in on policy here but, without that, so far my Delete per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> seems to be the outstanding policy issue.</dd>
<dd>Finally, a letter to the editor does zero to establish notability. Anyone can write them, and the only filter is whether or not the editor wants to publish them in the paper. While I'm glad some folks found his articles useful, that does not in itself establish notability per <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Wikipedia's guidelines</a>. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 22:44, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>MikeBeef did say where to find them; I don't think most Wiki users have access to Lexis Nexis but that's one way to search those publications. Thanks for your thoughts, but Wikipedia's policy on this type of article obviously needs to be mindfully interpreted by someone with the literary and/or journalistic authority to make these decisions. Perhaps this is the reason for Larry Sanger's new Citizendium. An expert-led discussion would have quickly put this matter to bed. Lastly, letters to the editor do mean something when they're written by experts, such as, say, the director of cell biology at a major university.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Jrosen68 (<a href="../../../j/r/o/User_talk%7EJrosen68_dc39.html" title="User talk:Jrosen68">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jrosen68_7194.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jrosen68">contribs</a>) 22:52, January 23, 2007 (UTC)</small></p>

<p>No. No one is trying to game the system. No one has to. This subject would not be such a notable writer with so many avenues of influence if he didn't have all this quantifiable success in his field. Many notable publications and articles of note as well as verifiable sources have been cited. If they don't fit into your rubric, you can fix them. In the end, you're simply saying that you don't find this author important, and that's your opinion, as you noted above. The facts speak for themselves. Jrosen68 17:59, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>It seems to me that Mr. Baer has written a goodly number of articles for various magazines, papers, and journals. What would it take for someone like this to "achieve notability"? Do you want someone to insert links to every article he's ever written in order to prove notability? One simply has to visit his website (www.glassshallot.com) to link to the articles he's written.

<p>Kesh, I'm pretty sure that if you published something in any of those publications, it'd be notable. Publishing an article in a newspaper/magazine of note is not an easy task. The fact that Mr. Baer has been published in them multiple times lends credence to his notability. This is not just one-off letters to the editor. Mr. Baer is an accomplished journalist and writer.

<p>I just stumbled upon this debate while and I wanted to contribute as the answer is clear to me.I believe that writers for highly regarded publications, who themselves become highly regarded from their journalistic work and published books should be considered notable. Since the wikipedia policy doesn't really address the definition of notable, why should we not give credit to the true work horses of information dissemination? Adam Baer had been appeared in virtually every publication I pick up, such as USA Today, LA times, NY Times, Arts &amp; Letters Daily just to name a few. I believe his work is notable and important. Kesh appears to have one definition of notable while wikipedia has another--who's the real boss here? Is Kesh notable? Why does Kesh get to determine what entries get deleted and what remains? As a psychologist and researcher, it is simply bad science to reject information based on this one source. Leave the entry, Mr. Baer is notable. Case closed.

<dd>Frankly, we're still lacking outside references to the author himself outside of his publishing credits. Journalists, especially freelancers, as I said before are tough to sort out. Kesh is an editor, same as everyone else, and the community has the ability to contribute in these debates. It's really going to be up to the closing administrator to decide what happens on this one.

<p>As noted, the references exist and are findable in well-known databases that cannot be linked to (i.e. it costs money to join something like Nexis). Also, it's important to note that the subject is a *staff* correspondent for a major magazine (Travel + Leisure, owned by American Express Publishing) as well as a well-known essayist with top-selling book credits, and freelance journalist for other notable publications.Jrosen68 20:13, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Regardless of whether or not they can be linked to, they can be <i>cited</i>. That needs to be done. Further, you cannot use articles written by Adam Baer himself to establish notability. Wikipedia does not rely on primary sources: see <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>.

<p>Reviews of prominent reviewers. Ok, that happens all the time. Sounds as if you need to acquaint yourself with how people like this become prominent, and what their work means to the world. As for articles and refences, they have been pointed out. You can take the time to cite them in your specific way if you'd like to improve this article. Wikipedia should rely on primary sources when it comes to people who work in this and other similar profession. Read the comments above from notable researchers and others. These are people who work in academia. They know what true notability means, and how to achieve it. If you're so confident that the policies you cite are powerful and bizarre enough to keep this subject from being written about here, you would stop contributing to this dialogue. If you were an expert in writing, journalism, or publishing, and you felt that the subject wasn't important, that would be another story. You are not, and that's why can state arcane and unimportant rules all you want, but in the end logic and expertise will win. If not here then somewhere that matters more.

<li><b>Improvement</b> This article was <i>absolutely not</i> created for advertising purposes. The company has lacked a presence on WP, and while I agree the article is new and under-developed and its content needs greater verification, I don't believe it is a candidate for deletion.

<li><b>Comment</b> What is the criteria for inclusion for articles about schools&#160;? This school does exist but I doubt it is "notable" or if has any famous alumni. The notability requirement for the inclusion of places is very low (afaik, proof of existence is all that is needed in most cases). If the conditions are similar for schools, it shouldn't be difficult to find mentions in local newspapers (there is a link to the official site already), but if there are any decent notability requirements, it is probably deleteworthy. <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETintin1107_b710.html" title="User:Tintin1107">Tintin</a> (<a href="../../../t/i/n/User_talk%7ETintin1107_ddb3.html" title="User talk:Tintin1107">talk</a>) 07:41, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>. The notability requirement for the inclusion of places <i>is not</i> "proof of existence".

<li>I abstain. I thought of commenting on it from my first hand knowledge. But there are more than one school by this name in this area and from the year of founding mentioned at their site, it is quite new and I must have been thinking about some other one.

<p>&gt;&gt; I'm new - I don't know how to do this, but please keep this article. I was doing research on Antipopes and found Maurice mentioned by: Why We Oppose Papal Claimants © 1999 by Robert F. Hess, Editor, the Saint Francis Newsletter:</p>
<p>Fifth in line is the Frenchman, Maurice Archieri, who goes by "Peter II." He is either in Paris, or one of its suburbs. His assistant priest originally wouldn't discuss with me who ordained and consecrated his pope. Archieri, according to his web page, was mysticly given the Papacy in 1995 "by operation of the Holy Spirit." (His web site now includes a section on the episcopal lineage of Archieri. It goes back into what appears to be Old Catholic lines.)</p>
<p>I wanted to learn more, so I looked Maurice up in Wikipedia. His own site is in French, so that is of limited help. That is the only reference I have at hand.</p>
<p>Are there "hundreds" of other people claiming to be pope? I don't know of very many. And if there are "hundreds", so what? IF they all wanted to be listed in Wikipedia, is Wikipedia unable to handle it? I guess I don't see the harm in listing it.</p>
<p>But, again, I'm new here and I really didn't open an account to get into these kinds of debates.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Only one passing mention in one article on one web site? Antichrist on a cracker! I found goatloads of references to him through a Google search.

Let the anti-pope (or True Pope) remain on Wikipedia, that the heretics (or True Catholics) may expand his article for the greater glory of God (or Satan!) <a href="../../../w/h/y/User%7EWhyaduck_99ff.html" title="User:Whyaduck">Whyaduck</a> 06:08, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>The "one passing mention" I referred to is the only reference given in the article. If you have other multiple, independent sources for which von Pentz is the main subject, by all means add them to the article. I did do a cursory Google search before this nomination; the results seem to be mostly Wikipedia mirrors or passing mentions in antipope articles. —<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 12:10, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>My recurring nightmare is logging on to the Internet and finding that every site is either a mirror of Wikipedia, a weblog commenting on Wikipedia, or a news site announcing that Earth has surrendered to the Wikipedians, a reptilian race from a distant planet. I'd say about half of Papa Linus' Google hits are mirrors of some sort, and most of the rest are indeed competing anti-pope (or anti-anti-pope) sites (Pope Michael is particularly hostile to Pope Linus.) Anyway, I'm not going to expand the article myself, I just think the contentious Catholics of various stripes ought to have time to do it themselves (though they've had over a year so far and have done nothing with it that I can see- but I've gotten more patient as I've gotten way older.) It's also a bit distressing to me that seven WP pages linking to the V von P article will now have more annoying red wikilinks on them. Some of those pages already have quite a few red name-wikilinks, which suggests to me that contentious Catholics lurking about the site are intending to create still more articles about still more anti-popes. You may have to set yourself to a long crusade to keep them from proliferating.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I created this, in part, because I was curious if anyone claimed to be "Pope Linus II." However I'm not sure he has a significant enough following to be notable.

<li><b>Comment</b> For starters, the CNN article <i>War games see sales spike</i>, the Tech TV X-Play review of 1942 mods. I would point out though, it need only have wide recognition within the Gaming community to avoid NN- something it has is spades as well. Various mods regularly appearing in industry magazines such as <i>PC Gamer</i> in addition IGN and other online web sources results in more notability and recognition then many commerical titles. <a href="../../../b/f/e/User%7EBfelite_e603.html" title="User:Bfelite">Bfelite</a> 16:03, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>And the reason this hasn't been put into the article at any point in the last 8 months is?

<dd>My point, however, is that it has <i>not</i> improved, even with all these AfDs. Unless all of the mods can be sourced for notability, and are going to be, they should be deleted. So far, despite the large amounts of time since the last AfD, little has been done to improve. Saying 'we'll fix it' doesn't fit in this case. <font color="#FF9900"><a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Fuchs_e635.html" title="User:David Fuchs"><b>Dåvid ƒuchs</b></a></font> (<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_Fuchs_fab2.html" title="User talk:David Fuchs">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_David_Fuchs_d754.html" title="Special:Contributions/David Fuchs">contribs</a>) 23:22, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No, but it HAS been a significant amount since the AfD before that. No work was done, despite the copy and paste 'Keep and clean-up' votes. Guess what? No cleaning up happened from June (the time of the AfD) to December, the time of the last AfD. Then lo and behold, at the last AfD, the same people who said 'keep and clean up' then disappeared never to be seen turned up! Can you guess what they said? Correct! They said 'keep and clean up!'. Can you guess what happened after the AfD dissolved into a trainwreck of non-consensus? Why, absolutely NO clean-up work was done once again. And this in spite of numerous people claiming there are multiple sources of notability. So here we are, 3 non-consensus AfDs later, into our 4th one, and the article is STILL exactly the same as it was the time of the 1st AfD. Any questions? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 15:15, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Its not exactly the same, there are more references establishing notability, such as <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2003/03/25/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://money.cnn.com/2003/03/25/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[65]</a> for instance. <a href="../../../b/f/e/User%7EBfelite_e603.html" title="User:Bfelite">Bfelite</a> 15:41, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fine, lets nit-pick over a word. Geez. The point was that at no point in the last 8-9 months was enough work done on the article to address the issues raised at an AfD, and as a result is nominated again relatively quickly. The fact that the article was nominated 4 times in less than a year should be considered a teeny-tiny hint that the article must have some major failings that aren't being addressed. But if you would rather argue over my using a word in slightly the wrong situation instead of trying to address major failings in the article, that's fine by me. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 16:40, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I do think it's important to rebut some of your exaggerated comments on this AFD. It is unfair to claim the lack of editing on the article to support your position that it will never be fixed, when in fact editing has been done. I don't think the insertion of at least three first-rate sources (CNN, Washington Times, PC Gamer) is insignificant, so your exaggeration is more than slight. For the second point, you're right: Four nominations (note: only by three distinct editors) suggest that some wikipedians have a problem with the article (and I do believe it needs more work still). But on the other side of the coin, the keep arguments by editors in good standing along with the work done on the article since its first nominations should suggest that other wikipedians do not believe those problems are insurmountable. That should be taken into account as well. <span style="font-size: 10px">— <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 18:11, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Anyway... I came across something which was so <i>funny</i>, the nominator makes references to not finding lists of mods for even big famous games such as Counter-Strike!! gee, I wonder why that is?! Could it be because Counter-Strike is itself a mod! (though of course it has some mods itself, just obviously the scope and number of mods that would exist for a mod is vastly limited compared to otherwise) It always disturbs me a little whenever somebody tries to nominate for deletion something that would be controversial (as this obviously is as it has survived several times before) while at the same time showing a complete lack of knowledge of the subject area. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 13:26, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: It <i>is</i> possible to "mod" a mod. While Counter-Strike isn't a particularly good example, <i>Desert Combat</i> for BF1942 has been expanded further by certain communities to form mods like <i>Desert Combat Extended</i>. You said it yourself: even <i>Counter-Strike</i> has mods. I don't see why you're slamming someone for having a "complete lack of knowledge" when you admitted that it's feasible at the same time. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd">Scottie theNerd</a> 14:37, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Sorry sorry, I did go ever so slightly over the top in my comment. But my point remains, that it shouldn't be surprising that CS has no page of it's mods because even though it is an extremely famous game most "mods" of it really would be mods of Half Life.

<li><s><b>Strong Delete</b></s> (See below) - Once again we reach this point due to ne'er-do-wells swanning in, saying 'keep and clean' and disappearing with no intention of doing any clean-up work themseleves, and only returning to the article when it's nominated for deletion again to make there cut-and-paste point again. (In fact I see several familiar names who have voted keep and clean on numerous articles and then ****ed off without doing the work, only to appear later and vote to keep an article that has no work done on it.) This article has been in this state for NEARLY A ****ING YEAR! How much time does this article need for all the vast wealth of sources the keep voters claim exists to be included in it? Face it, no-one gives a damn about improving this article because it is what it is: A directory of links designed to advertise, and as such is completely unencyslopedic and uncleanable. In 6 months time, this unedited article will just get nominated yet again, and the whole wretched process begins again. Does this article serve Wikipedias interests? No. Does it serve the interests of the various people who have put links to their project here? Absolutely. Stuff arguing about it's relevance in comparison to other pages or other mods. That's not the point.

<li>Links aren't sources. What we have in the article are links to homepages and links to lists of mods on other sites, but absolutely nothing establishing the notability of any of the mods. And I see no reference to CNN anywhere in the article. Once again these 'numerous' sources that establish notability appear to be as substantial as the early morning mist, and just as hard to get a hold of. Mod databases and homepages don't count as multiple non-trivial media mentions.

Otherwise whats to stop me listing some mod I just thought of right now and claiming it was mentioned in a PC Gamer article 10 months ago that I can't get my hands on now.

<li>You can't really claim that since a source is not immediately accessible to you (<i>i.e.</i> online) that it is not a valid source—<a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> of the other editors!

<ul>
<li>I'm just pointing out the problem with saying 'It was mentioned in this place' when you can't provide a copy of it to back your claim up. AGF fails here because this article was set up to neither help nor hurt wikip[edia specifically, but rather to attract people to a mods individual webpage. This article provides no ionformation on the mods, it hasn't since it's creation. All it say is if the mod is alive or not and a link to the home page, which brings us right back to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a directory of links or an advertising facility. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 16:28, 22 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Consider this. If a user comes to Wikipedia for information, and then finds the article they are looking for in fact contains absolutely no useful information and just provides a link to an off-wiki site, somethings wrong. If users have to leave wikipedia in order to find <i>any</i> useful information about something beyond whether or not work is ongoing on it, then what is the point of wikipedia? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 16:43, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Brighterorange, all those references refer to the same mod. As much, two references one, while the other references a second.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Highly relevant. Also I think it's rather offensive that you list an AFD then try to discourage discussion. Keep/Cleanup per is a valid input. Sounds like someone has a little bit of a <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> problem. Plus I am not happy with the assertation "all the others basically just have 'was ranked....'".....basically you've just shown that you don't care what kind of evidence is shown for notability.

<dd>Okay, as thats a slight affront to me, I feel I should respond... <i>I think it's rather offensive that you list an AFD then try to discourage discussion</i> - AfD's <b>are not votes</b>, as Wikipedia clearly states. If you'll look above, you'll find lots of <i>keep</i>s- but no reason for the keep. The point is not to say I want it to be kept per XX, but to contribute to an ongoing discussion. Secondly, to the <i>Maybe that means it deserves to stay, especially when so many people think it's a relevant topic?</i> That's certainly one way of looking at AfDs. But seeing as its been no consensus all of them, that basically means that there's a loud enough kicking and screaming faction that it can't be deleted in full conscience. I'm not saying that's necessarily a bad thing, but just because it survives doesn't really make its merit. Finally, to the most important part: <i>Plus I am not happy with the assertation "all the others basically just have 'was ranked....'".....basically you've just shown that you don't care what kind of evidence is shown for notability.</i> WP:NOT calls for <b>multiple, independent sources</b>- in other words, ModDB, a massive modding site, is only one. Just because its on one site doesn't make it notable (for a sort of comparison, just because a book's for sale on Amazon and has been rated does not make it notable under wikipedia guidelines). I'm glad you disclosed your vested interest; as I stated above I believe that in its thinner form it could easily be merged into the BF1942 article, but people keep on adding back in the cruft, which suggests that once again, if the AfD is no con, it will just become bloated again. A merge is more effective. Qestions/concerns, PM me. no need to clutter up the AfD unless it is directly related. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Fuchs_e635.html" title="User:David Fuchs"><b>Dåvid Fuchs</b></a> [<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_Fuchs_fab2.html" title="User talk:David Fuchs">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_David_Fuchs_d754.html" title="Special:Contributions/David Fuchs">contribs</a>] 03:08, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Per Havok, If you just agree with what someone else already said, it is perfectly reasonable and accepted practice to just say you suppor their previously stated positon. There is no need to write out a new pithy comment each time if someone has already captured well your belief on the matter. Please don't dismiss the views of other editors just because they happen to state they agree with a previous contributor. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 06:18, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, I want to shout. "Keep and cleanup" is not a valid opinion if the article stays the way it is. If you check the article history, back in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Battlefield_1942_mods&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=2621320" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Battlefield_1942_mods&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=2621320" rel="nofollow">March 4, 2004</a> (yes, just shy of <b>3 years ago</b>) the article got a table for the mods. Do you see? The table was first created 3 years ago and since then more fields were added to the table, the table became a little more beautiful, but the article stayed in the same way, without reliable references. "Keep and clean" is not an option because nobody cared about this article. Those who voted "Keep" never cared about checking the previous versions of the article, nor helped with the clean up. They either are gamers who would object deletion of even "List of RGB colors used in Master Chief's helmet", have only edits in articles related to video games, or they were interested in the topic because they play Battlefield and want to have a quick list of mods so that they can download them. Truly speaking, if not for my complete blank of the article and <a href="../../../b/f/e/User%7EBfelite_e603.html" title="User:Bfelite">User:Bfelite</a>'s effort to find references when adding new mods, the article would have spent 3 more years in the same state. So, next time anyone says "Keep and cleanup", please stop shouting blasphemies to your Halo mates, or congratulating yourself in how many enemies you killed on the night, sit down and edit the dang article to shape. We don't need keep votes, we need people cleaning the article. Thank you.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't see what you mean about "<i>..rapidly going back to how it was.</i>", the article is better now then its ever been. That an article will revert or not is not the subject of this AfD, the subject right now is verifiability, and right now it has sources for its entries.

<li><b>Keep</b> I remember him getting a bit of national press coverage when he won. There are a number of legitimate articles that can be found on Google and his youth does, in my opinion, go a long way towards establishing notability. He started running for office when he was 17 and became mayor at 18, that is really quite rare. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 01:13, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It seems to me that Christopher Seeley meets the notability for local politicians. If he doesn't meet notability than I doubt that any local politician could meet notability and I disagree with that. While an article cannot be created for every local politician it makes sense that those who are notable enough should be included. I also noticed that <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Sessions_f2a9.html" title="Michael Sessions">Michael Sessions</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Juhl_f56e.html" title="Sam Juhl">Sam Juhl</a> also have articles and neither have been nominated for deletion. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardlalone_3c3b.html" title="User:Edwardlalone">Edward Lalone</a> | (<a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwardlalone_ffa4.html" title="User talk:Edwardlalone">Talk</a>) 03:02, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Sessions is the mayor of a town of 8000, and is a high school student. Juhl is a high school student and is claimed to be <b>the</b> youngest mayor on record.

<dd><b>Comment</b> He still remains one of the youngest mayors in the US right now. He's young enough that he garnered quite a bit of attention for it. Notability can be established by the multiple, non-trivial sources about him. It's very rare for someone who is 18 to run for and win an actual public office. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 06:36, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Sessions appears to have parlayed his election - as mayor of a larger town - into national and even international media interest <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4429192.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4429192.stm" rel="nofollow">[69]</a>. Seeley hasn't, from a google search, which appears to show largely local newspaper articles. Compare google hits for "Christopher Seeley" + mayor to those for "Michael Sessions" + mayor. I make it around 170 for Seeley, around 10,000 for Sessions. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 18:29, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Revols, have been noted in "People Magazine", written about in at least 3 internationally published novels, and were considered by some, to be the beginning foundation of Canada's contribution to rock'n'roll, with 3 members playing on world wide acclaimed records.</p>
<p>There is infact recordings, The Revols recorded the "First known recording" of Richard Manuel (Bob Dylan. The Band) in 1958, the first song Richard ever wrote.</p>
<p>The recording has currently been handed over to Peter Moore, a famous Canadian engineer / producer (Bruce Coburn, The Cowboy Junkies) and that song "Eternal Love" recorded in 1958, by the Revols will become part of a box set, for Capitol Records, with a working title "Levon and The Hawks" "The Early Years" chronicling some of the first rockn' roll in Canada, as well all of the original, 1st recordings of Richard Manuel songs.</p>
<p>It'll take me some time to dig some of this stuff up, but The Revols, were a pretty important, quite documented band, for the 50's in Canada.</p>
<p>This article "as is" I completely understand why it'd be marked for deletion.... it's just very vague, and poorly written.</p>
<p>If I can have some time, and am able to edit this article, I can supply some valid content, linking these 3 famous musicians together. thanks <a href="../../../q/w/e/User%7EQwepasdl_0956.html" title="User:Qwepasdl">Qwepasdl</a> 04:00, 21 January 2007 (UTC)<br /></p>

<p>non notable monk, material unverifiable; I can't find any references to this person outside of the work of Richard Shaw Brown, who also seems to be the main author of this article.

<li><b>Keep</b>---Dear Editors, I am surprised there is no other reference to Krishnadas Babaji. Among the 1000 disciples of Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Takura he was the favorite, maybe because he never took disciples, even though he was highly realized. He was an "avadhuta" sadhu, or one who posseses nothing. In <a href="../../../v/a/i/Vaishnava.html" title="Vaishnava">Vaishnava</a> philosophy such humility its treated with the highest respect known to man, in most all religions. The irony is that he is the MOST qualified to be included among notable persons, yet is desires it the least, He couldn't speak English so I was the rare Westerner who got to know him and see his life. But if he doesn't fit then please delete him as your policy. OTHERWISE: May I reduce his page to a short blurb? Thanks, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Shaw_Brown_310c.html" title="Richard Shaw Brown">Richard Shaw Brown</a></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Though the article itself states several times "He is notable because...," none of the reasons given actually establish notability. Furthermore, there are no sources so verifiability has not been met either.

<li><b>Keep for now</b> The article was tagged for notability less than two weeks ago, which may not have been enough time for its author to come up with reliable sources.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Technically, the author of an article is supposed to include all citations when the article is created. We are not required in any way to keep unsourced information and it's perfectly legitimate to delete information that isn't sourced without warning. An AfD lasts five days; there is still time left to add sources before the AfD is closed, sources that should have been included when the original information is added. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 06:39, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>That is great! I don't know about laws in other countries, but If the VNN is a serialized newspaper that is printed at least four times a year, it qualifies as a bonafied periodical under US law and will definitely satisfy <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> for being non-trivial.

<li>The article in VNN appears to be about a different person with a similar name. The Krishnadas Babaji of the Wikipedia article died in 1980; the obit in VNN is about someone who died in 2003. I can't read the material in the pdf, so I have no idea whether it relates to the person that Richard S. Brown is writing about. Is "Krishnadas Babaji" even a "real" name? Or is it more of a name that someone might take on becoming a monk, like a Christian monk named "Brother Bartholomew"? There may be many monks with this name. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 23:33, 24 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Clarification: the article listed as "VNN World" does not seem to be about 'our' Babaji. Of the three links added by RSB, 2 don't presently work, <s>and the third actually does seem to be about 'our' Babaji, although the names don't match completely. I think we are making a little progress. I am still a little concerned about how notable this person is, but at least we have some independent evidence that he existed.</s> --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 00:21, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Further comment: It is unclear how much value to put on articles on VNN; articles are not written by reporters but instead <a href="http://www.vnn.org/participate/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.vnn.org/participate/index.html" rel="nofollow">solicited from viewers</a>, although they are supposed to meet <a href="http://www.vnn.org/about/publication.html" class="external text" title="http://www.vnn.org/about/publication.html" rel="nofollow">certain standards</a>. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 01:45, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>The free participation model of VNN does raise questions of reliability as a source, but it does not discredit it totally.

<li>Oh. So, we are presently left with afaik <i>no</i> functional outside references to the subject of this afd. I am also coming to believe, having looked at these various articles and some of the VNN site, that the identifying names and titles in the article are so common that it is very easy to get confused between different Babajis, Krishnadases, Maharajes, and Srilas. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 06:25, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The article in Italian seems very clearly to be about a different person - compare the photos, and also look at the fact that that person seems to have been still alive in the 1990s, while "our" Babaji died around 1980. And the list of "saints" is just a list, and I can't tell which name you believe matches - there are many similar names. As I have said above, that is one of the major problems here - it seems there are many monks with very similar names. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 02:06, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have added a section in the article listing some other information such as Google hits and where it's linked. As for the comment Danlina made, I understand that not every HP website needs an article. I never said they did. Yes, I admit I put my article on here to increase my traffic, but if I want to promote my website, and if I do it in a neutral, non-commercial way, I don't see why I can't. Also I'm fairly new to Wikipedia and haven't achieved top article-writing skills. --<a href="../../../a/u/s/User%7EAustinsimcox_106d.html" title="User:Austinsimcox">Austinsimcox</a> 19:38, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Austin, we were all new once, don't worry! We know you didn't say every fan site needs an article; however, 26 Google hits is very few, and your web site fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> notability policies. Wikipedia is not meant to advertise your site, even if it is done neutrally -- the site, or whatever the subject of the article, should already be notable enough that it's not seeking visitors. Don't be disheartened -- it's difficult to maintain a fan site, so keep it up. But we can't accept an entry on your site until it is acknowledged greatly by the press, or by J. K. Rowling, or for something else <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>. Hope you understand, and that you'll still decide to stick around at Wikipedia. If you want, you can have a user <a href="../../../a/d/o/WP%7EADOPT_c4e7.html" title="WP:ADOPT">WP:ADOPT</a> you to get slightly more acquainted with policies and article writing.

<p>Ok, I understand now. Thanks for your support. I now understand what "notable" means and I'll allow the article to be taken down. I'll check out <a href="../../../a/d/o/WP%7EADOPT_c4e7.html" title="WP:ADOPT">WP:ADOPT</a> too. I thought I could use Wikipedia as advertising space but I see now how that would be unfair.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. In the UK, one needs to pay a deposit of 500 pounds to be a candidate in a general election. However, if the candidate receives at least 5% of the vote in the consituency, the deposit is refunded. So "losing your deposit" means that you got less than 5% of the vote and you didn't get your 500 pounds back. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 23:27, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree with your assertion that losing candidates do fail notability requirements as there are literally millions of candidates who have lost elections and it just doesn't make any sense to have article about all of them.

<p>It's not quite as simple as that. Up the page there is a discussion going on to delete a candidate who WON an election (see: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Christopher_Seeley_86ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Christopher Seeley">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Christopher Seeley</a>). Surely what needs to influence the discussion is whether the person himself is notable; there are countless examples of notable people losing elections (<a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Foot_ac53.html" title="Paul Foot">Paul Foot</a> for example) but their other achievements qualify them. That may be the case with Brian Nugent, and it could be that having been a candidate for the SNP (no further details given in the article), left them and set up a rival party is itself sufficient to confer notability. I don't know enough about Scottish politics to come to a decision so I <b>abstain</b> at this point. (Edwardlalone - you are too modest I'm sure!) <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 12:51, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not only did he lose, and lose his deposit, he managed to do so without making the news.

<li><b>Keep</b> Regarding Wildnox's statement: <i>Chris Sullo would meet the notability requirement if Nikto were notable</i> - it is established that Nikto is notable as is evidenced by the <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikto_Web_Scanner_9996.html" title="Nikto Web Scanner">Nikto Web Scanner</a> article and the fact that Nikto is the top used web scanner tool in the security industry. (These comments were previously listed and never refuted.) This syllogism therefore supports that Chris Sullo is indeed notable.

<li><b>Comment</b> The <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikto_Web_Scanner_9996.html" title="Nikto Web Scanner">Nikto Web Scanner</a> article consists of two paragraphs, both of which are cut-and-pasted (and for that reason, probably copyvio) from their respective sources. Its only references are the homepage of the tool itself, and the page of the Mac port; there are no independent comments or other substantiations of notability, although the tool's user base is so large that the article passes <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>. Sullo's article DOES have a reference for this tool's popularity, so merging a short bio about its author with that page should improve it even more. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlakeloaf_bedc.html" title="User:Flakeloaf">Flakeloaf</a> 19:14, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> Fails <b><a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a></b>. The subject has not "been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent from the musician/ensemble itself and reliable." The mention in <i>Stuff</i> magazine is only a couple of dozen words, buried in the middle pages.<br />
Subject cannot be found on Amazon.com, which is a pretty good indication that he fails criteria about sales. All of the many Ghits are trivial sites: social networking (mySpace, and similar) and directories (including user-posted sites like lyric sites and Last FM).<br />
There are no reviews by non-trivial independent publications.<br />
Have you noticed the 'update' posted to the blog entry, the URL of which was proved by the editor: <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2003/06/12/russian_rapper_ill_m.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.boingboing.net/2003/06/12/russian_rapper_ill_m.html" rel="nofollow">[72]</a> Specifically: "should be obvious that this is a hoax. But if it's not, well, now it is." The mention in <i>Stuff</i> also hints at this.<br />
The creator of this version of the article seems to have a <b><a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a></b>, indicated by 1) desperation to keep this on Wikipedia, 2) this article is the full concern of his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=250&amp;target=Jellonuts" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=250&amp;target=Jellonuts" rel="nofollow">contributions</a> here since 15 November 2006 (after a 10 month absence), and 3) communication with the subject is proven through his very abrupt assertions that he has permission to post the images.<br />
All of the concerns expressed in the first AFD are still very valid. At the end of the day, this is about a non-notable rapper (per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>) using Wikipedia for self promotion. There is very little on even his own website to indicate notability. All we have to go on is an incredibly brief mention in a lads mag.

<li><b>Keep</b> This article is a re-write of on the subject of the article that was deleted 6 months ago. The authors are different and the articles are not similar. I was not the original author, but I did most of the updating. I saw the block was lifted in review, so I went ahead and uploaded the latest version in case someone else wants to work with it and for review. I'll repost the notability sources here on the AfD and then I am done with it because I am sick of arguing over this silly article. As for COI issues, I worked hard and "wasted" a lot of time updating this page, so yes I was fightig to keep it and maybe I have been a little obsessive. This was indeed my first major contribution, though I have made some other minor edits to other articles under my ip address because I forget to sign in sometimes. I do make small edits when I see mistakes on other articles, and after this contribution I did plan to continue to contribute to other articles. Like I said, I am discouraged and done because I am sick of my integrity being questioned. Yes, I am an Ill Mitch fan, no I am not Ill Mitch. Do what you will, here is the info I had:</li>

<p>Notability as an independent artist and an internet phenomenon:</p>
<p>Notable mentions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stuff Magazine article, April 2003 Page 38. Stuff magazine is a mainstream entertainment magazine. There is a scan of the article avaliable since Stuff Magazine does not have free archives of old editions avaliable on their web site.</li>
<li>Bacon Magazine article accessed at <a href="http://www.frymybacon.com/articles/articles.php?articleID=422" class="external free" title="http://www.frymybacon.com/articles/articles.php?articleID=422" rel="nofollow">http://www.frymybacon.com/articles/articles.php?articleID=422</a></li>
<li>Colorado Daily newspaper article from Thursday, June 12, 2003 edition.</li>
<li>The artist's web site's high traffic <a href="http://www.illmitch.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.illmitch.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.illmitch.com/</a> that has 1978615 hits as of today and, also high Google hits and My Space hits.</li>
<li>The artist is mentioned by name in a song by independant artist U-Kru which was linked to on the original article.</li>
</ul>
<p>No, you won't find his CD's on Amazon etc. How many independent artists music are avaliable there though?</p>
<p>That's what I have, and I believe that the newspaper and two magazine articles are enough to warrant having an article. It would detract from wikipedia as an information source to delete it because this silly rapper really is an internet phenomenon to a lot of people. I first started editing the page because I did a wiki search for Ill Mitch and saw it was a recreated page that needed updating. I made mistakes because I had not done much of this before, and I think it is now up to wiki standards. It's not reliable to mention this, but I do want to say anecdotally that several people at my college have purchased his CD's and know about him. He is silly and weird, maybe even fake, but nevertheless he is notable. <a href="../../../j/e/l/User%7EJellonuts_42f3.html" title="User:Jellonuts">Jellonuts</a> 23:13, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> but don't salt, as the band could conceivably become notable enough in the future. The sources provided don't seem good enough. Also, if a band has nothing on Amazon.com that <i>is</i> a pretty good sign of non-notability. Jellonuts asked "how many independent artists music are available there (Amazon.com)?" Actually, <i>a lot.</i> Indeed, many indie bands that are not notable enough for Wikipedia have cds for sale on Amazon.com and Amazon is widely utilized by people who are really into indie music for this reason. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 01:23, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> When the argument for keep is based on the premise that we should ignore <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> for this article, there's a problem. GassyGuy 04:55, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> is obviously a hoax; he isn't an actual, serious artist, but is rather a "character" fabricated for laughs. Being Russian myself, I was able to easily discern that he isn't actually Russian; on the cover of one of his albums, "ILL Mitch" was not transliterated properly into Russian Cyrillic, but was "transliterated" by using the phonetic Cyrillic keyboard layout. Also, in his songs, he states some ridiculous aspects of and facts about life in Russia that are blatantly untrue. I believe that this article ought to not be deleted because if other articles that cover various "internet phenomena" are seldom prone to deletion due to what they are about, then there is no reason to just delete this article due to ILL Mitch's authenticity as an actual independent artist being questionable. The article needs to be simply straightened out so that it would truthfully reflect the internet phenomenon that is ILL Mitch; it shouldn't be in such a format that depicts him as an actual artist.</li>

<dd><b>comment</b> Oh come on. Political parties are not inherently notable - they are only notable for what they do. I can start a political party tomorrow in my living room, with all the ease of starting a stamp-collector's club. In the UK you don't have to register. Me and my friend can start one - and not even tell anyone! To contest a seat in a UK election, you only have to pay a £500 deposit to get your name on the ballot paper and you are not obliged campaign, in fact you don't even need to turn up. So, some evidence of notability beyond that is needed. The 'Shetland News' story that you cite, is just a local rag laughing at the person who came last in the local election poll. And read it! It admits that <b>they can't even raise £5,000</b> to contest the EU elections!!!!! Let's face it - no national newspaper even mentions these people - there is no independent commentary on them. They employ no-one and have no office. They don't even appear to have registered as a charity. They put out a launch release (see their website), and evidently, the media ignored it. So should we. Absolutely no evidence of notability whatsoever.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 23:54, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It seems that you have taken note of the Free Scotland Party. How did you come across this article if it is not notable? It seems to me that if it is notable enough to receive attention from you and to be nominated for deletion that it should be given the benefit of doubt, and also its not Wikipedia's editors responsibility to determine what is and isn't notable enough based on our subjective judgments. Wikipedia policy states, "Notability is not judged by Wikipedia editors directly. The inclusion of topics on Wikipedia is a reflection of whether those topics have been included in reliable published works. Other authors, scholars, or journalists have decided whether to give attention to a topic, and in their expertise have researched and checked the information about it. Thus, the primary notability criterion is a way to determine whether "the world" has judged a topic to be notable. This is unrelated to whether a Wikipedia editor personally finds the subject remarkable or worthy." It is clear that most people in the world find political parties to be notable enough and some actually vote based on the political party. Inherently, we do not decide which political party is notable and which is not because that is a subjective opinion and judgment while deciding that political parties warrant attention is not subjective. To give attention to one political party in Scotland because we subjectively believe it is notable while ignoring another because we subjectively believe it isn't is a violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Neutrality</a>. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardlalone_3c3b.html" title="User:Edwardlalone">Edward Lalone</a> | (<a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwardlalone_ffa4.html" title="User talk:Edwardlalone">Talk</a>) 01:13, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Woah, how I came across it is hardly relevant. Maybe I hit special:random. Your arguement is 'if it is notable enough for me to nominate it, then we should keep it???' My point is not that I find it unremarkable (or else I'd be nominating pokemon articles!) my point is that journalists and third party sources find THIS political party not worthy of mention. Objectively, we can say that this party is not being noted. For goodness sake, your arguments are ridiculous.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 02:03, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Your choice to misinterpret my argument is laughable. I did not make the argument that if its notable enough for you to nominate it than we should keep it. My point what that if you took the time to nominate it as well as to take a position on the deletion of an article about a Free Scotland Party candidate that it should be given the <b>benefit of the doubt.</b> Which is not to say that we should keep it. Also, let's look at your claim that it needs to be newsworthy to be notable. This isn't consistent with Wikipedia policy that a topic does not have to be newsworthy to be considered notable. Also, I consider your arguments to be just as ridiculous consider your arguments to be subjective and based on whether the topic is newsworthy when newsworthiness has no bearing on whether a topic is notable. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardlalone_3c3b.html" title="User:Edwardlalone">Edward Lalone</a> | (<a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwardlalone_ffa4.html" title="User talk:Edwardlalone">Talk</a>) 02:21, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is the opinion of editors such as yourself but I do not recognize it as a valid premise to determine what is clearly a subjective decision based on whether an article should or shouldn't be included. It gives people with a POV the opportunity to prevent the inclusion of articles they disagree with on topics they do not want to be focused on because they can always say (subjectively) that an article has not receive enough third party attention. This is why Wikipedia has taken the position that an article doesn't have to be newsworthy to be notable. I concur with your assessment about notability having to be based on objectivity but its clear here that objectivity isn't the standard being used to determine the notability of a political party (i.e., it's not as major of a party as mine and people who write for news agencies that are members of my party have not condescended to write about this minor party that I want to make sure doesn't receive notice). The fact is that 99% of people consider political parties in countries dominated by them to be notable. It is shameful when non-members of those parties refuse to write articles about them or to give them attention and we shouldn't feed their insanity. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardlalone_3c3b.html" title="User:Edwardlalone">Edward Lalone</a> | (<a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwardlalone_ffa4.html" title="User talk:Edwardlalone">Talk</a>) 02:27, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Just because the <i>concept</i> of political parties is notable does not mean every party in the world is notable. For example, I'm the leader of the Bean-with-Bacon Party, but I'd hardly call it a notable group. Our best showing was when a candidate we fielded came in sixth out of a field of eight in the elections for high school class president, gaining twelve votes. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 01:27, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Political parties are by no means inherently notable. The fact that this party couldn't even raise £5,000 to compete in European elections demonstrates their lack of notability. Also, the above arguement by Edward is rather circular. If finding an article and nominating it proves notability then nothing could ever get deleted because it would become notable when it was nominated. That is absolutely ridiculous. Edward is right in claiming that notability isn't subjective here, but he is incorrect in his further argument that this indicates that "most people in the world find political parties to be notable." Where is your statistical data that the majority of the world's population considers parties to be inherently notable? We regularly delete articles on political parties here because they don't meet Wikipedia's standards. If the party gets a significant amount of attention from the press and if it gets multiple seats in the legislature then its notable. This party doesn't hold multiple seats in the legislature and doesn't seem to have significant and substantial press coverage. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 01:30, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You do what? That is shameful and all editors involved in such deletion should be ashamed of themselves and they are wrong for deleting political parties that the government recognizes and its sad that their POV on how political parties are to be deleted have prevailed and I personally take issue with that POV and object to it and to the deletion of political parties because some editors do not consider them notable. Deleting this article would be inappropriate and if editors such as yourself have behaved like this in the past you should be ashamed of yourself, and if editors such as yourself have used Wikipedia policy in this manner than you should be just as ashamed of yourself. Also, my argument is not circular but yours is ridiculous but I am sure that other arguments made by other editors who agree with your POV are just as ridiculous. To have a requirement about how many seats a political party gets in the legislature as determining whether they are notable is wrong. It has no bearing on whether a political party is notable. What number do you affix. 1, 2, 5, 6, 10, 11, etc? Also, how do you subjectively determine what is a significant amount of attention from the press when Wikipedia has made it clear that newsworthiness is not a criteria in determining whether an article is notable. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardlalone_3c3b.html" title="User:Edwardlalone">Edward Lalone</a> | (<a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwardlalone_ffa4.html" title="User talk:Edwardlalone">Talk</a>) 02:36, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'll ignore your personal attacks at myself and at other editors who don't hold your position, though perhaps the closing admin should look into it. Otherwise, Wikipedia has very clear policies on how to establish notability, namely the need for <i>multiple, legitimate third party sources which discuss the article's topic more than just in passing.</i> This article has <i>no third party sources whatsoever.</i> Thus this should be deleted unless such sources are provided. If you don't agree with this policy, that's fine, but this policy is one that determines the outcomes of AfD discussions. If you want to discuss problems with this policy (which will, I might add, get you pretty much nowhere) then feel free to open up a discussion topic on it at the Village Pump related to policy. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 05:54, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are hundreds of articles about minor political parties on Wikipedia and none of them should be deleted because of some erroneous belief that a Party needs to be newsworthy to be included when Wikipedia policy makes it clear that this is not a standard to determine whether an article on a topic is to be included here.

<li>These <i>criticism of X</i> articles have survived AFD, so there is no class precedent. They are not forks, they are subarticles. Of course it's possible for it to meet NPOV, and it should.

<li>I am not discussing merging the articles. I am nominating the article for deletion and suggesting that all such articles that are created by editors who advocate keeping these articles be deleted as well. Nor is the talk page of the article the appropriate place for this discussion as it's not a discussion of whether the article is NPOV but whether such POV articles should exist in the first place. Nor has community consensus ever been reached on this topic but those of us who disagree with those who have responded so far in favor of keeping the articles are driven to leave Wikipedia. Everytime we try to challenge those who advance POV and POV forks we tend to be left with two choices. Be civil and leave or be civil and let these POV advocates prevail and move on to other articles but that is also inappropriate. It's time that Wikipedia drew the line and made it clear the POV will not be tolerated. I also see that from the other articles that have been nominated of this kind that this point has been made by other editors but those who disagree with this point tend to prevail because those of us who disagree with them tend to be civil (even pass to the point of saying, "please don't jump all over me." <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardlalone_3c3b.html" title="User:Edwardlalone">Edward Lalone</a> | (<a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwardlalone_ffa4.html" title="User talk:Edwardlalone">Talk</a>) 00:37, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Consensus has indeed be reached on the issue. You only argue that it has not because you disagree with the result. The numerous <i>Criticism of X</i> articles would not exist if such a consensus had not be reached. Your proposal to delete all of these articles is unreasonable. Nonetheless, the result of this afd should determine consensus on the issue.

What is also unreasonable is that these articles are permitted and aren't deleted and your suggestion that this is unreasonable to delete them is itself unreasonable. What this afd will determine is that you and those who agree with you will prevail and those who don't can find that consensus is nothing more than editors such as Soltak and Cool Hand agreeing to ignore any real consensus with those of us who would like to see a more moderate Wikipedia policy on this issue.

<dd>There is absolutely no reason to discuss whether there should be sections on the Criticisms of Mormonism in individual articles about Mormonism. That is outside of the scope of this discussion and would require far to much discussion to reach any conclusion that is agreeable to everyone. This is why we need to focus on whether such articles should exist. We aren't really discussing whether there should be criticism sections in individual articles or criticisms included in the text of articles because that can be dealt with on a NPOV basis as opposed to entire articles existing of a POV nature. So, putting aside whether this information should be included in other articles it comes down to whether this article and others like it should be deleted. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardlalone_3c3b.html" title="User:Edwardlalone">Edward Lalone</a> | (<a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwardlalone_ffa4.html" title="User talk:Edwardlalone">Talk</a>) 00:57, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

And again, I think criticisms of broad movements have even stronger justification for their own article than say, <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_George_W._Bush_9d5e.html" title="Criticism of George W. Bush">Criticism of George W. Bush</a>. With a broad category like Mormonism, or especially Christianity, there's no way to merge relevent NPOV content into a single article. All of the articles would have criticism <s>sections</s> passages, and they would be massively redundant. As I see it, criticism articles are the only way to <i>prevent</i> forking for broad topics. Until we do reach consensus on this issue, take comfort that Mormonism is not alone. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i>

<dd>I believe that my position is correct and that such articles are inappropriate for an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriticism_8870.html" title="Wikipedia:Criticism">Criticism</a> of a topic should not be permissible (i.e., "Separate articles consisting entirely of criticism of a topic are not allowed"). It is further stated by others that "creating separate articles with the sole purpose of grouping the criticisms or to elaborate individual points of criticism on a certain topic would usually be considered a POV fork, per <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">POV forking</a>." I believe that this position is correct and that there is no reason that consensus on the length and content of a criticism section of an article cannot be reached by the editors of that topic and that attempts to create articles dedicated specifically to criticism of a topic are inappropriate and are best addressed in that article. We need to draw the line somewhere and I believe it is at POV forking. Also, some redundancy in articles is not a negative but a positive as people may not be able to read multiple articles on the same topic. If there is redundancy in articles than it is up to editors to reach a consensus on what is included and what is excluded from a specific article and to work within a Wikipedia Project to eliminate redundancy where bad while promoting redundancy that is positive and assists people in research. I believe that consensus on what constitutes a POV fork has been reached and that at some point it need to be adhered to when it comes to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Neutrality</a>. It brings me no comfort that Criticism of Mormonism is not alone but instead brings me even less comfort as my issue isn't specifically with the Criticism of Mormonism article as it is with these articles not being deleted when they are a violation of Wikipedia policy. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardlalone_3c3b.html" title="User:Edwardlalone">Edward Lalone</a> | (<a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwardlalone_ffa4.html" title="User talk:Edwardlalone">Talk</a>) 01:45, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The exact opposite is warranted. If the article becomes to long than there are two options 1) create an article for another section (i.e., history) of the topic, or 2) edit the content of the section and arrive at a consensus of what should and should not be included in the criticism section. Creating another article through POV forking is not acceptable and should not occur. Also, simply because a criticism can be verified does not mean that it deserves an article of its own. Wikipedia has sought to maintain a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutrality</a> policy and these articles violate that neutrality and only brings ridicule of and criticism of Wikipedia. No professional encylopedia would have articles dealing specifically with the criticisms of a topic and for good reasons. These are best addressed as part of the article and if they are notable enough than they should be included in the text of the topic's article. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardlalone_3c3b.html" title="User:Edwardlalone">Edward Lalone</a> | (<a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwardlalone_ffa4.html" title="User talk:Edwardlalone">Talk</a>) 03:18, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree with the premise that an article on a topic is long that articles should be created dealing specifically with criticisms of the topic. It makes just as much sense to create articles dealing with other areas of the topic as it does to create a article about the criticisms of the topic. If a new article needs to be created for length reasons than it should be from another section of the article with a Main Article reference and not with the criticisms of the topic as this only promote POV forking. I also do not agree that if the criticism article is well-written and contains references that the article becomes valid. POV articles do not become valid simply because someone is a good writer or is able to find sources that concur with their POV. It simply does not make sense to do so. POV forking is in my min inappropriate and is done to avoid consensus building. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardlalone_3c3b.html" title="User:Edwardlalone">Edward Lalone</a> | (<a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwardlalone_ffa4.html" title="User talk:Edwardlalone">Talk</a>) 03:13, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Those are not a good enough reasons to allow for the creation of POV articles through POV forking. It makes little to no sense to allow for the creation of such articles or to promote them. I can create a well-written article on just about any topic and include verifiable information to back up that POV but that does not warrant the creation of a new article dealing specifically with criticisms of a topic. Traditional encyclopdias do not have articles on criticisms and we should attempt to keep to that tradition of not creating articles dealing just with the criticisms of a topic. There are certain sections which can be expanded through the creation of sub-articles and it is urged that we do so but on the contrary it is against Wikipedia policy to be involved in POV forking. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardlalone_3c3b.html" title="User:Edwardlalone">Edward Lalone</a> | (<a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwardlalone_ffa4.html" title="User talk:Edwardlalone">Talk</a>) 03:13, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm afraid you have it backwards. Wikipedia strives to maintian a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>. If there is significant, notable criticism of a topic, it deserves mention in a neutral manner here. If that criticism becomes too large to keep in the main article, creating a seperate article with it is valid. Claiming that criticism itself is POV is counter-intuitive. A POV-fork is when you create a seperate article <i>specifically</i> to promote a single view of the subject; these are not POV-forks, they are neutral sub-articles that happen to be focused on the criticism of their subjects.</dd>

<dd>You are free to disagree and so are other editors but you and them are on the wrong side of Wikipedia policy on this issue and your interpretations of those policies are wrong. These sort of articles are POV forking and they have been rejected and should be rejected. In fact, this issue comes down to what is acceptable and what is not on Wikipedia. If editors are allowed to control Wikipedia policies and to interpret them so that articles can violate NPOV it will self-destruct. The proliferation of these kinds of articles will ultimately lead to people not trusting Wikipedia as a reliable source. There are differences between how Wikipedia works and how paper encylopedia's work but it shouldn't be a difference between professionalism and POV amatuerism which these articles are. Any respected encylopedia would not include such articles in their editions because they would lose customers, and people would begin to see them as nothing but the proliferation of viewpoints. Wikipedia is not a blog, it is not a forum, it is not a newspaper, it is not an all-inclusive source of information available online or offline but it is an encylopedia and while it is not a paper encyclopedia similar standards do apply here. It is always best for Wikipedia to err on the side of caution when it comes to POV. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardlalone_3c3b.html" title="User:Edwardlalone">Edward Lalone</a> | (<a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwardlalone_ffa4.html" title="User talk:Edwardlalone">Talk</a>) 03:44, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

I also don't need to be told that you are right and that consensus is essentially: "I am right and you are wrong and that's that."

<dd>Actually, according to what I have read the creation of an article on the criticism of a topic is considered a POV fork. There will always be disagreement about what constitutes a POV fork but its quite obvious that something is a POV fork when it seeks to avoid having to build a consensus in an article on a topic by creating a sub-article dealing specifically with criticisms. I don't know what your interpretation of a POV fork is but its obvious that you and those who agree with you have prevailed in the past and this must not be allowed to stand and that NPOV should be promoted even if you do not agree. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardlalone_3c3b.html" title="User:Edwardlalone">Edward Lalone</a> | (<a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwardlalone_ffa4.html" title="User talk:Edwardlalone">Talk</a>) 03:44, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> While I respect wanting to avoid POV forks, that concern doesn't appear to apply to this article. Avoiding reference to criticisms of a world religion or political entity would be passive partisanship of that group (inherently NPOV), just as only a cursory reference to such criticisms. As the main article on Mormonism is extremely large, I would say it made sense to make this sub-article. Reading this article it is obviously intended as an overview of the various forms of criticism that have been proposed (as opposed to, say, an article making a direct attack on the subject), with sub-links to those specific critiques.</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> No one is saying that we should avoid criticism of world religions or a political entity. The issue is how it is done and that creating an article specifically for the purpose of crititizing a topic is inappropriate and unprofessional and creates a source that is POV and not reliable. Wikipedia should be striving to create articles that maintain <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutrality</a> and these articles can no more maintain neutrality than can articles created for the sole purpose of advertising or promoting a specific topic, company or individual. You argue that a cursory reference to such criticisms is inherently POV and while its interesting to know that you consider all the encyclopedias that exist to be inherently POV except for Wikipedia. It is this kind of attitude that has caused the encylopedic community to criticize Wikipedia and it's becoming apparent to me that their assessment of Wikipedia's reliability is not far off. Anyone can create and edit an article on Wikipedia and there doesn't have to be any scholarly review and therefore there is a natural tendency here to create articles specifically for the purpose of criticizing a topic. Every topic that exists has its opponents and normally encyclopedias seek to balance those in articles on that topic but here we advocate the creation of articles based solely on a criticism of a topic and that is inherently <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a>. For some reason we feel that the unlimited scope of Wikipedia allows for this but it doesn't and it creates a perception of Wikipedia not being reliable. When I first started using Wikipedia I considered it to be highly reliable but over time I have changed to consider it at best only a starting point for further research and to be generally unreliable. Where do you draw the line? Can someone create an article titled "Criticism of the Criticisms of Mormonism?" It seems to me that there are editors here who are given undue consideration and that this causes a lack of balance in Wikipedia that should not be tolerated as it creates POV articles. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardlalone_3c3b.html" title="User:Edwardlalone">Edward Lalone</a> | (<a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwardlalone_ffa4.html" title="User talk:Edwardlalone">Talk</a>) 02:40, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Yes, POV forking concerns DO apply to this article. Criticism of Mormonism is apparent in just about ever article regarding mormonism... if you look at <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriticism_8870.html" title="Wikipedia:Criticism">Wikipedia's proposed Criticism guidlines</a>, it's fairly obvious that this article is inappropriate.

<dd>I suspect those editors who feel differently will prevail as they have in the past because those who felt the same way that you and I do on this have been driven to leave Wikipedia because of the attitude by other editors that such articles are appropriate and therefore cannot comment. This in my mind means that the only editors who will comment here on this issue are those who advocate POV forks such as this one. The next time this issue is brought up I doubt very much that either you or I will comment because of the result of the bias that is promoted. I have seriously considered leaving Wikipedia on several occasions because of this but I have chosen to remain and to edit articles I feel need to exist here. I had to give serious consideration to whether I would nominate this article for deletion and was somewhat concerned about doing so. I normally wouldn't take the time to challenge an unfair, and clear lack of neutrality as presented by these articles because those who advocate POV tend to be more outspoken than those who oppose it. Yet, maybe if more editors will nominate articles of this kind than over time someone may take notice of the bias of the overall community and maybe even the Media may become involved and ultimately force the hand of those who promote bias on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardlalone_3c3b.html" title="User:Edwardlalone">Edward Lalone</a> | (<a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwardlalone_ffa4.html" title="User talk:Edwardlalone">Talk</a>) 02:37, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The only reliable way to handle these articles is to delete them. Far to many editors have left Wikipedia because of the conflict and lack of consensus of these articles. I based this on the fact that there tends to be high activity in these articles and then suddenly that activity essentially disappears and then the same conflicts are renewed by different editors. In watching the discussions of these kind of articles I have wanted to make comments but I have learned my lesson and tend not to become involved in them anymore as they have no merit and those editors such as yourself who believe these articles are appropriate can do whatever you want with them but I do feel that someone needs to draw attention to this problem. Your POV that these articles are legitimate is wrong and a violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutrality</a>. Also, where editors are from who are questioning the appropriateness of these articles has no bearing at all on the issue. I could just as easily say that "A bunch of 'keeps' from outside of Utah aren't going to force us to keep an entire "Criticism of..." article style." It's clear based on your comments here that you are biased on this issue and are promoting POV forks. I will continue to challenge editors such as yourself and if necessary force you to show your true colors as tyrants who advocate POV on Wikipedia and who won't even compromise on an issue such as this one which would still allow for criticism to be expressed on Wikipedia about an article's topic without creating entire articles based on a POV. I doubt that anyone would agree that if George W. Bush or one of his supporters logged on and created an article titled "Praises of George W. Bush." Who here would think that this wasn't a POV article? What if they also argued that they were simply expanding on a section in the article about George W. Bush? At some point we need to draw the line and its clear that this line should be at POV articles because there is no way to form consensus in these articles as opposed to consensus being almost guaranteed in a topics article. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwardlalone_3c3b.html" title="User:Edwardlalone">Edward Lalone</a> | (<a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwardlalone_ffa4.html" title="User talk:Edwardlalone">Talk</a>) 02:37, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, I'm going to be referring to <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">WP:POVFORK</a> here. This article is not a POV-fork because it is "summary style". The difference would be if this article was created for the purpose of inserting content into <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormonism.html" title="Mormonism">Mormonism</a> that was rejected from that article for being uncited. But you've shown no evidence that this is the case. Moreover, even if it were the case, and if this article were suffering from profound POV issues, there is an alternative route besides deletion. You could balance the article. For every criticism in the article, you could potentially provide reliably-sourced Mormon responses. This would make the article meet <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. As for your claim that I am a "tyrant", well, I'm flattered, but even if I were "biased on this issue and are promoting POV forks" that would mean little. You are biased toward removing criticism; we all have our biases. What's your point? The idea behind <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> is not that we each try to be perfectly flat (impossible for most people), but that "<i>where there are or have been conflicting views, these should be presented fairly. None of the views should be given</i> undue weight <i>or asserted as being the truth, and all significant published points of view are to be presented, not just the most popular one. ... As the name suggests, the neutral point of view</i> is <i>a point of view, not the absence or elimination of viewpoints.</i>" Your POV and my POV add up to NPOV. The problem with your whole argument here, and why you are wasting a great deal of your own time (and a fair share of others' time), is that you are trying to argue for policy change by using an AFD.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: although I obviously agree with your vote, I do find your comment about a "a couple of 'keeps' from Utah" to be a bit unfriendly. One might imagine that you're marginalizing these editors' contributions—perhaps discounting the contributions of all Utah/LDS editors. I just don't think the comment was necessary. It's true that precedent speaks strongly against deletion, but it has nothing to do with the geography or religion of those who suggest the precedent should change. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 07:59, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I respect your viewpoint but I did not consider AFD to be about voting and did not consider Wikipedia to be a democracy. If Wikipedia is going to be about precedents and about voting than there is very little real neutrality. I would even assert that this is an American POV about how things should operate (i.e., democracy and the Supreme Court) and it fails to recognize that democracy and precedent should not govern <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutrality</a>. We shouldn't be voting on whether an article contains POV and deleting them because they contain POV's but we should delete articles as per Wikipedia policy that violate neutrality. To continue adhering to a precedent based on the opinions of editors who promote a lack of neutrality concerns me as precedent tends to become even more fixed over time. I also think that precedent speaks for deletion and that the repeated nomination of these articles suggest that they are in fact POV forking and that many editors consider them to be POV forking. To think that one interpretation has prevailed in totality on this issue to date would indicate a conflict of interest and I assert that an environment exists where editors perceive tyranny in the process. At some point we have to say that while we seek to promote <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutrality</a> that real neutrality can only exist if articles that deal with a topic include a balance of POV's and that no article should exist either as an advertisement or criticism of a topic which these articles do.

<li>Undecided - One thing that bothers me about the arguments is the examples of articles such as Criticism of Christianity, Islam, etc. I did find one article on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_the_Catholic_Church_bdda.html" title="Criticism of the Catholic Church">Criticism of the Catholic Church</a>; however, I was not successful in finding similar articles for Southern Baptists, Quakers, Episcopalians, or even Calvinists? Even more surprising is no critique of the Jehovah Witness group. To criticize a religion as a whole is one thing, but when there are so few comprable articles to the one in question, it sure raises a red flag for me. In addition, I would repeat a comment from above; every single article regarding Mormonism is replete with criticisms. If Wikipedia is going to keep this example of criticizing a single church, then I assume it would be appropriate to remove the vast majority of the criticism and place it in this single article, which is what the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> has achieved; it is virtually devoid of criticism. I prefer the example of the Roman Catholic Church article, but I think it would be almost impossible to achieve for Mormonism. Given its small size relative to other groups, it would be virtually impossible to overcome the nature of friendly Christians who insist on ensuring that criticism falls on every article. --<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm_Rider_8aac.html" title="User:Storm Rider">Storm Rider</a> <a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStorm_Rider_45fc.html" title="User talk:Storm Rider"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 07:06, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment -- StormRider, if you check out the links in my post above, there is an example of criticism of a mainline denomination as both a section in the main article, and as an independent article. The same phenomena can be seen in the articles on Christianity, which include criticism as a <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html#Current_controversies_and_criticisms" title="Christianity">section</a> and as a <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Christianity_2059.html" title="Criticism of Christianity">"Criticism of..."</a> article (not to <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_as_myth.html" title="Jesus as myth">mention</a> the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Jesus_786e.html" title="Criticism of Jesus">many</a> other <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_the_Bible_7af3.html" title="Criticism of the Bible">articles</a> which could be considered direct criticism of Christianity]]). That said, I would certainly be in favor of minimizing criticism of Mormonism in other articles, and linking to this one main "Criticism of..." article. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPastordavid_9d78.html" title="User:Pastordavid">Pastordavid</a> 16:29, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> As some readers may know, I am strongly supportive of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Please bear this in mind when I say this: I firmly believe that religions and creeds can show themselves best when they are tested. We are taught ( by Brigham Young ) that people should "seek to know the object of their present existence, and how to apply, in the most profitable manner for their mutual good and salvation, the intelligence they possess. Let them seek to know and thoroughly understand things within their reach, and to make themselves well acquainted with the object of their being here, by diligently seeking unto a superior Power for information, and by the careful study of the best books." I believe that if Brigham Young were alive today he would seek to include Wikipedia in "the best books", and would feel, as I do, that understanding comes not just from a one-sided view of things, but from diligent study of all sides of a case. This is a teaching of many scriptures, and we all do ourselves a dis-service if we ignore it. By all means, let us ensure that we do not become biased to support ( or oppose ) criticisms of this or any other creed, and let us not be mean-spirited or petty, but in the spirit of clear understanding that is handed down to us from our predecessors, I say <b>Keep</b> this article, and similar articles on other creeds. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 16:56, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. An article that references valid sources in this particular subject matter, given that the LDS Church's founding and history, versus other much-older Christian church histories, lends a valid, NPOV comparison and, as such, debate of its <i>differences</i> in practice over the largest of the faiths, Catholicism, and the many Protestant faiths. This article does require cleanup per WP policies. Many comments in this discussion are "playing the system", which itself is against WP policy; the existence of the supporting criticism articles on other faiths keeps NPOV by their presence, provided they, too, adhere to current policy. Personally speaking, as I practice another faith other than Mormonism, I may personally take an LDS bible found in public and throw it in the trash as a personal objection of heresy. However, to keep the purposes of WP as neutral source of information, no contributor should be able to lock out criticism of any faith, including your own, for the sake of personal objection to it. --<a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESpencerian_205c.html" title="User:Spencerian">Spencerian</a> 17:21, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>BTW, there are plenty of people who would agree with Edward Lalone. There was a heated debate about the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_the_Catholic_Church_bdda.html" title="Criticism of the Catholic Church">Criticism of the Catholic Church</a> article and it was agreed to create subsidiary articles on specific subtopics and include criticism in each subsidiary article. I'm not against this approach. In fact, I agreed to it. However, as far as I know, the subsidiary articles were never created (I haven't been active over there for a while) and so the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_the_Catholic_Church_bdda.html" title="Criticism of the Catholic Church">Criticism of the Catholic Church</a> article was kept.</dd>
<dd>It's my opinion that the two approaches are not incompatible. You could have detailed criticisms in each subsidiary article and an overview article like this one summarizing all the criticisms.</dd>
<dd>IMO, the nub of the question is: If a "Criticism of..." article is written in a way so as to assert that the criticisms detailed therein are unquestionably true, then you have a POV fork. If, on the other hand, the criticisms are described in a way that suggests "According to reliable source X, there are people who believe criticisms A,B and C." then the "Criticism of..." article is not a POV fork because it is not pushing a POV but describing it. Describing a notable POV is not in itself POV else the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazism</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxism.html" title="Marxism">Marxism</a> articles would be considered to be POV. So too, would be articles describing the criticisms of those ideologies. Detailing criticism in a separate article should not be considered inherently POV. Done correctly, it is just an organizational device which allows the main article to focus on the topic while pushing the details of the criticism to a subsidiary article.</dd>
<dd>I will also comment that <a href="../../../c/r/i/WP%7ECriticism_a718.html" title="WP:Criticism">WP:Criticism</a> is not a policy nor is it even a guideline. It is a proposed guideline that was demoted to an essay and only recently repromoted to a proposed guideline.</dd>

<li>'<i>delete</i> not a bad idea, but a poor implementation. First of all, the creators obviously intended "literature" in the sense of imaginative literature, not books in general. Second, most of this is 19th c. novels, and of course all 19th c novels are PD. So it then becomes a list of 19th c. notable novels, and I suppose one could be constructed, though it would have to rely on some sort of criterion than would have to be spelled out. There is no point in a list of all 19th c. novels, that's appropriate for a category. I suggest it would be easier starting over than having this one hang around. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 04:30, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>delete</b> This could become a notable event, but is not yet one. the article is honest enough to mention that the 1st year there were only 6 entries, and avoid saying how many in the latest. I suspect very few, as some of the article is devoted to trivialities about an individual contestant who fell out of a boat,</li>
</ul>
<p>and the photo is not reassuring about N. If they can get a reasonable number of contestants year after year, ... But i notice there is no independent RS at all: the two sources are the web site for the event, and the web site for the university rowing club where it is held.

<li><b>Hint</b>: You can't nominate the movies this way. They and the man all need their own separate AFD's because any one of them might be notable without the others.

<li><b>Comment</b> Bandhak was a non commercial Bollywood film. It was a different film than usual Bollywood film that are usually dance drama. Bandhak was selected in different film festivals like IAAC, SAAFA and one in Rutger's University. It was released for DVD market. I had seen the site of Chath A Roof Without Walls again a different film on homeless in America. Arvind Pal</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The article says "A press release from the distributor Digimax Studio describes it as the first Hindi film in the United States" which if true and verified certainly makes it notable. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichhoncho_144b.html" title="User:Richhoncho">Richhoncho</a> 00:15, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Wikipedia is not a source for obscure internet communities unless we choose to have every person who runs one to create a page. Other pages such as Live Journal's Top Model have been delete and so I fail to see how this one should have a page. Wikipedia shouldn't act as an ad for this group. Page doesn't even have a single other page linking to it. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChange1211_cdfe.html" title="User:Change1211">Change1211</a> 02:26, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
