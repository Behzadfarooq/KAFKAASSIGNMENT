<dd><b>Comment</b> - since the split article has only become more NPOV, and better sourced (it almost hasn't grown in size and putting it back is out of the question). Simple demands you mention: well everyone can check on the talk page that your demands were very simple (<i>Fix the problems that are in this article or it will be removed as an egregious violation of WP:NOT</i>) and quite short and not explained and you made them yesterday. This is not what wikipedia is about... Check below for other arguments.<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalvNaut_b0e8.html" title="User:SalvNaut">SalvNaut</a> 11:14, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wrong...the article is huge compared to when it was on the 9/11 CT article...when it was there, the complaints were that adding more nonsense then would make that article too big. After forking, conspiracy theory folks have made this a repository of junk science. I asked to get the known facts about Steven E. Jones put in the article and was essentially laughed off. Misuse of Wikipedia to push conspiracy theory propaganda such as this makes folks like yourself nothing but problem editors. I mean look at the singular focus you and the rest of the cruftists have...a blind man could see that your agenda is to POV push conspiracy theory nonsense...you hardly edit anything else. You're not fooling anyone.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 12:12, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wrong: MONGO laughed off?? - the facts about Jones you asked for are already in the article since yesterday (were added witihn hours you asked)... maybe you should concentrate on its content not your personal POV on this matter? What I edit is my personal thing - is it ad hominem argument you just brought on? To make this even I'll say that you make yourself look like a problem admin.

The phrase "since the split" should be read with that in mind. The requests to establish an NPOV and an encyclopedic approach have been met with friendly assurances that "we're working on it". The problems with this article had, as the nomitation notes, previously been problems with the 9/11 conspiracy theory article (which is coming around nicely) and (though this is before my time) the article on the collapse of the WTC (which is in great shape now - in part due to the efforts of editors who are working on this article). At this stage it is clear that the sections need to be trimmed in its "collection of information". As the closing admin on the recent AfD said, "it is clear that [Controlled demolition hypothesis for the collapse of the World Trade Center] needs to be made more neutral etc, but <b>this is going way outside the area of AFD</b>.".<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Controlled-Demolition_Theory_%289/11_Conspiracy_Theory%29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Controlled-Demolition_Theory_%289/11_Conspiracy_Theory%29" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> I agree with that judgment, and it is too soon to say that the challenges have not been met.

Again we talking about "POV pushing" on the one side and "a notable theory" on the other. Importantly, the basic justification for this article is that merging it back into <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a> would undo some substantial recent improvements to it.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> we want to honestly present in this article the status of knowledge about the hypothesis, which already caused quite a mess in the world. It's very notable among Internet users, it's made its way to the media, it's been considered among engineers (NIST, Bazhant - then dismissed) and there are academic papers promoting it (Jones,Cherpanov, Greening, who considers thermite reactions). There are voices form experts abroad (Swiss professor of structural engineering; Dutch, Danish demolition experts) agreeing with it. We want to present most notable points of this hypothesis (and there is a lot of them, they are mentioned in academic papers, summaries of researches, on thousands of blogs), present a critique of them (it's already done in many cases). There are secondary sources presenting this hypothesis, there is a critique of it, so the article can be very encyclopedic.</li>

<dd>Proponents of deletion bring following issues on: WP:NOT a soapbox, WP:OR. My opinion:
<ul>
<li>Propaganda,self-promotion, advertising, or advocacy - it's not propaganda cause the hypothesis lives its own life and this article only presents it. It's not advocacy because article is written in NPOV language and criticism is already there and more is very welcomed.</li>
<li>publisher of orginal thought: the article presents thoughts which are on minds of millions of people(many scientists) - such thoughts deserve to be described and discussed, criticised.</li>
<li>WP:OR:the hypothesis has been published, has been engaged with (NIST discussed it,FAQ). There is no drawing conclusions in the article, no orginal thought (please work on that more if you wish).</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Proponents of deletion, instead of working on the article to make it better, would prefer to delete it. They're using this tactics very often with regard to 9/11 articles - I agree that in some cases they're correct - not in this one, and recent AfD voting has shown that, too.

Popular will cannot trump policy for what is meritous, and 60+ RS is certainly meritous. I want to AGF but the fact that this was nominated 24 hours after the last AfD on the same content is just the height of hubris, and as Jeff mentioned should be tossed on procedural grounds. This is already clearly going to be a no concensus or keep--this needs cleanup, and does not qualify for deletion, as AfD is not a vote (thankfully). Anyway, the sudden and premature AfD will at least insulate this from future premature AfDs as any new early ones will be certainly considered a disruptive WP:POINT vio of some sort. · <font color="#0518A7"><b>XP</b></font> · 08:15, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wait, wait--so for some reason, because some of us consider it a dumb theory or disagree with it, valid RS reporting about the existance of a thing being espoused by possibly unreliable people means that we shouldn't have an article on it? That makes absolutely zero sense and I'd like for you to demonstrate where/how in policy such a thing is justifiable. Unless I'm misreading what you just wrote, your saying that is 1. I announce I am heriditary Emperor of the United States; 2. I post it all over the Internets, all over print media, and buy a TV spot Ross Perot style to espouse this; 3. I am a certifiable crackpot. 4. The NY Times and other international and domestic media cover my nonsense reliably; 5. I shouldn't have a wikipedia article because it's not provable that my statements may or may not be false? That makse zero sense and following that logic I can apply it to virtually any article on any fringe subject matter that I disagree with to get it removed from Wikipedia.

<dd>Ironically, the same people whom this article cites as reliable sources would probably buy into your announcement. Fortunately, there are precious few. This isn't a matter of sanitizing the site for "my opinion" or "MONGO's opinion". It's a matter of removing an article that will always be a cruftish soapbox for an extreme minority of people. It's not our place to advertise theories and breed disdain for the US government, we're here to present the facts in the most neutral unbiased way possible.

<dd>Ironically, I think my point was missed. It's not our place to decide if something is meritous based on it's virtue, and it's neither our place to breed disdain for the US government nor is it our job to prevent it. This is not the American Wikipedia, it's the English Wikipedia. American POV, pro or con, has no more relevance than English, Scottish, Canadian, Jamaican, Austrailian, South African, or New Zealand POV. Neither has any more intrinsic value than any other. If something is offensive to some Americans, that's of no relevance, and if the subject matter leads to people clucking their tongues at the US government... well, that's not our concern. Also, have you not noticed the constant surveys that says 1/4 to 1/3 of all people believe in 9/11 related Conspiracy Theories? Hardly an extreme minority, there are scores of such reports all over. <a href="http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,20385039-910,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,20385039-910,00.html" rel="nofollow">From a major Aussie news source.</a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. "Hypothesis" is the word that both the official report on the collapse (NIST) and the most detailed statement statement of it (Jones) uses. This is very clear in the present article, which cites both Jones' emphasis on its hypothetical nature and NIST's use of the same word. As for the sourcing, yes, it is uneven. But the hypothesis itself is easily located in a handful of detailed conspiracy theories <i>and</i> mainstream media coverage <i>and</i> the official investigation (brief mention) <i>and</i> the scientific literature (very brief mention). We need to filter out some noise in the article, not start from scratch.

<dd>I once again appreciate Seabecan's personal attacks and odd linking to an arbcom case which has already resulted in two of those who were harassing me now being indef banned...and this is before the voting has even commenced. Seabhcan claims this article is balanced. The only fact based citations are those from mainstream science, not from non peer reviewed conspiracy theory websites. This article is clearly not capable of ever being neutral, except to those who dream and fantasize that controlled demolition is what really happened on 9/11. My guess is that, as usual, this kind of comment from Seabhcan is deliberately designed to provoke a hostile response...kind of the thing I deal with when he posts edit summaries such as these:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=65024234" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=65024234" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=51496524" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=51496524" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=51428328" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=51428328" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> and of course there are more.

<dd>Again we behold the wonderous miracle of MONGO logic! Mongo declares above that the article is not 'neutral' on the one hand, yet complains in the previous sentence that the article presents both "citations ... from mainstream science" and from "conspiracy theory websites". Presenting both side of the issue is balance, and I stand by my assertion that it is this very balance that is mongo's main peeve. Mongo wishes wikipedia to contain only his version of truth. If this policy were to hold sway, we should presumably be deleting "<a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>" next. Even if the ideas and theories in the article are untrue, the fact that they are notably discussed and believed by many, even by "those who dream and fantasize that controlled demolition", even if Mongo disagrees with these beliefs, this topic warrants an article. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Self-Described Seabhcán</a> 17:58, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The accuracy of the second claim can assessed by looking at the article's talk page under "Unencyclopedic"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Controlled_demolition_hypothesis_for_the_collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center#Unencyclopedic" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Controlled_demolition_hypothesis_for_the_collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center#Unencyclopedic" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> and the associated edits (see especially<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Controlled_demolition_hypothesis_for_the_collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center&amp;diff=77251723&amp;oldid=77246891" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Controlled_demolition_hypothesis_for_the_collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center&amp;diff=77251723&amp;oldid=77246891" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> and compare with Mongo's "demand" in the talk pages.) The vast majority of the alleged "miring" and "pushing" has taken place over the last couple of days, working very quickly (note the cautious tone in the edit summaries). We have been trying to convert a list of curiosities into a coherent prose presentation. Of course, people who think that the views presented are incoherent will consider any semblance of coherence an act of misinformation. Many of us, however, who have looked at these theories in some detail, have come to concede that, even if they ultimately may prove to be false, they do in fact 'make sense'.

<dd>A hypothesis is very often presented along with the prima facie evidence for it. This evidence is of course provisional and does not constitute proof; it merely informs subsequent investigations and (importantly in this case) it helps us to understand the content of the hypothesis. As with any other article, we are here to help each other understand (i.e., make sense of) the topic. A synthesis of, say, three presentations by conspiracy theorists, along with official responses and mainstream media commentary, without any intention of advancing either the truth or falsity of the proposition that the World Trade Center was brought down by controlled demolition runs afoul of no policy I am aware of.

<dd>Let me add that this AfD is especially interesting to me as a relatively new editor. Not only has my judgment been called into question by the nomination (obviously in a sense, since I created the article), so too have my motives for being here. I should point out that my edits here were made in the same spirit (applying the same sort of synthesis) as the edits that I made on the "official" <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center_cfbf.html" title="Collapse of the World Trade Center">collapse of the World Trade Center</a> article, where they were met with what I took to be approval.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The controlled demolition argument is one of the strongest and most well known among those who argue that 9/11 was an inside job. The fact that the 9/11 commission report didn't even mention the collapse of building 7, a collapse NIST admits is fundamentally inexplicable, is a red flag to Americans that there are significant unanswered questions concerning the events of 9/11. Those American currently number over 100 million. To say that a discussion of this on wikipedia is "unencyclopedic" is a pure POV play by <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">User:MONGO</a> and others. If he can't edit articles in a way that fits with the desire for information of a large minority of wikipedia readers and editors, then perhaps he should recuse himself from this debate. The base 9/11 conspiracy article is already overloaded and this is a logical expansion of one of the larger subsections.

<dd>The existence of the CD hypothesis is acknowledged by the very engineers (Sunder, Bazant) who have qualified opinions about the subject and has been widely reported in the majority of the world's media, although as a minority view. There is no evidence to suggest that the hypothesis is being vetted by "one or a few webmasters". There are, for example, several books that present a version of it, all (as far as I can tell) by <i>independent</i> small publishers [I'm actually not sure how small all of them are]. We must keep in mind that this article is not about the collapse of the world trade center, but about a <i>hypothesis about</i> that collapse. That is why the subject of most of the sentences is either the hypothesis or its proponents, on the one hand, <s>and</s>or the mainstream explanation and its proponents, on the other. In a few cases it presents a fact about the collapses directly (most often with a qualifier like "there were reports of..."). It should of course only do so when the fact is not controversial (the date and time of the collapses, the amount of buildings that collapsed, etc.) My point here is that the article is only "forced to rely on unreliable sources" if it claims controlled demolition brought down the buildings. It clearly doesn't do this. It says that there are people who suspect it was brought down by controlled demolition, and it explicates the main tenets of this suspicion, which, as Time magazine has pointed out, is no longer simply part of a "fringe phenomenon" but of a "mainstream political reality."--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Basboll_a8ed.html" title="User:Thomas Basboll">Thomas Basboll</a> 06:26, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I fully understand most of what you state...but to present this "hypothesis" (if that is even an accurate word for such a matter), then ultimately we rely on references that are not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and oftentimes fail to meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Synthesis of information to advance a position using sources that are tending tremendously towards disqualification for failure to be reliable is not an effort to build a better encyclopedia, but instead one to advocate a position. The undue weight clause of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> for this hypothesis is enforced on the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center_cfbf.html" title="Collapse of the World Trade Center">Collapse of the World Trade Center</a> article, yet here, the minority viewpoint is now the point of advocacy. Wikipedia suffers from systemic bias when we allow this type of article to exist as a fork advocacy article of information that fails to meet policy for inclusion in the main article. Mainstream political reality is meaningless and has nothing to do with an encyclopedia which exists to advance the known evidence that can be referenced by reliable sources.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 06:41, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I suggest we think of this article as being about "political reality" (i.e., culture) more than about "physical reality" (i.e., engineering). Again, that's why the subject of most of the sentences are people and ideas, not buildings and physical laws. It refers to something people are saying, and only indirectly to what they are talking about. (Unlike the main collapse article, which talks about the facts of the disaster.) None of this is obscure in the article, though the occasional sentence may not quite pass muster. In this sense, the idea that "mainstream policial reality is meaningless" and not of interest to an encyclopedia is of course simply wrong.

<dd>Reference 43 is a good example of one that is actually quite good but could be improved to be more informative. The sentence claims that some researchers make use of the oral histories of the events. It links to a researcher (Hoffman) who uses them (straightforward correct citation). Hoffman, in turn, has properly referenced his selection of quotes to the officially released oral histories, which have been published by the New York Times, a reliable source. That is, in this case we can say more than just "researches draw on oral histories", we can source those histories themselves to a reliable source.--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Basboll_a8ed.html" title="User:Thomas Basboll">Thomas Basboll</a> 08:33, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

The editorial time commitment to keep the main 9/11 conspiracy theories and the CD article both saying the same consistent, NPOV, RS things is arduous.

<dd>Well, it is incontrivertable that the theory exists, is believed in to some degree (according to constant poll results) by a significant portion of both American and international populations, and therefore "exists". So therefore the question is whether the article content is significant enough size wise to warrant a split. MONGO referenced approximately 1/4 of the listed references. However, many are primary sources about the theory, so they can be linked to as explanations of the theory. That does leave a possible portion of them up for debate--but thats not a deletion clause. For arguments' sake, if neutral, uninvolved individuals were to delete "in contest" content simply to see what was left, the existing article would be roughly 60%-70% of it's current size--altogether too big to merge into the original parent or grandparent, and therefore under policy due for a split.

<dd>I listed almost half the references as being unreliable and yes they establish notability, but they are all from websites that are unreliable for anything other than to be able to say...there a lot of websites that discuss controlled demolition. The problem is simply that no reliable websites, published engineer reports or even the media support the notion of controlled demolition, so since nothing reliable can be sourced, it isn't encyclopedic except to say that a lot of people believe this issue of controlled demolition.

<dd>I have and I strongly disagree with your interpretation and reading of this. Established, incontrovertable facts: <b>1)</b> The theory is notable in and of itself now due to the massive array of media coverage of it, the 911 Truthers, Jones, Scholars, et al. <b>2)</b> Many, many people believe in the existence of these theories and their basis, based on the various polls that constantly go around these days. <b>3)</b> The content simply is notabable enough for coverage on WP, and this seems to revolved around one camp saying x links aren't valid RS, and the other saying they are. <b>4)</b> #3 is not grounds for deletion. <b>5)</b> This was a pure fork of the parent, which then expanded--that's not a POV fork, thats what articles do. <b>6)</b> The parent is already too large. <b>7)</b> Proper procedure is to clean up this article as it is, not delete it. <b>8)</b> If the resulting article is too small, then it can be AfD'd for a merger. <b>9)</b> There is overwhelming concensus here for a keep, as displayed so far, based on all these facts. <b>10)</b> Above and beyond all these, for procedural reasons this AfD should be tossed as a close. The 1st AfD was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Controlled-Demolition_Theory_%289_11_Conspiracy_Theory%29_e95a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Controlled-Demolition Theory (9/11 Conspiracy Theory)">11 September 2006</a>, this one was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Controlled_demolition_hypothesis_for_the_collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center_fa15.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Controlled demolition hypothesis for the collapse of the World Trade Center">22 September 2006</a>.

<dd>I recently discovered that the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">guidelines on forking</a> say that <i>"since what qualifies as a 'POV fork' is itself based on a POV judgement, do not refer to forks as 'POV' — except in extreme cases of repeated vandalism."</i> Mongo, of course, does believe that this case constitutes an exception. The troubling thing is that he has now included my work on the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center_cfbf.html" title="Collapse of the World Trade Center">collapse of the World Trade Center</a> in his (somewhat implicit) history of the (presumably) "repeated vandalism" that allows him to refer to this article as a "POV fork". I encourage everyone to have a look at my edits on that article, and especially this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center/archive6" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center/archive6" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> talk archive to see how a consensus for the most controversial of them was built. If I understand Mongo's insinuation here then my work on the article between, say, July 20 and 26 (see<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center&amp;diff=65928158&amp;oldid=64930069" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center&amp;diff=65928158&amp;oldid=64930069" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>) constitutes an extreme case of POV-pushing, which despite the sweeping changes it brought about, left me so unsatisfied that I had to create another article to get all the things in there that were reverted by other editors. Obviously, there is no basis for that insinuation: the article's form and content is very much in line with what I was after and I have come to be very happy with the outcome. Like I say, I am really curious to see what the community's take on Mongo's arguments turns out to be. If they are taken to hold water then Wikipedia is something very different from what I thought it would be. It would mean that this extremely hostile editing environment is indicatitive of the norm, and is not an unfortunate (and hopefully temporary) lack of restraint on the part of what appears to be a perfectly good editor and administrator when working on topics he has a real fondness for and interest in.--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Basboll_a8ed.html" title="User:Thomas Basboll">Thomas Basboll</a> 21:10, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thomas, it seems very apparent from my previous workings with you, that had you been allowed to violate policy on the Collapse of the WTC article and create an article such as has been done here, you would have originally done so. You did seem to understand at that article why you couldn't have the links you want in this one...what better definition do you want of POV forking?--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 21:20, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Let me make this clearer. As I understand the guidelines, you need to identify a set of edits to the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center_cfbf.html" title="Collapse of the World Trade Center">Collapse of the World Trade Center</a> article that constitute vandalism, and <i>repeated</i> vandalism at that. Though it would not be sufficient, you need to identify the edits by which I tried to get those links into that article. (Like you say, I made no such attempts, because I had read the previous discussion and understood the consensus for that article.) You need to identify my <i>attempts</i> to violate policy, or retract your accusations about my <i>intent</i> to do so. Sources are reliable relative to the claim being made. Finally, sources that are not suitable for one kind of article may be suitable for another (obviously, I would think). But all this misses the main point: all these links were already in another article. The article was split because the WTC stuff was way too long, not because attempts to insert links were meeting resistance from you. The "extreme" conditions under which the guidelines allow you to accuse a split of being a "POV fork" don't seem to exist. Except in your peculiar interpretation of your "previous workings" with me. Again, I encourage anyone who wants to know about those workings to read our exchanges.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center/archive6" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center/archive6" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Basboll_a8ed.html" title="User:Thomas Basboll">Thomas Basboll</a> 21:56, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> For all the many good reasons already cited on here. My comment: It's amazing to see how many people shout out on this page to delete because they see it as "nonsense" and "cruft" and other derogatory descriptors. I expect most have never looked closely at the issue, but "know" to reject anything from the tin-foil hatters which they see this as a part of. They can't bear the thought of such information "spreading," as though it could "infect" more people. But what does any of that emotional bluster have to do with a neutral presentation of information? Seeing such a furious response to this topic makes it all the more clear how threatened most people who are calling for deletion actually must feel about this issue. Most don't calmly cite logical reasons, they are actually furious, and that comes out in their angry retortions. Why do people get <i>that</i> angry? Because the demolition hypotesis is a powerful threat to their perception of the world and represents something that most people would far prefer not to ever consider -- <i>"please just make that idea go away!"</i> -- so that their lives can go on as normal. This is a natural response. If it were indeed only "nonsense," say, a stream of letters which contained no meaning, there would be no such level of vicious statements about it as we see here. There would be annoyance, maybe the average blow up over a detail, but not such a level of war. Unfortunately, this makes the task of admins on this issue all the more superhuman -- to literally rise above the massive emotional response that all Americans have to the issue of 9/11 and examine the issue as though a living robot.

<dd>That your argument is the length of a dissertation does not make it correct. Precision and brevity is far better, but that does not make it correct either. Put very simply, if the text is no longer in the original article, except a summary paragraph, and if it has been split out into this article, there can be no fork. Instead it is a clerical exercise to split a lengthy article.

<dd>That reasoning is flawed. I have summarized why this is a POV fork, so I'll do it again.

So instead, it was put in the article <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a>. This article is a POV fork of the main article because this is the information that was disallowed in the main article..it just resides here now. Had some editors been allowed to put these unreliable sources in the main article, it would have looked a lot more like this one. You need to to understand what is a POV fork and what isn't. If this article were to have all the unreliable sources removed it what remained could then be reinserted back into the 9/11 conspiracy theories article. The 9/11 conspiracy theories article needs massive reduction of unrelaibale sources itself...all those sources are good for is to demonstrate that the theories are notable becuase their are a lot of websites out there, but those websites are controlled by only one or a few webmaster and are not relaibale witness since they are based on fiction.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 20:13, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, that reasoning is not flawed. The rebuttal you have just made is based on an incorrect starting assumption. It is very simple in reality. Split the article. No fork. Edit the split article down. Still no fork. Reduce any uncitable POV in the article, but not the aticle's commenary about the POV in the theeories. Still no fork. If you were correct I woudl agree with you.

<li>200 kilobytes per second? I'm impressed&#160;:) Seriously, I've missed it on the talk page. Could you please just link to it instead of saying "here"? About POV fork, I was not aware of this term but I think it is not right to believe that some articles would be subject to different guidelines than others. I think the forks are not to <b>allow</b> for cruft theories, unsourced, but to keep the main article readable, because elaboration of every doubt would destroy readability. To keep wikipedia consistent, however, the main article should be formulated cautiously where the Fork article would dig deeper into the specifics of the doubts.

<dd>I sort of see what you're driving at here, Mongo.

The move from Collapse of WTC to 9/11 CT was before my time. But the article we're discussing now (as many have noted above) could also have been reasonably created from scratch, at least today. It's a popular idea with notable proponents. But, like I say, I can see how the history of this problem might blind someone to seeing that. I think we will get this article onto a footing of RS, but I don't think it will ever get down to a size such that merging it will be the right thing to do. 9/11 CTs have many components, and are so broadly recognized today that presenting these components in detail and in their own articles does not give them undue weight. It just gives them the attention they deserve. I think the backstory you bring up here, while perhaps unfortunate (if accurate), may be obscuring the real reasons that this article is necessary. Anyway, thanks for clarifying.--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Basboll_a8ed.html" title="User:Thomas Basboll">Thomas Basboll</a> 21:08, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not to be a broken record, but if you take out the unreliable sources from this article and the 9/11 conspiracy theories article, you end up with maybe a 60kb article...which is bigger than the recommended size but smaller than many featured articles of which I have edited...if things are disqualifed from one article, they can't simply be placed in another due to them being POV and unreliable without it then becoming a POV fork...that is the definition of POV fork. Not being able to examine "closely enough" or whatever in the main article, evidence which is deemed unreliable, doesn't allow the creation of an article, even under a different name, that follows different rules than those that apply to all articles on Wikipedia. From <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">Wikipedia:Content forking</a>, "<i>A <b>content fork</b> is usually an unintentional creation of several separate articles all treating the same subject. A <b>POV fork</b> is a content fork deliberately created to avoid <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> guidelines, often to avoid or highlight negative or positive viewpoints or facts. Both content forks and POV forks are undesirable on Wikipedia, as they avoid consensus building and violate one of our most important policies.</i>" Please understand this guideline.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 21:27, 26 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You remind me of my best defense: "A POV fork is a content fork <i>deliberately created to avoid neutral point of view guidelines</i>." Since that was my not my intent when I created this article, this is not a POV fork. The intention is to produce an NPOV article on the controlled demolition hypothesis. Nothing about the split from 9/11 CTs to a separate article will avoid consensus building. On the contrary, its creator (me) is currently trying to build consensus for a focus and acceptable sources. Lastly, the CDH article will have much more information than either the 9/11 CT article or the WTC collapse article.--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Basboll_a8ed.html" title="User:Thomas Basboll">Thomas Basboll</a> 21:33, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's necessary to have a separate article to cover the subject in detail. This is quite normal. It is not a POV fork, because it does not advocate a biased interpretation of another article. It gives a balanced interpretation, but a fuller one, of a small part of another article. It's a subject that's known about worldwide, so wiki needs to be an authoratitive and accurate source on it (as on anything else) if it is to be a leading work. To do anything else, is against the interests of building a comprehensive encyclopedia. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 23:52, 26 September 2006 (UTC) (I do not believe the US govt is responsible for 9/11)
<dl>
<dd>No, it is not necessary to have such an article, and the proponents of this theory are pushing for a separate article simply to boost its importance. Given that the only major external direct treatment is in one New Yorker piece (which, incidentally, goes into far less detail than it does here), and some allusive references in some rebuttal pieces, it is not at all clear that this subject warrants an individual article. Moreover, absent a reliable secondary source, saying "the New Yorker mentioned this guy, and Bazant alluded to another, so we should synthethize them into one theory" is a patent violation of NOR. --<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 00:19, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please avoid speculation about people's motives and <i>ad hominem</i> comments, unless you can prove what you allege. The theory of controlled demolition is well known about. I've certainly heard about it, and I'm not particularly interested in the subject. Haven't you heard about it, prior to reading this article? Wiki is a source of knowledge.

<dd>Ditto, for the curious--I argue because I honestly believe it's notable enough and with enough coverage to merit a standalone article, and the previous arguments of delete for lack of validity can be discounted utterly: if we delete unprovable theories/ideas, then all religous articles are gone. For deletion based on NPOV/POV--this has been demonstrated as not a fork, and POV editorial issues are never a deletion reason anyway; it's a reason to edit and do the only thing we are here to do: build the encyclopedia. Questions of no interest, lack of interest, etc., are dispelled by these simple searches, proving notability. And for what it's worth, I think the towers were brought down by 15 radical terrorists that <i>both</i> the current and previous US administrations did not do enough to counter ahead of time, simply from organizational complacency. "They don't do things <i>here"</i>, and so forth. I think the only valid conspiracy is that a young John F.

<dd>Any topic which has an "article" will have significantly higher Google search response over time for any search matching the name of that search. This is due to WP's massive Google ranking, and the fact the interconnected nature of the Wiki boosts it in turn. Any page that has few wikilinks into it will do worse; those with more into it do significantly better. It would be a violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> to assume or say that people want the article gone to keep general public access to the information that may or may not be in the article minimized in terms of public exposure, due to this.

<dd>Yes I agree that bias needs to be stopped and that's one big reason to delete this article. Notability of subjects like this that require reliable references from the engineering community and other experts demonstrate that aside from a few that have yet to publish a scientific treatise on the issue, it completely fails notability aside from a bunch of POV websites that have no editorial review from outside parties. These websites can produce whatever nonsense they wish. We have an encyclopedic article at Collapse of the World Trade Center...and this one has a lot of the "references" that failed notability there, so they do so here as well. When the consensus doesn't agree to having some information in one article and then it shows up in another that looks at the same issue, that is a POV fork...it's very plain.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 06:03, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What we are saying is that the premise of the article is OR. There are a few self-published sources (Jones and Hoffman) making these claims, who blatanly fail WP:RS. The New Yorker article mentions such a hypothesis, but does not treat the elements of the "hypothesis" in detail. Just because these people and their beliefs are ALLUDED to in reliable sources DOES NOT open the door to using them as primary sources. There is no collective "Controlled demolition hypothesis"; there are merely a number of theories and questions foisted by members of the conspiracy theory (or truth) movement which can be discussed. If you wish to collect these theories together, great. Blogspot's got plenty of webspace.</p>
<p>There is no "Controlled demolition hypothesis", not as advanced by any reliable source. There are people who believe "Controlled demolition hypothe<b>ses</b>" of one sort or another, but they do not collectively make fodder for an article.</p>
<p>Reliable sources state "there are people who believe the building was brought down by controlled demolition". There are self-published sources that explain the reasoning and rationale for such a belief. The synthesis clause of NOR prevents us from using the former as a gateway toward inclusion of the latter. It's that simple. The 9/11 conspiracy article is the natural place to explain the former; nobody is saying that there aren't people that believe in controlled demolition. That's as far as the reliable sources go. None of them advance the theory and there is no place on wiki for delving into self-published and other such sources to fill that gap, which this article is an invitation towards. --<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 06:42, 27 September 2006 (UTC)--<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 06:42, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

If you take the nonsense out of this article, you get about 5 kbs left...and that's about it (of course the mainstream references in the article that are only there as refutation of the CD argument wouldn't be needed hardly at all).

<dd>Appealing to other articles as some sort of "precedent" is a false argument.

If all that were available were Simpsons references and CNN news snippets, yes it would be worth deleting. What would there be to say? "CNN reports alleged sightings of bigfoot; the Simpsons parodied it"?

<li><b>Comment on "self-published" sources</b>: It is false to suggest that Jones is "self-published". His paper has been published in a book edited by Peter Dale Scott and David Ray Griffin (Olive Branch Press/Interlink). There is plenty of non-self-published material to work with, BTW: Griffin's paper on the WTC was published in <i>The Hidden History of 9-11</i> by Elsevier. Tarpley's <i>Synthetic Terror</i> is published by Progressive Press.

<li><b>Keep</b> I was talking elsewhere about this. I see a lot of POV pushing on both sides based on people's beliefs. Some think these conspiracy things are non-sense and unpatriotic. Some think that the government did this and that the people who want to delete it work for the government as CIA/Homeland Security/Majestic 12 at Area 51. Basicaly my reasoning is simple. To some extent the conspiracy stuff is notable. How notable and to which article I don't know. But the main thing is that if an article gets too long it should be split. This one article itself is HUGE (I didn't read it). The voting page is HUGE. The references on it is 105. If it could be slimmed down to a stub, I would vote to have the content moved to something else. But it is so freaking LOOOONG the article itself probably should be split into two articles just so it's not too long. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnomo_6299.html" title="User:Anomo">Anomo</a> 10:39, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Just a couple of observations and a summary at this late hour. The concensus in pure concensus terms is significantly more in the Keep side rather than any other (yes, AfD is not a vote, but yes also that the much larger majority clearly believes the article has merit and legs based on this). All the delete reasons seem to be one of four points: 1) That the article should be deleted as non-notable (beyond disproven); 2) the theory itself needs validation from qualified sources to merit inclusion (absolutely inappropriate deletion reason--many articles in scientifically unproven theories ranging from God to Bigfoot exist); 3) POV fork (this is highly disputed and refuted); 4) various scattered reasons which it is not a violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> to say are clearly based on personal reasons, rather than policy (all of them can be safely discounted--I respect ones' personal beliefs, but they are not appropriate for consideration or discussion relevant to Main article space matters). And again, this already passed AfD <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Controlled-Demolition_Theory_%289/11_Conspiracy_Theory%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Controlled-Demolition_Theory_%289/11_Conspiracy_Theory%29" rel="nofollow">once as a keep</a>, exactly <i>10 days</i> before this AfD. You cannot rerun an AfD until you get the desired result, and subsequent AfDs before at least 4-6 months after this one should be closed immediately on disruption grounds. <a href="../../../c/c/c/WP%7ECCC_b716.html" title="WP:CCC">WP:CCC</a> is not applicable or appropriate either as concensus cannot trump or overrule the 5 Pillars of Wikipedia, and the notability and validity of the article under policy has been established already once. · <font color="#0518A7"><b>XP</b></font> · 15:00, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> There is an argument that the "theory" in this article is nonsense, or that it cannot be proved scientifically, and therefore there should not be an article about it. This is not a basis for not having an article, if the subject itself is widely known about. As I've pointed out above it has received mainstream UK press coverage. If it is nonsense or unproven, that is a basis for an article that communicates these things, and therefore serves wiki's purpose of being informative and authoritative, as is done with other possibly comparable subjects.

<dd>The article is covered in accordance with the undue weight provision of NPOV already over in the Collapse of the World Trade Center article. The reason undue weight applies to this subject is that there is indeed a scientifically and correctly evauluated body of research that completely refutes the lack of scientific evidence that controlled demolition happened...it doesn't do this in a direct rebuttal format but it doesn't need to since there is no evidence to refute. It makes a passing mention, in accordance with undue weight...this article therefore, which has information that was unreliable is a POV fork. Should this article be erroneously kept, all mention of this nonsense will have to disappear from the main article aside from a link to be in accordance with policy. XP keeps talking about the majority, what majority? I see some people who want to violate policy and keep this article, but I see no majority anywhere, and if fact, the majority, definitely demonstrate either a desire to delete this article, or have weak reasons for keeping it.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 15:56, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>While a demonstration (of a negative) may indeed be impossible, I think it's pretty easy to see, if you look at the split and the justifications offered for it on the talk pages, along with the recent edit histories that pertain to the WTC section (of the 9/11 conspiracy article at the time), that it was not carried out in reaction to any POV conflicts. It didn't try to avoid such conflicts; it was simply an attempt to clean up. So I think the burden of proof is on you Mongo. You've tried to identify possible motives by going back to something that happened on the WTC collapse article long ago. But you have not successfully shown that those were my motives, or that those motives will guide the development of the newly split article. In fact, everything since "controlled demolition" was introduced in the WTC collapse article in its present form indicates that you're dealing with reasonable people doing their best to present controversial material in an NPOV manner.

<dd>Thomas, you essentially rewrote the Collapse of the WTC article, unfettered for the most part, and evn endorsed by myself and others. It was made clear then that most of the questionable references I have listed previously here, we're disallowed in that article, yet now they are here, a repository of links that were unacceptable there. The controlled demolition "hypothesis" is a fabrication that is only supported by these questionable links and the basis of the information was originally on the 9/11 conspiracy theories article, yet was moved here, re-termed as a hypothesis (which is isn't) and then the article goes on to use, multiple times, the work of a gentleman who is currently under adminstrative leave pending a review of his work, which, as evidence supports, has not been adequately peer reviewed or published by a reliable and neutral third party organization...it was published by an unreliable and biased organization as it helps them to promote their conspiracy theory. This article is a POV fork of the main one which you rewrote. Once the unreliable info is taken out of this article, you end up with a stub. About all you can say on the matter and be reliable is: <i>Controlled demolition issues regarding the collapse of the WTC were examined by NIST and the conclusion was that no evidence exists to support the hypothesis. There have abeen several engineers and one phycists that have stated that the collapse of the WTC could have or looks as though it was due to controlled demolition, yet this has not been sanctinoned by the engineering community as a whole and no relaibale published material has been produced regarding the issue.</i>...that&#160;;s the whole ballgame, and trying to stretch it out into something is isn't by using unreliable sources is not in keeping with policy. It deserves a passing mention, at best, and that is what it gets in the article you yourself rewrote.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 20:45, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is realy simple. We have an admin who has not been involved in the discussion and who has volunteered to close this discussion. Since no-one would take on this task lightly it follows that the result is likely to be based on sound assessment of the Wikipedia policies together with the content of the article itself, the various arguments put forward here, a judgement about <u>content fork</u> vs <u>POV fork</u> (valid and desirable vs deprecated and deletable). Since the closure of this nomination is subject to scrutiny at so many levels the closing statement is likely to be more than a single "keep" or "Delete". And it is most unlikely to be based upon a "vote". I think complaining about our volunteer because one person has said "Seems impartial to me" is probably human nature, but is not wholly helpful. After all, we have so many systems in place for scrutiny that it would not matter, except transiently, if this person were biased as biased could be, though I have every expectation that is not the case.

<p>No, the article has links that were not permitted by policy in the Collapse of the WTC article, and the split of this article from 9/11 conspiracy theories was not supported by consensus to do so.

<dd>"POV fork" is perhaps the most misused term on Wikipedia, and I'm certain that you're misusing it here. We both know that this article came into being because <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a> was too long - which makes this a content, not a POV, fork. Look, it's inevitable that 9/11 conspiracy theories, and anything forked from that page, is going to have a different POV from other articles about 9/11, and anything forked from those pages. But the existence of articles that present different POVs about the same material does not imply the existence of a POV fork - because if that were true, no mention whatsoever of alternate viewpoints about anything would be allowed on Wikipedia. You couldn't have <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism%27s_view_of_Jesus_f709.html" title="Judaism's view of Jesus">Judaism's view of Jesus</a> or <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27a_view_of_Abu_Bakr_900c.html" title="Shi'a view of Abu Bakr">Shi'a view of Abu Bakr</a> or <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kennedy_assassination_theories.html" title="Kennedy assassination theories">Kennedy assassination theories</a>. Is that how you really want to interpret the term "POV fork"? --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 05:58, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Don't be ridiculous...how many articles does this seies of conspiracy theories deserve? I feel that one is enough and that one si the one we have at 9/11 conspiracy theories. Collapse of the world trade center had a redirect to the 9/11 CT article section on this article. Basboll did a fine job rewriting the Collapse article, but consensus was to not have all these links (link farm) in that article, so now they are here...that's a POV fork.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 06:09, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What's ridiculous is the idea that a group of editors carrying a content dispute from one article to another pre-existing article would retroactively make the latter article a "POV fork." If those editors started adding those links to, for example, <a href="../../../7/_/w/7_World_Trade_Center_db3e.html" title="7 World Trade Center">7 World Trade Center</a>, should we then delete that page as a "POV fork"? Simply, content disputes are solved through the editorial process, not AfD. Yes, we're aware that you think there should be only one article on 9/11 conspiracy theories; it also seems plain that the community does not agree with you. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 06:20, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> You got to use quotation marks and targetted terms when searching google or google news or google whatever.

<li><b>Reply</b> fair enough. with quotaion marks, it still gets well over 60 newspaper articles, including the washington post and several major city dailys, and is carried on the upi wire service. (it also gets +400 unique non-news hits). that meets my standards. i frankly don't see what's bad about providing information on what's clearly a reasonably large event, as indicated by the geographical breadth of the coverage). isn't that what we're supposed to do: provide neutral information about things people care about? people seem to care about this, as evidenced by widespread coverage. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 08:07, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The sole purpose of this article seems to be to draw a distinction between the definition of the word "religion" and the word "mythology". Wikipedia is not a dictionary or usage guide, so this seems dubious. Of course there are huge variances in opinion on that issue, especially because "myth" has the connotation of "false" for many people. There are complaints on the talk page that this page does not treat this topic in a neutral fashion, and that it was created as a POV fork of the explanation given on <a href="../../../m/y/t/Mythology.html" title="Mythology">mythology</a>. Given that both <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a> and <a href="../../../m/y/t/Mythology.html" title="Mythology">mythology</a> are defined or at least explained in their respective articles, and can refer to each other as needed, this third article seems spurious. <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 00:35, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I do not see where this article does not meet the notibility test? This is a viable and ligitimate organization. I am sorry Wikipediatrix, but you seem to rely on Google for an aweful lot of your resourcing and Google has not been found to be the most reliable source for information. There are plenty of references to this organization and I do not feel it needs to be deleted. Would deleting this article make it any less true that this organization exsists or has a rightful place in the field of Christian music? Hmmm. We might want to ponder that.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article should be rewritten I agree, but it seems there's some amount of personal bias going into the nomination and all of the "vanity" attacks.

<dd>The question is, whether he's well-known by word-of-mouth, or whether there are verifiable print references from credible sources, which prove his notability. If there are, then by all means, please provide links. But simply <i>saying</i> that someone is well-known, is not sufficient.

<dd>The page itself lists his credentials - Pro Wrestling Torch, Figure Four Weekly, Puroresu Power Hour, and so forth. If <i>print</i> is the key aspect of this debate, it should be noted the F4W newsletter is printed and delivered to tens of thousands of subscribers all around the world every single week. I'm not saying Dr. Keith Lipinski is as famous as Dave Meltzer or Bryan Alvarez, but I am saying he's more than Joe Schmoe on the street and the caliber of guests on his radio show (top wrestlers from Japan to the US to Europe) speak volumes about how <i>known</i> he is.

<p><b>Nomination for deletion</b> I'm sure this publication is a worthy showcase of Haverfordian artistic talents.

<dd>The one Times review of the Carnegie Hall performance is largely sufficient for me. Furthermore, I didn't have to search very hard for the link since despite your denials it was a source in the article.

<dd>Great so he played one time with a bunch of other performers and sounded good with Wayne college, and Long Island performers.

<dd>If you are sincerely interested in Mr. Kendrick's career, please read the article and follow the links. You will see that this "choir teacher" is far more accomplished than you are willing to acknowledge and has been actively touring. In the meantime, by repeatedly selectively misquoting a bolded passage from the Times - that was actually attributed to a musicians union protesting the use of foreign performers - you are seriously demeaning your argument. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 02:21, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>1) The article states "Mr. Kendrick debuted in Carnegie Hall with the Verdi Requiem in 1995" with a NY Times article linked.</dd>

<dd>3) Then the article continues: "The <b>performance of the Verdi Requiem on Saturday evening showed that the union may have a point.</b> Although the orchestra's strings produced a unified, warm sound, its winds were lackluster, and its brass players muddled their big moment at the start of the Tuba mirum. The performance, conducted by <b>Donald Kendrick</b>, was surprisingly leisurely; only the most overtly dramatic sections had any real drive."</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>:'Oldest Anglican cathedral in Canada' asserts notability. <i>An important ecclesiastical centre for the Niagara Peninsula, Christ Church was erected in stages, its form altered as the size and prominence of the congregation increased. Begun in 1835 as a parish church, the frame building was expanded in 1852-54 with the addition of a stone chancel and nave extension designed by the renowned Toronto architect William Thomas. The present nave, fashioned by Henry Langley, a specialist in church architecture noted for his masterly High Victorian Gothic designs, was completed in 1876, a year after Christ's Church was designated the cathedral for the newly-formed Diocese of Niagara. Although the building has undergone various alterations and renovations since then, notably the extension of the chancel in 1924-25 it retains its handsome 19th-century character.</i> Source: <a href="http://www.waynecook.com/ahamilton-wentworth.html" class="external free" title="http://www.waynecook.com/ahamilton-wentworth.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.waynecook.com/ahamilton-wentworth.html</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnbrownsbody_afca.html" title="User:Johnbrownsbody">Johnbrownsbody</a> 02:50, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>One does wonder why this cathedral article in particular is singled out for deletion when it is part of a series on Anglican cathedrals in Canada — and no, I did not create that list; I did rename it from a somewhat cumbersome earlier title. Are cathedrals not inherently notable? At least that which is the second oldest in Canada, the oldest in anglophone Canada and one of only three pre-Confederation Upper Canada/Canada West cathedrals? The issue of older colonial buildings existing in the USA is of questionable relevance: anglophone Canada is of much more recent establishment. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasalai_b16e.html" title="User:Masalai">Masalai</a> 19:20, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am familiar with WP:AGF, thank you <i>very</i> much. It does <i>not</i> mean to assume good faith in spite of all evidence to the contrary. The use of the term "sect" is at <i>best</i> unfortunate and misleading. I am curious as to what this "widely used sense" is: Wiktionary provides one definition - "A cult or religious movement, a group sharing particular (often unorthodox) political and/or religious beliefs." The <i>connotation</i> here is quite strong, even if the <i>denotation</i> could be argued to be harmless. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarolynparrishfan_61da.html" title="User:Carolynparrishfan">Carolynparrishfan</a> 17:58, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

Deleting it as collateral punishment for <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_M._Kendrick_8627.html" title="Donald M. Kendrick">Donald M.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I disagree in part. There were no apparent sources that could be found to improve the article based on my cursory search. In addition, I disagree with this Cathedral="notable by default" theory that has sprung up in this discussion. I think it is biased in favor of religious institutions that have Bishops and could very well lead to a situation where Cathedrals that aren't very notable are kept "over" individual parishes that are more notable. When there is no apparent basis for notability, bringing an article in for AfD discussion is the only responsible thing to do if you ask me. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErechtheus_2543.html" title="User:Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a> 23:13, 26 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Sorry, but I completely disagree with this. Any major church, whether of an episcopal denomination or not, is notable (we have many articles on churches which are not cathedrals). But cathedrals can easily be defined as notable for being the mother church of a diocese and usually (not always, but usually) pretty large. Nobody is saying that the churches of episcopal denominations are more notable than the churches of other denominations, but only those denominations have a group of churches that are defined as inherently notable in this way, so it makes sense to define cathedrals as a class as notable buildings. Like it or not, people are interested in cathedrals. When I visit a new city, the cathedral is always the first place I head for. And I'm not religious in the slightest - I just like fine buildings. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 23:33, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>The first problem with this line of analysis is that this is not a list, but an article. Now that, of course, can be resolved by renaming it, and if this article is kept, it should be renamed. As to your second point, it is doubtful that this list will ever be complete, so it remains random due to its incompleteness. Furthermore, it is indescriminate whether complete or not, as the items on the list have no relation to each other except that they all happen to be fictional. As for usefulness, how is it useful? Articles relating to each individual fictional universe undoubtably already has this kind of information, so it is not useful in that sense. Any one looking for a specific ship or type of ship in wikipedia are unlikely to look up a list named "starship class" or "fictional starship class." I cannot fathom that anyone would need to see all this information in one place, and even if they did, it would still fail <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 03:16, 23 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's an article versus a list? I'm afraid I don't see the difference. You'll have to explain what you mean. And I'm sorry, but it's pretty obvious to me what the conection of the items are is, they are all classes of Starships in various fictional environments. Now you may think the entries are random, but that's not true at all. They are all spaceships from more or less notable series, grouped by series. Given that people are most likely to do what they know first, and what attracts interest to them, I completely expect such things to go first. Yes, it's not very systematic, but somewhat haphazard. That's the nature of Wikipedia sometimes. That's also why I agree it's doubtful the list will ever be complete, as I doubt that Wikipedia will ever be complete. People are creating new content every day, but I doubt it's increasing at the same pace of new things to include are. However, I point to this example of people wanting to look at Starships <a href="http://www.merzo.net/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.merzo.net/" rel="nofollow">[36]</a> presented as a visual comparison to size. If people want to do that(Slashdot and Sci-Fi Weekly both gave it a nod)), I can easily imagine someone wanting to look at it on Wikipedia. I certainly think it's useful. Perhaps some people might work backwards from it as well, if they're looking to compare several classes or genres. It's certainly no less useful than numerous other lists. You may not find it useful, I however, disagree. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 04:26, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Not only are the first sentences original thought, they are not even provably true. Show me one place in a Star Wars, Star Trek, Firefly, Battlestar Galactica, etc. source where any of the following is stated, and I quote from the article: "By tradition, [a class] are [<i>sic'</i>] named after its first ship, known as the lead or class ship. Classes of starships, like their naval counterparts, are used to save effort and money; it's considerably easier and cheaper to build multiple units to the same design than to develop a unique plan for every individual starship. It also simplifies maintenance, training, and procurement of spares (not inconsiderable factors for any service)." While this is certainly ture when it comes to the real world, no proof exists that any of it is true in these fictional universes. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 05:36, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hmm, so what you're saying is that the information is transference from the real world? Sorry, but I don't see how that fits the criteria of original thought. It does for example, apply to Star Trek, if you look at some of the technical books for it, like the Star Trek Encyclopedia (or see <a href="http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/library/ships/article/71885.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/library/ships/article/71885.html" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> for something on the web.

I can accept some distancing from it, since it may not be true in every case, and I did try to reword the statement accordingly, but I'm sorry I just cannot concur with you that it's original research.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This is PRECISELY what Wikipedia is good at. Our strength is in chronicling those corners of popular culture which might not end up in any "real" (ie, formally published) encylopedia, but are of major interest to users in certain fields. this page serves another vital role of such articles; ie, it serves as a forum and convergence point for fans of one genre through many different works, shows, franchises, etc, etc. Therefore, i feel strongly that we should keep this. Why shouldn't this be worth keeping precisely because of the people most interested in it, precisely as it is, such as, for example, science-fiction fans, budding writers, or those interested in the broad shape and pattern of speculative fiction, etc?</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as chewcruft. Actually, I wouldn't mind a representative list of <i>kinds</i> of gum added to <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chewing_gum.html" title="Chewing gum">chewing gum</a>, but a list of <i>flavors</i> is, in my opinion, not encyclopedic. Furthermore, this is a list of the <i>names</i> of flavors, not an attempt to taxonomize the flavors themselves. Is "Cherry Chill" really different from "Cherry"? And what the heck flavor is "Blue Blowout"?

<li><b>Keep</b> I disagree that this article constitutes indiscriminate information (and it falls under none of the categories listed on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" rel="nofollow">policy page</a>. The article is directly related to other articles in wikipedia (we have articles on <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chewing_gum.html" title="Chewing gum">chewing gum</a> itself, as well as on individual brands like <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altoids.html" title="Altoids">altoids</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trident_gum.html" title="Trident gum">Trident gum</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/b/Bubblicious.html" title="Bubblicious">Bubblicious</a>, etc., and flavors like <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spearmint.html" title="Spearmint">spearmint</a> and <a href="../../../b/u/b/Bubblegum.html" title="Bubblegum">bubblegum</a>). The information is also completely verifiable. Note that there are also related lists also in existence, like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_chewing_gum_brands.html" title="List of chewing gum brands">List_of_chewing_gum_brands</a>. It's certainly as encyclopedic as many of the other lists on Wikipedia. It wasn't created just for the sake of creating a list. There are a lot of people who actively follow the chewing gum/candy/mint market, collect containers (like Altoids tins or tic tac boxes), and are interested in buying gum *across* the range of brands, not just within a particular brand. As a result this is actually a useful list for many people. The fact that Wikipedia has so many articles on individual flavors and brands demonstrates that fact in part. Ideally, it would be a section on the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chewing_gum.html" title="Chewing gum">chewing gum</a> page, except that it's clearly too long for that. If there were only, say, 12 chewing gum flavors in existence, nobody here would have a problem with listing them on the chewing gum page. But the list has become too long to be a sub-section, so it really needs its own article at this point. It is fairly comprehensive, although obviously not complete, and I'm the first to admit it needs some work. There are lists on wikipedia seemingly more trivial (i won't bother listing them here. you've all seen them). In many ways, a list of flavors of gum is analagous to a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_genres_of_music.html" title="List of genres of music">List of genres of music</a>. It's true, they aren't taxonomized, but that's more of a reason to improve or reorganize the page than it is a reason to delete it. Also, yes, the flavors are "marketing-speak" to some degree, but so are brand-names (what does "Altoids" or "Kraft" really tell you about the products those companies manufacture and sell?) or book titles, and we certainly have lists of those. Also, somewhat as an aside, "marketing-speak" is actually of interest to many people. Although admittedly the consensus so far is to delete, that alone isn't reason to delete an article, i really think i've addressed the relevant issues here. -<a href="../../../b/i/n/User%7EBindingtheory_054a.html" title="User:Bindingtheory">Bindingtheory</a> 00:12, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The thing is, we have standards here, and we can't go around and make exceptions like that. Just because someone "worked" hard to create the articles does not mean that they are instantly notable or should be kept. Yes, the show has a fair amount of hype, but that doesn't mean that the show will be sucessful. I think it's best to delete/merge the articles until it can be assumed that the characters are notable (if ever). <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiant_onehead_ca40.html" title="User:Giant onehead">Giant onehead</a> 13:38, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My point is what's the big deal about waiting one month? Many articles are listed as stubs with only 2-3 sentences and they are kept sitting around for months "in case someone decides to expand it". One month won't kill anybody. Regarding "we have standards", "Wikipedia is not a beaucracy." It isn't necessary to make a decision immediately--monitoring relevant external events for a short period is the best approach. <b><a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickReinckens_8aaa.html" title="User:RickReinckens">RickReinckens</a> 02:27, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</b>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Well, you're wrong, simple as that. There is a problem waiting another month or so as we can't just make exceptions for articles. Odds are, the article will be merged or such, and if it's certified as a notable show to allow character pages, then perhaps they can be recreated at a later date. WP is not a crystal ball, and we can't just forcast what is notable. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiant_onehead_ca40.html" title="User:Giant onehead">Giant onehead</a> 04:32, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I really don't think the reasoning for this vote is valid. Yes, it did get decent ratings, but that doesn't mean that the show would be kept long-term at this point. And Lost and Desperate Housewives are confirmed hits and have been around for a few years, this show has only aired one episode and probably got the high ratings mainly on curiosity and the fact that Grey's Anatomy was on afterwards. Even a show like <a href="../../../w/e/_/We_Got_it_Made_c419.html" title="We Got it Made">We Got it Made</a> got pretty high ratings at first, but that show got dumped fairly quickly, and not even all of the actors on the show have articles, let alone characters. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiant_onehead_ca40.html" title="User:Giant onehead">Giant onehead</a> 20:07, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

The previous versions of this show have had at least moderate (often great) success in many other countries, including Russia, Spain, Columbia, and Mexico. Also, with the large Latino population in the United States, there are many people within the country who are familiar with the show already. While the jury is out on how it will fare in the US, I think that given its previous track record, the hype surrounding the show, and the great ratings it has recieved so far, so what's the harm in simply merging them with the Ugly Betty page and going from there in a month or so?

<li><b>Comment</b> I hate that I'm making so many comments on this issue, but I'll make some more. I really don't understand where people think that initial good ratings mean that the show is an instant hit or is instantly notable or what. I'm not suprised that the ratings were alright for the premiere (not a "giantic success", but respectible), there was a lot of hype and the premise was unique and it has Grey's Anatomy following it. Who knows what the ratings will end up next week? Even a show like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Single_Guy_c5da.html" title="The Single Guy">The Single Guy</a> always had decent ratings based on lead-ins and such, and I don't see any characters getting pages for that show. I'll make a compromise and <b>Withdraw</b> <a href="../../../b/e/t/Betty_Suarez_4cb6.html" title="Betty Suarez">Betty Suarez</a> from consideration for deletion. Even if the show got cancelled tommorow, the hype and buzz about the character make her notable for WP for sure. I still stand by that the other articles nominated should be merged/deleted. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiant_onehead_ca40.html" title="User:Giant onehead">Giant onehead</a> 04:32, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> Jim Douglas: Yes, this article has been written by the subject. I don't mind if you delete it, I'm not trying to achieve glory and recognition by submitting this article to Wikipedia. I was just submitting my BIO to Living Russian Poets, that’s it... Unfortunately in our time, most of the work published on Internet, in different languages and form, so “Notability” is the question. Are you “Notable” if you receive more than 100s emails a day from your fans? Do I really need Wiki for that? Was just wandering that you decided to delete it now, after this article been published for 6 month.</li>
<li><b>Reply</b> Lilith angel: I honestly have no axe to grind here. I was clicking the 'Random article' link and this article happened to come up. The first thing I noticed was that the external <a href="http://www.voronoy.com" class="external text" title="http://www.voronoy.com" rel="nofollow">link</a> was for a personal photo site. That seemed a bit unusual, so I spent a few minutes looking around on google, and the only other link I could find was <a href="http://www.lulu.com/voronoy" class="external text" title="http://www.lulu.com/voronoy" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I was wondering, though; wouldn't readers of <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://ru.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">ru.wikipedia.org</a> be more likely to be interested in Russian-language poetry? -- <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Douglas_5faf.html" title="User:Jim Douglas">Jim Douglas</a> 22:55, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b>Jim Douglas: It’s funny, but you hit my site right at the moment I was updating it. It is not personal photo site, but artists home. I just left the photos, since I have been asked by fans to keep photos while I do maintenance of the site. Look at the article again.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article isn't a strategy guide, since it doesn't teach how to make the decks; if it was a strategy guide, it would say "The perfect aggro deck is: and give a list of cards. Nor is it original research, because there's websites such as Pojo.com and some about.com websites that explain what these decks are and how to build them. I think that if the sections can get expanded, this will be a good article. HOWEVER, I think this shouldn't have the word "strategies" in the title, but rather just be called List of Yu-Gi-Oh! Deck Formats.</li>
</ul>
<p>P.S. If you're going to delete this article, don't stop at just this! Here's two other articles that are quite similar to this one: <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tank_%28computer_gaming%29.html" title="Tank (computer gaming)">Tank (computer gaming)</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munchkin_%28role-playing_games%29.html" title="Munchkin (role-playing games)">Munchkin (role-playing games)</a>; they are similar in that they teach about different styles, or strategies if you must, about MMORPG's and RPG's. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperDT_9076.html" title="User:SuperDT">SuperDT</a> 04:54, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't see any similarity whatsoever, other than all three articles are about games.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> They are similar in that they explain about different styles of playing a particular game; for example, the tank article is a how-to guide on how to "tank" in MMORPG's, and the Munchkin one tells how to play as an underestimated character. The article you nominated tells about different styles of play that Yu-Gi-Oh players use. Second, I'm not sure how this(The article you nominated) is a how-to guide, could you please enlighten me? <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperDT_9076.html" title="User:SuperDT">SuperDT</a> 18:14, 1 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> "Tank" and "munchkin" are common enough terms in gaming in general to merit having an article explaining their meaning and source; this article just explains how decks differ from each other using fan-based terms, with no sources whatsoever. "Aggro deck" has no meaning outside of MTG variant type games. Instead of trying to get the article kept as is (which it obviously won't), why don't you add some sources, or (better) consider a transwiki. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 01:30, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I guess I will try and find some sources, and make this article better, but you still haven't answered my question: how is this article a how-to guide? These are how-to guides: Aggro deck, Combo Deck, Control deck, and Midgame deck.</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. This is an obvious case of misinterpretation of Wikipedia policy. We all agree that Wikipedia should not include game guides - that is, articles where there are instructions, hints, guides, tips, and other text where the article generally instructs the reader how to play the game. What Wikipedia is here for is to state facts and other reference information - and that is all this article does. It is also all the other articles do that this user has put up for deletion. I would really like to know what separates this article from any other game related article. How does this qualify as a game guide? If this article was merged into <a href="../../../m/o/d/Battlefield_2%7E_Modern_Combat_912c.html" title="Battlefield 2: Modern Combat">Battlefield 2: Modern Combat</a>, would that article also be a game guide? A LOT of articles are being put up for deletion by this user, and if they get deleted because of a complete misinterpretation of Wikipedia policy then a lot of work will be wasted. Please consider voting on the other AfD's that this user has decided to start (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Battlefield_2_Awards_d172.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Battlefield 2 Awards">here</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Table_of_ranks_in_Battlefield_2_1fad.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Table of ranks in Battlefield 2">here</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Songhua_Stalemate_417b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Songhua Stalemate">here</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Dalian_Plant_19f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Dalian Plant">here</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Strike_at_Karkand_985c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Strike at Karkand">here</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Great_Wall_%28Battlefield_2_map%29_2c58.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Great Wall (Battlefield 2 map)">here</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Ranking_system_in_Battlefield_2%7E_Modern_Combat_92df.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ranking system in Battlefield 2: Modern Combat">here</a>). <a href="../../../r/e/m/User%7ERemy_B_eda6.html" title="User:Remy B">Remy B</a> 03:14, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Transwiki if required and <b>Redirect</b> to Battlefield 2 article. Lists such as these are game guide material as they're exactly what you'd find on GameFAQs and of no relevance to those who don't play the game already. Until someone sits down and actually plays the game, how can they compare the difficulty in accomplishing these tasks?. Why would gaining 'insert award here' mean anything to them? Talking about these things, what kind of requirements players would need to pass etc. is useful information.

<li><b>Comment</b>, "Old Baldy" already appears in multiple volumes of the printed press; she is already noted. Agreed that both the section on the type of vessel "Friendship sloop" needs expansion, but that does not preclude documenting individual vessels much in the same way that the U.S.S. Enterprise has a separate history apart from the class of ships known as "aircraft carriers". Friendship Sloops were contemporary working vessels of the famous Glouchester Grand Banks fishing schooners some of which are used as yachts and cruising ships today."Jwilsonnh 23:31, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>2) Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable).</p>
<p>3) Has been featured in multiple non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media (excludes things like school newspapers, personal blogs, etc...). – numerous press articles in Honolulu Advertiser &amp; Honolulu Star Bulletin – see google reference cited under Christian New Age references</p>

<p>Revisiting the above arguments note that <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> states, "A musician or ensemble (note that this includes a band, singer, rapper, orchestra, hip hop crew, DJ, musical theatre group, etc.) is notable if it meets <i><u><b>any one</b></u></i> of the following criteria". These are three of the cited criteria that are met--1) Robert ÆOLUS Myers' tour to Spain which included the Expo '92 in Seville does not have readily available web citations, though hard copy information could be supplied in verification; 2) <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Robert+%C3%86OLUS+Myers%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Robert+%C3%86OLUS+Myers%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Relevant Google search</a> as cited above derives a number of citations corroborating Robert ÆOLUS Myers' inclusion in Global Pacific Records roster. See <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fruits-Our-Labor-Paul-Greaver/dp/B000BQ5HYM/sr=1-2/qid=1158447313/ref=sr_1_2/102-3528977-6548118?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/Fruits-Our-Labor-Paul-Greaver/dp/B000BQ5HYM/sr=1-2/qid=1158447313/ref=sr_1_2/102-3528977-6548118?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music" rel="nofollow">Global Pacific Sampler, FRUITS OF OUR LABOR</a>; 3) A major article in the Honolulu Star Bulletin (Mike Gordon, "The New Age of Music," _Honolulu Star-Bulletin_, 5 Nov. 1987.) is cited in a 1993 reprint for web article <a href="http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/cri/cri-nwsl/crn0006a.txt" class="external text" title="http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/cri/cri-nwsl/crn0006a.txt" rel="nofollow">"How 'New Age' is New Age Music?"</a> cited from Christian Research Newsletter, Volume 2: Number 1, 1989 by Elliot Miller.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. If the sources mentioned above are the best ones available, then it's pretty obviously a delete. None of them are articles about the subject, the best one is the "How 'New Age'..." thing, which has one paragraph out of 12 mentioning him. 29 unique google hits for "Robert ÆOLUS Myers" (which also includes results that have ae instead of Æ) have no relevant mentions of him either. - <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobet_31bb.html" title="User:Bobet">Bobet</a> 07:36, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>The above refenced article, Mike Gordon, "The New Age of Music," _Honolulu Star-Bulletin_, 5 Nov. 1987 does indeed fulfill the criteria noted in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, while the "How 'New Age'..." article does not, but does contain the reference. However, Honolulu Star-Bulletin articles from 1987 being pre-internet phenomenon are currently unverifiable by interent seach engine research. I will see if I can access a hard copy of the article and post a link to a scanned copy, though this may go against Wikipedia linking protocols (please advise how to submit hard copy references).</p>
<p>A second <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criteria is the artist's participation in "one of the more important indie labels" with a roster of "notable" artists. Global Pacific Records, with artists such as Bob Kindler, Steve Kindler, Georgia Kelly, David Friesen, Paul Greaver, Ben Taverna King, Charles Brotman, and Tor Dietrichson, etc. was a strong enough label to be purchased by Sony records in the mid-eighties when Private Music and Windham Hill had a lion's share of the new age market so that Sony could establish themselves in the market as well. Additionally, the above mentioned "notable" artists are search engine verifiable.</p>

</ul>
<p>Again, I reference the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criteria that states that only one criteria need be met to let an article stand and that declining the acceptance of articles due to criteria outside of the guidelines is capricious at best and Wikipedia reputation damaging at least. To defer to "not researchable by Google" is not cited as criteria for dismissal. Hiiaka 17:20, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - there has been a lot of research completed to support this article in the AfD process.

<p><b>Comment</b> - Citations to entities not the artist could be readily made, i.e. to the record company, the artistic collaborators and affiliations, and to specific articles within Wikipedia itself referencing the Sufi masters and Expo '92. This would get a cross referenced article, and I would be happy to do that. However, what remains under dispute is how important an indie label is Global Pacific (I am not sure that a citation would help this and would smack of a commercial citation), is the Honolulu Star Bulletin an important journal (this still does not cite the article under question), and did the Spain tour occur (no citations for this are available outside of citing the Expo '92)? I would suggest letting the article stand on the merit of the Record company and inputting the available citations. Citations are a good enough idea, but needs a bit more consensus to be seen a remedy. With a nod and/or a wink I could make it so.Hiiaka 08:08, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>, with conditions. On the surface it seems like vanity or at least it has POV issues, but the article does hint to notability (internationally recognised, TV appearances, all that jazz). If somebody can reword the page to have a neutral POV <i>and</i> qualify her notability, i would say keep it. ~ <a href="../../../l/a/v/User%7ELav-chan_eb6b.html" title="User:Lav-chan">lav-chan</a> @ 12:15, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. This is an obvious case of misinterpretation of Wikipedia policy. We all agree that Wikipedia should not include game guides - that is, articles where there are instructions, hints, guides, tips, and other text where the article generally instructs the reader how to play the game. What Wikipedia is here for is to state facts and other reference information - and that is all this article does. It is also all the other articles do that this user has put up for deletion. I would really like to know what separates this article from any other game related article. How does this qualify as a game guide? If this article was merged into <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlefield_2.html" title="Battlefield 2">Battlefield 2</a>, would that article also be a game guide? A LOT of articles are being put up for deletion by this user, and if they get deleted because of a complete misinterpretation of Wikipedia policy then a lot of work will be wasted.

<dd>How does this qualify as a games guide? let's see - <i>This flag is next to a large warehouse. Around the flag itself there is little cover, but there is a small area inside the warehouse where the flag can be captured, though it is fairly open. The flag can also be captured from the roof if you have a helicopter</i>, <i>This flag is quite open, and the only real cover is the sand bags around the flag itself. This flag is not very easy to defend due to there being three entrances by land, as well as the aircraft carrier behind it. However, there is a tank and an attack helicopter, making it a valuable asset, though on the 64 player version the attack helicopter will only spawn if the USMC side hold the flag.</i> How does that NOT read as a games guide? --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 15:31, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I am also very confused as to why the article has been labelled as "no value". It seems perfectly obvious to me that people could come to Wikipedia to look up the ranking system of this game.

We all agree that Wikipedia should not include game guides - that is, articles where there are instructions, hints, guides, tips, and other text where the article generally instructs the reader how to play the game. What Wikipedia is here for is to state facts and other reference information - and that is all this article does. It is also all the other articles do that this user has put up for deletion. I would really like to know what separates this article from any other game related article. How does this qualify as a game guide? If this article was merged into <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlefield_2.html" title="Battlefield 2">Battlefield 2</a>, would that article also be a game guide? A LOT of articles are being put up for deletion by this user, and if they get deleted because of a complete misinterpretation of Wikipedia policy then a lot of work will be wasted.

<li><b>Delete</b> as <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Originial Research</a> and non-notable. As per the above question, Wikipedia requires reliable, independent sources for articles. Because anyone can post to youtube or a blog, such sites are not considered reliable sources of information. Also, most Wikipedia requires that the subjects of articles be notable (see <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>). Media articles or references in academic literature easily assert notability, but blogs and youtube do not. Dozens of articles are deleted on the basis of notability every day. However, if you can provide citations to reliable references for the event, it will be considered notable and factual. Just find a few, and everyone will be happy. If there are none, it is likely that the article will not be considered notable enough for Wikipedia. However, you can always move the article to a subpage of your userpage so that people can still access the information. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool3_2ec0.html" title="User:Cool3">Cool3</a> 19:50, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> The OR rule is only put in place to stop vandals from proposing their own theories about subjects already established. There has never been any research into mecha being used in the military. Therefore finding sources is impossible. But it is still a subject of interest to mecha enthusiasts, therefore it should be kept because it is a notable subject of interest. Subjects on wikipedia also include pop culture topics which don't have acedemic research. See <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donkey_punch.html" title="Donkey punch">donkey punch</a> for example.

<li><b>Keep</b> as a worthwhile stub.

<li>An argument that WP:BIO shouldn't apply is always a weak argument, and indicates that the person probably does not warrant an encyclopaedia article.

<ul>
<li>I mean that WP:BIO is designed to set up a framework for notability, but even it realizes that not everyone who's "notable" is going to meet the standard. If you need to dismiss it as ruleslawyering, you'd be wrong and so be it, but I think his position in the FSF confers notability, and it should stay based on that. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 15:55, 24 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, Jeff.... Go ahead. You have my blessing! Demonstrate that. Provide a cite that he has the position, and that it is notable enough in the history of the open software movement, or whatever else might help establish notabiilty. The keeps have been asked for this for some time, and I'm not seeing it. Hypothetical, or unsupported, assertions don't cut it for me. Until something changes in the article this is such an obvious delete that your claiming differently causes me to question your judgement about what's deletable.

<li>Perhaps you might want to lay off the accusations of wikilawyering. It's entirely unnecessary. If I find a cite between now and the end of this, I'll gladly add it - you can do so, too!

<li>You might be tired of them, yes, but they're not uncalled for in my view. Call a spade a spade and all that, your comments often look like that is what you are trying to do... If you have the cites needed to satisfy my standards here (which I think are more in tune with accepted practice than yours) I'll be falling over myself to change from delete to keep. As for adding cites, I looked. Didn't find any. Not sure I am convinced that adminning a mailing list, even for 10 years, quite counts.

<ul>
<li>No, they are uncalled for. If my comments "often" look like that, you better have more than my belief that WP:BIO should be waived for this one if you're going to continue to go down that line of accusation. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:53, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>So did you have any cites as to his notability, then? I have to wonder. I see a number of cites added that satisfy me that he's been part of FSF and LPF for a very long time.

<ul>
<li>It is not a matter of permission, or me trying to hide anything... If I seemed to be doing so, it was simply because primary sources are not normally considered adequate verifiable material for encyclopedic content. I know of (some) early free software history (including GNU and FSF) mostly due to following the free software community and conversing with some of the people who have been actively involved in it from the start. I can't really tell you "go to this URL or read that book where a secondary source said this and that". Not that there necessarily isn't one; I just never really researched into it, as I didn't have to. If you look at RMS for example, there aren't that many sources either, outside of himself or the FSF, regarding many of the things we take as common knowledge, and mention in his article. <i>(added a posteriori: GRBerry makes some interesting comments below, which I think fall well into what I said here)</i> <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapi_43f5.html" title="User:Capi">Capi</a> 16:39, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

I think we can source that he was a director of the FSF, but as it stands, that isn't enough of a reason to have an article. He has done so well at not promoting himself, I can't find any good sources about him. However, if anyone can produce a source that says anything beyond the basics about him, I would support keeping.

<li>Citing you from further up in this discussion, <i>His role for more than 10 years at the FSF was to do electronic administration for them, including handling mailing lists and usenet groups.</i> I wouldn't say that maintaining mailing lists is significant to the historical record. I'm pretty sure the passage from WP:BIO you cite above was not intended to mean that if you make a small contribution to chronicling, you are notable. The passage may need to be further disambiguated on that point. - <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamsara_83cc.html" title="User talk:Samsara">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samsara_6f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samsara">contribs</a>) 19:06, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>The same source that gives this description describes Stallman's role as "Richard Stallman continues as a volunteer who does countless tasks, such as Emacs maintenance." (volume 1, #22). This is a transparently obvious understatement of the roles of the various individuals. It is, however, the only source we have found so far to use until someone competent (which isn't me), evaluates all the primary sources I was referring to above and publishes a secondary source that more accurately describes the roles of all the key players. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 12:54, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

The beginnings of the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_software_movement.html" title="Free software movement">Free software movement</a> are important and should be documented. And part of that documentation includes the efforts and assistance offered by Len Tower in helping the FSF and Gnu Project to form and prosper. I recall first meeting Len at a <a href="../../../u/s/e/USENIX_082e.html" title="USENIX">USENIX</a> conference in 1990 and he was very active in promoting free software. <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Stallman_a8be.html" title="Richard Stallman">Richard Stallman</a> (rms) wrote the code and Len helped get the word out. Richard was not that great with human interactions at that time (he is much better now!) and there really needed to be someone who believed in the cause and could communicate well with others. Len Tower was this person. There is no vanity in Len Tower.

<li><b>Strongest Possible Keep</b> This debate is completely nuts. Len has been the behind-the-scenes organizer, fund-raiser, administrator, and sanity checker for the very organization that laid the groundwork to make projects like Wikipedia possible.

He easily passes multiple <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> notability criteria per above. It is only his modesty through the years that keeps all the nay-sayers here from knowing just how notable he really is. Shame!

There are many more mentions of Tower in old newsgroups and mailing lists. What you have to note here is that several of the most notable events range back 20 years ago, in a time when things were much more informal. The WWW wasn't what it is today (in fact it <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Wide_Web_2386.html#Origins" title="World Wide Web">began</a> on 1990), and much was communicated through BBSes, Usenet and simply through personal contact at universities and user groups. Many informal references exist, some of them primary sources, some of them not. This isn't just true for Tower, it's true for most of the early hackers, including of course Stallman and others on whom we (rightfully) already have large articles (hacker here being used in the sense of computer wizard, those who advanced much of what we now take for granted). badlydrawnjeff above is right; this clearly falls under WP:BIO's "this is not an exclusionary list" explanation. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapi_43f5.html" title="User:Capi">Capi</a> 23:18, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>I am quite familiar with Wikipedia's policies, but thank you nonetheless. Linking me to WP:V and WP:NOR seems to indicate that you chose to ignore the existance of references which I pointed out above as examples. Did you read the links I provided? It is unclear to me where WP:NOR comes into place in a discussion about notability, after sources showing notability have been produced. Are we arguing "letter of the law" now? Or are we trying to understand and follow the guidelines to create a better encyclopedia? WP:BIO is clear that people need not belong to that list to be notable - it would be a very limited encyclopedia otherwise, where you could only write about 10 or 12 different topics that someone thought up. Tower in fact even fits on that list, having made critical and recognized contributions which are part of the history of his specific field; this is sourced and cited above, on the sample of references which I posted.

<li>I was rebutting your arguments about BBS and direct contact, which, in addition to being OR in themselves, do not lead us to any reliable sources. Furthermore, I read the links, but neither attendance at conferences nor contribution to software development confer notability, in my opinion. - <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamsara_83cc.html" title="User talk:Samsara">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samsara_6f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samsara">contribs</a>) 15:51, 26 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In my opinion, these sources are reliable for what they prove (which is that Len Tower was on the board and participated in the project), but they don't justify anything further. This was the kind of source I was able to dig up myself, and after a bit of digging I gave up, because I could find nothing that profiles Tower, no interviews, no one discussing his contributions. Someday, maybe someone will write a book about the history of the FSF, and then we'll have the source we need. Until then, with the article being confined to either be original research or a permanent stub, I think we shouldn't have an article. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 16:28, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Indeed. How about putting the verifiable parts of the above into the FSF article, and leave a redirect from Leonard H. Tower to that article? would that do? I was mentioned on BBS systems 20 years ago too, but I'm not notable. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 18:46, 26 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What possible relevance could that have? I breathe air too, but I'm not notable... that's called spurious reasoning&#160;:-) Did you redesign and rewrite, almost from scratch, what today could very easily be argued to be the most widely recognized and notable compiler worldwide, just to name one example? If you did, you would indeed be notable in your field. And that article would be about you. We have a huge article on Torvalds, who created a very widely recognized free kernel. That's great. We even have an article on a sysadmin whose sole contribution to mankind, from his article, was apparently creating a directory in an FTP server for Torvalds to put his kernel sources in. That's great too, if only a bit inconsistent given what we're arguing to delete here. Given the choice between outright deletion and a redirect, of course a redirect is the lesser evil. However, I still believe that there is no harm in leaving the article; we have information to cite, from official sources - GNU bulletin being one, the official AUTHORS file for GNU diff (only the program that allows version control systems such as Wikipedia to even work) being another, the GCC documentation being another, etc. Mangojuice noted that we don't seem to have a book telling the history of Len Tower yet; indeed, it would be nice for such a thing to exist, and we could definitely expand on the article if it did appear. Until then, though, why delete the article? As long as it doesn't have false information, or information that cannot be sourced, and given that he is notable in his field, why not keep the stub and let the natural process of Wikipedia evolve the article in its own speed? Surely you cannot expect an article to grow from a 2-line stub to a featured article over the course of 5 days or whatever, during an AfD. We have countless stubs that need enhancement, some more worthy than others (heck, some stubs are far more worthy than some articles I've seen). Why should this article not have the same chance? <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapi_43f5.html" title="User:Capi">Capi</a> 21:07, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Dude... if you can provide a verifiable cite for "redesign and rewrite, almost from scratch, what today could very easily be argued to be the most widely recognized and notable compiler worldwide" as far as I am concerned, this discussion is over, Len is notable. But that's not what has been put forth so far, it has been about maintaining mailing lists and how much was posted in the old days of usenet. Provide a cite for the gcc assertion, a solid verifiable cite, and I'm on your side. But mostly what you have been doing is not that, it has been arguing against the guideline. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 21:24, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

Tower Jr. (second nomination)">references</a> I quoted above? In particular, the GNU bulletin vol 1, no 1. That bulletin establishes Tower as GNU's #2 (after Stallman) and clearly defines his role with GCC, in section "4. C compiler". GNU is the official organization which produces GCC, and that particular part was written by Stallman, the organization's founder and person who initially started GCC. Furthermore, the GNU bulletins are <a href="http://www.gnu.org/bulletins/" class="external text" title="http://www.gnu.org/bulletins/" rel="nofollow">official GNU publications</a>.

So either this part of history has been misrepresented by Stallman in the books given as references at the bottom of that article, or the article is not true to those sources either, or possibly LT bailed out of GCC development before 1987. - <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamsara_83cc.html" title="User talk:Samsara">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samsara_6f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samsara">contribs</a>) 01:04, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well noticed. GCC's <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.misc/msg/32eda22392c20f98" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.misc/msg/32eda22392c20f98" rel="nofollow">first beta release</a> was indeed made on March 1987 (note the post was made by Len, quoting Stallman). <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html#historical" class="external text" title="http://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html#historical" rel="nofollow">GCC Releases (Historical section)</a> confirms this. Now, for a beta release to have existed on March 1987, programming must have started earlier. I believe the problem is simply that the GCC article is ambiguous. It should be corrected to state something like "GCC was first released on 1987" or something equivalent. I wouldn't say the authorship of GCC is in dispute; to my knowledge, Stallman did indeed start work on GCC, and continue on with it. Tower made substantial contributions to GCC, though, being responsable for a thorough redesign in the early stages (to lose the Pastel dependency and rewrite the thing in C), and assorted work on the front end, etc. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapi_43f5.html" title="User:Capi">Capi</a> 10:58, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Some, <i>not all</i>, sources above are newsgroup postings. For the most part, newsgroup postings constitute self-published materials that lacked fact checking processes before publication, much they way that Wikipedia lacks a reliable pre-publication fact checking mechanism. Per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, the guideline on reliable sources, such publications, including both Wikipedia and newsgroup postings, are not reliable enough sources to meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. This can feel odd in comparison to how we handle websites on a case by case basis to those of us that remember the pre-web days of the net. I personally believe that the same skills needed to evaluate if a web page is a reliable source are the ones needed to evaluate if a newsgroup posting is a reliable source. But that isn't the community consensus. So I'll I'm adding to the article are the facts from items meeting WP:RS that I also am confident I can represent correctly. So far just the FSF and LPF's periodicals have met both tests for me. I'm quite sure the author's file portions of the software documentation is a reliable source per WP:RS, but I think it is a primary source that I personally am not qualified to interpret. So I'm now adding a fact here, a sentence there, as we identify more usable reliable sources.</li>
<li>With the sources identified to date, it is impossible to write a featured article, but that isn't a standard we even mention in most AfD discussions. Every fact in the article now is cited to a reliable source, except for Len's birthdate (which could readily be cited to one of the external links if we want to be that picky). With that level of citation, I feel that the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> concern about the present form of the article is a bit unreasonable. Concern about future versions should be addressed through the normal editing process.

You and others who wanted to delete argued in the DRV that the previous discussion should had been closed for deletion because there were 3 votes to delete in the last day; myself and others who wanted to keep argued that the discussion should had been closed for keeping because there were 6 votes to keep (and no delete votes whatsoever in the first 5 days).

<li>You're twisting things once again. It was ruled in DRV that the nomination should be relisted, which means including the previous votes and listing the AfD again to gather more views. However, in this instance, the old discussion was not relisted. Instead, a new discussion was started, so all the people who originally complained that process had not been followed were apparently happy with process not being followed second time round, presumably because the offense was in their favour. If you're going to be a process wonk, you had better be consistent.

<li>Twisting things once again, pushing POV, trying to gain unfair advantage, process wonk... Well, I'll <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> somehow, even though you don't really seem to. What I would like to know is how not listing the previous opinions is favoring the keep side... (or the delete side, for that matter.) Both in here and in the DRV (where at least it was on topic) you consistently mention the previous delete votes as though there were 50 regular users who argued to delete and everyone was conspiring to hide that fact. I have nothing against including the previous votes; they favored us anyway. In any case, "relist" to me implies "listing again", as in doing another vote, but hey if the normal procedure is to include previous votes then fine, message an admin and ask him to do it. My previous comment, that if we are here to relist and discuss deleting the article, then we should do it instead of playing with hidden implications of prejudice and cabal, still stands, though. Both sides feel that their point of view was the right one - that's called a <i>disagreement</i>.

<li>So let's include them, then. Either copy them in, or, make the link in the header loads more prominent. I think when we start process wonking we have to not pick and choose among processes.

<li>Repeat something often enough and it becomes true... 1) [red herring] Someone has yet to show how not including the previous votes has skewed anything, especially when there were far more regular users arguing for keep than there were for delete. 2) [straw man] The point is moot anyway, because no one here is arguing against including the previous votes, so if anyone feels prejudiced against, by all means include them. 3) [red herring] It is hardly process wonking when we overturn an AfD that had at least 6 regular user arguments for keep over 5 days, and 3 arguments for delete in the last day, and got speedy-closed as delete (on WP:SNOW, on top of it, if anything SNOW would have meant it should be closed as keep). 4) Can we please do whatever to solve the issue of previous votes already, and go back to discussing keeping or deleting the article? <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapi_43f5.html" title="User:Capi">Capi</a> 14:31, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Meh. All your process points don't actually address the real issues here... this is a substub article (and therefore deletable in my view, as often NOTHING is better than a unsourced substub) about a person whose notability has not been established, and apparently, can't be. Were I the closing admin of this AfD or the first one (I am not and, as a participant, won't be...) I would say this is a clear delete. Numbers are irrelevant, who turned up when is irrelevant, that it was closed a bit early is irrelevant, what matters is the strength of the arguments, because AfD is not a vote, and the Delete argument is running away with this. All the keeps can do, seemingly, is raise process, which, frankly, isn't what this encyclopedia is about. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 16:25, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Let me get this straight. The sources show that RMS decided to write the first version of the compiler in an rare extension of Pascal, resulting in a very nonportable design, and you don't think translating it into C and overhauling the parser, intermediate language, and VAX (most numerous platform of the time) target description as the second person to touch the code was a notable contribution? That is an opinion with which I not only disagree, but which I think is ridiculous, and worthly of very much ridicule, which should reflect on the quality of your education and educators.

<li>Now let <i>me</i> get this straight. Since his notability now seems to hinge on whether or not he has made huge contributions to gcc, let's be very careful about this. The source says <i>is working on this</i>, not <i>has completed</i>. The source given does not indicate that Len significantly contributed to the completion of the transition from Pastel to C. Furthermore, the Wikipedia article on <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_Compiler_Collection_cfca.html" title="GNU Compiler Collection">gcc</a> does not mention Tower in spite of citing three sources, two of them by Stallman. It seems that at least one person is taking or being given more credit than he deserves. - <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamsara_83cc.html" title="User talk:Samsara">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samsara_6f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samsara">contribs</a>) 15:38, 27 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. I believe this can be explained by the fact that RMS depends on income from speaking fees, and Tower does not. However, I will take another look at the gcc article. <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELossIsNotMore_d6f5.html" title="User:LossIsNotMore">LossIsNotMore</a> 15:42, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Not wanting to involve myself too much in this line of discussion, I would just note that the Stallman sources cited in the GCC article do not go much toward authorship or development history; they are reference manuals, they discuss usage and technical characteristics. Regardless of this, I really don't think going down a path of "which one person wrote more lines of code" or "someone is lieing" is productive or even relevant. Stallman is generally recognized as the person who created GCC; he did not do so alone, naturally. Tower is one person who is cited officially as having been a very important contributor. He was the person resonsable for changing GCC from an initial design which was written in Pastel, non-portable, impractical and unmaintainable (keeping the compiler in that language would have meant a project within a project, as there was no other compiler which could compile Pastel in the first place) to something completely different and modular, written in C, a design which evolved into what we have now. We have an article on Torvalds, who created the Linux kernel, but we also have articles on a few important contributors; should we delete those, because "many people have contributed to Linux over the years"? Clearly not. Please do not reduce this to a matter of "who was the one guy who created GCC so that we can keep him and delete the other" or whatever; they are both important figures, in GCC and not only (sources have been listed for other projects besides GCC - e.g. GNU diff - and other things besides programming as well) along with the rest of the other hackers on whom we already have articles. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapi_43f5.html" title="User:Capi">Capi</a> 15:53, 27 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>(edit conf) capi, we're trying to establish whether among all the hundreds of people who've contributed to gcc, Len Tower is sufficiently outstanding to be considered "notable". We simply can't afford to have an article on every contributor to gcc. Now, where's my vim?&#160;;) Also, can you guys get used to writing your comments once rather than keep amending them, because I'm getting very fed up with these edit conflicts. - <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamsara_83cc.html" title="User talk:Samsara">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samsara_6f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samsara">contribs</a>) 15:59, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Perhaps you already know this, but if you can improve the diff engine, then you can cut down on the number of edit conflicts that occur. But I digress. Do you claim that RMS's statement that Len, in 1986, "is working" on the conversion from Pastel to C may be reorganized per <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> into the fact that he "has worked" on that conversion, and was the first and for at least several months the only full time staff to work on that task, or, do you believe that the adjustment of verb tenses constitutes original research? <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELossIsNotMore_d6f5.html" title="User:LossIsNotMore">LossIsNotMore</a> 16:07, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Resorting to arguments like this doesn't help your case. We don't (at least, shouldn't) write articles about things which are important to Wikipedia but not the outside world.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> This is not my area of expertise, but after my attention was called to this article, I found the stub to have enough content to be interesting.

<li><b>Delete</b> I think this might actually be speediable. He doesn't appear to be any kind of "professional" artist, neither the article nor his website (last updated 2001, it's own counter says it's had 258 hits in 5 years) lists anything about galleries, museum showings, agents, etc. He neither sells or shows his work and the article itself says he isn't drawing right now. He's a soldier who draws with a homestead page of his art.

<li>I think this guy's stuff is way cool. What exactly makes criteria of "notability" anyway? So the guy isn't famous, but is obviously an artist. Plus, according to what is written, he hasn't abandoned art for the time being, but is slowed from usual production for the time being while carrying out a commitment to his country, perhaps as an act of patriotism from the immediate wake of 9/11? I know 5 and 6 year commitments are common. Plus, since all of these are done freehand and not computer generated, I can see how he would be slowed by it. The fact that he does fractal-like by way of freehand is amazing, and while not famous, perhaps he should be, as he has a unique and amazing talent, and thus should be noteworthy on that alone. It would be a shame to say that because someone isn't a "famous" artist, that they should be removed. I know I have seen other people deemed "noteworthy" on wikipedia who don't exactly have talent, but somehow got some sort of fame.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Commonnonsense (<a href="../../../c/o/m/User_talk%7ECommonnonsense_0491.html" title="User talk:Commonnonsense">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Commonnonsense_1816.html" title="Special:Contributions/Commonnonsense">contribs</a>) 07:37, September 24, 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<li>Ohconfucius sounds like someone who knows how to be a critic, but not how to critique. I guess when you have no knowledge of things, but want to appear to be an authority, that can tend to happen. 'Twould be a shame to delete in my opinion. This guy's stuff is quite good. Like I said before, it is unique and vibrant. Perhaps one of you could tell him a direction to go in to become famous, rather than dismissing him as nothing, when he is merely not known, but still quite good.Commonnonsense 07:51, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Perhaps you mean a different guideline? SELF is just a manual of style guideline relating to avoiding writing with the assumption that the text is being viewed on Wikipedia, or indeed anywhere on the internet. The article actually follows it fairly well, in that the text would make sense in any context.</dd>
<dd>AFAIK there is no especial guideline covering self-documentation in this sense, since the issue only ever arises in non-namespace pages relating to Wikipedia itself. Therefore we should stick by a combination of the core principles (eg. write from an NPOV and so forth) and the exercise of a healthy dose of common sense -- WP:WEB and WP:ORG are designed to stop trivial websites and organisations respectively from using Wikipedia as cheap advertising space, which is clearly not what's happening heere, and WP:V and RS are intended to prevent conjecture and opinion from being presented as fact, which again isn't happening, though certainly a link to the Bureaucrat's ban log would be handy as a source for the relevant comment. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmowton_e7c5.html" title="User:Smowton">Chris Smowton</a> 01:41, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>No, I meant exactly this guideline. If I, for instance, create my user's page at Wikipedia, is this a source for an <i>encyclopedic</i> article? Obviously, it is not. And the same goes for language versions of the Wikipedia. There can be a lot of useful information in other namespaces. But these are auxiliary. The main namespace is something very different. It is the <i>encyclopedia</i>.
<dl>
<dd>Well no, of course not, but I can't see why we would need your user page (or anybody else's) as a source here. The article makes a few assertions:</dd>
<dd>1) Czech Wikipedia exists. Of this we're quite sure, a source isn't needed.
<dl>
<dd>I agree, the only problem is whether its existence is notable. -- <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZorro_CX_6afd.html" title="User:Zorro CX">Zorro CX</a> 11:38, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>2) Czech WP had N users as of Y. Source: stats.wikimedia.org. Whilst this might count as self-citing, it's the only reasonable source for such information, so employ common sense and ignore the rule for this special case.
<dl>
<dd>I may agree, but this source cannot be <b>verified</b>. Only facts (not <b>truth</b>) which are verifiable can be inserted into the Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZorro_CX_6afd.html" title="User:Zorro CX">Zorro CX</a> 11:38, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>3) Czech WP commonly features arguments about topic X. Somewhat woolly and hard to source per se, but again since it's a harmless observation about the internal culture, don't worry about it unless it is disputed by another CZWP user.
<dl>
<dd>Andy what about this another CZWP user? Can he or she insert his or her <b>original research</b> into the article? -- <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZorro_CX_6afd.html" title="User:Zorro CX">Zorro CX</a> 11:38, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>4) Czech WP banned a Bureaucrat in July. The only logical source is the cz block log. Whilst it counts technically as self-reference, again this is the only reasonable source and verifies it as unquestionably factual. It's also used elsewhere in Wikipedia; for example the article on <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> links to diffs to show some of his edits.

<dd>How do you know that the Czech Wikipedia is not trivial? About a dozen of articles in Czech (most mixed the Wikipedia in general) and only one in English.

<li>I'm sure you're going to complain that the last two are not in English, but you know, not everyone here is limited by one language and sometimes its plain what an article is about even if you do know the language (I don't know Czech, yet it only took me about 10 minutes to find these articles.)

<p>But OK, let's go through:</p>
<p>ad 1. An interview with non-notable <i>Petr Kadlec</i> and, obviously, a Wikipedian. This constitues a <b>bias</b>.

<p>ad 2. The article is almost only about the Wikipedia itself. The Czech Wikipedia is mentioned only in just <b>two</b> statements: "Jenže pak jsem se dostal na stránky české wikipedie, kde je mj. k dnešnímu dni přes 18 300 článků ..." (= statistics) and "Místo pro setkávání našich wikipedistů se nazývá Pod lípou neboli Česká hospoda." (= There is a Village Pump.) Nothing else at all. The base for the <i>encyclopedic</i> article? I am sorry, but my demands are higher.</p>
<p>ad 3. Again about the Wikipedia as a such (I never propose to delete the article about the Wikipedia). "Česká verze Wikipedie (přístupná též z adresy www.wikipedia.cz ) má na začátku roku 2006 článků přes 22 tisíc." (= statistics) "Na české Wikipedii můžete vyzkoušet, jaké to je, stát se wikipedistou a podílet se na psaní encyklopedie. Můžete se také podívat na články nominované na nejlepší články české Wikipedie . A pokud by vás zajímalo, co že editory motivuje k jejich mravenčí práci při kontrole vkládaných informací, můžete se podívat do Kabinetu kuriozit , kde se dočtete (vesměs promptně odstraněné) perličky anonymních „wikipedistů.“" (= P.

<li><b>Comment</b> I have to say this is the most bizarrely obstinate work-to-rule afd I've ever been in. Okay: 1) I doubt that <i>you</i> would be invited to get an interview / profile about whatever you do on Radio Prague. The interview I referenced is about Wikipedia, not an individual Wikipedian; and its conducted by professional journalists in the employ of a major Czech broadcaster. The journalist conducting the interview even asks some difficult questions about Wikipedia 2) and 3) These articles prove that Czech Wikipedia exists and are notable for the Czech audience when talking about the broader discussion of Wikipedia. And finally, are you still denying that Czech Wikipedia falls under the umbrella of the Wikimedia Foundation?

<dd>Your doubts were baseless, that's what I can say. Concerning the English interview, most of its content is about the Wikipedia. But the Wikipedia has already had the article, so does Wikimedia Foundation and no one doubts it. I only doubt <i>notability</i> and <i>verifialibity</i> of the subject which is so far described in <i>one and only</i> English article. It presents <i>one POV</i>, what about the others?

<dd>Short background: Czech Wiki suffered from a long conflict that escalated into wheel wars, edit wars, flame wars, numerous blocks, using sockpuppets, exposing personal details ["is that you VZ?", inserted by Zorro CX], labeling people as Hitlers, fascists or communists, questioning their motives and intelligence or associating them with former secret police. The attacks were made on Czech Wikipedia as well as on external website. Several people left or gave up admin positions. The situation was mostly solved by an arbitrage in May 2006. IMO this conflict was so long and so heavy that it is worth to be mentioned in the article. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 15:34, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I did read the article in full. If its intent is to parody white supremacy and racism, then I suggest that it does that rather poorly. The article on the Ku Klux Klan does not include <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a> "joke" fantasies about attending the Apollo theater and shouting "Wow! Look at all you monkey people!", or anything similar. The article on Nazism does not describe circumstances like a believer saying "would be nice to get rid of those disgusting chinks and hashbrown bastards permanently" as "in which he vocalized these exact thoughts into an albeit witty social commentary" (um, sic). Anyway, the fact that it's racist is hardly the only criteria for deletion on the table here. Also, please sign your comments on talk pages by using four tildes. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 20:28, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> Ok, the fact remains that because there is an absence of these specific citations on Wikipedia, does not exlude their existence elsewhere. And yet again, how is this racist when there is nothing advocating racism? Simply because the majority of people are not familiar with this organization does not point immediately to this being 100% false. There are countless underground organizations in existence and if Wikipedia claims to be a haven of information, surely it cannot delete an article that some people find offensive despite its accuracy. If there truly are doubts about this organization, I implore everyone to get in contact with, for starters, the various connections this group has with people of national presence. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Zoso2005 (<a href="../../../z/o/s/User_talk%7EZoso2005_57bc.html" title="User talk:Zoso2005">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zoso2005_e65b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zoso2005">contribs</a>).</small>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Since the history shows that you are User:Zoso2005 the creator of this article, then please provide appropriate 3rd party citations.

<li><b>Keep</b> I've personally heard of this group before and based on what I've seen on Youtube they're the real deal. Sure, some of the information on here seems a little "out there" but the sources are still cited with month and year, regardless of them being weekly or biweekly publications. Is it not also the intentions of Wikipedia for all users to seek out more information themselves? Also, how is it unreasonable to contact people like Mary-Kate Olsen? They're not unapproachable. --Elvis 1950 21:33, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>I am not so good at the setting up of the page, and was hoping someone would assist me by cleaning up the page. Alls i am trying to do is get Rob's name out. i was actually quite shocked to not find an article on him here, so made this one myself. Yet, as i said, i am not good with the layout. As you can see though, all of the information, images, etc is all there. I just need the page setting up. And I would have appreciated a message rather than nominating my article for deletion. I have been working on it for a while...</p>

<dd>Look, no one is saying that what you say is not right. IT MIGHT BE CORRECT. That is cool. If the show is well known over Southern California, then CITE A SOURCE. Link to a webpage that reviews it.

Please read this over. If something is worthwhile, then it has <i>been mentioned somewhere besides wikipedia</i>. If you cite your article and cross reference it well, it will probably not be marked for deletion. No one is saying that the 30/60 show is AUTOMATICALLY not worthy of inclusion in wikipedia. You just need to demonstrate its noteworthyness, and it will be included. If you CANNOT do this, I support its deletion.

<li><b>Delete all</b>. These are all individual articles for motorway service stations (<a href="../../../r/e/s/Rest_area.html" title="Rest area">rest areas</a>) on motorways of the United Kingdom. There are a few dozen of these, as listed above; most are genetic and have very little that makes them notable, even apart from one another let alone in their own right. Few of these comprise anything more than a description of where they are and who runs them; some have lacking content warnings, linkless warnings, cleanup warnings. None of the nominated articles is sufficiently notable for inclusion in Wikipedia in my opinion. Many of these articles have been attempted to be deleted before (at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Knutsford_services_599d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Knutsford services">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Knutsford services</a>) but no consensus was reached.

I don't think this AfD is going to go anywhere for the reasons I wrote below: mass nominations like this never do, in my experience. Let's have a centralized discussion to hash out whether service stations are notable as a class or individually or not at all, then we'll know what to do with the individual articles. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 10:34, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> and <b>Redirect</b> to several omnibus articles. Could be grouped by motorway, or by region. Some service stations are, in my judgment, clearly notable - think <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watford_Gap_services_5ca1.html" title="Watford Gap services">Watford Gap services</a>, the first of them, which has a nice long article. An <i>obiter dicta</i> remark: any AfD nomination which includes so many articles is almost bound not to end in a clear-cut result, because there are so many articles that AfD contributors will never bother to read them all, and are unlikely to support deletion just in case there's useful information in the bits they didn't see. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 21:16, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep all</b> Agreed with above. Most of these are stubs and just need expanding. I have fixed the missing links one and propose to go through and expand them.

<li>You guys have to be kidding. Do we <i>really</i> want an article on every rest area in the world? (If you include Britain's I can see no reason why, say, South Africa's rest areas shouldn't also have articles). These things are just not notable, they contain little <i>sourced</i> information (and is therefore <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>)... <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkerpikker_c3cf.html" title="User:Mikkerpikker">Mi<font color="darkred">kk</font>er</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkerpikker_77de.html" title="User talk:Mikkerpikker"><sup>(...)</sup></a> 01:40, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>No one is suggesting the same for every part of the world. Service stations are large and prominent facilities on UK motorways.

<li><b>Comment</b>. No, unsourced material is not necessarily "original research". This term has started to be bandied around a little too freely in recent months, usually by people trying to support their desire to delete something. It's a good idea to read <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> to see what actually constitutes original research on Wikipedia - it's summarised in the little box at the top. This clearly states the position - stating a fact (e.g. "Donington Park services is a motorway service station off the M1 motorway and A42 interchange near Derby, England") is not original research; advancing a theory which has not been published by a reputable source is. Yes, it's always better to source articles, but don't just dismiss articles as OR because they're unsourced. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 02:09, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

In <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">SA</a> they seem to serve exactly the same functions as in the UK, so if the latter is notable enough, so is the former.

<li>Sorry if you took my remark as a breach of either guideline. It certainly wasn't meant to be and it doesn't read as being to me.

<li><b>Comment</b>: There doesn't seem to be any parent article for these at the moment.

<li><b>Merge</b> all without particular notability either into one or several list-type articles or into articles on the motorways they serve.

<li><b>Keep all</b> (and don't merge). Each is a multimillion pound business in its own right, most long established, and certainly as or more notable that the high schools and shopping centres which, an apparent consensus asserts, are sufficiently notable. Secondly they form a component of our overall UK trunk roads article collection, which is getting pretty complete - omitting the service stations on Motorways seems like a willful omission. Southwaite services, a lamentable heckhole though it surely is, is certaily more notable (and with much more to say about it) than <a href="../../../m/8/7/M876_motorway.html" title="M876 motorway">M876 motorway</a> and its myriad ilk. That said, motorway services are a special case (they're large, the exist because of specific government action, and there aren't that many of them). A-road services, on the other hand, are far less special and far more numerous, and exist merely because someone got planning permission from Upper Scratching Parish Council, so I think motorway services is the line below which we shouldn't (barring special cases with more to say for themselves) we shouldn't go. -- <a href="../../../f/i/n/User%7EFinlay_McWalter_466b.html" title="User:Finlay McWalter">Finlay McWalter</a> | <a href="../../../f/i/n/User_talk%7EFinlay_McWalter_a93f.html" title="User talk:Finlay McWalter">Talk</a> 15:48, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep all</b>. This isn't a paper encyclopaedia, and these are all notable locations in the UK (I know I've been to many on that list personally). Motorway service stations are a necessary part of tranport life in the UK and frequented by perhaps a million people on a daily basis. If some old building that no one lives in and few people visit is allowed an article because someone once owned it or lived there, then why shouldn't these services? <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 06:12, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Expand or die</b>. If all Wikipedians can think to write on a topic is <i>"Swansea services is a motorway service station on the M4 motorway near Swansea, Wales.

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> as if nothing else, there is a David Brin (I think, could be someone else) article on the "meaning" of Star Wars, a couple of books exploring it, and who knows what else.

<dd><b>Comment:</b>Yes, and no doubt a substantial part of that French entry was contributed by User:Musikfabrik (i.e. Messrs. Boisseau, Wehage et al.). Look at the edit history. They have a French Wikipedia account too. The whole point is we don't know how much info on the Web about Boisseau, Wehage &amp; Co. was put there by themselves and how much is from neutral third-party sources. So it's not a very good indicator of notability. --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 10:20, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My main argument wasn't that the info could be found elsewhere, but rather that there was no good reason for it to be found in an encyclopaedia. A few of the tunes could be named in the main article to illustrate the sort of material found on the CDs, but listing the lot of them is excessive and unnecessary, bordering on (and in my opinion, falling on the wrong side of) the line for indiscriminate information. GassyGuy 15:46, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I understand where you're coming from, but I still believe that a comprehensive list isn't indiscriminate, but rather a good illustration of the series' scope.

<dd><big><b>IMPORTANT</b></big>: I confirm that host Daniel Lessard states naturally: "[...] But first, Afghanistan <u>and Quebec bashing</u> with minister Maxime Bernier, after this." Then, a voice-off quotes the Jan Wong piece, then mentions the Quebecistan article, then mentions words from Don Cherry. Afterwards, in an interview with minister Bernier, Lessard once again uses naturally the phrase: "<u>Quebec bashing</u>, mister Bernier, (Bernier laughs, knowing what the subject will be) in lack of a better term in French ― The Globe and Mail <u>again</u> this week ― this article that you have read on Dawson, does it irritate you, personally?". Bernier: "shocking" and "no foundations". Lessard enumerates the examples of Wong, Quebecistan and Don Cherry, says that it happens <u>"pretty regularly"</u> and asks, about articles and words such as these: <u>"Is it racism?"</u> Then, Lessard discusses Jean Charest's and other politicians' response to the Wong affair, and any possibility of political recuperation, with Bernard Drainville, chief of the SRC (the network) office in Quebec City. In this exchange, Drainville, contrarily to some like the Globe and Mail editor, comes to the conclusion the politicians acted with moderation <i>("avec pondération")</i>. One can verify all of this by watching the video available on the webpage linked above. This report is a very pertinent find. --<a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELiberlogos_df62.html" title="User:Liberlogos">Liberlogos</a> 03:34, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As I wrote in the article's discussion page, the text needs important work on 1) the quality of English and 2) on making the subject more comprehensive, but the ceaseless bashing on Quebec in the English language media of Canada (especially the written press) is a real social phenomenon. Much has been written on the subject, in both English and French and the current controversy over Jan Wong's Globe &amp; Mail article is making it clear that the issue is still ongoing. -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathieugp_c3f3.html" title="User:Mathieugp">Mathieugp</a> 23:55, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>But is Quebec bashed endlessly in the English-language media? As a former Quebecker living in Toronto, and reading the Globe (can't say I spotted the article that has caused the ruckus), I don't see much in the way of Quebec-bashing ... there's probably more Alberta-bashing an definitely more US-bashing than anything. Was Wong even bashing Quebec? I got the impression she was talking about Francophone society more than the province ... not that I agree with her conclusions. But name the last article in the Globe that caused an issue? That aside, the question is, should the article exist? Is it accurate? Should it have a different name? Should it be merged with something? Just because a noun/verb combination scores high on Google it shouldn't have an article. I don't konw where 321,000 comes from. I just put in "Quebec bashing" (as a phrase) and I only get <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=%22quebec+bashing%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=%22quebec+bashing%22" rel="nofollow">501 hits</a>.

<li>Please explain why bashing the mainstream francophone society of Quebec is NOT bashing Quebec itself??? 74% of Quebecers have some French ancestry, 80% are native French speakers, 82% adopted French as their main language in the privacy of their homes and 94% claim to be able to carry a conversation in French. Come one. That's not serious. You are getting 501 hits because you are putting double quotes around <i>Quebec bashing</i>. You are missing all instances where the phrase is not exactly <i>Quebec bashing</i>, but maybe <i>bashing on Quebec</i> or something similar.

<dd>Explain, with valid arguments, how the fact that Quebec has a multilingual population, something you have to expect in a nation of 7.5 million, changes the fact that when you attack the majority of Quebecers and the political and social institutions of all Quebecers, you are attacking the whole of Quebec? If the majority national group isn't allowed to identify to Quebec, who is? If the old-stock Franco-Quebecers are racist when they identify to Quebec, are old-stock British Canadians racists when they think of themselves as Canadians?

<li>Asking what is the last G&amp;M article having raised issues is not an apt argument, for this article is not named "Quebec bashing in the Globe and Mail newspaper". The last article published in the general press to raise a ruckus was published only a month before ("The Rise of Quebecistan, in the other big Canadian newspaper). You don't see much Quebec bashing? ...read the article. Yes, Wong was bashing Quebec. She referred to the language laws that were passed by the Quebec legislature. "the question is, [...] Is it accurate?" Look at the plethora of references. "That aside, the question is, [...] Should it have a different name? Should it be merged with something?" That is not exactely the question at hand: this is a deletion nomination. Those issues are raised in different fashions. "the question is, should the article exist?" That's the question. The answer is yes. Books (as noted below) and hundreds of articles (as also noted below) have commented and studied the phenomenon. The opinion that it exists is held widely in all political sides in Quebec (see below). --<a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELiberlogos_df62.html" title="User:Liberlogos">Liberlogos</a> 03:12, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - "Allegedly" has specifically been used to carefully counter criticism of "bias" and deletion nominations. Since the subject is controversial, any mention that says "The phenomenon exists [end of the line]." will get the article into trouble. Now, you're nominating it for the exact opposite reason, which is curious. The fact is that, in the Quebec society, in all political sides, it is widely believed to exist (see "There's a sort of <u>trend</u>." - <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denis_Coderre_e5bf.html" title="Denis Coderre">Denis Coderre</a>, Liberal MP), <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/cp/media/060921/X092108U.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cbc.ca/cp/media/060921/X092108U.html" rel="nofollow">[71]</a> and the abundance of references makes that argument successfully. Books (Three volumes of <i>The Black Book of English Canada</i> from Normand Lester, <i>L'obsession ethnique</i> from Guy Bouthillier...) and hundreds of articles (see <a href="http://www.vigile.net/00-4/bashing.html" class="external text" title="http://www.vigile.net/00-4/bashing.html" rel="nofollow">"Bashing Quebec fashionable in anglo media"</a> by Michel David and the dozens more referrenced in the article) have commented and studied the phenomenon. --<a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELiberlogos_df62.html" title="User:Liberlogos">Liberlogos</a> 01:54, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Because of the controversy, right now, dozens, hundreds of Quebecers, and some outside Quebec, are googling "Quebec bashing". As I am writing this, the googlesearch has the Wikipedia article in question in 7th place on the first result page and the one from the French-language Wikipédia in 6th place on the first result page. Many of the people finding this page have never contributed to Wikipedia. This article has been featured on <a href="../../../v/i/g/Vigile.net.html" title="Vigile.net">Vigile.net</a>, a popular website with a majority of readers that have never contributed to Wikipedia (and many may not know about it). This is probably a big part of the explanation. Also, as noted below, this is an issue that "burns many" people and therefor an attempt to erase this in a sphere where it is less well-known, the English-speaking world (which could be seen by them as historical revisionism), will draw more people in trying to avoid it. --<a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELiberlogos_df62.html" title="User:Liberlogos">Liberlogos</a> 03:49, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>We know that systematic denigration of entire national groups, gender groups, religious groups etc, for political reason is common. Each case has for certain been the subject of many books and doctoral thesises. Using available material, we are for sure able to write something good, neutral, encyclopedic on these subjects. Various books have already been written (some translated to English) in reaction to the constant flow of disinformation on Quebec and it is currently exploding in the news RIGHT NOW. the Prime Minister of Canada wrote a letter to the Globe &amp; Mail to ask them to apologize for publishing an article. This is a first in the history of Canada and that alone would deserve an article! I believe the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec_bashing.html" title="Quebec bashing">Quebec bashing</a> article can be improved to meet Wikipedia's standards.

<li>I said that it was fine to use foreign language references when the content could not be found in English and was necessary for the article. I am a habitual qualifier. I like my statements to be correct in all foreseeable situations.&#160;;-)</li>
<li>I might be in favor of deleting some of the less notable articles that you mention (flat earthers, Moon landing hoax accusations (could be briefly mentioned in Moon landing article), thetans &amp; engrams (maybe deletion, but merging into another article might be a better solution), Saddam &amp; al Qaeda (could be briefly mentioned in respective articles)), but I would have to check them out first. However, your examples of articles on things that are false or do not exist is not relevant to the reasoning that I gave, which is that bashing between regions is not notable, specifically, not notable enough for its own article. Mentioning that there is perceived Quebec bashing in the article on Quebec would be be more appropriate, in my opinion. A better example article would be a whole article about the bashing of a region by the rest of the country. The most well known case of regional bashing that I am aware of is the Southern United States vs. the rest of the U.S., but there is not an article about it as far as I can find. If the bashing of Quebec is so severe or is perceived to be so severe by Quebec residents as to warrant its own article, why is the subject not widely discussed in English? 8% of the population in Quebec speaks English and many people are multilingual. Also, there are many English speakers outside Quebec that should be writing about it if it is such a big issue. Finally, how is Quebec special in regards to regional bashing, as you say? -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 10:07, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b> - I thought that there is some value in this article, and I have tried to improve it in constructive ways, but the primary author has reverted virtually everything I have done, and seems to be on some kind of mission of original research here, rather than writing a collaborative article. This would be less frustrating, but with his poor English, some of his reversions have restored words that were not used in the correct form (with the primary author citing the dictionary to justify his misuse of the English language). The author also seems to have a lot of bias, being under the mistaken belief that the Canadian English media have some kind of particular axe to grind with Quebec, which is a very naive and insular understanding of how Canada works, for if they had spent any time in TROC they would see that the media tends to pick on everyone, with Quebec being less of a target than say Alberta or in particular The United States.</s> While I think there may be some validity in having an article here, or perhaps somewhere more neutral like <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Quebec_2c0c.html" title="Criticism of Quebec">Criticism of Quebec</a>. <a href="../../../n/f/i/User%7ENfitz_2215.html" title="User:Nfitz">Nfitz</a> 16:48, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>That I have shown bad faith, but no assuming you don't have bias - I'm sorry, I should have phrased that differently. But "high racism"? After a lifetime of speaking English, I have never encountered this term - therefore the use of it in an article is not going to explain what it means. I'm really unsure what you mean by high racism ... does this mean racism that is more pure than other forms of racism? Does this mean racism brought about from upon high? Does this mean "highly racist"? I honestly don't understand what is meant by this term, and I'm sure not a lot of others do either. <a href="../../../n/f/i/User%7ENfitz_2215.html" title="User:Nfitz">Nfitz</a> 17:52, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think I do not understand the arguments going against this page.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Distinguishing "Francophone society" and Quebec is ridiculous - Quebec's official language is French, just as the language of the USA is English, and ethnic diversity in origins in both societies would not render in any way pertinent a similar distinction between "English-speaking society" and the USA as two very distinct bodies. It would rightly seem nonsense to say criticizing the "English-speaking society" of the USA is not criticizing the USA.</li>
<li>The real issue is the manner of criticism, not the proportional space it takes in the Canadian media. The criticism described as "Quebec bashing" is generally gratuitous and prejudiced, attempting to foster a general contempt of Quebec because it is different and French-speaking.</li>
<li>The prejudiced character is the reason why both Prime ministers Harper of Canada and Charest of Quebec have asked the <i>Globe &amp; Mail</i>, by letter, to express regret at the prejudiced article by Jan Wong. The <i>Globe</i> has refused and tried to drown the issue, on which other Toronto newspapers have strangely remained silent. The <i>Globe &amp; Mail</i> cannot be dismissed as unimportant, as far as English-Canadian media go. As for the <i>National Post</i>, whether subjectively one takes it seriously or not should not be part of the argument. What matters is that "Quebec bashing" describes a phenomenon that does exist in the Toronto newspapers and often characterises the work of their Quebec correspondents&#160;! Especially nowadays, after the departur of Graham Fraser and Ray Conlogue.</li>
<li>See the latest column by Chantal Hebert in the <i>Toronto Star</i> - she is not their Quebec correspondent by the way, and is not biased against Quebec, but usually avoids commenting on Quebec bashing, as she confesses, but this time was revolted by the silence surrounding what the <i>Globe &amp; Mail</i> has called "a minor uproar" when in fact the Canadian House of Commons has condemned the prejudiced reporting only last week.</li>
<li>This silence in itself warrants the article&#160;: many are unaware of the phenomenon because other English-Canadian media neglect or avoid reporting on the debate these "Quebec bashing" incidents stir, even when they are at the core of a House of Commons motion.</li>
<li>Why shouldn't a documented bias that infects many Toronto media not warrant an article&#160;? Readers will make their own opinion when reading the article, its existence will simply make the facts accessible and discussion possible. Surely a positive effect, which is the effect we all hope accessible knowledge through Wikipedia should obtain. (previous unsigned comment by User:Clio Corteis)</li>

<li>I'm not really that familiar with this incident in question - oddly enough, living in Toronto, this seems to be pretty much a non-issue in the media - seems to more of a self-persecution issue in the French media than anything else. That aside however that one would insist that the term should be "Quebec bashing" rather than something like "francophone bashing" seems to be a bit odd to me ... seems to be very much of the Quebec is French bent ... which is considered politically incorrect by most people. Perhaps that is why the phrase "Quebec bashing" seems to be not very common in the English media compared to the French media. As such, this seems to point to this not being the correct article name in English. Perhaps an alternative is Francophone perceptions of "Quebec bashing" in the English media? <a href="../../../n/f/i/User%7ENfitz_2215.html" title="User:Nfitz">Nfitz</a> 23:05, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Precisely. The most respected political journalists in Quebec (Michel David, Michel C Auger, Chantal Hébert, André Pratte - certainly not all separatists) all pointed out how quickly the affair was brushed off in Toronto. In spite of letters by Harper and Charest. In spite of a unanimous vote by the House of Commons. It's never the same when it's Quebec, it's never as important. 132.212.92.162 18:37, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Give an example of how this is taken more seriously by the English media, when other provinces or governments are bashed? Perhaps the English media isn't making much fuss about this, because it's such a non-story. Second-rate columnist shoots her mouth off ... big deal, who gives a f? Why take her seriously ... in Saturday's paper she made a point of smoking in non-smoking areas - she's a much-raking journalist, that's all? I'd say more than anything, that this has become an issue in the Quebec media, is symptom of hyper-sensitivity of the Quebec media, to even the hint of criticism; and if that's the real issue, this article name needs to change. And it appears to be, as it seem important to include Howard Stern in the list of people bashing Quebec.

The Liberals denied that it was a scandal and that there had been fraud and corruption for a long time. Some people preferred to think of it as the "Liberal Sponsorship Scandal" (presumably people opposed to the Liberals). Some English language media used another term, "AdScam" for sensational effects. Using the same flawed arguments that are always used, some of the usual suspects of the English language press even tried to make it look like a Quebec specific issue, calling it the "Quebec Sponsorship Scandal" as if all of a sudden the fraud had not occured within the federal government, the government of Canada. Everyone was trying to bend things in their favor, to present their POV. In the end, the expression "Sponsorship Scandal" is the one that remained and is even used in the official documents of the Gomery Commission. The point is: the first expression that is used to name something often ends up being the most frequently used expression afterwards.

<dd>"Quebec bashing" is the name that was first given to the phenomenon by English speakers in Canada. Francophones borrowed it, preferring it over many other French expressions (campagne de salissage, dénigrement du Québec, littérature haineuse etc.) Using another English term, now, all of a sudden, because two or three Wikipedians do not personnally like it is to be rejected because it is so obviously biased.

<dd>The prime reason to for this particular portion of the debate, is to decide if the name (not the content) of the article is appropriate in the English; so examples from the French media are not relevent. It would appear that all the examples you cite are from within Quebec; what about examples of the use of this phrase from outside Quebec? It's ironic though, that the best reference there, the Montreal Gazette, used "Quebec-bashing" not "Quebec bashing"; however when I moved the article from "Quebec bashing" to what is the clearly proper grammar at "Quebec-bashing", it was reverted, by someone posting in this page, who had "never seen this way spelled"!!! <a href="../../../n/f/i/User%7ENfitz_2215.html" title="User:Nfitz">Nfitz</a> 23:16, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

I'd hardly use this as an example of how the word is used outside Quebec! The issue is badly covered in the English media, because there is no evidence that the English media is treating Quebec any differently than anywhere else. It's very rare to see an negative article about Quebec in the English media - why the French media seems to hunt out every single negative article and hype it, is beyond me! The new Globe and Star quotes are interesting ... again, note the hyphenation ... "Quebec-bashing" not "Quebec bashing" in both. However, the Star article is quoting a francophone, when the word bash is used, so this is can't be used as a source for how the word is used. <a href="../../../n/f/i/User%7ENfitz_2215.html" title="User:Nfitz">Nfitz</a> 23:26, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>DELETE</b> -- This is an attack article, attacking individuals—some deceased—who cannot defend themselves. The article is rife with factual inaccuracies and logical errors (as well as containing poor grammar and diction). It is an attempt to protect an illegitimate political ideology from legitimate criticism; and, it purports to assert a non-existent pervasive "hostility." The "examples" given, are, in fact, an exhaustive list of all major and minor media criticism now existing in respect of the province of Quebec; and, therefore, they are not examples at all; thus, the "examples" purport to show a grand conspiracy against the French of the province of Quebec; when, in fact, there is no deluge of criticism. The exhaustiveness of the "examples" given reaches the absurd when even radio host Howard Stern's criticism is taken seriously; that, to say the least, is humorless. The article does not, as it appears to claim, merely inform. It by-passes legitimate criticism as purported "bashing," but fails to have a full command of the sources of criticism (the criticism of Richler's <i>Oh Canada! Oh Quebec!</i>, for example, shows that this book was either unread or misunderstood). This last assertion is the article's most fatal flaw. It doesn't criticize the primary sources so much as parroting the criticism of others; and, in that respect, the article is unoriginal and doesn't really add anything to the questionable material already available on the Internet. Its one-sidedness, its unbalanced tone, its tendentious sources, its errors and inaccuracies, furthermore, make the article patently un-encyclopedic.</li>

<dd>"[..] the extremely reductionist analysis of this issue carried out by the anglophone media outside Québec is to be deplored. Rather than having to acknowledge the fact that the French-language school system was sharing the international controversies regarding the balance to be found between the public space and the individual rights on the one hand, and religious and cultural diversity on the other, it chose to present the case as another proof of the hypotheses that tribalism would still [be] the dominant mode of ethnic relations in Québec. This should not come as a surprise when one knows the tendency of the anglophone media to ethnicise, and even in certain cases, to demonise the entire nationalist movement, and, by extension, the francophone population in Québec (see Cisco and Gagné, “Le Québec vu par le Canada anglais”, Voir, 18-24 June 1998 and M. Potvin (in collaboration with M. McAndrew), “Les dérapages racistes à l’égard du Québec au Canada anglais depuis 1995”. Politique et Sociétés, vol. 18, no 2, 1999, p. 101-132)."</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I just quit a job in Montreal in an english-speaking environment because not a week would go by without me hearing a comment about how conservative, backward, catholic, etc. Quebec society was. OUT OF THE BLUE, I would be lectured by a variety of people about: antisemitism, my oppression of english speakers, racism, aboriginal rights, fascism in Quebec (with the suggestion that it lurked in me as well),etc. In another anglophone work environment, I was told the continued existence of French in Canada was a historical mistake, and that gratefully we would soon disappear. I witness more or less blatant forms of prejudice towards either Quebec or francophone Quebeckers on a regular basis. It is a very real phenomenon, which fosters divisiveness and misunderstanding. Why are people like me contributing for the first time??? Because it is an issue that burns many of us directly, and recent events have brought it to the forefront.

<p>The term exists, the phenomenon exists, the article documents and explains them through examples, frome more serious to less serious media, but usually important media, such as the <i>Globe &amp; Mail</i>. Here's an example of the expression, as used in a blog&#160;: "I wanted to share this story with you, since this is not really being covered in the English Canadian media, because in Canada, it's apparently an impossible task to get the exact same news in two languages, something they actually do in Europe (...) I can't say that I'm suprised this is coming from the Globe &amp; Mail, this isn't the first time they've carried on this Quebec bashing". <a href="http://thejf.blogspot.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://thejf.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">[72]</a> Thus, a term that is used while the examples are seldom reported on or reflected upon in English-Canadian papers certainly warrants an article in a free encyclopedia. One will immediately know from this article what "Quebec bashing" refers to, without being coerced into what to think about the examples. Apparently people here have shown they managed to develop very different opinions of them. The will of some to eliminate even the discussion of the topic shows the actual encyclopedic use of this article&#160;: spread knowledge, counter ignorance. Clio Corteis</p>

<dd>Do some people view the very existence of this article as a danger? There seems to be a lot of resentment and suspicion in some of the comments suggesting to delete it. If a certain group perceives to be repeatedly targeted by a certain set of prejudices, can they not create an article which describes the phenomenon? If there exist books, articles, etc. which counter the perceived phenomenon of Quebec bashing, then include them in the article. (unsigned comment by 66.131.133.47)</dd>

When is an issue worthy of mention in Wikipedia? An attack on what and by whom anyway? Since the very beginning, I say that there IS a minor neutrality problem with the article, as you said because it is not made explicit who is the "owner" of such and such claim and also because the English was not always correct. That can be fixed and that is why there is a copy edit tag on the article. Since when do imperfect articles deserve to be deleted? We understand that many people cannot go and read the French articles and verify for themselves: that's a problem. Because of that, the copyediting job will have to include the addition of more translated quotations.

<li>It's certainly true that an anti-Quebec phenomenon exists in some media, and we've even seen it crop up on Wikipedia in the edits of certain users who tended to vastly overplay any example of a Quebec political or cultural figure making a racially or ethnically biased statement against anglophones, while simultaneously <i>burying</i> examples of English Canadian figures doing the same against francophones. (I won't name them lest I accidentally invoke them, but you <i>do</i> all remember who I'm talking about, right?) But at the same time, "bashing" is a word that can be (and probably has been, by now) added to absolutely any noun in the world in response to any negative statement whatsoever about that noun. Dog bashing, cat bashing, America bashing, Canada bashing, gay bashing, Bush bashing, Jew bashing, and on, and so forth, and that doesn't make every noun string composed of "(insert noun here) bashing" worthy of an article — nine times out of ten, the phrase represents a POV war more than anything else.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I would also take issue with the notion that Quebec-bashing sentiment represents some kind of <i>mainstream</i> of Canadian media opinion; any article that posits wingnuts like <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diane_Francis_5bcc.html" title="Diane Francis">Diane Francis</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don_Cherry_%28hockey%29_221f.html" title="Don Cherry (hockey)">Don Cherry</a> or <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Galganov_fb83.html" title="Howard Galganov">Howard Galganov</a> as some kind of <i>norm</i> in Canadian media needs a reality check. Not to mention that I <i>really</i> don't think we can conflate <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawrence_Martin_b9a4.html" title="Lawrence Martin">Lawrence Martin</a>'s criticism of <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucien_Bouchard_485e.html" title="Lucien Bouchard">Lucien Bouchard</a>, fair or not, with some kind of condemnation of Quebec society as a whole. (Well, okay, maybe if we wanted to depict Bouchard as some kind of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fisher_King_aa81.html" title="The Fisher King">Fisher King</a>, but I think I can safely assume that we <i>don't</i> want to do that.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>All of that said, I don't <i>fundamentally</i> object to the article, given that we also have things like <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Canadianism_c0c1.html" title="Anti-Canadianism">Anti-Canadianism</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Americanism_e60d.html" title="Anti-Americanism">Anti-Americanism</a>, but it certainly needs a POV scrub. I'd also suggest that we move the title from "Quebec bashing" to something closer to the "Anti-Canadianism"/"Anti-Americanism" title convention. But if those things are done, I'm perfectly fine with a <b>keep</b>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 00:25, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> with major changes, as I think the perception of Quebec in English media is a noteworthy subject. I don't like the "X bashing" formula for titles, and the phrase "Quebec bashing" is absolutely not notable in itself in Canadian English.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>My main complaint with the article is that it should be placed in a larger context of relations between Quebec and the rest of Canada. Though it is impeccably sourced and the material included is generally appropriate, the extreme focus on the negative makes it very difficult for me to believe that this article was not conceived with a polemical purpose in mind. Reading the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec_bashing.html#Themes" title="Quebec bashing">Themes</a> alone makes one think the anglos are a bunch of noose-wielding Orangemen.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One example of the slant of the writing is the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec_bashing.html#Jan_Wong" title="Quebec bashing">Jan Wong</a> bit: it sources a large number of Quebecers as criticizing her idiotic article, but the only Canadian from outside Quebec quoted is Harper. Of course Quebecers are going to be more incensed by Wong's comments than other Canadians, as the subject was their own culture. But there was a furious reaction against Wong throughout English Canadian media, and the strange omission of this gives the impression that the non-Quebec anglo media was indifferent or supportive of Wong's comments. --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 07:48, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for your constructive comments and good words. I quoted not only Harper, but also the G&amp;M editorial (which was not on the same side as Harper and most Quebec journalists but that was their decision). I simply could not unearth that many more comments positive or negative from English Canada (i.e. the territorial entity, as I quoted all Anglo-Quebecers I could find: The Gazette, Macpherson, Jedwab...) and I stressed that by quoting the Globe saying that, in English Canada, the reaction has been, I quote, "considerably more muted", which addressed the issue the best I could with the available material. It's the Globe that seems to validate the idea of indifference. Now, I have just heard something on radio archives on the net that could show an opposite English Canadian voice... from a former Anglo-Quebecois, told on Quebec French-speaking radio (and even then, some things are not clear about what he said, which could make inclusion difficult).</dd>
<dd>So: do suggest editorials, columns or other pertinent finds from English Canada from either sides if you find some, with the appropriate sources. The "Themes" section is not pretty, but they're all things you find in there (not one slightly contentious theme is nor referenced), in what is stressed to be "allegated examples of Quebec bashing", not "typical, mainstream, general English Canadian press". The debate on how much this represents an opinion in English Canada is mentioned in the introduction and developping on this is next on my list.</dd>
<dd>The title is just the expression most common, and that is stressed also in the very first sentence. It's like the article <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_Mafia_b47c.html" title="Gay Mafia">Gay Mafia</a>. People don't go, about the wikipedia title: "well, it's not exactely a mafia; would 'cartel' be better? How about 'syndicate'? Maybe we should try 'commonly motivated group of folks of a homophile tendency with a non-pre-judged possible but not proven and even disputed goal'. It's just the word people have stuck to it; Wikipedia doesn't say they're a mafia, those people do. You raise that this should "be placed in a larger context of relations between Quebec and the rest of Canada". That's what the "Context" section was added for; it's new but it attempts to do this and, at the very least, does so partially. --<a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELiberlogos_df62.html" title="User:Liberlogos">Liberlogos</a> 10:35, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Yes, "Quebec bashing" (795 ghits) is a phrase that is used on occasion, but so is "Canada bashing" (12,000 ghits) and "America bashing" (163,000 ghits) - neither of which have Wikipedia entries. Examples of "Canada bashing" and "America bashing" are provided within, respectively, the Anti-Canadianism and Anti-Americanism articles. Frankly, I don't see "Quebec bashing" as a subset of Anti-Quebec sentiment. I wonder, what are the others? I fear the determination as to what is "Quebec bashing" and what isn't - while still being considered Anti-Quebec sentiment - would be highly subjective. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 16:38, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Rewrite or delete</b>. Weaselwords notwithstanding, the article is blatantly POV presuming "Quebec Bashing" is wrong. Since when is free speech wrong? The physical bashing of a live person is wrong, the metaphorical bashing of a social movement is not necessarily so. Inciting to hatred is (in Canada) illegal, but there is nothing immoral about free speech. A balanced article would be OK. Food for thought: Should there be a Canada Bashing article? (No.) Comedian <a href="../../../y/v/o/Yvon_Deschamps_5fa8.html" title="Yvon Deschamps">Yvon Deschamps</a> often does routines about Anglos speaking incorrect French, without anyone in the Anglo community complaining, but I remember a stand up routine in English about how silly <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clint_Eastwood_469b.html" title="Clint Eastwood">Clint Eastwood</a> sounds when Dirty Harry is dubbed into French (the joke being he would say "Aiyoye!" instead of "Ouch!")

<li><b>Delete</b> With a certain degree of regret, I change my vote (above). My reasoning is four-fold:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1) While I agree that the term "Quebec bashing" is in usage, I have not been able to find a definition of the term outside of this article. Furthermore, I do not agree with the definition and, it would appear, I am not alone.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Quebec_bashing#Definition" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Quebec_bashing#Definition" rel="nofollow">[73]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Quebec_bashing#Only_in_the_media.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Quebec_bashing#Only_in_the_media.3F" rel="nofollow">[74]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Quebec_bashing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=20" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Quebec_bashing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=20" rel="nofollow">[75]</a> Quite obviously, one cannot create an article around a term for which there is no precise definition.</dd>
<dd>2) With the exception of <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan_bashing.html" title="Japan bashing">Japan</a>, no other geopolitical entity or ethnic group has a similarly titled article, this despite more prevelant usage. To repeat a previous observation, there is no Wikipedia article entitled "America bashing" despite a ghit of 161,000 (over 206 times greater that the 779 ghit for "Quebec bashing"). Fair or unfair, criticisms of the United States are included in Wikipedia's <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Americanism_e60d.html" title="Anti-Americanism">Anti-Americanism</a> article.
<dl>
<dd>For both 1) and 2)&#160;: The article Anti-Americanism a complete mess. The first few lines make it clear the contributors failed to properly define the subject "refers to a prejudice against the government, culture, or people of the United States. In practice, a broad range of attitudes and actions critical of or opposed to the United States have been labeled anti-Americanism and the applicability of the term is often disputed." Should we also delete this article too? Some people are strong on the delete button. The dicussion on the definition is important and not over. You are invited to come back. -- <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathieugp_c3f3.html" title="User:Mathieugp">Mathieugp</a> 23:29, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>3) It is my opinion that since the nomination the article has moved farther from the policy of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>. Moreover, it contains elements of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. The attempt to define "Quebec bashing" is one obvious example. I will single out the final sentences in the "Themes" section as another example: "They [Quebec bashers] will also sometimes emphasize the superiority of English Canadian or Anglo-Saxon conceptions of democracy, individual liberty and multiculturalism, as well as the world ascendancy of English Canadian tolerance of dissent or "treason", claiming that "only in Canada" could such things be tolerated. Because of these higher morals and principles, Quebec is portrayed as being kept away from sliding into a more somber state only by its association with Canada and its leaders." To whom, one wonders, does this theory belong?
<dl>
<dd>This should indeed be attributed to the right person. Using an unidentified "They" here is one of the reason the copyedit tag is there.

Leaving aside issues of transcription and copyright - it would appear they are posting at least some articles without permission - the reader is constantly being directed to a website with a clear political agenda (their collection of articles on Mordecai Richler, for example, is titled "Le salisseur-en-chef").

<dd>Unfortunately for us, the websites of major newspaper sites do not keep a history of their articles.

<dd>I'm disapointed by your change of heart, but I respect it. <a href="../../../v/i/g/Vigile.net.html" title="Vigile.net">Vigile.net</a> is being relied on because, its archive, standing since 1995, is much more stable than those of most of the newspapers concerned. When the link goes dead for the article on the newspaper's website, chances are the link on Vigile will still be there and remain for years and years to come. Vigile is a press coverage and archive service. Its partisan aspect does not interfere with its archiving: the articles are word for word those from the Globe, the Post, the Devoir, the Presse, etc. Vigile is not the source, these papers are; Vigile is used only for the safety its text storage provides. Also, some of these articles are online, but protected from non-subscribers on the original newspapers' websites. If somehow Vigile was still a problem, most could be found elsewhere, we'd change the links and that would be that. I am very surprised to read that you think it has become actually less NPOV: since the nomination, not only useful tweaking of the existing text has occured but also the addition of the sections "Debate" and "Different depictions" that greatly temper the article, as well as the section "Context", that mentions the Parizeau referendum speech and the Michaud Affair, as well as the finding of an English Canadian criticism (in an article) for Wong and a passage added about her talking about the Devoir cartoon.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If you disagree with the title, that's entirely another debate and Wikipedia has its own different way of dealing with this (templates and talk pages). First, I'll say that, golly, Googlesearches aren't The supreme reference on everything. Also, comparing "America bashing" with "Quebec bashing" is not apt for a number of reasons. The United States has exponentially more population and world influence and relations than Quebec. But as importantly if not more, the fact that the expression is in English tricks us into false analogies and analysis. "America bashing" will be discussed in English (within and without the USA), where the words are not a colloquialism, not a loaned expression, it's a natural assembling of two English words and therefor will appear much more easily. "Quebec bashing", will be discussed in French (mostly within Quebec exclusively, in a much smaller population). It is a loaned expression from another language and is not therefor a natural assembling of words; it will be used only when refering to that specific expression. Finally, I have seen your attempts to contribute constructively to the article; thank you. --<a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELiberlogos_df62.html" title="User:Liberlogos">Liberlogos</a> 20:44, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for your comments. I, too, am disappointed that I felt obliged to change my vote. Again, while I think that there is most certainly a place on Wikipedia for an article dealing with Anti-Quebec sentiment, my primary concern is that the title "Quebec bashing" has not been properly defined. Respectfully, that you've defined it as one subset of Anti-Quebecois sentiment leads me to wonder how many other articles are to follow - and, as I've previously written, exactly where the line is to be drawn. I would prefer one comprehensive article - again, to belabour the point, like Wikipedia's <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Americanism_e60d.html" title="Anti-Americanism">Anti-Americanism</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Canadianism_c0c1.html" title="Anti-Canadianism">Anti-Canadianism</a> - than a vaguely defined series. Point taken concerning ghits and the relative populations and influence of Quebec and the United States - though I hasten to add that "Toronto bashing" has 841,000 ghits, while the population of the city (and I daresay, its influence) is less than that of Quebec. Though I would argue the contrary, I do recognize the possibility that "Quebec bashing" might be a term used more amongst French-speakers. If so, might it not be a term considered for redirection on the English-language edition of Wiki? Just a thought.</dd>

<dd>Point also taken concerning Vigile.net's archives. That said, I hold true to the idea that the source <i>is</i> the source. If a link does go dead, so be it - in this country confirmation requires nothing more than a trip to a major library. Outside Canada, I suppose one might have to query a fellow Wikipedian. Inconvenient, yes - but I maintain that it is inappropriate to rely on a third-party source, particularly one with a clear-cut political agenda. While I don't for a moment believe that the articles found on Vigil have in any way been altered, I would find myself unable to defend the site against such an accusation - particularly as, again, these pieces seem to have been archived without permission.</dd>

<dd>I resent the fact that a user has inserted his own comments into my communication (above - 19:58, 30 September 2006). Not only is the act a clear violation of Wiki policy, it is serves to confuse as this occured after another user had responded to my comments (to which I had in turn responded). That said, I will address <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathieugp_c3f3.html" title="User:Mathieugp">Mathieugp</a>'s comments. I'm afraid the quality of the Anti-Americanism article is irrelevant to this discussion. The fact is that "Anti-Americanism" is a well-defined term. Among other dictionaries, "Anti-Americanism" is defined within the pages of <i>The Oxford English Dictionary</i> (which cites the first usage of the term as having taken place in 1844). The fact is that we have yet, despite all our work, found any definition of "Quebec bashing". I maintain that to build an article around a term that has yet to be defined outside of Wikipedia is, simply put, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. I stand firm on my opinion concerning the use of Vigile.net and await an argument as to why a biased third-party, apparently unlawfully archiving the writings of others, should be considered an appropriate reference source.<a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVictoriagirl_1259.html" title="User:Victoriagirl">Victoriagirl</a> 22:16, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>A Disquieting Degeneration into outright antisemitism.</b> I shall reproduce verbatim the patent nonsense under the rubric “Esther Delisle”:</li>
</ul>
<p>“Esther Delisle received an education in politic [sic] with israelis [sic] researcher specialist in nazi and antisemitic speech [sic] before she study history [sic]. She give speech for the B'nai Brith organisation in synagogue [sic].”</p>
<p>So what is the implication, or relevance, of the unreferenced assertion that: “Esther Delisle received an education in politic [sic] with israelis [sic] researcher specialist in nazi and antisemitic speech [sic] before she study history [sic]. She give speech for the B'nai Brith organisation in synagogue [sic]”?</p>
<p>And, yes, this does sound like <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=2505022&amp;page=1" class="external text" title="http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=2505022&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">Borat from Khazakstan</a>. Clearly, this nonsense reflects the rampant antisemitism of the “movement” that the author of this “article” is apparently a member of.</p>
<p>For those who are unable to see the implication, however, let me explain.</p>
<p>The strange reasoning is that no “pure wool” French Canadian would study in Israel or, worse, attend a Synagogue. In other words Delisle is being dismissed as a “Jew”; notwithstanding that she is both French and Roman Catholic; just not “pure” enough.</p>

<dd>That passage was added by one individual whose only contribution was this. I, the main contributer to the article, am actually the one who put the "clean-up" tag and I had erased completly another similar addition to the same section. If it proves anything about my edits, it's that I'm much much less biased than you want to desperately portray me, and it's dishonest (or badly researched) to try to make people think this excerpt represents the work of the main contributer, or the whole article. The passage in question is a mess. It's undermining the article. I'm pulling it from the text. Do not speculate on my personal political opinions; I'm contributing here as a Wikipedian and citizen of the world. Also, as the article proves, this is a cross-ideology issue.

<li><b>Keep, but re-word it</b>. This is just insane. i thought wikipedia disproved of insulting and bashing other cultures. my vote is to either word it in a way so that it is inoffensive towards quebecois viewers (or those that may seem a bit annoyed/angered/hurt), or to simply delete and protect. Yes, the topic is legitimately useful for researching the culture of English Canada versus French Canada, but it shouldn't be done in a mean-spirited light. <span style="border: 2px solid #330000; text-align:center; background: #C0C0C0; text-color: #DDDDDD; link: #A0522D; vlink: #000000"><b><a href="../../../r/a/c/User%7ERaccoonFox_8c42.html" title="User:RaccoonFox">RaccoonFox</a></b> • <a href="../../../r/a/c/User_talk%7ERaccoonFox_3002.html" title="User talk:RaccoonFox"><b>Talk</b></a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RaccoonFox_7a73.html" title="Special:Contributions/RaccoonFox"><b>Stalk</b></a> 05:15, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</span></li>

<dd>Gosh darnit. People, this article examines the phenomenon of many people *saying* there's "Quebec bashing", Wikipedia doesn't ever use "bashing" itself, authoritatively ("it is a term used by people" and "it has been called", not "Quebec has been bashed especially since..."). It's the subject of the article; why remove it from the title? I know it's not clear to people outside but, to a great number of French-speaking people in Quebec, the words "Quebec bashing" spring to mind instantly something very clear, while something else would be more nebulous. As I was saying above, do we bust our heads in changing the title of <a href="../../../g/a/y/Gay_Mafia_b47c.html" title="Gay Mafia">Gay Mafia</a>? Do we go at <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheese-eating_surrender_monkeys.html" title="Cheese-eating surrender monkeys">Cheese-eating surrender monkeys</a> saying "Are they really into all cheeses, or is it more of a Camembert thing? Monkeys is a little too narrow, some of them act more like lemurs." An attempt to change the name seems distorting. But I am not entierly closed to the idea. This will be decided in a *different forum*. If a name had to be chosen, it would have to resemble this: Anti-Quebecois sentiment in the media since the Quiet Revolution. We must fix it in time: it makes sense since the current alleged media bias is linked to the emergence of the modern Quebec nationalism and if we don't, there's a lot of stuff from the 19th century papers we'll have to rake up, and I feel that for now this can be addressed in the future parent page <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Quebecois_sentiment_fd14.html" title="Anti-Quebecois sentiment">Anti-Quebecois sentiment</a> (it's a redirect as I'm writing this; long story). --<a href="../../../l/i/b/User%7ELiberlogos_df62.html" title="User:Liberlogos">Liberlogos</a> 11:13, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I was kind of fond of Francophone perceptions of "Quebec bashing" in the English media. Seriously though, there seems to be way too much original research in this article.

<li>"Notable" isn't something that you <i>do</i>. The word "notable" means, literally, "worthy of note". Since notes are written records, the word "notable" essentially refers to something that is likely to have written records about it (which, since we're writing an encyclopedia here, is a good thing because we need those as sources). Based on what's in the article right now, it seems quite likely that quite a bit has been written about the school over the ages, making it "notable". <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 23:46, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia. An encyclopedia catalogues knowledge. Each of the articles speaks solely to the content of the episode. There may be times when the article is more of a note than an article, but it still contains information. I have read through the articles; I have read Volumes 1 through 11 of Naruto. These articles are fairly accurate -- barring some translation issues yet to be completely cleared up. I believe some articles may need to be combined and/or clean-up, but none of them should be removed. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by SalvatoreRichardGomes (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SalvatoreRichardGomes_2073.html" title="Special:Contributions/SalvatoreRichardGomes">contribs</a>) 2006-09-24 02:25:32 (UTC)</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per above for now. Currently, (as I am aware of) there is no policy forbidding episode articles.

<li>The relevant policy is <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>. If individual episodes of television shows have not already been documented individually outside of Wikipedia, they may not be documented individually in Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> Please do not say that using an episode itself is original research, as it's not. The episodes themselves are the source. In addition, Naruot is a pretty notible show. Is it Pokemon, The Simpsons, or Star Trek? No. But is has spawned things in Japanese youth culture, among other things; that said, I agree with Tutmosis that the best thing would be to have singular articles of only the most notible ones. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelodia_4ad5.html" title="User:Melodia">♫ Melodia Chaconne ♫</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Like anybody wants to read the summary of a saga. Maybe they would, but it'd be better to look for the episodes and points in the timeline you care about. The reason these pages should be kept is for the reasons that the plot pages are too huge. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Slammenhousa (<a href="../../../s/l/a/User_talk%7ESlammenhousa_9b26.html" title="User talk:Slammenhousa">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Slammenhousa_f5d9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Slammenhousa">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
<li><b>Delete some</b> Ok, there are some viable episodes in there. There are others that consist of the title and almost nothing else. i.e. "<i>I want to fight you! Finally they clash, Sasuke vs Naruto (Japanese: オマエと戦いたい！ついに激突 サスケVSナルト - Omae to tatakaitai! Tsui ni gekitotsu Sasuke tai Naruto)</i> is episode 107 of the anime series Naruto. The episode's storyline is the first part of the Sasuke Retrieval manga arc." Some editors love to create pages just to fill in series boxed. (I know! I do it on an outside fandom wiki.) I do not think every individual episode of a TV show is notable enough Wikipedia, but we have no one but <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">Jimmy Wales</a> to blame for their inclusion. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 15:36, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep all</b> for two reasons. First, <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia%7ECentralized_discussion_Television_episodes_d747.html" title="Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Television episodes">Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Television episodes</a> recommends merging instead of deletion (although at least some of these articles could probably stand on their own and don't need to be merged). Second, there's far too many articles nominated here to be able to research the encyclopedia-worthiness of every single one. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 15:57, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep; merge as needed, relist particularly problematic episode articles individually</b>. This is a <i>massively</i> overbroad nomination; I've always said "AfD Isn't Cleanup", and I say for emphasis that "AfD Isn't the 20-Megaton Nuke to Level Tons of Cruft at Once" either. There's limits to what's sensible to bundle in one AfD, and one just <i>doesn't</i> nominate entire category of 200 articles up for deletion at once! Just look at what's happening with the esoteric programming language stuff right now: massive AfD that got reversed and is now being carried out again really slowly, <i>as it should.</i> And that was far less than 200 articles! --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 16:13, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Individual articles for each episode is a way of condensing the main article about the series without omitting data. If these articles are simply cut-n-pastes of parts of the main article, then the main article can be precised with impunity. In my opinion, deleting the individual articles is not an appropriate response to the duplication. And I share the reservations about the scope of this nomination; it is de trop. —<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 16:54, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> And I forgot to mention: True there are appropriate plot summaries that already exist. However, if that was a viable excuse, well, Wikipedia wouldn't have any articles would it? Everything on Wikipedia is a compilation of information from appropriate sources. Anyone can go onto google and find an article on President Bush, stem cell research, immigration, the Revolutionary War, tuberculosis, Mario Tennis, and the like. Including the topic at hand: Episode Summaries. Though I have to say, it's much harder to find plot summaries for specific episodes of a television series taking place in a fictional universe than any of the other topics listed above. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYou_Can%27t_See_Me%21_320d.html" title="User:You Can't See Me!">You Can't See Me!</a> 04:01, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Definitely Keep</b>: We should definitely keep the episodes!! For one thing, I spent hours writing some of those articles myself!! Wikipedia is an international forum and there's those who can't watch the episodes for whatever reason!! It's not like we're posting episode downloads here and the summaries don't really have episode images!! I think if Naruto fans knew what were going on in the episodes it would encourage them to buy the DVDs!! So I say we keep the articles!!
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b>: Wikipedia doesn't exist "to encourage people to buy the DVDs". Images or lack of them aren't the issue here either; nor does the fact someone spent a lot of time on an article make it a valid reason for keeping them. As I said above, my opinion is that the best thing to do is keep the most notible episodes, but this particular AFD isn't the best way of going about a consensus toward that. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelodia_4ad5.html" title="User:Melodia">♫ Melodia Chaconne ♫</a> 11:44, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> The precedent is rather ridiculous. Aside from South Park, there are Friends, Seinfeld and the list goes on. The fact that people have written so extensively about it proves that the show is notable enough to merit this. Mergers or expansions are called for, not deletion. An episode summary logically offers an opportunity for a more detailed and specific synopsis than an overall plot summary. If the episode descriptions were specific than the Plot of Naruto and Naruto II sections which some people have called too long could be reduced without a great loss of information, though reducing the plot pages may not be possible in any event simply because Naruto has a long and fairly intricate plot.Rayfire 18:07, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Bad reason to be deleting. All this needs is a little cleaning. Jerwong 21:26, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep, but clean up</b> It seems that some, if not most, of the episodes in question, primarily those in the beginning, have enough information to warrant individual articles. However, two or three episode long filler arcs should be merged into one article. As for the ones that basically have a name and an episode number, more information needs to be gathered. However, if we were to delete every episode from the list in favor of a brief summary, we could in theory delete every stub here in favor of a massive compilation of related, yet vague, information. The individual episode descriptors expound on the information given in the summary, but to actually add that information to the summary itself would make it too unwieldy. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasterRadius_dcfd.html" title="User:MasterRadius">MasterRadius</a> 05:02, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><font color="#CC0000"><b>STRONG Delete -- Wikipedia is a <i>general</i> encyclopedia</b>.</font> The fact that it is on computers doesn't change that.

<dd>I just realized that Frenchman113 is voting to delete ALL of the articles in question, not just the less-notable ones. It actually seems to me that Frenchman is voting on this not out of concern fo bandwidth and space, but out of personal bias against the show. Think about it: Frenchy used a bot to list every single episode under AfD, meaning he didn't even check them for content- he just deemed them unworthy, offering was that it was "Tons of fancruft, non of which as new info" as his justification. It has been clarified that most people who voted on this want to keep it, albeit with minor changes in some cases, but the few who claim deletion a definite edict have or can have their views disproved, save for their dislike of anime. Furthermore, the Frenchman rersorts to personal attacks on a regular basis, even referring to those who vote against him his "foes". Truthfully, if this really warranted such an extreme clause of deletion, we wouldn't be talking about it; it'd be gone already. The fact that this "conversation", if you can call it that, is being held means it needs to stay. If you feel we should clean it up, don't vote here; start a new discussion regarding its reorganization. However, under no circumstances should we delete over 200 articles just because some french guy labels them as "fancruft".<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasterRadius_dcfd.html" title="User:MasterRadius">MasterRadius</a> 19:44, 28 September 2006 (UTC), and the horse you rode in on

<li><b>Keep</b>: At worst, this is a work in progress. Yes, a print encyclopedia would not have detailed summaries of every episode, but WP is better as an encyclopedia for having them, and its hardly a huge burden in terms of K. The plot summaries may contain some of the same information, but a history of WW2 may contain reference to battles that have their own pages. I also vote that we end this now, seeing that the keep vote is overwhelming. Note also that while a plot summary is not enough for a good article, "A plot summary may be appropriate as an aspect of a larger article, or as part of a series of articles..." I would say that the episode pages are most certainly aspects of the larger Naruto articles. Plunge 21:21, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>OK, so his thesis got published in a journal. As a rule, one journal article does not equal encyclopedic notability. I think this is below the threshold.
