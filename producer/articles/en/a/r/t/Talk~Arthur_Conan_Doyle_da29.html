<p>There's a story somewhat popular among preachers that goes like this: Doyle was a practical joker. Once he sent the same telegram to twelve of his friends: "All is discovered. Flee at once." All twelve left the country.</p>
<p>Google turns up a number of such citations <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22flee+at+once%22+arthur+conan+doyle" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22flee+at+once%22+arthur+conan+doyle" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>This looks like a hoax, or <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_legend.html" title="Urban legend">urban legend</a> to me. I recall having heard something about it before, but <i>almost every single citation</i> I discovered turns up in a sermon, used to illustrate the well-travelled theme of <b>guilt</b>.

<p>Is anyone familiar with what Copyrights to the Holmes character were held by <a href="../../../d/a/m/Dame_Jean_Conan_Doyle_4265.html" title="Dame Jean Conan Doyle">Dame Jean Conan Doyle</a> before her death? According to one biography her brother sold off some of the copyrights and original manuscripts in an illegal sale to an American University in order to retain his french estate. I was just hoping to beef-up the Jean Conan Doyle article with more info.</p>
<p>Also, pherhaps we could add more information around the legal copyrights of Conan Doyle. I know that he had to sell the copyright of A Study in Scarlet in order to get it publish and recived a total of 20 pounds for the story...but by the late 1980's Jean Conan Doyle could still axe certain Holmes publications and complained to the producers of <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_The_Next_Generation_935d.html" title="Star Trek The Next Generation">Star Trek The Next Generation</a> when <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brent_Spiner_6ddb.html" title="Brent Spiner">Brent Spiner</a> played Sherlock Holmes in a holodeck episode.</p>

<p>In article 7 of his will Arthur Conan Doyle wrote: "My executors shall deal as they think best with copyrights, plays, cinema rights, or unpublished MSS, it being my wish that the advice and cooperation of A.S. Watt of 10 Norfolk Street be always obtained. The yearly income on the capital sums derived from such sources shall always be divided as already stated-one half to my wife, one half divided among three younger children."</p>
<p>(You can view jpgs of Doyle's will as well as the transcribed version here: <a href="http://www.foolscap-quill.com/sherlockholmes5.html" class="external free" title="http://www.foolscap-quill.com/sherlockholmes5.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.foolscap-quill.com/sherlockholmes5.html</a> )</p>
<p>This is a really bad way to devise (give by will) your literary property. The result was that the copyrights remained in the Doyle estate without a neutral party to oversee them.</p>
<p>Doyle designated his wife Jean and his eldest son Denis as executors. However, Doyle's children (especially Adrian, who is referred to as "Malcolm" in the will) and their surviving spouses and heirs have feuded over the copyrights for almost 70 years.</p>
<p>I don't believe this is matter that Wikipedia should get into the middle of.</p>

<dd>Yes, that was a fascinating article. I heard the suggestion somewhere that the method of Sherlock Holmes was the method of medical diagnostics that Holmes learned in medical school from one of his teachers in particular. Anyway, here are my notes of that NEJM article:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>NEJM, 8 Dec 2005, 353(23):2426, Perspective: Medical History: The Medical Detectives, Howard Markel. Arthur Conan Doyle was a medical journalist, and broke a story on the limitations of Robert Koch's treatment for tuberculosis. Koch announced a "remedy for tuberculosis," on 6 Aug 1890, at the 10th International Medical Congress, Berlin. This was "Koch's lymph," a glycerin extract of tuberculosis germs. It was reported 13 Nov 1890 Deutsche Medizinische Wochenscrift, 15 Nov 1890 BMJ, 16 Nov 1890 New York Times. Koch never claimed that he discovered a "cure," but that his "remedy destroyed the tissue in which the tuberculosis germs had settled, so that the entire diseased area would simply be sloughed off and then expelled through coughing." Conan Doyle, who had published A Study in Scarlet in 1887, read the translation of Koch's paper in BMJ, which announced that Ernst von Bergmann would demonstrate the tuberculosis remedy at the University of Berlin later that week. [Conan Doyle's wife, Louise Hawkins, had TB.] Conan Doyle immediately boarded a train for London, got an assignment to write about it from the Review of Reviews, and arrived in Berlin 16 Nov. But tickets to von Bergmann's clinical demonstration were "simply not to be had and neither money nor interest could procure them." Conan Doyle went to Koch's home, but the butler told Conan Doyle that Koch was unavailable. On 17 Nov, Conan Doyle went to the medical auditorium, "but neither bribes nor his clumsy attempts at slipping by the ticket taker" secured him entry. Conan Doyle threw himself in front of von Bergmann and said, "I have come a thousand miles. May I not come in?" Bergman glared through his pince-nez and replied, to laughs and jeers, "Perhaps you would like to take my place? That is the only one vacant!" Henry J. Hartz, TB specialist from Detroit, was appaled by von Bergmann's bad behavior, and agreed to share his notes. Next morning, Hartz escorted Conan Doyle into von Bergmann's clinical wards to examine the patients treated by Koch's lymph. After analyzing the data, Conan Doyle concluded, "The whole thing was experimental and premature," as he wrote in the London Daily Telegraph of 20 Nov 1890, and in the Review of Reviews. Koch's lymph left germs "deep in the invaded country," and its real value was as an aid to diagnosis. In 1891, Koch admitted this.<a href="../../../n/b/a/User%7ENbauman_bc94.html" title="User:Nbauman">Nbauman</a> 10:06, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wikipedia currently lists illustrator Richard Doyle as Arthur Conan Doyle's father. However, in <i>Victorian Fairy Painting</i>, published by the Royal Academy of Arts, London in 1997, Victorianists Pamela White Trimpe (p 58) and Jeremy Maas (p 17) list Richard's brother Charles as Arthur's father. Richard and Charles were born in London, which is where Richard also died. Charles, on the other hand, moved to Edinburgh. Both brothers were celebrated illustrators, but Charles less so, partly because he was institutionalized for alcoholism and epilepsy in the 1870s and remained "in and out of institutions" for the rest of his life (Trimpe 58). According to Trimpe, the work of Charles Doyle only resurfaced in the 1920s under the curation of his son, Arthur Conan Doyle.</p>

<p>This article says that Arthur Conan Doyle "helped form Portsmouth Football Club, playing as the club's first goalkeeper and occasionally as a right back between 1884 and 1890." <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portsmouth_F.C._de65.html" title="Portsmouth F.C.">Portsmouth F.C.</a> calls that assertion "a common myth": "While Conan Doyle did play for an amateur side, Portsmouth AFC, that flourished from 1882 to 1894, the first goalkeeper of the professional era was Matt Reilly who previously played for the successful Royal Artillery team." Which of these is true? <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis"><sup>Apple</sup></a><a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis"><sup>knocker</sup></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_Userboxes_0d05.html" title="User:Aecis/Userboxes"><sup>Flophouse</sup></a> 18:18, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Apparently the latter: that he played for the amateur club Portsmouth AFC, but not for its successor, the professional Portsmouth FC. There's a book on the subject reviewed <a href="http://www.sherlock-holmes.org.uk/dm.php?dm_id=250" class="external text" title="http://www.sherlock-holmes.org.uk/dm.php?dm_id=250" rel="nofollow">here</a> (<i>Sherlock Holmes Was a Pompey Keeper</i> by Kevin Smith). <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> 08:35, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I also followed up on this some on the web; while a few sites mentioned Doyle playing as goalkeeper, none gave any sort of verifiable material supporting the supposition. On the <a href="http://www.pompeyfc.premiumtv.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.pompeyfc.premiumtv.co.uk" rel="nofollow">Portsmouth F.C. official website</a>, there is no mention whatsoever of Doyle in either the History or Trivia sections — which would be a surprising omission had he actually been on the team in any capacity.

<p>The article is called "Arthur conan doyle", but the first words are sir arthur conan doyle. Surely the name of the article should be changed? --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_James_7345.html" title="User:Will James">Will James</a> 07:12, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No; the convention is to use the unadorned name for the title - otherwise, how about <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Thatcher_2770.html" title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret_Thatcher</a>, or <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_Churchill_74d2.html" title="Winston Churchill">Winston_Churchill</a>? <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28people%29_db33.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (people)">Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_(people)</a> notes:<i>article names preferably don't add qualifiers (such as "King", "Saint", "Dr.", "(person)", "(ship)"), except when this is the simplest and most NPOV way to deal with disambiguation</i>. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Burnett_2542.html" title="User:Stephen Burnett">Stephen Burnett</a> 08:49, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On this article, the hound of the baskervilles was said to be published in 1902, but in the article "The return of sherlock holmes" they say the hound was published in 1901. This contradiction could quite possibly undermine the wikipedia website and bring an end to the world as we know it. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_James_7345.html" title="User:Will James">Will James</a> 07:19, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
