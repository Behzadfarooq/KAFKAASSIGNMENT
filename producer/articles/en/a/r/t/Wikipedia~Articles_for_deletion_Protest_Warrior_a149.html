<li><b>Keep</b>. It seems notable to me with coverage in a number of different state and national newspapers. However, there needs to be more NPOV, both in the writing (there are only a few NPOV mentions) and in the references (I think only indymedia right now is a dissenting voice). Just FYI, I am opposed to the politics described in Protest Warrior but don't think that is any reason for me to vote to delete it (not that I'm implying that its nomination was motivated by political reasons). <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 00:02, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, not a speedy keep candidate, although I question the motives of the nom on this one.

<li><b>Delete</b>, while it may get some news mentions in current times, it is not notable enough for an encyclopedia that will hopefully be around for decades or centuries. A previous AfD nomination resulting in "keep" is one of the greatest obstacles to future deletion, so make sure that your nomination is accurate, thorough and persausive. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 00:31, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>So because it reaches basic notability guidelines for a group here on Wikipedia, you don't think it belongs here in the future? --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 00:34, 15 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Is this in reference to my comment? I don't think that they are notable enough for an article now, either. Perhaps the confusion is my saying "news mentions". I don't think that groups that get news mentions are necessarily notable enough for an article, now or in the future. News mentions are part of some guidelines (like <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>), but the guidelines also say that there is disagreement about the guidelines themselves and that meeting one or more of the criteria does not necessarily mean that the article should be kept. A lot of things are temporarily famous but are quickly forgotten and have no significant impact on history. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 07:04, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I forgot to answer the other comment. Yes, I would apply the same standards to other organizations, regardless of their politics.

<li><b>Keep</b> notable organization. Use of Alexa is misguided in this case. Protest Warrior <i>has</i> a web site but that doesn't mean it <i>is</i> a web site; <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> doesn't apply here. Rather, the group is known for its organization of counterdemonstrations in real life, as discussed in the sources cited in the article. The group is still active and continues to be mentioned in news coverage of events where it engages in counterprotests <a href="http://news.rgj.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060320/NEWS10/603200339/1016/NEWS" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.rgj.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060320/NEWS10/603200339/1016/NEWS" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 03:20, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> for reasons mentioned above. It is a global organization which receives moderate media attention and is active in many protests. Also, as a side note, Ben Burch seems to think that media attention is necessary for a Wikipedia organization article, although a Google News Search returns 1 result for "White Rose Society", and it has a page on Wikipedia, and also WhiteRoseSociety.org 's Alexa traffic report is <i>hardly</i> better than ProtestWarrior.com.

<li><b>Delete</b> Protest Warrior consists of very few people whatsoever. It claims to be global but offers no proof. Furthermore, it has videos on display with CLEARLY illustrate that it can mount counter-protests no larger than two dozen people. It is not global and it might have a few hundred people in it AT BEST. The forums are also incredibly small, with only a half dozen users on at any given time. It is NOT comparable to Free Republic or Democratic Underground forums. It's not worthy of anything, half the people ranting "keep" apparently are members and want attention. For God's sake, they managed to round up less than 30 people for a counter-protest at the Sept 24 March on Washington. How is it even an organization? My local PTA could put them to shame in comparable numbers. The attention mongers don't really deserve an article.--Grebrook 06:14, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

Plus an organized right wing protest group is notable because of its rarity and the fact that it hasn't managed to achieve large scale support. It tells us a lot about the political culture in the USA at this time that there are "left wing" protest organization that can get hundreds of thousands of people onto the streets, but the "right wing" cannot.

<p>DELETE-- No recent PW activity of note. No counter protests to May 1 protests nor the last Anti War protests. "Chapters' such as the Los Angeles PW Chapter have more cancelled 'operations' than successful ones. There are college republican groups with members numbering in the thousands in L.A, and PW is shunned by them for their extremist Neonazi views and tactics. Counter protest activity in most chapters is dormant.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> The group seems to be just over the threshold for notability (because of the national media coverage). The article itself though is too partisan and contains too much irrevelent material, which needs to be reworked if it's going to be kept. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakgraf_ae03.html" title="User:Makgraf">Makgraf</a> 06:21, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>A. What constitutes "vandalization?"</p>
<p>B. Do you have any substantive, confirmatory evidence that would suggest PWers are "vandalizing" this entry, or that they have created more mischief than those who are antagonistic towards PW?</p>
<p>72.68.163.158 06:34, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, the assertion that this entry is biased in favor of Protest Warrior is demonstrably false, as anyone who gave even a cursory glance to the links section would realize.</p>
<p>There is the direct link to protestwarrior.com-as is customary with these entries-an article/interview from a mainstream cable news network, a balanced piece by a well-known, reputable conservative newspaper, followed by three extremely tendentious, critical opinion pieces, from various leftist sources.</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I looked up some records and not even a week ago BenBurch Nominated and deleted a wiki entry for a site called Conservative Underground.

<dd>Another outright lie. A CU member created the entry for Ben_Burch. That was Sammy the Squid Boy who did that. I never said that a CU user created the White Rose page, only that I never did. I never said that LGF mentioned my website by name. I said that LGF's page covered the same incident. I never trolled for votes on ether of these present issues, and the CU deletion that succeeded was not even a matter I was aware of. I see what you are doing here as defamatory under Wikipedia guidelines. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 02:38, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> This AfD and the parallel AfD for White Rose Society eloquently make the case for revisiting <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. I realize I'm a relative newcomer, but I'm no meatpuppet, and it seems to me that there should be a strong bias towards <b>keep</b> in any case. If an article with marginal notability remains in the encyclopedia, what is the harm? Surely the damage done by keeping an article that is arguably non-notable is much less than the damage done by deleting an article that is arguably notable. Setting a high bar for inclusion invites this sort of bad faith nomination, especially for articles on politically-charged topics. Keep this article, keep the article on the White Rose Society, keep the article on Ben Burch, and keep political debates where they belong... i.e. <i>not here</i>. <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoiceOfReason_c913.html" title="User:VoiceOfReason">VoiceOfReason</a> 08:08, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Ignoring all the politics, they have gotten significant national coverage. The fact the haven't done much in the last year or so doesn't make them stop being notable. If this were a requirement, there wouldn't be any articles on dead people. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Sevens_df30.html" title="User:Ace of Sevens">Ace of Sevens</a> 14:57, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Toicap, your assertions have already been amply refuted.</p>
<p>It is a worldwide organization, as has been proven-repeatedly-throughout this afd discussion.</p>
<p>Please read through the entire discussion-with accompanying links-before making baseless assertions.</p>
<p>72.68.187.222 15:10, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, let it be noted that Ben Burch has voted himself to "delete" on the WRS afd.</p>
<p>He has also said that he did not believe he deserved his own Wikipedia entry.</p>
<p>No one from Protest Warrior-except for NCB and Grebok, who are not actual PWers-has voted to delete this entry.</p>
<p>Plus, many who are not from PW-in fact, many who are very liberal-have voted to "keep" this article.</p>
<p>72.68.187.222 15:17, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Edit to previous comment: The links can be found on the "discussion" page.</p>
<p>Why the links to those relevant documents were moved there is beyond me.</p>
<p>Please give a at least a cursory review to that page before making unfounded assertions.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Minor musicians are kept, even if their notability wasn't very high and they have faded from the scene. So are their CD's. So are many other not-really-meaningful-today "things from the past," such as my boyhood favorite <a href="../../../h/o/p/Hop_Harrigan_806b.html" title="Hop Harrigan">Hop Harrigan</a>.

<p>It's pretty clear that a few politicly-motivated Individuals are trying to delete sites based on Leftist preference. So much for that Democratic Principle of "Free" speech, eh??</p>
<p>NOBODY hates the ideas of free speech and the free exchange of ideas more than a leftist, ESPECIALLY ben burch. Liberalism simply can no longer survive in the Arena of Free IDeas and Discussion, hence the Deletion of a political enemy</p>
<p>Toicap lies again.</p>
<p>James Bond has not been involved in any "vandalism," nor has he invoked any "sock puppets," however you choose to define that very subjective term.</p>
<p>He merely alerted CU and PW users-as is his right-to the bad faith afd nomination of perpetual partisan hit-man Ben Burch.</p>
<p>You have no evidence whatsoever to demonstrate that sock puppets-which you have yet to define-are being used to skew the results of this discussion, or that multiple Protest Warriors have "vandalized" this page, not that you have defined that term either.</p>
<p>71.125.240.18 19:48, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Furthermore, the person who nominated the WRS for afd was not a Protest Warrior.</p>
<p>Please retract that allegation, as it has already been disproved elsewhere.</p>
<p>71.125.240.18 19:49, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
