<dd><i>Perins Community School is a secondary school in Alresford, Hants, England.</i></dd>

<p>and an external link that I can't get to work at the moment (although this internet connection has been intermittently flakey today). The <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_BEEFSTEW_8c5d.html" title="User:Dpbsmith/BEEFSTEW">BEEFSTEW</a> score is 0.

<dd>I note that now it has been expanded <i>very</i> slightly but it still scores 0 on BEEFSTEW. Being a "specialist sports college" isn't notable, as many (most?) successful state secondary schools have become specialist x colleges recently. As I understand it, you just have to show that you're a little above average in the local area in a particular field, and you get this status which is just a mechanism for gaining more funding for that particular subject. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 18:22, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Hmmm we seem to be making some progress on the reasons for deletion. Actually I dispute Korath's interpretation of the Jimbo thing, but I don't particularly mind deleting substubs if they've had a chance. I will still vote <b>Keep</b> and give it more time, because even average secondary school have important and interesting things to be said about them, like how they raised the sponsorship needed to become a specialist college, why they specialized in that field, if that choice was influenced by the sponsors, and how the specialization changed the nature and level of examination achievements. We should be able to keep quality articles on average schools, because they <i>are</i> quality articles on verifiable subjects which significant numbers of people might want to read about. It doesn't mean we have to accept permanent substubs on every school. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 18:36, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Specialist x colleges have nothing to do with sponsorship, all the extra money comes from the Government. There are a few UK schools that have been taken over by private organsiations, but that is completely different, and they have all been failing schools - which this clearly isn't.</dd>
<dd>Any information on whether the specialist x status has had any effect on examination results would be apropriate at <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_in_the_United_Kingdom_7510.html" title="Education in the United Kingdom">Education in the United Kingdom</a> or <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_in_England_c7c5.html" title="Education in England">Education in England</a> if its not a UK-wide policy (I don't know off the top of my head) where it can be contrasted with those schools that aren't specialist x colleges, but at the level of a single school it isn't anywhere near statistically significant. The only way that it being a specialist sports college could have any impact on its notability is if it was the first or last (and it certainly isn't the latter) to become one. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 19:38, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)
