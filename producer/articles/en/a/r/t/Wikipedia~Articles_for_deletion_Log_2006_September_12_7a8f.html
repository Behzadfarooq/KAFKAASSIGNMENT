<dd><b>Comment</b> - Looking at the history of the <a href="../../../k/e/a/Keane.html" title="Keane">Keane</a> article, it's fairly clear that you moved the trivia and other sections to their own articles in an attempt to get first Featured Article and more recently Good Article status, and it became clear that violating <a href="../../../t/r/i/WP%7ETRIVIA_c4e2.html" title="WP:TRIVIA">WP:TRIVIA</a> probably wasn't the best way to achieve either goal. Removing the trivia from the main article certainly made the main article much better, but taking the bad, unencyclopedic information and segregating it into another article with no aspirations of Good Article status isn't the best solution. Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information, and we shouldn't be concered about "loss of information" as a motivation for keeping something in an article. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoffspear_16b0.html" title="User:Geoffspear">Geoffrey Spear</a> 13:16, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Non-notable residential complex. There's hundreds of these complexes in Hong Kong (I've lived in one), and I don't see any reason why this one is so special as to deserve its own article.

<li><b>Delete</b> - this is the first and only time I've ever felt bad voting to delete this kind of article, so I think it deserves some really good reasons to delete. First of all, the nom is very well explained. It is quite accurate to say that it'd take at least a couple hundred articles on such developments just to cover the residences of a majority of the population of Hong Kong. And it's also true that few of the developments - and very few of the structures - are especially notable in and of themselves. Appealing to precedent, New York City is slightly bigger than Hong Kong, yet we don't go into such detail to document all of the residential developments in NYC. Still, I'll sort of regret seeing this article go. <a href="../../../m/y/_/User%7EMy_Alt_Account_c155.html" title="User:My Alt Account">My Alt Account</a> 08:48, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom, without regrets. Notability neither stated nor implied. I get roughly 27,500 general Google hits, which boil down to 526 distinct hits.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>, Hello everyone, this is my first article on Wikipedia, and so forgive my lack of experience. I even had to look up on how to properly format my part of this discussion, which just goes to show how much of a newbie I am. Those of you with additional input are right in that South Horizons is not a particularly special development, even though it is quite well-known around Hong Kong, and there have been quite a number of suicides there too. Anyway, I did use sources of information from the internet, but I don't know how to do the citations yet, haha. So anyway like I was saying, this is my first article and I felt that something I knew well and is not yet in Wikipedia is the place where I live. However, I am not familiar with all the rules and policies here, so judging from what has been discussed (particularly Tychocat's nomination), I think I would go with whatever decision that will be made, and I am leaning towards deletion myself, although personally I'll regret to see it go too. Nice to see how the Wikipedia community works, though!Gggu 17:40, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The free advertising argument leads to logical absurdity: Any living person about whom there is an article in Wikipedia benefits from free advertising, be the article is positive neutral, or negative. This is true whether the person is in power because of election or coup d'etat, whether a politician, athlete, or scientist. To avoid such free advertising, Wikipedia could set a policy that no living person can be the subject of an article. Such a policy would of course reduce the utility of Wikipedia to its readers. Hence it is absurd. There is utility to Wikipedia's readers in having information about incumbent and challenger candidates in Wikipedia as long as these articles really have a neutral point of view. <a href="../../../f/3/m/User%7EF3meyer_0c5e.html" title="User:F3meyer">F3meyer</a> 05:23, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oh,well..</b> I just think it should stay beacause even though it is in Alpha stage at the moment,I think it is susposed to come out of Alpha somewhere in October.

I'm somewhat asking you guys to "give it a chance" in building up to your expectations and what-not. The original creator can try to make it more less of a guide,and more into a descriptive article about it. Sure it's a small game,but all games take time to grow..

<li><b>Do not Delete</b> We're running into a number of odd technicalities that can ultimately be ignored. The state of Battledawn has been labeled "Beta Testing." The reasoning behind this label is that the game is updated on a regular basis as bugs and imbalances are discovered, but it has always been the same game. Perhaps saying the game is in Beta Testing because of its regular updates is incorrect by most standards because this would also mean Windows Operating systems never left the Beta stage and most of the biggest PC games released in the past 5 years were still in their beta stages. Regardless of its "Beta" titling, it is being advertised, played and updated as a full game. I believe Micheal, Battledawn's developer, has dubbed it Beta because he feels it gives him the right to make changes as he pleases without feeling totally unprofessional until the game has gotten to a point that he feels is perfectly tuned and he is allowed to move on to a new project. Frankly, I agree with this outlook because the only true testing a game can get is in the hands of the public and at least Micheal is humble enough to realize his game was not totally perfect upon release. I'm insulted when I'm forced to fork out $50 for a game only to find out I'm just another Beta tester until the clean version is around after a number of months or even years. As for <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>, Battledawn is only required to meet 1 of their criteria to satisfy Wikepedia's standards. In <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, #3 states "The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster." Any of the game listing sites on which Battledawn has been highly rated qualify as distributors of this type. They are not merely distributing content so trivially as Newgrounds or Geocities are, but instead are listing Battledawn above other notable games in a ranking of quality and popularity. Furthermore, <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> #1 states that "user guides" qualify as the sort of independent publications that may define content as nontrivial. Well, these game listing websites are, above all else, user guides. Their sole purpose is to help game players find other games they may be interested in. The fact of the matter is that Battledawn is a phenemenon on the internet that, though relatively small, has already made its mark. It has sucked up a vast number of players from older games of similar genres and quickly earned their loyalty, not as testers, but players. Yes, Micheal has reserved the right to make drastic changes in the name of improvement whenever he pleases, but if calling a game Beta is the cost of that right, I wish more games did so. I say you leave the article up. Perhaps it could use some work, but no argument here justifies its deletion so if no more information can be brought to the table, this process must be halted. -Rockytastic 08:45, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Explain Notability</b> From the comments above, it appears notability is granted rather arbitrarily. Could some Wikipedia policy define notability in any way that would exclude the aforementioned 3rd party websites from satisfying the necessary criteria? It has been stated that games can be submitted by their creators and be swung to high rank with only a surge of votes, but how is that any different than a few editors being alerted to a game by its developer and some articles being written on it? In fact, I am connected to much of the game design arena and pay special attention to the indie world of flash development so I can tell you that this is not the first discussion questioning the value of these game list websites. The general rule is that online gamers, especially in flash, are alerted to more games by "Top 100" websites than any other source. How many articles on a specific flash game have you ever read? How many were in "notable" publications? -Rocky 06:44, 13 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>With respect to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28web%29_6df7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (web)">Wikipedia:Notability (web)</a>, you do <i>not</i> pass 3 for being on those listings. The sheer number of them, and their individual non-notability results in a failure to pass. 3 refers to a <i>major</i> distributor, and quite clearly any listing with extreme swings and their #1 listing only having 400 votes is not major. This is confirmed by footnote 7, which finishes with "Although GeoCities and Newgrounds are exceedingly well known, hosting content on them is trivial." This applies quite clearly in this case. Get yourself a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stratics.html" title="Stratics">Stratics</a> news mention, and you might have more chance. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 19:09, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> When looking through the policy, I saw nothing excluding those third party mmo sites. Osafune</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Other than being the "first" Flash implementation (note the lack of references for proof), this makes no claims of notability and does nothing to differentiate itself from the glut of browser-based strategy MMOs in the world. It being in beta is beside the point (would a World of Warcraft II beta be nonnotable?) but the lack of demonstrated notability IS the point. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Garrett</a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_0893.html" title="User talk:Master Thief Garrett">Talk</a></sup> 10:22, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Argument Unfounded</b>. To believe that Battledawn is not the first of its kind or indeed no different from the "glut of browser-based MMOs in the world" evidences your inexperience with the game itself and/or the so-called "glut of browser based MMOs." Furthermore, it is actually impossible to "prove" that something is the first of its kind. You run into the old "proving a negative" problem by attempting to show that no others of its kind exist. It is then up to those that believe Battledawn is not the first of its kind to prove themselves by finding another game like it. There is no lack of demonstrated notability, the argument here is whether or not the demonstrated notability above satisfies the requirements of Wikipedia. Because no Wikipedia policy has yet been referenced to show that the 3rd party sites mentioned previously are excluded from the notability criteria, the article must remain. -Rocky 18:25, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>See my above comment on notability. You are deliberately misinterpreting the notability guidelines. And remember, having an article on wikipedia is not the most amazing thing in the world.

<li><b>Keep</b>. <i>Misconceptions</i> are often more dangerous than simple ignorance, as they usually have more consequences. It is generally hard to prove how many people have specific misconceptions without doing original research, but such is actually irrrelevant: Even if only few people would be helped - that is better than nothing. It sure beats not having the article, since having it cannot possibly do harm. The nice part about this particular article is, that misconceptions are shortly though clearly stated and the sourced thruths are given just as briefly but understandably. It's an exemple for other 'misconception' articles, which can easily and usefully be linked from other articles without cluttering the latter with data that is not needed by every reader.<br />
To my experience (and according to the popularity of books on 'misconception' matters), quite a lot of people are interested in finding out how much they have figured out correctly, or not. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../s/e/p/Sep_20.html" title="Sep 20">20 Sep</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> 16:58&#160;(UTC)</span></li>

<p>Well, Google is not always accurate or even pertinent (nor is the German Wikipedia known for sensible decisions).

<li><b>Delete</b> this gal. She ain't even close to be considered as a German Paris Hilton. Absolutely ridiculous. She got some attention because her mother Ute Ohoven – a blonde mature lady and an eager socialite posing as a <a href="../../../u/n/e/UNESCO_24a0.html" title="UNESCO">UNESCO</a>-charity-matron – pushed her. I mean, I can understand ageing Ute: She ist getting older, and she wanted to establish Chiara as her substitute. I understand that because I know my <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigmund_Freud_d2be.html" title="Sigmund Freud">Sigmund Freud</a>. And I happen to know überblonde mature women and their desperate strategies... So there were some press reports about the chick, telling ... well, nothing. Chiara is not a famous party girl, natch. She is not promoting anything, she hasn't recorded bad songs (she hasn't recorded anything at all), she isn't even a fake blonde with blue contact lenses. She is not best friends with any actors, or singers, or famous socialites. There is no 'One Night in Chiara'. There is just a big nothing. Nada. Niente. Zero. To call her 'The German Paris Hilton' is an insult to Paris. And even in Germany you don't attract fame anymore just because you had bad cosmetic surgery and talk trash. Oh, yes, "Socialite of the Year": try to resarch the jury and its members – and fail. It's a cheap <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_relations.html" title="Public relations">PR</a>-joke.

<p>This price interests nobody (or do you think that we should list all people who have something little in commom with prominents like Thomas Gottschalk, like people who were born in the same city?) and even this price she has only won "half" and her mother IS the reason that anybody knows her (not for her prominence, becaues her prominence doesn't exist). That a German fan of her translated the article into German surely isn't an arguement for having more prominence than her mother!

<li><b>Keep</b> As a Jew, I cannot possibly understand all the nuances that went into creating this school. But a thorough read through the articles regarding the school shows that it is quite genuine and was created to meet a perceived need for a new type of school. That a new school is not accredited by a well-known accrediting agency does not make it a diploma mill. Nor do I find it at all unusual that the mainstream press hasn't latched on to this school as a subject for articles that would confer the notability so many feel it would be given. Despite the lack of traditional news coverage, the articles provided and available online provide clear satisfaction of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> . I find the use of "scare quotes" and other derogatory suppositions regarding its nonaccreditation making it a suspected diploma mill to be a staggering violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>.

<li>Thanks for the reply to prove my point about good faith violations. These folks seem to have a genuine interest in teaching folks their version of Baptist theology as they understand it. I've seen ads for diploma mills, all of which read "send in a check we'll send you a sheepskin." If you take a look at <a href="http://www.bhcti.org/AboutUs/index.cfm?action=page&amp;contentid=120" class="external text" title="http://www.bhcti.org/AboutUs/index.cfm?action=page&amp;contentid=120" rel="nofollow">the school's admission requirements</a>, they're doing a very poor job of attracting only those who just want a phony credential. I see no evidence (nor has anyone offered any) implying that they're pushing paper, and not their brand of gospel. I find the school notable and verifiable, and I can at least respect challenges to the issue, even if I disagree. But, other than that, all I see are rampant violations of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 03:03, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>Another bit player in the 9/11 conspiracy movement.

Otherwise we'd have articles for thousands of self-promoting Hollywood hacks.

<li><b>Comment</b> As the former director of the Municipal Museum of The Hague (Gemeentemuseum Den Haag) I herewith confirm the facts mentioned in Wikipedia about Martin Sjardijn. Indeed, already in 1985 he started his important Weightless Sculpture Project. The animation at the Digistar Planetarium Computer in the Omniversum in The Hague (neighbouring the Gemeentemuseum) was at the time an exciting experience. He is innovative and especially a pioneer in using as a visual artist the virtual reality of the internet. dr. J.L.

<li>"It sounds like you realize he isn't notable now, but think we should keep the page because he will be in a few months. I say let him acheive notability on his own, and then we can include him. In <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> it says, "Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work." Just a minute ago I was looking for reviews of his book, and couldn't find anything. There is "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events." I guess that's a judgement call.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep absolutely</b> I'm amazed that this is under discussion. Ken Thompson was one of the first 9/11 researchers, one of the deepest, and one who does the least amount of speculation in his research. He uses thousands of links to publicly published mass media reports to delineate the timeline. He has published the definitive 9/11 timeline in bookform and on a website that is widely read. He is also seen in the movie <a href="../../../p/r/e/9_11%7E_Press_for_Truth_4702.html" title="9/11: Press for Truth">9/11: Press for Truth</a>. Furthermore, I'll go on to object to editors who claim he is "not notable". To make this claim shows clear POV and I regard it as aggressive editing.

I'm not saying it's the perfect article, and somebody may indeed make a compelling argument for deletion. I think it at least makes its case for inclusion. Not that I should have to even say this, but I am not a Catholic or any sort of defender of cathedral-cruft but not parish-cruft. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErechtheus_2543.html" title="User:Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a> 01:56, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The search is very clear and performed with the normal standards of any google search on an individual.

<li>You claimed it directly above <b>I get a huge amount of Google hits personally,</b>. Scroogle does limit to 100, but that tops out at 24, it doesn't even begin to approach the limit.

<li><b>Keep</b>It is not meant to be an Ad. I do not work for the site or get paid by them, but I am a member. I created the entry as a factual document of the founding and operation of the site based on the facts I found in their forums and FAQ. I started the article after reading the <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicidegirls.html" title="Suicidegirls">suicidegirls</a> wiki. Since DN was founded by a former employee of SG (and several of the models are SG refugees as well), I thought it would be relevant. As the site grows and expands, I expect the entry to as well. I didn't' think linking to the model app would be a problem, but have now removed it. Membership pricing and model pay scale are included solely as informational pieces and not meant to solicit business or new models. Torklugnutz 04:39, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Did a little more editing, removed "Site Features" and replaced with "Site Trivia". Also, in rebuttal to William Pietri, DN is a new site, whereas SG has been around for years. Obviously the older site is going to have a higher Alexa rank. They've got a much larger user base. DN doesn't need Wiki's help.

<li>I don't see any likelihood of it being established either way.

Great - so the article doesn't coincide with the rules of notability on Wikipedia. But that doesn't mean the article does not belong - perhaps the rules themselves need to be revised. This is supposed to be an online (so therefore diverse) encyclopedia. If someone has heard of Level Seven and wishes to look them up on Wikipedia (which is reasonable), then why restrict them from doing so? Does it really matter if admins from America or even the UK haven't heard of this band? Is this article harming Wikipedia in any way? No! If anything, it is adding to the already sterling content on this online encyclopedia.<br />
A band is a band. The Beatles were a band. The guy you know down the street who jams with his mates - he's in a band. It is an entity, regardless of fame or notoriety, and as an entity it at least deserves recognition on Wikipedia. Fine, so some people may not check this page as much as they would a more famous band, but some may <i>want</i> to - and because this is a <b>free</b> encyclopedia (in both financial and personal manners), people should be free to read whatever they wish. And if that includes this band, so be it. If it does not - again, so be it.<br />
I understand that, according to the codified rules of Wikipedia, this band should not have a site. But I'm not arguing with you over those grounds; that's silly and fruitless. I'm requesting that as a member of a free nation and a user of a free encyclopedia, this band be given recognition on the unlimited size of the Internet.<br />
Why, other than its contradiction to the 'rules', delete this page?<br />
<br />
Truly, what harm is it doing?<br />

<ul>
<li>Thanks for responding, Naylor. Following the rules is what keeps the encyclopedia an encyclopedia; it's why policies and guidelines exist. There are ~3,000 articles created every day and the cost is in server space. Wikipedia does not live on the internet, it is in St. Petersburg, Florida and a few other hosting sites. There are literaly hundreds of thousands of bands that have not met the criteria for <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">MUSIC</a> and that is the reason for the policy. If someone searches for Level Seven on Google, they can get the band's website. If/when the band is successful, the article can be recreated with no qualms. You said <i>"Does it really matter if admins from America or even the UK haven't heard of this band? Is this article harming Wikipedia in any way?"</i>, and I'm assuming that is mentioned because I made the nomination. Please note that I removed the speedy deletion tag from the article and moved it to this forum to get the <i>community</i> opinion and it is a move I have made as an editor many times. <a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETeke_11ee.html" title="User:Teke"><font color="maroon">Teke</font></a><sup><small>(<a href="../../../t/e/k/User_talk%7ETeke_b34c.html" title="User talk:Teke"><font color="gray">talk</font></a>)</small></sup> 04:30, 14 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Being honest, it was nothing to do with you, moreover the member who first put the 'speedy deletion' tag on the page. And I respect your move, but I still stand by everything I wrote above. If <b>information</b> (because that is what it is) doesn't belong in an <i>encyclopedia</i> because of some rule, surely that says more about the rule than the article. --<a href="../../../n/a/y/User%7ENaylor182_6629.html" title="User:Naylor182">Naylor182</a> 15:41, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>That article is not even about the mall. If it was really that important, I would expect you to find a reference directly on point. Of course people are going to recognize the name of the local mall -- I certainly know the name of mine -- but where is the evidence that it has anything beyond local name recognition? Local club bands have local name recognition too, yet we have a speedy delete category for those. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 23:42, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Just about anything can be a point of reference for locals. A rundown house on the corner of the street can be a point of reference. A traffic light that does not work right can be a point of reference. A block of warehouses can be a point of reference. I certainly hope you are not suggesting that these things should have articles just because the locals know them and use them to oriente themselves in a given neighborhood. What if the article had said it was near the Super Wal-Mart? Does that mean the local Wal-Mart now deserves an entry. What about the Blockbusters that article talked about that went out of business? Should they all receive articles because the local paper thought they were important enough to report about? Does every single business in the world that more than a couple of dozen people patronize deserve an article just because the locals use them and oriente themselves to them? If you can truly answer yes to all of these questions, then there is no reasoning with you, but if you think some of these things cross the line, then you have not articulated any reason why this mall is special. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 01:20, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Ok, let's look through this one.

<dd>Yes, but are the sources I found through Google reliable or not? And anyway, even if it is perhaps not a scientific term, it still is clearly a widely used one in certain circles (and for that Google <i>is</i> a reliable indicator), and deserves an entry. It's not because the subject and most of the Google links are not to my taste that we should get rid of it. If the info in the entry is incorrect, give it a cleanup tag or something. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 07:34, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, origin is not Ebonics, the origin is from Latin and Greek. The Latin dacrydium, is a type of tree, and is a diminutive of a greek word that means tear (the drops of resin that the tree leaves look like tears). Also there is a reference to it in Brenda Love's book 'The Encyclopedia of Unusual Sexual Practices'.</li>

<p>Ski Big Bear is important to the economy and tourism of the region.

<p>As far as putting information into the original article I thought that it was better to link to a separate article that I wrote rather than mess with the hard work of someone else.

<li><b>Comment</b> Why should Wikipedia be hostile to them, when deleting stuff that doesn't fit into the encyclopedic mission? If stuff that is deleted gets recreated they are hostile to wikipedia. Also I read this "arugment" as a threat of (internet) violence and this is IMHO not tolerable, I don't think wikipedia should bow its encyclopedia mission just because some group thinks that it must have to publish stuff here. --<a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJestix_6105.html" title="User:Jestix">Jestix</a> 16:13, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Oh boy. I am not making threats. I am a Wikipedian. I have noticed that whenever there is no article on equipment, some new CS player who wants to help Wikipedia creates a new article on CS equipment. I am merely hypothesizing that if we shoo them away (<a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>), we may make them feel unwelcome. This makes them more likely to be vandals. These are merely my observations and not a threat (please check my contributions and review <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>). --<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabap_8f9b.html" title="User:Habap">Habap</a> 18:32, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To the editors voting delete on the reasons of "unencyclopedic", it has been noted by others that a clear concept of the show is the "Don't try this at home" element. They bust the myths for our benefit because they are professionals and can (presumably) do it in a safer manner then your average curious Joe. This list makes clear the danger level involved in the making of this show.

<p>This page was originally nominated back in March (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Candidates_for_the_54th_United_Kingdom_Parliament_8132.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Candidates for the 54th United Kingdom Parliament">here</a>). There was no consensus to delete, but there <i>was</i> an expectation that the article be updated and maintained. In early September it was <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">prodded</a>, without contest, but I'd like to run this through AfD again instead. Note that the only extant section is A-C, and it only goes up through Berwick. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 11:18, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I prodded this earlier this week, and was a delete vote in the first AfD. There are many reasons why I think this article should be deleted. At the very core of this is the fact that this article is redundant. Each and every individual constituency article has the list of candidates nominated, and will have running up to the next election. There are plentiful links to the constituencies - such as <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constituencies_in_the_next_United_Kingdom_general_election_b1da.html" title="Constituencies in the next United Kingdom general election">Constituencies in the next United Kingdom general election</a> - and each notable candidate will have articles here too. As Mackensen says, this article only goes up to A-C, and has not been updated in any fashion since the last AfD. The article would also be prone to vandalism, could be a magnet for vandals, and would mean the duplication of information across hundreds of existing pages. In the last AfD, the consensus seemed to point to the article needing updated for it to survive - I don't think it has. I would request therefore <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../d/o/k/User%7EDoktorbuk_af25.html" title="User:Doktorbuk">doktorb</a> <sub><a href="../../../d/o/k/User_talk%7EDoktorbuk_4b6f.html" title="User talk:Doktorbuk">words</a></sub><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Doktorbuk_f540.html" title="Special:Contributions/Doktorbuk">deeds</a></sup> 11:54, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> The article must stay hopelessly incomplete - 'Unknown, Unknown, Unknown' etc.. - right up until a few months before the election (in 2009 most likely) as nominations for candidates are not confirmed until such a time. Also the title 'Candidates for the 54th UK Parliament' is pure invention. As far as I am aware no-one refers to a (UK) General Election using such a term. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 12:17, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong delete</b> - wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> a crystal ball. Completely pointless at any time to have a list of candidates.

<li><b>Delete</b> - highly useless. Both Marcus22's comments above are correct. It seems to me there may be a case for such an article <b>once the election is called and nominations have closed</b>, but not now. <a href="../../../b/t/l/User%7EBTLizard_ebd6.html" title="User:BTLizard">BTLizard</a></li>
<li><b>Delete</b> we have ample time to cover the next general election, it will be over and done with before <a href="../../../t/h/e/Wikipedia%7EThere_is_no_deadline_ad78.html" title="Wikipedia:There is no deadline">the deadline</a>.

<li><b>Further comment</b> - just a thought on the mention of maintainability above. Such an article would be impossible to maintain until the election is called because until the election is called there can be no nominations and therefore no candidates. You could list sitting MPs and prospective parliamentary candidates but it would be misleading to imply that members of either group will inevitably be candidates when the election comes around. And then there's the question of boundary changes. Are any outstanding, and if they are, does the list reflect that? <a href="../../../b/t/l/User%7EBTLizard_ebd6.html" title="User:BTLizard">BTLizard</a> 14:12, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete, but...</b> - I checked the old previous AfD's, and it's true nobody ever showed there was much coverage of his placing 5th in the Yu-Gi-Oh World Championship. Nor was there significant coverage (outside, perhaps, of obscure online hobbyist press) of his other achievements apart from that championship. Now, here's where my <b>but</b> comes in. English-speaking media doesn't really cover Yu-Gi-Oh tournaments, but perhaps it's different in Japan.

<li><b>Stong Keep.</b> This article covers a POV but that doesn't make <i>it</i> POV. All the info is cited and well written and there are plenty of other "Criticism" pages that have withstood both AfD and the test of time. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 21:23, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - as NeoFreak states above, if it covers a POV that doesn't make it POV, because there is a response section as well. This should not be merged back together, because according to the NPOV policy most of an article should not be criticism.

<li>I see no reason why this can't go in the <a href="../../../c/a/i/CAIR_c159.html" title="CAIR">CAIR</a> article. Redundant, unnecessary, just not worth creating a cascade of articles about every single subject that warrants a criticism section.

<dd>If "Criticism of..." pages were inherently POV, then those other pages would not exist.

<li><b>Keep</b> -per above. Also, I do not see any POV that can't be fixed.

<li><b>Keep</b> per Arbusto and others. As it sits, I think the current CAIR article has major POV issues with over abundance of criticism. Merging this will article will only tilt that POV imbalance further.

Kris: there i changed it. im no wikipedia expert editor so i guess i shouldnt be voicing my opinions like this. but i just thought i should tell people to lighten up a bit + and to spell chilis right. chillies? one l no e. and call me a nerd/geek/whatever for being picky about that, but it is truly a silly mistake to make. that said, if i had to agree, i would agree with JIP. good point, and well made</p>
<p>Chelsea: Exactly right! I thought everyone knew it was spelt "chili". Guess I was mistaken. As for the page, it shouldn't be deleted because of what Kris has already said, and it is a very big message board and it is notable for a wikipedia page.</p>

In this case it's a program that awards a certificate (for taking two classes), pretty much the lowest level of formal acknowledgement the campus offers. Third, it's been around since 2005.

<li><b>Delete</b> The article does not show how this phrase is not simply selling old wine in new bottles (i.e. standard management consulting lines of thinking about services dressed up in new jargon). The Berkeley connection is insufficient - adopting the exact same name as an IBM research/university collaboration initiative<a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/ssme/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.research.ibm.com/ssme/" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> suggests a sponsorship or other collaborative relationship with IBM.

<li><b>Keep, Move</b> I'm afraid I don't have time to do much new research (wife had baby on Friday!), but my argument in the previous AFD was keep, rewrite, and move to Services science. If you read both of the web links from the article, they both say clearly that the supposed new discipline is called "services science". "Services Science, Management, and Engineering" is just the name of the IBM initiative and the UCB program (probably due to IBM fronting some of the cash, I suspect). And <i>services science</i> gets an awful lot of Google hits - about 152,000. (See, for instance <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/04/18/business/services.php" class="external text" title="http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/04/18/business/services.php" rel="nofollow">this International Herald Tribune article</a>.) It may be a management buzzword, but it looks like it has gotten a fair amount of press. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 06:29, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'd say 90% of those simply have nothing to do with SSME, but some of them qualify as secondary sources.

<p><b>Londoner</b>: <b>A Londoner is someone who inhabits or originates from London. Although the term Londoner is generally accepted as covering all people from Greater London, it is sometimes used to mean more narrowly a 'Cockney', and tradition has it that true Cockneys are only those who are born within the sound of Bow Bells (i.e., the peal of the church bells of the parish church at St Mary-le-Bow, Cheapside, London). Londoners come from a broad range of geographic and ethnic backgrounds. They speak with a wide variety of accents including Cockney, Received Pronunciation and Estuary English. Londoners often have a very distinctive accent, quite distinct from the rest of England.</b></p>

<li><b>Delete</b> unless there's evidence that "Kuala Lumpurian" is used by more than a few bloggers. Its use isn't established, for example in any journalism among the Google hits (for a comparison, see <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumbaikar.html" title="Mumbaikar">Mumbaikar</a>), so I don't see that there's a worthwhile starting point for either an article or a redirect at the moment. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMereda_55a9.html" title="User:Mereda">Mereda</a> 09:58, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>(for a comparison, see <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumbaikar.html" title="Mumbaikar">Mumbaikar</a>)</b> Mumbai population is roughly 20 or maybe 30 times more than Kuala Lumpur, surely you win on Google hits.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> The <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penangite.html" title="Penangite">Penangite</a> article has an "Expand" tag on it. Why wouldn't this article merit the same treatment? Maybe <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penangite.html" title="Penangite">Penangite</a> needs to be nominated for AfD also. As for "neologism", except for a few widely known Anglicisms, it's always hard to figure out what to call people from a particular non-English/American city. I do agree that, unless a significant article could be written, almost anything that you could say about "Kuala Lumpurians" could be inserted into the <a href="../../../k/u/a/Kuala_Lumpur_b5d7.html" title="Kuala Lumpur">Kuala Lumpur</a> article. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 08:19, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>So? <a href="../../../l/_/j/User%7EL_joo_e9b3.html" title="User:L joo">L joo</a> 05:22, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I guess you want to know what the conclusion of the AfD debate is. The official answer is:The debate has not been closed (concluded) yet. The unofficial answer is: The article will probably be deleted in a few days.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>First off, regarding your point about "the purpose of AfD is discussion", the point is we are not just voting. Instead, we are discussing whether or not to delete this article. So far the discussion is leaning overwhelmingly in favor of deletion. Some AfD's are close calls. This one doesn't seem to be one of those.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">AFD</a> nominations stay open for 5 days unless an early close is indicated. This nomination was started on 12 September and therefore would normally stay open until 17 September. However, discussion so far is pointing towards an early close. There are no "Keep" votes and even if you (L joo) voted "Keep", the consensus is running overwhelmingly against you.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you could show at least a handful of English sources that used the word "Kuala Lumpurian" or a variant thereof, you could defeat the charge of "neologism". However, you would still have the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a> argument to deal with. To be encyclopedic, the article would have to describe how Kuala Lumpurians are different from residents of other Malaysian cities (such as <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penangite.html" title="Penangite">Penangites</a>) or how they are perceived to be different. All this would have to be sourced to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, of course.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If this article is deleted, don't lose heart. You can re-create it provided that the new article addresses the issues discussed here. If it doesn't, it is likely to be re-nominated for AfD again.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Please don't take any of this personally. We are only interested in maintaining and improving the quality of Wikipedia articles. We would be glad to re-consider an expanded, improved and sourced article if you write one.</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> and clean up. I agree with Wafulz completely on the grounds by which we should judge this. Searching around, people definitely make products out of coconut palm wood, so having some sort of entry is reasonable.

<li><b>Keep</b>, but with major cleanup and re-write, and possibly re-name 'palm wood'. Palm wood - from many different species of palms, not just Coconut Palm - is an important commodity in tropical / subtropical regions (e.g. I've seen Date Palm <i>Phoenix dactylifera</i> wood extensively used as a structural timber in southern Morocco) - <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 08:08, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I can live with a major cleanup i.e. removing almost the entire body of the article instead of deleting. This seems to be the consensus of this discussion. I will start cleaning up shortly, thus eliminating the need for deletion. --Philippe 11:01, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> in its present form.

It was then created despite this declining. The subject itself may be deserving of an article, but it needs to be written from scratch and properly sourced.

<li><b>Keep</b>, I do agree that as it stands now the material is not written for wikipedia however it contains information which could be used to improve a future article.

<li><b>Keep <i>content</i></b> but preferrably not the present way: this belongs in an article that either shows current politics, economics, etc with ongoing changes in Nigeria, or a historical overview (or detail) on major Nigerian projects, or an overview of African agriculture/oil/..., or a worldwide view on gaining oil from agricultural products. Do not expect quick reactions and improvements for articles from non-English-speaking and/or developing countries as one may expect from the US or Great-Britain (<a href="../../../c/s/b/WP%7ECSB_93c9.html" title="WP:CSB">WP:CSB</a>) - an article like this has a <i>signal</i> function. At the appropriate moment, the content should be available and easily found by search operations, thus definitely do not destroy it. Meanwhile, the boxes at top of the article can sufficiently warn readers of the shortcomings. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../s/e/p/Sep_20.html" title="Sep 20">20 Sep</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> 18:34&#160;(UTC)</span></li>

<p>I prod'ed this, with this text: "Non-notable product line, as they're not inherently innovative. Enumerating all the models in the line might be an interesting article, but even the collection of specifications does not make an encyclopedic article." Another editor removed the prod and made a comment requesiting the topic be kept at <a href="../../../p/o/w/Talk%7EPowerEdge_5896.html" title="Talk:PowerEdge">Talk:PowerEdge</a>, so that brings us to a formal AfD.</p>
<p>I'm on the <b>delete</b> side, and vary from "why the heck is this here?!" to not thinking the article does any harm -- but I never find myself having a desire to keep this article. It is in poor shape now, but I also don't think that it can be improved to provide an interesting article at all. There's no argument that the line of servers is popular, but they're not innovative and are just repackaged products that someone else invented, designed, and implemented. Anything discussing the business model behind them probably belongs at the Dell Inc. article, and a catalog of the line and its configurations isn't interesting. -- <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">Mikeblas</a> 16:33, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The referenced article is not about PowerEdge servers in general. It's also not completely about a specifc PowerEdge server; it's a press release recap mentioning some announcements from a two or three different companies. While the article has "PowerEdge" in its text, and discsusses one change to one model at one time, it provides zero depth. This specific article doesn't help PowerEdge meet <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> because it is just a press release rehash.

<dd>Actually that is just recycling the same non-academic tourist museum fluff. It is not a real book but a catalog of the Italian "museum"'s travelling exhibition. By "long" you mean thirty years? Do we have a page on Yetis too? Actually as this is supposed to be an encyclopedia, surely everything that lacks evidence should be deleted? Everything. How would it be original research? You mean there is a value judgement implicit in refusing to accept an article? How? Why? I hate to claim knowledge of torture books but I assure there is <i>no</i> credible printed reference to this. It has not been verified by anyone except this Italian tourist "museum". I have asked for proof for this article for more than a year. I have tried to track down every reference. I have yet to see a shred of proof or even a credible reason to think it existed. <a href="../../../l/a/o/User%7ELao_Wai_79b4.html" title="User:Lao Wai">Lao Wai</a> 10:55, 17 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, sir, we <b>DO</b> Have a page on <a href="../../../y/e/t/Yeti.html" title="Yeti">Yetis</a> (... just as we actually document sex toys as well). They are encyclopedic as commonly documented urban legends and hoaxes (there are others - <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lochness_monster.html" title="Lochness monster">Lochness monster</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_is_Dead_00d6.html" title="Paul is Dead">Paul is Dead</a>, etc. No, it's not wrong to question the legitamacy of this device, but just because you feel the sources are unreliable does not mean we can/should not cite their <i>claims</i> - a claim can be used to source information, but you just have to let the reader know that it is that - a claim. Let the reader decide for him/her-self the verifiability of the provided sources. In fact, it is totally possible to write a section questioning its verification under this article (in fact - see <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_maiden.html" title="Iron maiden">iron maiden</a> under "Known Usage" for a short stub-type example), but it is no reason to delete it. In fact, if a lot of you think it is a hoax, I'd even <i>encourage</i> to write such a section to create that "awareness". Still, sadly, despite having researched this for so long, it is totally possible that you may NEVER uncover its truth (especially if it is as old as they say it is). That does not mean that it could in no way be real (and it certainly does not mean we should suddenly just give up searching for the undeniable truth!). That also does mean we throw away the <i>POPULAR</i> theories involved with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_proposed_Jack_the_Ripper_suspects_6161.html" title="List of proposed Jack the Ripper suspects">Jack the Ripper's supposed identity</a> (or even the theories of "Possible Other Victims" in <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_the_Ripper_b953.html" title="Jack the Ripper">Jack the Ripper</a>), who <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deepthroat.html" title="Deepthroat">Deepthroat</a> really was before his public revelation ("Other Suspected Candidates"), the theoretical uses of <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stonehenge.html" title="Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a>, and so on.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Numerous citations concerning the Pear of Anguish can be found in reference texts on torture. The device also appears in Ken Russell's film "The Devils," where it is shown being used on an accused witch. This movie was released in 1971, so if the Pear of Anguish is a hoax, it is one that has been perpetuated for over 35 years, and thus notable. --Doctor Dan 02:35, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Which "texts on torture" does it appear in? As someone who has gone over the literature I assure you the opposite is true. There are no credible references to it at all. Anywhere. Who cares if it is in Ken Russell's film? Just because an urban legend survives less than 40 years does not make it credible as far as I can see. Why do you think it is notable if the <i>only</i> reference to it is this film and a bad private-sector museum in Italy (which may be run by a Ken Russell fan for all I know)? <a href="../../../l/a/o/User%7ELao_Wai_79b4.html" title="User:Lao Wai">Lao Wai</a> 10:55, 17 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>This page should be deleted The suicide methods page has been proposed for deletion 2 times previously, but these attempts have been unsuccessful, for whatever reason. There are a number of very good reasons why this page should be deleted:</p>
<p>Firstly, Wikipedia is not a manual. It is not meant to be used as a resource by people who wish to kill themselves, but it clearly can be. Consider the following which was written on wrist slashing</p>
<p>"Slashing or slitting one's wrists entails cutting through the wrists until one of the arteries is reached. People choosing this method die because of the massive blood loss from the radial artery or the ulnar artery. This method is also frequently used as self-harm, and it is not an immediately lethal method; therefore, not all people who slash their wrists intend suicide (this is then called parasuicide where suicide is either not sought or is not accomplished).</p>
<p>It is generally difficult to die by slashing the wrists since the arteries tend to try to spasm shut in response. Bleeding to death by veins is even harder and rarer. It can take a few hours or even more to finally die from the blood loss, depending on body weight, clotting problems (such as alcohol or aspirin in the blood), etc."</p>
<p>This gives a lot of information to anyone who wishes to end their life in this manner. It tells them some of the problems which prevent a successful suicide, and how to solve them in such a way that will allow death to occur (ie, use aspirin to prevent blood clotting). This is ethically bankrupt, and it is not what wikipedia should be about. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a manual.</p>
<p>Secondly, Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information. There are some types of information which is already banned from wikipedia, such as information about people who are non notable. This policy is designed merely to prevent self promotion. Surely it is just as admirable for wikipedia to prevent suicide.</p>
<p>Opponents to the deletion of this article may claim that wikipedia shouldn't be censored. But the thing is, wikipedia is not value neutral. Wikipedia is about enforcing a public good, and helping the world through providing access to information which can help people. A suicide manual doesn't help anyone, but it does target vulnerable members of our community. About 1 in 5 people will experience depression at some point in their lifetime. Many people who experience this debilitating illness will consider suicide as a way of alleviating their suffering, even wikipedia users. We owe these people a chance at life by protecting them from information which they may use to kill themselves.</p>
<p>I am aware that it can be argued that the information itself wont kill anyone. That people who wish to kill themselves will do so even if they can't compare methods. But my point is that resources like the suicide methods page will increase their chances of commiting suicide effectively. It is well known that medical practioners have much higher suicide rates than the general population. This is because they are more successful at killing themselves during suicide attempts than people without medical training. Likewise, I believe that this suicide methods page will lead to more successful suicide attempts.</p>
<p>Finally, who wants to read in the newspaper that some depressed teenager killed themselves using wikipedia as a manual. That will happen unless this page is deleted. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Katie32 (<a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatie32_55c6.html" title="User talk:Katie32">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Katie32_e60b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Katie32">contribs</a>) 16:35, 12 September 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<li><b>Keep</b> but tag for some clean up (I agree with the the scant OR). Katie while your intentions maybe good your reasoning is flawed. First off, the reasons those "How to" articles don't exist is precisely because Wikipedia is not a manual and this article isn't a how to but rather an encyclopedic overview of a social phenomenon that is related to the main <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide.html" title="Suicide">suicide</a> article. Just as we have articles on <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape.html" title="Rape">rape</a>, <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plagues.html" title="Plagues">plagues</a>, and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_molestation.html" title="Child molestation">child molestation</a> because of the encyclopedic merit of their contents so to we have this article. I agree that the article is not perfect but that is why it needs clean up <i>not deletion</i>. A fundamental principle is that "Knowledge is Power" and sometimes you need to throw off the cover of the darker and uglier parts of existance to show it as it is. I would say this article (in a more ideal state) can actually serve an immense benefit in preventing suicides rather then encourage it. In their depressed state with only a shadow of knowledge, an individual can fantasize and visualize an ideal concept of suicide. But when the stark reality of what suicide actually is and what it means hits you, that knowledge can knock a person out of their fantasy concept and maybe the grim reality will cause them to reconsider. An ignorant mind is far more dangerous then an encyclopedia entry. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 10:10, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Any argument that suicide is good or bad, wrong or right, is strictly a matter of an individual's personal opinions and beliefs. It should be noted that suicide has been regarded as both abhorrant and supremely honorable. Therefore we are left with technical nuetrality. It should not be deleted for the remaining grisliness alone, as that would be tantamount to simple censorship. Furthermore, anyone looking to seriously kill themselves should be given out of a sort of humanitarian aid the most complete resouces to do it as cleanly and easily as possible. If they are intent on ending their life, it can't be very good in their esteem, and out of mercy they deserve a good death. Then again, this is just my personal opinion. Even more pointedly, it could be argued that reading all the heretofor unknown unpleasant details of the reader's self-proposed end of one's life may even DISCOURAGE suicide, and therefore SAVE lives. For example, someone intending to jump out of a six story window may come across this article and find that there is a ten percent chance of living from this. Discovering that it isn't instant 100% guaranteed death as portratyed in movies, they may start to consider life after such an event to their persons and their opinion may be -slightly- swayed in the direction of just toughing life out. And lastly, in my own personal experience, I will honestly admit I came to this article considering ways of ending my own life, and after perusing it, am now just thinking of going out and getting really drunk as an alternative. The article itself in summary is "living" (yeah, i'm funny) factual proof that transitioning from life to death is not as easy as a painless flick of a switch, and that there is indeed, no easy way out.11:58, 15 September 2006 69.149.178.129</li>

Efforts to delete this article verge on <a href="../../../c/e/n/Censorship.html" title="Censorship">censorship</a> (i.e., controlling access to information to stabilize or improve society). It involves <b>suppression</b> of ideas with the intent of controlling perceptions; classic indicators of censorship. Censorship invariably involves restricting information that does not match the <a href="../../../v/a/l/Value_systems.html" title="Value systems">value system</a> of those who censor. Although topics such as obscene speech &amp; sedition have been routinely censored (even in the U.S. where the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_7435.html" title="First Amendment to the United States Constitution">First Amendment to the United States Constitution</a> specifies that Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech); removing discussion of suicide methods, when <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assisted_suicide.html" title="Assisted suicide">assisted suicide</a> is legal in states such as Oregon, would be setting new standards of control. True, Wikipedia relies heavily on consensus, which provides for periodic attempts at censorship by members sincerely interested in the good of humankind (or some subset of humankind). But in the end a neutral point of view, which acknowledges a multiplicity of views, will prevail. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWilliamborg_4029.html" title="User talk:Williamborg">Williamborg</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWilliamborg_4029.html" title="User talk:Williamborg">Bill</a>) 04:44, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I have been watching this debate and I think that both sides have points that can't be ignored, and so I think a compromise might be in order.</li>
</ul>
<p>First of all, <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slippery_slope.html" title="Slippery slope">slippery slope</a> arguments are being made on both sides. Would deleting this article be a slippery slope to more extreme censorship? Maybe a little bit, but I doubt there are many other articles that people could use the same arguments for deletion as strongly as this one, so I don't think we have much to worry about there. If we keep it, will we see articles about methods of sabotaging airplanes or raping children? I doubt that too. The MOST IMPORTANT thing is that we are not arguing about deleting other articles and we are not arguing about adding a rape methods article -- we are debating THIS article alone. I didn't stumble across this article while having suicidal thoughts, I read it because the subject is fascinating. Personally, I fall on the side of the people that speculate that, unless one is already determined to kill onesself, an article about methods isn't going to persuade them to do it. The truth is, however, that I don't really know what it would be like to be seriously considering taking my own life, and most of you probably don't either. Too much of this debate is based on speculation. In the spirit of freedom of information, I think the burden should be on the advocates of deletion to find research showing that such articles (or books) increase suicidal tendencies. Anecdotal evidence on either side of the arguments over that point (and it's probably the main point of contention in this debate) is meaningless. However, the people who have concerns about suicidal people reading the article as a how-to guide have valid concerns. The fact that there is an article about suicide methods but not about signs of suicidality DOES bother me. There should be an article about common symptoms displayed by people who are contemplating suicide. I'm sure there are myriad reliable sources for this information. I also agree that the article needs some cleaning up. Possibly a longer introduction is in order, and I think that adding something about the general uncertainty involved in nearly all methods of suicide would be good, and I'm sure it would, if anything, increase the chances of a suicidal reader's reconsideration. Look, we wouldn't be arguing about this if we didn't love wikipedia, and we would all weep if we heard about someone who killed themselves after reading this article, but I truly think that if a suicidal person is going through the trouble of research, they are crying for help. If they really wanted to get the job done, they could do it without the research I think. <a href="../../../r/g/r/User%7ERgrizza_9e77.html" title="User:Rgrizza">rgrizza</a> 05:15, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Reasoning follows. Suicide is a documented phenomenon. It is certainly encyclopedic. People commit suicide in various ways. These ways have major differences. These differences, and hence the ways, are encyclopedic. Wikipedia is not censored. Perhaps somebody will commit suicide after reading this page. That's extremely unfortunate and tragic. However, I'm sure that recent Canadian shooter read information on the Columbine tragedy (whether here or elsewhere)... The fact that these things happen <i><b>does not mean</b></i> that we should delete information about them. If someone is going to commit suicide, they will find a way to do it, whether there's a WP article on it or not. --<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorkk_d740.html" title="User:Storkk">Storkk</a> 17:00, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is quite a difficult issue, one which I believe strikes on some of the flaws inherent to Wikipedia. Is NPOV actually a POV? Isn't "evil" POV? Is it possible to keep an article such as this sane when subject to the attention of two polarized viewpoints? All things considered, I believe this could be a valid entry if handled carefully. Namely, a set of special guidelines in the talk page detailing how to contribute to the article, elimination of unreferenced material, and a compromise with the "suicide is bad" viewpoint by linking to suicide prevention in the "see also" section (it is relevant, after all). A warning at the top stating that the dangers would be acceptable, so long as it were delicately worded ("If you are considering suicide, seek help now" is not delicate). As for being a manual, you could argue that <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricin.html" title="Ricin">ricin</a> details how to make lethal poison or <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marijuana.html" title="Marijuana">marijuana</a> how to maximize drug yields. Any good source of knowledge can be used to carry out an act; otherwise it is useless trivia. If we toss this out on that basis, perhaps we should toss out all of the chemistry articles while we're at it? ~ Eidako 12:32, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, article provides information and would be extremely useful to someone doing research on the phenomenon of suicide. Although it may be somewhat useful to someone wanting to commit suicide (though there are hundreds of sites on the internet that provide much more detailed information e.g. alt.suicide.holiday FAQ), in actuality this information may equally likely discourage someone from attempting suicide. Additionally, as the person who added the radial and ulnar artery information to the slitting wrists section <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Suicide_methods&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=63855953" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Suicide_methods&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=63855953" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>, I further would like to make the point that condemning suicide is itself POV. There are some people out there who actually consider suicide as a proper way to end suffering (I am not one of them), and by imposing one's own (arbitrary) morals that suicide is wrong, aren't we being close-minded and ultimately one-sided? <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedia_brown_aa79.html" title="User:Wikipedia brown">Wikipedia brown</a> 20:57, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> If someone kills themselves as a result of something they read on the Internet, one has to question their sanity in the first place. People predisposed to suicide will find other sources of information anyway. This entry is encyclopedic. It should be edited around a bit so make it seem less approving (obviously without going into POV, so by adding sources); but if we start here, next we'll start deleting other content on Wikipedia. Plus, people have a right to live their own life. They also should have the right to end it. You would rather lock someone up where they would remain in despair and mental anguish for the rest of their lives, rather than allow them the mercy of ending it all.<br />
<br />
Then again, by including this article, those predisposed to suicide will trigger their suicide in this manner. Therefore it makes sense that leaving this article (which seems to be quite recent) could in fact trigger suicide in a depressed person. People should have the right to make up their own minds, and not have us make them up for them, but at the same time some people are not capable of making rational desicions that they once would have made. This makes this article tricky to delete or keep. There are pros and cons either way. However, in the end, does anyone want to read the headline, "Teen Suicide Over Wikipedia Entry"? Because I sure wouldn't, and if I contributed to that article I'd feel like I contributed to that person's death. This is the only reason why I pick delete. I must admit in my weaker moments I (or others) might be tempted to read this article and follow its 'advice' and this is why I think it should be removed.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - This website does not just list methods, it describes ways to make attempts more successful. It is not impartial, it makes suicide sound acceptable. It links to a page that describes in great detail the best ways to make attempts successful, and deters against methods that have a low success rate. Many people who look up information on suicide are doing it because they're depressed. How can anyone support a page that serves no other purpose than to prey on vulnerable people. Treeny</li>

I can see the reasoning behind deleting it from a given person's moral perspective but this is actually the framework of a very good article overall.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - This article is a disgrace to Wikipedia. No encyclopedia in the world has ever included an article on "Suicide methods". "Suicide", of course - but "Suicide methods" absolutely not. The problem is in the title of the article, which attracts edits making it a "how to" manual inevitable, however much it may be cleaned up whenever it is regularly, and rightly, put up for deletion. This article should be deleted and whatever is encyclopedic about the contents (very little) can go into "Suicide". Another beef I have with this article is that the crusaders for it prevent edits which place at the top of the page prominent links and warnings to those who are contemplating suicide, directing them to reconsider and to help. One of my own several efforts in this regards is at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Suicide_methods&amp;oldid=47274172" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Suicide_methods&amp;oldid=47274172" rel="nofollow">6 April 2003</a>, I had many predecessors in this, who all failed against the regular editors, as I did. Instead, these resources are banished to the very bottom of an info box. This article is profoundly sick.

<dd>I've seen it now! More to the point, deletion of a page which may cause death is not censorship, if it happens it will be by consensus or as a result of a policy decision. I agree that, whilst an article on "Suicide methods" exists, editors will always edit out exhortations against following the methods as non NPOV. That is why an article on "Suicide methods", as opposed to "Suicide", is misconceived, and no clean up ever works or sticks. On your arrest point, you are anonymous and so I don't know who "we" is - in fact, attempted suicide has been a crime in many countries for long periods, including the UK before the passage of the <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide_Act_1961_9232.html" title="Suicide Act 1961">Suicide Act 1961</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> There seems to be consensus above that the article is a manual. Also, the censorship issue has also been discussed above. Wikipedia does delete pages, and whether you like it or not, this is a form of censorship. Furthermore there seems to be some confusion between the encyclopaedic nature of suicide, and the uncylcopaedic nature of the article about suicide methods. We only wish to delete the suicide methods page. I am aware that some of the keep camp think that the article can be fixed, but I think it should be considered that this article has been nominated for deletion twice before. There was plenty of time to fix it up, but it wasn't. This page is immune to proper cleanup.Wik98 00:40, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>This page is immune to proper cleanup</i> Leaving aside the symantic problem with that sentance and what you're trying to say, and ignoring the "no-one's been bothered yet" argument, why is cleanup not possible?

<li>Line, I like what you are saying, but the problem as I see it is that the title of the article prevents this page from being anything other than a list of suicide methods. Over time, the edits will become more and more morbid, as editors wish to add more detail to each method. It seems impossible to prevent editors from adding the type of detail which turns an article like this into a How-to guide. Besides, Lina, what kind of references are being used right now? A suicide methods file that was constructed by anonymous users of a suicide newsgroup. It is hardly the most encyclopaedic of sources, is it? You may argue that in the future some smart fellow might do a search on pubmed for an acedemic suicide review, but I feel this is wishful thinking. In anycase, this article should be deleted on the basis of what it is now, not what it can be. Wik98 01:14, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The moral and legal objects are well meant and heartfelt. And obviously there may be rare cases where wikipedia needs to assert censorship. But this is not one them. For one, there are plenty of explicit articles on wikipedia dealing with topics that many users find morally objectionable and which may be illegal in any number of jurisdictions around the world, e.g. most of the articles dealing with sexuality in all its variations. One of the underlying principles of wikipedia is that transparancy is a good. Knowing more is good. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> edits have helped the quality of the article. As he asserts, there is more work to be done.

Finally, regarding the morality issues. On any <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consequentialist.html" title="Consequentialist">consequentialist</a> account, we would have to factor in the benefit this article may provide to people who are concerned about love-ones who seem depressed.

<li>The article for deletion is Suicide Methods, not suicide. I highly doubt in a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consequentialist.html" title="Consequentialist">consequentialist</a> account that the family of a suicide victim would find anything on the Suicide Methods page that would have helped them prevent their loved one from killing themselves. After all this page only discusses ways that people kill themselves, not the signs that people display before they suicide. the suicide page is valuable for the reason you have raised, but the suicide methods page is not.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It seems that this article is being nominated for deletion solely out of certain individuals' notions of propriety and morality (and this moral outlook is not shared by everyone: personally, I see no problem with suicide, and much less with an article on the ways in which people do it). There is no policy-based reason for this article to be deleted, and its topic is noteworthy. The article itself is well referenced, although it could do with a cleanup, particularly for language and style. However, the presence of the odd comma splice is obviously not why this discussion is occurring. The nominator writes about the article being "ethically bankrupt" and so forth: <i>I</i> think it is providing a worthwhile public service (and this doesn't really matter, since "ethical conduct" is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">no more what Wikipedia is about</a> than performing public services). The article provides solid information on a phenomenon which is a part of life, and deleting the article will not remove suicide from society, so this whole fiasco is a pointless waste of bandwidth. Wikipedia doesn't exist to save people from their own actions, it exists to provide them with information. So the article must stay. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 09:54, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The question isn't whether deleting the article will remove suicide from society. The question is (1) whether retaining the article is likely to increase the number of successful suicides (I think yes) and (2) whether the article is encyclopedic (I think no).

<li>Seriously, now. Whether or not this article could increase the rate of successful suicides is a moot point, one which would require proper empirical evidence to evaluate (not shrill, moralising do-gooder rants). However, providing information on the various methods by which people successfully kill themselves is indeed a public service (for a variety of reasons), although <i>whether or not</i> the article existed, people would continue to commit suicide effectively, as they have done for millenia. But since Wikipedia, last time I checked, is apparently <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> here for the "public good", it really doesn't matter, one way or another. The point is that there is no <i>policy-related</i> reason why this article should go, and "ethical" arguments are too subjective to hold water. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 15:10, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Easy guys. I think this highlights something essential to this debate. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChelseaboy_a649.html" title="User:Chelseaboy">Chelseaboy</a> and others are arguing for deletion based on the premise that suicide is a bad thing. I agree with Chelseaboy about this, in most cases -- definitely if some depressed teenager happened upon this article and committed suicide because of reading it, I think that would be a terrible thing. I think most people would, and I think that <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a>'s stance on the issue is pretty radical, but the fact that he and others have expressed their opinions on this side of the fence (Byrgenwulf said, "I see no problem with suicide") is illuminating. There are multiple points of view on this: most people, I think, believe that most suicide is bad (obviously there are exceptions involving the terminally ill, etc., but that is beside the point), however another point of view that many people seem to hold is that suicide is a person's right. Wikipedia has pretty clear NPOV standards when it comes to this sort of thing, and that's why I still think the article should be KEPT. I'm going to anticipate a slippery slope rebutal here: but what about people whose point of view is that <i>murder</i> is not so bad? Do we have to respect any point of view, no matter how radical? I don't think so. I think that if actual well-meaning individuals espouse a point of view and express it eloquently, as the right-to-suicide people have (and I know they mean well as we all do in this debate), then that point of view should be respected. Thus, a deletion based on the premise that suicide is bad would be a violation of NPOV. Also, I think it's exactly this type of article that is the reason why <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_EVIL_85b9.html" title="WP:NOT EVIL">WP:NOT EVIL</a> has not been adopted as an official policy.<a href="../../../r/g/r/User%7ERgrizza_9e77.html" title="User:Rgrizza">Rgrizza</a> 16:32, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>It seems that proposing the deletion of this page has been far more controversial than I thought it would be. Some of the arguments raised in support of keeping this page are reasonable. Others aren't. It is true that other webpages on the internet will describe the various methods by which people can die even if this wikipedia article is deleted. This article certainly doesn't glamorise suicide and it does portray a verifiable social phenomenon that spans pretty much every culture.</p>
<p>However, this article does provide specific details on how people may end their life, and this can't be ignored. While it is true that wikipedia shouldn't be censored, it often is. There is some information that you can't find in this encyclopaedia, like "tips for how to rape children", and "how to use molecular biology techniques to modify bacterial pathogens and create a new plague". These articles don't exist because they are offensive and dangerous even though some users may find them interesting.</p>
<p>When the quality of this encyclopaedia is threatened, wikipedia users respond by deleting pages. Even though this page about suicide methods documents a verifiable social phenomenon, and it doesn't glamorise suicide, and even ignoring ethical concerns, the quality of this article is so poor that it must be deleted on grounds of quality alone.</p>
<p>This article is listcruff. It merely presents a list of suicide methods which has been taken from a website that appears to be original research. The references they provide aren't from medical journals, government agencies or newspapers. Rather, they have been built from suicide newsgroups. This is not encyclopaedic at all. It's pseudo research.</p>
<p>Although not unanimous, there appears to be consensus that this article is basically a suicide manual. As Nydas wrote, "This is a how-to guide. Much of the text is given over to 'common pitfalls' of suicide methods". Wikipedia is not meant to be a manual, and especially not a poorly written one.</p>
<p>While I concede that this article is interesting in a visceral sense, this is not enough to save it from deletion. I tried to avoid using the morality argument, but given the comment below by a depressed teenager, I am forced to bring it up.</p>
<p>Someone wrote that "This article is helpful, and shouldn't be deleted just because it provides accurate and specific details on how people may end their life. If people really wanted to end their lives the information to do so can be found just as easily from many other sources. And all of this is the opinion of I, a depressed, but not suicidal, teenager. Thank You"</p>
<p>People don't start out suicidal. It begins with depression, and develops as the depression gets worse. This teenager admits depression, and has decided to look up suicide in wikipedia. Doesn't this indicate suicidal thoughts? My fellow wikipedians, we have to protect young people from themselves. Let's not prostitute our values for poor quality articles.

<li><b>Comment</b> Is assisted suicide legal in Florida? I ask because Wikipedia is not meant to show material that is illegal in Florida, as the wikipedia servers are physically located in Florida <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_disclaimer_8d69.html" title="Wikipedia:Content disclaimer">Wikipedia:Content_disclaimer</a>. I disagree with <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThrow_acb9.html" title="User:Throw">User:Throw</a> that the article is well researched and encylopaedic. Almost the entire article is stolen from <a href="http://www.ctrl-c.liu.se/~ingvar/methods/other.html" class="external free" title="http://www.ctrl-c.liu.se/~ingvar/methods/other.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ctrl-c.liu.se/~ingvar/methods/other.html</a> word for word. This isn't research, it's plagiarism and possibly a copyright violation.Wik98 01:20, 15 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This article isn't doing anything remotely close to "assisting suicide". To actually assist suicide you have to, you know ... assist in it. Not just write an encyclopedia article on it. I don't think Florida law can be interpreted so broadly as to suggest that merely writing about suicide is illegal. In America we have a thing called free speech ... <a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 01:27, 15 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>While free speech is a wonderful right to have you must remember American law doesn't apply to Wikipedia. Wikipedia sets and follows its own rules that apply worldwide. Wikipedia is Jimmy Wales' home, and he allows us to put our feet on his coffee table and raid his refrigerator....as long as we follow <i>his</i> rules. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThrow_acb9.html" title="User:Throw">Throw</a> 01:34, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>As long as having Internet is legal in Florida, everything is strictly under the law here I believe. Besides, writing an encyclopedical article about something that is illegal in Florida isn't an illegal act by itself.

<li>I'm from Australia, and we don't have a bill of rights. Some dude was put in jail for using a loudspeaker to talk randomly at a shopping mall. This violated a local council bylaw, and he tried to argue that free speech was guaranteed, but the high court found it wasn't. . While the U.S. has a bill of rights, and Free speech is more protected, it isn't that protected. I believe that you are not free to talk with others about commiting a terrorist act. Libel laws mean you are also probably not free to say something about someone else which isn't true. Likewise, it is possible that talking to a suicidal aquaintance about the best methods for commiting suicide would be illegal in a state that outlawed assisted suicide, even if this conversation only took part on wikipedia. Wik98 01:43, 15 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The article in question is not advocating or protesting suicide in any way. What is it doing is making a list of methods of suicide that can and have been used. Any indication in the article where it tries to hint at best methods would be a NPOV violation and should be editted, but this article should not be deleted. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThrow_acb9.html" title="User:Throw">Throw</a> 01:58, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>This article compares suicide methods, and also provides links to pages like <a href="http://www.ctrl-c.liu.se/~ingvar/methods/other.html" class="external free" title="http://www.ctrl-c.liu.se/~ingvar/methods/other.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ctrl-c.liu.se/~ingvar/methods/other.html</a> which do an even more thourough job. The best methods would still be obvious even if it were written in NPOV format. This article should be deleted precisely because it is impossible to compare suicide methods without implying that some methods are better than others. And besides, this article is not at all encylopaedic. It has no historial context, andmost of the information it has is copied directly from suidice method websites.Wik98 02:15, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The debate about suicide is not neutral. It is loaded by statistics which show that young people across all cultures are more likely than any other group to attempt ending their lives. Your idea that those who wish to commit suicide should be given the resources to do it out of humanitarian respect is so obtuse as to be obsene. I am saddened to hear of your own battle with suicidal thoughts, yet I do not see your experience as common. People who are suicidal tend to be aware of the grissliness of suicide. Articles like these are more likely to educate them about the methods to use which work. Ie, If I were suicidal, I would find that hanging is a surer bet than slitting my wrists, and I did not know this before viewing this page. But I was aware that both methods were grissly before I came here.Wik98 12:20, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>It's not like there hasn't been enough time to clean this article up. It has been nominated twice before. The problem, as <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChelseaboy_a649.html" title="User:Chelseaboy">Chelseaboy</a> noted, is that you can't clean up a page that is named suicide methods.

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../w/w/i/WP%7EWWIN_b86f.html" title="WP:WWIN">WP:WWIN</a>"Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information:" "Instruction manuals. While Wikipedia has descriptions of people, places, and things, Wikipedia articles should not include instruction - advice (legal, medical, or otherwise), suggestions, or contain "how-to"s.

<li><b>Comment</b> The question keeps coming up of whether there is a substantial risk that the page could lead to a death that would not otherwise have happened. We're pretty much doing guesswork about that, and I think some expert opinions would be very helpful here. Here is a passage from the American Association of Suicidology "Media Guidelines for Reporting on Suicide": <i>Exposure to suicide method through media reports can encourage vulnerable individuals to imitate it. Clinicians believe the danger is even greater if there is a detailed description of the method. Research indicates that detailed descriptions or pictures of the location or site of a suicide encourage imitation.</i> <a href="http://www.suicidology.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=9" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.suicidology.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=9" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>.

<p><b>Compromise proposal</b> A compromise would be, if the article is kept, at least to allow prominent reference to resources which might help people to deal with their situation without killing themselves. You could regard this either as a balance between NPOV and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_EVIL_85b9.html" title="WP:NOT EVIL">WP:NOT EVIL</a> or, indeed, as truly neutral point of view in that methods would still be set out (the how-to manual if you will) but the alternative point of view, that there are other approaches open to the potential suicide which deserve consideration, would also be given due prominence. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChelseaboy_a649.html" title="User:Chelseaboy">Chelseaboy</a> 17:28, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I still think that is interjecting POV. As another editor noted, there have been times in civilized society that suicide was considered honorable. There are a variety of reasons for a person to consider taking there own life. In my personal opinion, the vast, vast majority of them are poor reasons but again that is just my personal view. Ultimately, it comes down to each and every individual to make up their own assessment of the matter. It's not a matter of WP:NOT EVIL at all. It is not Wikipedia's role to legislate through our editting any particular view or sense of morality on a subject. To paraphrase another editor in the Hitler article, we don't have to say that things like <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape.html" title="Rape">rape</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_molestation.html" title="Child molestation">child molestation</a> is bad because if we write the article in an impassioned, NPOV view the evident facts will shine through. It my opinion that if we maintain NPOV with this article, the same is true. <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.157.110.11.html" title="User:205.157.110.11">205.157.110.11</a> 11:58, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Agreed with IP. Also, NPOV is a long-standing policy. NOT EVIL is an essay.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 15:38, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm still not quite sure where I fall on this issue, but one possible point of compromise is in <i>see also</i> material and in-text references. I think presenting a fair view on suicide has to include material on risks, consequences, suicide hotlines, the extent to which suicidal urges are a treatable medical condition, and so on. Questions of morality aside, I think we all agree that NPOV requires us to be sure that readers come away with a fair picture of the topics we present. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 15:54, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Eidako above (in the recomendation area) added the thought about linking <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide_prevention.html" title="Suicide prevention">suicide prevention</a> in the <i>See Also</i> section. I think that would appropriate but putting a "warning" on top would be WAAAAAY too POV. Another idea would be to make sure that each <i>method</i> has a clear negative comment on what the physical "affect" on the body are with a failed attempt or other potential problems (like with "Driving"). Some already have these (like "Electrocution" &amp; "Asphyxiation"). It's vital to NPOV to neither <i>glamorize</i> suicide nor to moralize about it being wrong. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 16:03, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>it doesnt matter. having it this way makes it easier to find and use. that geocities page could end up going 404 in a week. having the info on the wiki will make sure it stays avalible. and putting it on the D'Hara page will just clutter that up because you know as well as i that we cant have anything close to the High D'Haran info there. this is nuts. there has been no peer review, or any other input. its just been you going on about deleting it since i put it up. get off it. i strongly encourage people to check out the page, and check out the talk page with it. - <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrickjsanford_f565.html" title="User:Patrickjsanford">Patrickjsanford</a> 20:19, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am sorry if I am sticking my nose where it doesn't belong but neo, stop being wiki snob and admit that even though you didn't think of it this page does have its merits. Furthermore I think that everything imitates everything else have you ever heard the phrase art imitates life which imitates art? If this is a copyright violation then so is the page on Plato and Aristotle and Socrates and every other thing that has ever been offered any info on because you cant give a excellent observation on anything without including some of the original material into the article. I notice you haven't jumped on Tolkeins elven language page, why is that? Stop being a snob and let those with new and interesting ideas have their say also. This page does not belong to only you but to everyone, so please stop acting as if you are the Wiki god, okay? Sorry if I've offended you but I am offended by condescending people who are rude, so just stop. The page should stay because it offers an in depth look at High D'Haran. - Selena Moriarti 20:15, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. I've read the books in question, and the language described in this article does not play a particuarly significant role in the books, and is never described in detail. I'm pretty sure that the "list of terms and words" contains - more or less - every single word of the conlang which appears in the series, including a number of words inferred from phrases. In total, there are perhaps fifteen or so unique words and phrases which appear in the series.. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 20:51, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

Gezzz Neo why is it that all you want to do is to tear down anything but your ASOIAF pages? Talk about fancrufty the whole BwoB on GRRM's page is all that... Dude, you seriously need to stop being an edit nazi. If you cannot add to the positive aspect then stop trying to destroy a page. All you can do is to point out what "you" see as faults. All you do is to add content (and questionable at that) to your asoiaf pages. I think we need someone to look into your abusive actions on this whole issue....</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> A stub by itself is a legit article format. The best way to improve a stub that is acting more like a thorn is to roll up your sleeves and expand it.

<li>My mistake, it was BriBrick that removed the nomination to delete.

<p>Cfrydj, I challenge you to dispute the objectivity of the Fire It Up page. It is written in third person and is linked to multiple other wikipedia sources. The page could be expanded upon by numerous editors in the listening region. The show has been written about in "The Tufts Daily," "The Stonehill Summit," and has been associated with multiple sporting events involving actual Division II and III university athletic teams. The Fire It Up page is not some cryptic babble, and it certainly IS noteable. Erroneous on both counts.Fireitup 21:14, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I am not disputing the objectivity of the Fire It Up page. I am disputing its notability. It also contains no reliable sources. I am not sure what makes you say that it is "linked to multiple other wikipedia sources". The article does contain links to other Wikipedia articles, but no other Wikipedia articles contain links to it. I am afraid a campus radio station that has been written about by campus newspapers does not qualify as notable.<a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfrydj_cc34.html" title="User:Cfrydj">Cfrydj</a> 21:21, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>So throughout the lengthy history of Wikipedia, whenever articles didn't have links to them, does that mean they were automatically not notable? I am sure it takes time to build such links. If a college newspaper isn't notable, then why are there wikis for college newspapers? Also, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_M._Silverstein" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_M._Silverstein" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_M._Silverstein</a> is an entry for a gentleman who has affiliation with WMFO, as you asked, as well as college newspapers. In accordance with the notability clause you cite, this page would be deleted as well. And I'm sure a great many other pages would be. Taking edits "by the book" would devoid wikipedia of a resounding amount of valuable information. I simply ask that my entry be spared from what seems to be an argument so editors CAN link to it. Fireitup 21:28, 12 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>At no point have I said that this article should be deleted because of a lack of links to it. I was only refuting your above claim that it was notable because of nonexistent links. Mr. Silverstein is an award-winning columnist. The fact that he gives commentary on "The Ari G Show" does nothing for the notability of either the "Dante and The Brick" or "Fire It Up with The Spinners" shows.<a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfrydj_cc34.html" title="User:Cfrydj">Cfrydj</a> 21:35, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Sir, while suggesting the Fire It Up page should be deleted, you used the statement "but no other Wikipedia articles contain links to it," therefore you used the argument that the article should be deleted based on a lack of links. Also, if you intend to use Mr. Silverstein's notability as an award-winng columnist as a a juxtaposition to the Fire It Up page, it should be noted that the award he received does not have a wikipedia page. Thus, his merit as an "award-winning columnist" is moot.Fireitup 21:45, 12 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm afraid that you are missing the point entirely. In each successive comment, all I have been doing is showing how your arguments in favour of the notability of the article are irrelevant. The only reason I added the Fire It Up page was because of its lack of notability. I only mentioned the lack of links to the article in response to your claim that those links existed. Check the order of the comments, and you will see that this is the case. I also only refered to Mr. Silverstein in response to your claim that his connection with WMFO somehow gave the article on the Fire It Up radio show some notability, which is not the case. I hope that the misunderstandings are settled now. <a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfrydj_cc34.html" title="User:Cfrydj">Cfrydj</a> 21:51, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I respectuflly reply that I have only been trying to engage you in a bttle of logic. See, my refutations have only surfaced to refute your refutations. Let's put it this way: I feel you are wasting your time trying to delete the Fire It Up article. It would not have been deleted had this discussion not occured. I am going to try to edit the article to match it to the specifications upon which you insist. In the meantime I would appreciate that you remove the nomination for deletion.

<li>That decision is up to the Wikipedia community now, to be decided by consensus. So far, anybody not personally connected to either of the two radio shows has voted for it to be deleted. I'm not sure how you will edit the article to make the radio show have some notability, I'm curious to see the end result.<a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfrydj_cc34.html" title="User:Cfrydj">Cfrydj</a> 22:17, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>However, when you think of it, the editor of the Fire It Up page and the editor of the Dante and the Brick page have no personal connection through edits to each other's pages, thus each page has one vote for undeletion. The opposition consists of you and two Holy Cross students, who clearly have a bias against Boston College, Tufts University, Stonehill College, the Dante and the Brick show, blegs, Joe Mauer, all of it. That's just the way it works here. That is clearly unfair. Thus we stand even, one vote to one, in terms of unbiased voters.Fireitup 22:27, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>What you have also failed to take into consideration are the notability of the guests which appear on Dante and The Brick each and every week. Prof. Chow from Tufts University is an award-winning computer scientist, his work has appeared on Oreilly.net as well as published in various industry periodicals. Mohammad Jahed Dirkalurka is an innovative thinker, who would call out anyone trying to destroy this page as a devil. Bitch Slap Guy is a man of brains and braun, after Katie Couric is done at CBS, it will be him bringing you the news. And needless to say, The Olse &amp; Harry Carey, longtime friends who enjoy each others company as well as each others humor. The Olse is a drunk Irishman, and Harry has been dead for 8 years, but both contribute to this fine show, whose Wikipedia page you are going to delete. And why is that, because you didn't get the job at the mall as the security guard with the big ugly sombrero, so you did the next best thing, make yourself God of wikipedia, where you can control what is notable.

<dd>This is not a matter of semantics, but of notability requirements for <i>an encyclopedia</i>. There are many, many programs on the airways that are not sufficiently notable to have encyclopedia articles. Google hits are one way of rating notability. There are others-- no evidence for the subject meeting those criteria has been provided in "keep" arguments. Perhaps the creator of the article can turn his talents to constructively editing other articles. The deletion of this article will not in any way stop you from listening to Fire It UP.

</ul>
<p>This may be my first response or comment posted on wikipedia, but I was searching through for shows on WMFO on wiki and I came across Dante and the Brick and the Fire it Up programs. I respect what Dante and the Brick do, I believe they are a fresh face to the usual stale talk/music that is WMFO weekdays. As for the Fire it Up program, they talk some damn good sports regarding the Boston area. These guys have talent and people should catch on to the popularity. Check out their website at fireitup.bravehost.com, you'll see that their show is significant and has a following. There, that's my concerns, if you have a problem with that, then stop being a friggin policeman of the internet and get a life. Go worry about something else.JHA30 06:38, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>To answer each objection to this page in turn: 1. It is not an advertisement. Neither WMFO nor the personalities in question will in any way profit from the inclusion of this article in Wikipedia. 2. The information is verifiable. The WMFO website notes the show and time slot and information about the shows exist in student publications which are archived. The show's prior episode may be reviewed at the station website. 3. The entry is notable. The show originally in question, Dante and the Brick, and the show incorporated by the "geek patrol", Fire it Up, are or were broadcast over a large geographic area with at least the potential to reach a large number of listeners. Both can be listened to from around the world through itunes and the WMFO website. It is uncontested that WMFO is notable, therefore the flagship shows carried should be considered notable as well. 4. The show is "encyclopedia notable". This phrase must be read as applicable to Wikipedia rather than less inclusive encyclopedias. This article provides only verifiable facts regarding a single unambiguous subject. It provides a definition of a radio program that is useful to anyone searching for this information. 5. It is not a "vanity" post. Neither personality's proper name is given and the actual broadcast likely reaches a significant number of listeners regardless of this entry. 6. There is little possibility of misdirecting a reader. There is no competing 'Dante and the Brick' entry and users searching for "Dante" or "The Brick" will realize it is not the information they sought upon cursory examination of the article if not at the search screen. Finally the consequences of deletion far outweigh the consequences of allowing the information to remain. The availability of information about this program is notable and useful to listeners, potential listeners, and any other information seeker. Dante and the Brick offers a unique type of talk radio in its market and Fire It Up offers a unique perspective on boston sports. The Boston talk and sports radio markets are both significant and crowded. The low probability of misdirection shows that there is virtually no consequence to allowing the entry to remain. For these reasons this post should not be deleted. <small>—<i>the preceding comment is by</i> JourneyRocks - 23:31, 17 September 2006 UTC: <i><a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">Please sign your posts</a>!</i></small></p>

<li>A couple questions...so first, a community member's (EDITOR'S) input is considered "more heavily" than regular users of the website? So apparently those who visit wikipedia daily but don't bother to edit pages aren't important. That is a major insult to the user base. I don't have figures, but I'd venture that less than 1% of wikipedia visitors actually edit pages. Therefore, if someone is so passionate about the inclusion of an entry that they create said "single-purpose" account, just so they can join in a debate, it means nothing? That's a slap in the face of the user base. Let this be said, those of you who have entered this dialogue, coming up with cryptic phraseology in bold face type to dismiss community statements seriously lack a funny bone. Why not engage in a lighthearted, spirited debate about these articles? Because it's a waste of time for these "editor" types. Fine, whatever, I give up, you can delete to your heart's content. But seriously, grab a sense of humor or SOMETHING or you will never, ever get laid.24.147.151.4 02:12, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hi. The readers are of course important; they are why we do this. But there are many concerns to be balanced, and until you've spent some time here, they aren't all obvious. We generally welcome contributions from single-purpose accounts (and many, many people with no accounts at all). It's just that in AfDs we find that special-purpose accounts generally have a purpose other than building a good encyclopedia. Sorry if we seem cryptic or stuffy here, but with about 1000 AfDs a week on Wikipedia, the responses that seem novel and entertaining to you are regrettably familiar to us. If you spend some time working on articles where you don't have a strong personal interest you'll discover that there's plenty of fun being had.

<p>The result was <b>Delete</b>. Admittedly, by strict tally, this argument is on the verge of being "no consensus." Considering that the keep arguments fail to engage on matters of policy (deferring instead to personal beliefs regarding the site's quality), the strength of argument weighs in favoring of deletion. The complete lack of reliable sources decides the matter; but, I will happily userfy for anyone willing to search out such reliable sources. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 00:59, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment.</b> Well Google bases its hits ranking off the number of webpages that link to the site which is why Google is often used as a yardstick of sorts to determine Notability.

<p>Okay, here's a weird one. Basically, this is about a subforum of a website, which does not (IMHO) fulfill any sort of notability criteria (let alone <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>) - and the article contents probably would warrant a complete rewrite in any case, in which case <b>Deleting</b> won't hurt. The more odd thing is that I bring this to AfD: I deleted this already, but thought I was kinda-sorta stretching CSD A7, because this is a web forum and not a group of people; however, while a witty philosopher might lump them to same group, the practice is still highly controversial (I'm not saying yea or nay on that myself). I figured that CSD is for uncontroversial stuff and I can't decide myself, it won't hurt to AfD. So here it is up for evaluation, for the sake of the Process. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 20:27, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> actually, I should have made this clear so thanks for the comment. The article indeed refers to a study conducted by a non-profit organization of the Netherlands <a href="http://www.slo.nl/international/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.slo.nl/international/" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> which technically is independent from the ministry of education (although subsidized by it). It is that organization's task to undertake studies and there's no sign that this one was less routine than the others (and I say this after zipping through all 8 pages of that report). That still does not make it notable as there is no evidence that there was a follow-up since that 2003 study. Surely if this New Jersey based company had a hot product, you would actually have this reflected on their website <a href="http://www.bookmap.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bookmap.com" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>. Also I went back to your Google search and looked at the dutch pages (I know enough german to at least get a jist of the content. They are mentions in passing that this SLO organization is conducting a study on that product. In fact, most pages have the very same paragprah on the subject which means it was probably a press release or something of that sort. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 21:35, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

According to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>"Organizations whose activities are local in scope are usually not notable unless verifiable information from reliable third party sources can be found." Most theatrical activities listed on PA can be verified through the listed theater, in various news papers, and on other theatrical websites. Furthermore "Organizations are usually notable if the scope of activities are national in scale and information can be verified by a third party source." Though most activities listed are local to Utah we do have members throughout the U.S. who also list theatrical activity which can also be verified in their individual states.

<p>That said, I believe this article is not notable (a fictional event in a recent adventure book, which can hardly be considered classic, or even notable among recent literature). It consists largely of speculation, and is written in a factual tone (I changed the first paragraph to make it obvious it was fictional).
