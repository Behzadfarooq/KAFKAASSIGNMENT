<li>No vote on this article, but I feel compelled to object to that last remark. It is <b>not</b> true that there is "consensus here to keep every school."

<li>Not all roads are notable some schools like Elementary Schools get erased. And most roads are even less notable than that. That is a perfect example.Not ALL numbered roads are notable if we got an article on every road in the world there will be hundreds of millions of articles numbered roads also Probaly a million+ of those out there and We Cant Keep them all. --<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranda56_4537.html" title="User:Aranda56">Aranda56</a> 02:14, 13 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There are not even close to a million numbered state/provincial roads in the world. If you assumed a rough average of 100 state routes per state, that would be 5,000 articles or so. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 03:14, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well, I'd put the number closer to 600 per state, so about 30K articles...but still, that's fewer articles than the geography bots maintain here... -- <a href="../../../i/l/g/User%7EIlGreven_50ab.html" title="User:IlGreven">Grev</a> -- <a href="../../../i/l/g/User_talk%7EIlGreven_076b.html" title="User talk:IlGreven">Talk</a> 05:22, September 13, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is not just a road, this is a state highway. I would never write an article about the street I live on. Also, there are 4,000 people who must use this road... more people than are in a typical elementary school. --<a href="../../../r/s/c/User%7ERschen7754_0301.html" title="User:Rschen7754">Rschen7754</a> 03:07, September 13, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yeah I over estimated the number of state roads. But still 5000 is too high and thats a low estimate knowing that there are many more of those.Some State Highways are still Non Notable. There are at least 30 of them in Miami alone and most of them dont got articles and i will place the vfd on it also because its only a road --<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranda56_4537.html" title="User:Aranda56">Aranda56</a> 03:46, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: This article is useful since it's a part of New Hampshire's State Highway system. I can think of articles on Wikipedia that are of far less notability than this. --<a href="../../../k/1/v/User%7EK1vsr_a65a.html" title="User:K1vsr">K1vsr</a> (<a href="../../../k/1/v/User_talk%7EK1vsr_009a.html" title="User talk:K1vsr">talk</a>) 17:24, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> simply because it is a numbered US state highway; from what I have read above it appears that there are some states that number more roads than the norm, but I don't think I've heard that about New Hampshire anyway. This road is also not short (approx 43.3 miles).
<ul>
<li>For a road in the United States, 43.3 miles is short. From where I sit right now, 43.3 miles will just barely get me to another city. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 03:25, 14 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I disagree. While relative to many areas it may be short (I'm guessing in central US this could be the case), it certianly isn't so everywhere.
