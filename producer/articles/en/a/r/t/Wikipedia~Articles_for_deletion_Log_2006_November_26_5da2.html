<li><b>Keep</b> - although it needs cleanup, I can't imagine sources would be too difficult to find.

<li><b>Delete</b> - Altohugh I'm probably getting voted off the island here, this lsit is just taken from the boss's main articles. Also, it is unreferenced &amp; a blatant fan-cruft situation. I created an <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weapons_of_Halo_2_fe1f.html" title="Weapons of Halo 2">article</a> from the biggest selling game ever, &amp; it gets deleted. just as much time was spent on my article, yet it gets deleted. So, taking the principles from that situation &amp; applying them here, this article would be deleted. So that's what I'm sticking to.

<li><b>Keep</b>- The characters listed here do play a large role in the Yoshi series games, but most have relatively little or no background info that can be cited off of the internet. Most info, if noted, has to do with battle information; the only real attainable information about these characters.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Had not known about this comic prior to today, found through link from online community scans_daily. Perhaps not famous enough to be noticed by a particularly large crowd; however, I believe this will change in the near future. Taste varies, but I would be willing to deem this notable enough to keep (ubiquity is no accountant for excellence, and merit despite obscurity has kept many authors in encyclopedias despite the fact that their works were little known). My argument is threefold:
<ul>
<li>1) I believe DC to be of sufficient quality (it is unusual, and unusually good) to merit its entry into Wikipedia,</li>
<li>2) regardless of my opinion, my own investigation (based in a large part on the comments above) lead me to believe that DC (regardless of its quality or the lack thereof) will attain some familiarity with a significant section of the public. I would argue at the least that it's attained <a href="http://www.brianmpalmer.com/gurewitch.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.brianmpalmer.com/gurewitch.htm" rel="nofollow">a status of sorts among more famous webcomic artists</a>.</li>
<li>3) I feel that the case for deletion has only been made on the grounds of its obscurity. If the article is lacking quality, let it be rewritten. But singularity has enough of a claim here to keep it. I find the "non-notable" assertion to be just that, an assertion, and specious at that. I realize that my points may be mere opinion too, but it requires something beyond facile claims of "not notable" to undo somebody else's handiwork.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> High quality, very interesting style and subject matter, I'm a big fan, yet there's not enough in the way of verifiable source material out there to write an encyclopedia article on it.

<li><b>Keep</b> Exactly as per <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonrhode_cae8.html" title="User:Jasonrhode">jasonrhode</a> above. Obscurity is not the same as non-notability. The comic is very well-known within webcomic circles. dougalg 15:56, 28 November 2006 (NST)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment,</b> right, there are plenty of obscure topics which are notable. That is the idea that, per <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>, "A subject is notable if it has been documented in multiple, non-trivial, independent, published sources" applies to many obscure topics such as some cult films, obscure bands, and webcomics. But it doesn't apply to evetyone, or to this one, as the article has no references at all, let alone to multiple non-trivial independent publishes sources. Notability is not "I've heard of it" or "me and my firnds have heard of it" or "Websites I visit talk about this." Think of Wikipedia as an encyclopedia that requires sources at least as good as a junior high school research paper. We do not have the sources here to cover this form a neutral point of view without using original research. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 17:39, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - This is just a comment on the incredibly trivial links presented above. We should not be pandering to the webcomic community, I can think of a bunch of unsigned bands which have picked up more attention and exposure than this has. Plenty are featured on <a href="../../../x/f/m/XFM_e027.html" title="XFM">XFM</a>, which is a heck of a lot more notable than popular than the publications you mention. I know of a hell of a lot of Half-Life mods that have been deleted, one could argue that <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Sweet_Half-Life_417f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sweet Half-Life">Sweet Half-Life</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Azure_Sheep_95c2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Azure Sheep">Azure Sheep</a> were well-known within the Half-Life community, but so what, everything is notable to some community, it's meaningless. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 23:18, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - i think as long as there's a category on this site about "Defunct United States soccer clubs" then it's really kind of a double standard to take this down cause it's too obscure or whatever.<i>have you seen what passes as "notable" around here?</i> seriously i think a somewhat popular webcomic deserves an article if the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Markov_strategy.html" title="Markov strategy">Markov strategy</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/s/Wisconsin_Highway_182_c48c.html" title="Wisconsin Highway 182">Wisconsin Highway 182</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Defays_75e3.html" title="Frank Defays">Frank Defays</a> gets one without arguement. also, a webcomic is different from half-life. see, not everyone plays half-life, but everyone who sees this site has internet, and thus can see the comic, so it's a bit more relevant even if obscure.<a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAceGT09_f9e6.html" title="User:AceGT09">AceGT09</a>
<ul>
<li>It's evidently <i>not</i> a popular website though is it. As popular as Genmay? <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Final_Fantasy_Shrine_3d4c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Final Fantasy Shrine">Final Fantasy Shrine</a>? <a href="../../../s/o/o/Soompi.html" title="Soompi">Soompi</a>?

<ul>
<li>you're not really saying anything there, you have no real basis that it's not a popular website beyond alexa ratings. There is alot of information on wikipedia about sub-cultures, and webcomics are getting to be a notable sub-culture. Dresden Codak is notable in that sub-culture. i see reason enough to not delete.<a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAceGT09_f9e6.html" title="User:AceGT09">AceGT09</a>

<p>Speedy-tagged as POV and unsourced. The subject itself doesn't seem unworthy of an article, though this particular article is a naked list with no sources and little content (sounds like it was compiled from someone's memory of what they saw on TV). If it's going to exist at all, it should be better written with credible sources, as it's otherwise a magnet for POV speculation. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 02:25, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> is probably the best option, although sourced information (and it can't be too hard to find sources on at least some of this) could be easily merged into an article on the Taliban or a larger History of Afghanistan page. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 02:55, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> but I agree with the above. The article desperately needs better sourcing and probably a new name.

There is a section called <i>Life under Taliban government</i> in the well sourced Taliban article (that article has 22 references).

<li><s><b>Not sure</b> (yet).</s> (See below.) Unlike most crystal ball articles, this one seems fairly well referenced. The first listed exception to the crystal ball policy says, "if the event is notable and almost certain to take place", then it may deserve an article. This one is <i>certainly</i> notable, so the question then becomes, is it <i>almost</i> certain to take place? That's a fuzzy question. (How almost is almost?) Given that this much better referenced than the average crystal-ball article, I'd like to take some time to investigate before making a final judgement, and I recommend that others study the references to see whether they feel this is "almost certain" before jumping to a conclusion. At least one reference (the one on <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Iommi_bd98.html" title="Tony Iommi">Tony Iommi</a>'s site) seems quite certain this will happen, and I'd expect the participants to know better than anyone. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 10:08, 26 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have done some editing - much of the speculation was in the formation announcement (which I have now italicised). The rumors have been downplayed somewhat. While the reference to a proposed 2007 tour is crystal ballish, the announcement of the (re)formation is the noteworthy - and pertinent - event. Now that the article is a stub, I hope that it will suffice for the purpose of the AfD. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 10:42, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> A quick Google News search came up with a number of references to the reunion, including this one <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/breaking_news/15848267.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/breaking_news/15848267.htm" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> in a major US-based daily newspaper. The "crystal ball" clause in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> begins with: <i>Wikipedia is not a collection of unverifiable speculation.</i> This isn't unverifiable, nor is it speculation. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 20:11, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> If this was as unlikely as some of you seem to think, the news would not have been posted on the websites of the three definitely involved. The same announcement appears on the sites of Tony Iommi, Dio and Geezer Butler. If that is not confirmation enough for you, what more do you want? Three official announcements from the official sites of those involved? This reunion (which is quite definitely going to happen) is certainly noteworth enough to be granted its own page on Wikipedia. If this sort of 'what if' mentality was kept for all articles pertaining things in the future, shouldn't they all be deleted, just incase?</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There are sources from reliable sources such as <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2006/10/25/entertainment/e174845D92.DTL" class="external text" title="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2006/10/25/entertainment/e174845D92.DTL" rel="nofollow">Associated Press</a> shown on Google News <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=&amp;q=Heaven+and+Hell+Geezer&amp;btnG=Search+News" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=&amp;q=Heaven+and+Hell+Geezer&amp;btnG=Search+News" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> confirming this.

<li><b>Keep</b> per above.</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> (superceding "Not Sure" comment above). I honestly still think it's marginal. The reunion will surely be notable if it does take place, but so far all we really have is an expression of desire by the potential participants. Desires, especially among such a small group, can easily change (and indeed, there's been at least one substitution in the planned line-up already). But the expressions of desire seem <i>fairly</i> firm, and it has been picked up and reported by secondary sources (which addresses any <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> issues). This <i>might</i> be notable (due to secondary coverage) even if it never takes place, which is why I said "keep", but it also might not, which is why I said "weak". <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 01:31, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete and redirect</b> to the album of the same title until there's an actual announcement of a tour or album, and add something about it to Butler, Dio, and Iommi's articles if it's not there already. It's not really notable until it actually happens.</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> A badly written article is not a criteria for deletion. It is a criteria for rewrite. He has not just set a "Clinic" Just because some one is not included here it does not mean that another person with similar credentials should not have an article (like just because one article exists, it is not a criteria for another keep). Notability is a subjective phenomenon and hence no can can PROVE notability (unlike verifiability which can be "shown"). Please read the links or do a search yourself. Media coverage in India is vastly different from Media Coverage in Western World. One Google Hit for a personality in India is equivalent to 100 Google Hits in Western world due to the language factor, different fonts used by vernacular newspapers and the simple fact that not all media in India have a web presence listing their articles <span style="border:1px solid #000;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMariano_Anto_Bruno_Mascarenhas_f6b6.html" title="User:Mariano Anto Bruno Mascarenhas"><font style="color:#ffd700;background:#000;"><b>&#160;Doctor Bruno&#160;</b></font></a></span> 12:46, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><strike><b>Keep</b></strike> - I'm tempted to say that this should be an invalid nomination, as you don't actually cite any reason for deletion. To the point of this being cruft; In my opinion the article largely remains clear of that allegation per <a href="../../../r/u/n/Portal%7ERuneScape_Fancruftguide_0428.html" title="Portal:RuneScape/Fancruftguide">Portal:RuneScape/Fancruftguide</a>. The article isn't particularly well-referenced but that should be taken to the talk page, and not necessarily used as your sole reason to AfD it.<br />
To me it seems that the article survived the first AfD not because if it was merged <b>to</b> the main article it would be too long, but because it was created <b>from</b> the article, in the first place, for that reason. If it was a suggested split of passable content that had already survived in the main article, and was deemed by some editors to be worthy of merging back, why isn't it capable of surviving on it's own?</li>

<ul>
<li>Wouldn't everyone love it if "no good reason for deletion" was a criterion for invalidating a nomination? Anyway, you misunderstood my point, I think. I have no issue with the fact that it happens to not be sourced now, I simply do not think that it can be sourced, ever. Besides, it was split from the main article simply because it was too long. I doubt a discussion of removing the content entirely ever came up then. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 06:20, 26 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sorry, but "no good reason for deletion" <b>is</b> a valid criteria for invalidating a nomination. There is a very clear guide and criteria for an AfD, if you can't come up with a reason for the nom then the nom itself is invalid. <a href="../../../w/t/f/User%7EWtfunkymonkey_476f.html" title="User:Wtfunkymonkey">wtfunkymonkey</a> 06:29, 26 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No it isn't. Many, many, bad articles would be kept if someone who didn't like the nominator's argument could make it invalid. Now, if you can show that I somehow made this nomination in bad faith, or that I don't understand what AfD is for, that's another matter. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 06:31, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I don't think this is cruft - as my understanding of cruft is that it usually involves excessive fanboy levels of attention to specific obscure detail. No, the problem with this article is that it is purely generic. Even if referenced with verifiable sources, this article has no encyclopedic notability as its content could be about any one of hundreds or even thousands of online game communities (just need to switch the specific names). Multi-national player base? In-game jargon? Chat forums? Censorship of player communications deemed inappropriate? Moderators with different levels and powers? Fan websites?

<li>Well I do think Runescape itself is encyclopedically notable- certainly more than most online multiplayer games. Very popular (with an astonishingly highly edited (or vandalized) wikipedia page<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200609/wikipedia/3" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200609/wikipedia/3" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>and the Wall Street Journal wrote about it as if it was England's MySpace.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think it has the potential to become an encyclopedic article. At the moment it's only a list, but certainly it can become an article; the linguistic and cultural significance can be discussed. I'll agree it needs work.

<p>This article has been marked to be merged to <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Spirit_e4ea.html" title="Holy Spirit">Holy Spirit</a> for almost a year, and it's not too hard to see why it's been left that way. <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Spirit_e4ea.html" title="Holy Spirit">Holy Spirit</a> already has a short section on Pentecostalism's views on the subject, and I can't see what this article adds. Combined with POV issues, and the fact that the article is written as an essay toward other Christians, I'm not sure what value there is in merging instead of deleting. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheProject_f8b7.html" title="User:TheProject">theProject</a> 06:58, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I can envision an article breaking out of the Holy Spirit article that explores the understandings and practices of the Pentecostal movement (given that the Holy Spirit in doctrine and practice feature so large in Pentecostalism), but the current article is not an encyclopedic article.

<li><b>Comment</b>: As an FYI, so far as I can tell <a href="../../../m/i/l/WP%7EMILITARY_850e.html" title="WP:MILITARY">WP:MILITARY</a> does not have recognised guideline status -- it is a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiproject_f31e.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiproject">Wikiproject</a>. The bio's sole claim to notability is that at some point, prior to his death at 32, the subject received a <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virtuti_Militari_a9ad.html" title="Virtuti Militari">Virtuti Militari</a> medal. There is no verifiable source as to why or when such an award was given. In fact, the only reference of such is a Web site list, which itself doesn't source its information -- and lists a dozen Dunins as recipients. How do we even know that this "Antoni Dunin" is the same as the <a href="http://feefhs.org/PL/vm/vm-d.html" class="external text" title="http://feefhs.org/PL/vm/vm-d.html" rel="nofollow">one listed</a>? (Hint: we don't, because it's unverifiable). Further, while the article about the medal claims a comparison to the US <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medal_of_Honor_1efa.html" title="Medal of Honor">Medal of Honor</a>, this appears to be an exaggeration. It may be referred to as "Poland's highest military medal", but there are actually five classes of the award, the last of which has been given out over <s>4500</s> 10,000 times (since 1939 alone). Compare this to the US Medal of Honor, of which there have fewer than 2000 receipients since the Civil War (during which 1500 were handed out).--<font size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 04:17, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Likewise, the core points I made have not been addressed: no matter what claim the Virtuti Militari medal might have in the status of Poland's "highest military honors", the 10,000+ recipients of the Class 5 "Silver" medal are simply not notable within the English language Wikipedia. The medal is much closer to the Army's <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distinguished_Service_Cross_%28USA%29_e6b2.html" title="Distinguished Service Cross (USA)">Distinguished Service Cross</a>, which while certainly an honor, is hardly a qualification for Wikipedia.

I, possibly wrongly, assumed that this officer had been awarded one of the higher grades of the decoration. Rereading the description, I think that probably only the top four classes are automatically notable and the fifth is not (although recipients may be on a case-by-case basis) - this is in line with my own policy on British decorations that only holders of the VC and GC are automatically notable, plus those who have won one of the next highest awards twice or any other award (or combination) three times.

<li><b>Comment</b>. This debate reminds me of the recent AfD debate <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Sanford_Ransdell_f2d2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sanford Ransdell">here</a>, which was also an article apparently created by someone doing genealogical research. While these editors have every right to be proud of the sacrifices of their forebears, in both cases the only claim to notability for our purposes was military service; practically everything else in both articles was original genealogical research or tangential padding. Ancestor cruft is a trickle now; it will likely be a flood in the future.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The difference is that not everyone's ancestor has won their country's top military honour!

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. It would be nice if that were true, but as the other debate showed, the notability guidelines can become fuzzy in individual cases. Canny genealogists should usually be able to avoid speedy deletion by turning a traditionally non-notable biography into one that at least makes a weak case for notability. In this article, for example, someone has created an article where normally there would be a one-line entry in something like "List of the 10,000 people who have won the Virtuti Militari". That's fine—it's an important honor, let's have articles on all 10,000 people. Other genealogists, however, undoubtedly feel that their ancestor's achievements are of similar (i.e., 1 in 10,000) distinction. This is just the tip of the genealogy iceberg, I tell ya. —<a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_Myers_d288.html" title="User talk:Kevin Myers">Kevin</a> 01:19, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I think you're being unnecessarily pessimistic. I have myself speedy deleted at least two genealogical articles about gentlemen with worthy but not especially notable war service. If someone just does their job, however competently, has not held a senior position and has not received any recognised state reward then they meet speedy deletion criteria without needing to be AfDed. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 01:51, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I hope you're right.

<li><b>Keep</b> and remove unverified facts until we can specifically link them to sources. We have sources to use, but we have no way to link the sources to specific facts.

<li><b>Question</b>. I disagree with Leflyman's view that someone might be notable enough for the Polish WP but not the English WP. English-speaking readers might want to know about notable Poles. This article has no interwiki link, though. The editors working on the Polish-language Wikipedia would be better placed to evaluate the <i>Polski Slownik Biograficzny</i> listing and other issues.

I would note that while the Polish Wikipedians are very active (more articles than the Spanish version), they still only have about 1/6th the number of articles of the English version, it may just be a case where they haven't drilled far enough down the stack of articles that need to be written to get to Rodryg yet.

<p>Before you all jump over me for even thinking about nominating this page for AfD, hear me out. I'm nominating this page to call attention to the fact that this article, under its current title, is a classic example of a POV fork. The content need not necessarily be deleted (apologies for bad form for using AfD in this manner). It's my understanding that this article actually used to be titled <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_perception_and_assessments_of_George_W._Bush_9e01.html" title="Public perception and assessments of George W. Bush">Public perception and assessments of George W. Bush</a>, a much better title, and one I would favour renaming to, although the fact that it used to be titled "Criticism" would mean such an article would be extremely POV at the moment.</p>
<p>In short, this article should either be <b>renamed</b> as before, or <b>merged</b> back into the main Bush article. In its current form, this article is precisely what <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">Wikipedia:Content forking</a> was written to prevent. I cannot stress this enough: just because Bush is a guy who has receives a lot of criticism does <b>not</b> justify forking all criticism into a separate article. Such an action fundamentally violates NPOV, which is non-negotiable.</p>
<p>One more thing: this may become some sort of precedent, as there is a whole list of similarly-titled "Criticism of ..." articles at Wikipedia:List of POV forks. Do consider whether those articles are justified forking criticism into a separate article, not just this article. Again I stress: volume of criticism is not justification for creating a POV fork. I cannot see how these articles can be kept in their current form.</p>
<p>I trust we can all discuss this in a civil manner, according to Wikipedia policy and not our own political beliefs. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheProject_f8b7.html" title="User:TheProject">theProject</a> 07:47, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Move</b> The title is really POV, but the article itself isn't that bad - cited sources, approval ratings, etc. I wouldn't have put it at AfD though, there's quite a risk of knee-jerk reactions. <b><a href="../../../u/l/t/User%7EUltra-Loser_fa06.html" title="User:Ultra-Loser"><span style="color:#112B84">Ultra-Loser</span></a> <small><sup>[ <a href="../../../u/l/t/User_talk%7EUltra-Loser_53db.html" title="User talk:Ultra-Loser">T</a> ] [ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ultra-Loser_4117.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ultra-Loser">C</a> ]</sup></small></b> 09:35, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am sending this back to AfD. Nothing is being done to improve this. Just empty promises of improvement. It is clearly original research and I fail to see how this qualifies as encyclopedia material.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>, since it feels as though something could be done if someone who knew enough about the topic took to it.

<p>I would like to point out this: Habbox is not even recognised by Sulake as an Official Website. That is, the site it is a fansite of, Habbo Hotel, has not included Habbox on it's Habbo Hotel Official Fansite list. As the images of Habbo Furni on Habbox belong to Sulake, which hasn't recognised it as an official fansite, putting this on Wikipedia is bad idea.</p>
<p>I may be new to the Wiki community but I will say this. This article is an advertisement for a fansite that was not accepted by Sulake Ltd as a proper fansite, it is an unimportant and trivial topic ('Habbox') with trivial media references, and using this article may cause copyright concerns.</p>
<p>This has no real relevance, scientific or otherwise, as an informative article nor do people need to be informed of what is, in essence, a fansite for something else. That site that it is a fansite for (Habbo Hotel) has an Official List of fansites, with information about every fansite. And if Habbox doesn't feature there, than it is not recognised by the company and therefore was chosen not to be advertised by the company!</p>
<p>Habbo Hotel Official Fansite list, is found here - <a href="http://www.habbo.co.uk/community/fansites/fansitesgeneral.html" class="external free" title="http://www.habbo.co.uk/community/fansites/fansitesgeneral.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.habbo.co.uk/community/fansites/fansitesgeneral.html</a> Note, Habbox is not amoung them.</p>
<p>In summary, this article has no real relevance and unfortunately no real right to be here, it's just an advertisement really and not informative for a relevant topic. Should be deleted." - LewstherinII 4:45PM AEST</p>

<li><b>Speedy delete</b> and so tagged. This is spam of the very worst sort, with most of the text C&amp;P directly from the Habbox website. It also attempts to circumvent deletion debate by tagging on claims of notability (press reviews), which unfortunately for the author do not protect from speedy deletion. In fact, it is only one press review, the principal subject of which is Habbo, and we have to look very carefully indeed to find the mention of Habbox. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 06:06, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I do not feel that by having notable honorary members would necessarily make any association notable, regardless of whether the nominee accepted or not. These hon memberships are meant to confer an honour upon the member to which it is granted, and the connection in the other direction is considerably weaker. The person would not have volunatarily joined the association. Furthermore, it is common practice of student political associations to have sitting members of parliament as their hon members, which does not stop consensus from deleting the former as not-notable. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 06:32, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I haven't read them all, but the ones I have I do not think fail notability criteria. The notability <i>guidelines</i> will often leave room for interpretation where there is none to cover specific entities (as there are, for example, for musicians). There isn't to my knowledge any particular policy regarding societies from top universities and there's a profusion of information on them, particularly in the case of those from the Ivy League in the US, that your own take on a set of guidelines isn't in line with the de facto consensus elsewhere on wikipedia. This club is, I believe, sufficiently prominent within the University, sufficiently well-known (and well-connected) outside of it, mentioned independently by the national press and involving (or having involved) a number of very public figures that it satisfies the current guidelines as I have read them. Furthermore, the article is written in an appropriate and encyclopaedic manner and couldn't be considered vanity. I found it quite interesting, and should not want to deny other readers the information it contains by, what seems to me, a rather rash case of <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Deletionism" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Deletionism" rel="nofollow">deletionism</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/_/User%7EAn_Edwardian_Sunday_a820.html" title="User:An Edwardian Sunday">An Edwardian Sunday</a> 15:31, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It has been referred to in passing in press articles, alongside other clubs that <i>don't</i> have articles. The fact they've appointed people honorary members and those people haven't written them a letter back and rudely <i>refused</i> doesn't denote notability. You assertion that the society is well known in the university simply isn't verified. As for the content of the article, half of it doesn't relate to the club and is a duplication of content of another article. --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyDancer_ed0c.html" title="User:SandyDancer">SandyDancer</a> 15:34, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Most of the media mentions I've seen of it (e.g. <a href="http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=528442002" class="external text" title="http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=528442002" rel="nofollow">this article</a> from the Scotsman) refer to it solely alongside the Kate Kennedy Club, which most certainly does have <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kate_Kennedy_Club_0f3e.html" title="Kate Kennedy Club">an article</a>. And your assertion that the honorary members of the society exist merely because they 'haven't written them a letter back and rudely refused' is also completely unverified hypothesis. Now, here we come to a plain case of differing philosophy: you would simply delete the article now and let it be lost to wikipedia; I would keep it and <i>give editors a chance to demonstrate and verify in what capacity honorary members are connected with the club</i> - and, once this has been done, then discuss notability if there is still an issue. By all means add unverifiability tags to statements that should have them - the point of these tags is to encourage editors to add sources and avoid exactly this kind of discussion. You cannot simply create a hypothesis and use it to argue for the removal of what is, for all you <i>can</i> know, not shown to be non-notable. The fact that public figures do have some connection with this club should mean that we should be encouraging contributors to give more details on these connections, with references, not hastily deletionise an otherwise legitimate article on a whim. <a href="../../../a/n/_/User%7EAn_Edwardian_Sunday_a820.html" title="User:An Edwardian Sunday">An Edwardian Sunday</a> 16:12, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In my view the duration of the AFD process offers a window for verification and assertion of notability. At least one user has attempted to undertake this but has not offered convincing arguments or sources to back them up. The article has been in existence for some time, it is hardly a brand new stub. This isn't a hasty deletion - if I'd wanted that, I would have gone for speedy deletion - as one user pointed out I could have plausibly done so. --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyDancer_ed0c.html" title="User:SandyDancer">SandyDancer</a> 16:15, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think that if you were to survey every single statement on wikipedia, I'd be surprised if half a precent of them are verified and sourced. Whilst articles with careful citations are of course much better and easier to work with, the fact remains that the majority of editors, for whatever reasons, tend not to do so. This does not necessarily mean that the information they provide should be removed - if it did, we'd have to delete most of wikipedia. The {{source}} tag exists for this purpose. One of the great strengths of this medium is that such sources can be later ammended when flagged as such. Now, your whole argument for deletion <i>rests on information neither of us have</i>. That being so, I find the case for keeping the article and allowing more people to contribute, expand and source it far more compelling than relying on your own personal revelation of supposed non-notability. The AFD process can indeed provide a window for assessing verifiability <i>or</i> notability, but not both in a case where one is being theorised to rely on the other. If we, for the sake of argument, were to all agree that this club is notable, then there would not be a question of verifiability. The only 'unverified' aspects of the article relevant here seem to revolve around the role played by the various notable people associated with in, in an attempt to judge whether it is sufficient that their notability should somehow rub off on the club; if notability weren't an issue, I don't believe there would be a case for deletion on the grounds of non-verifiability. Hence the whole precept upon which your argument rests is one of pure conjecture. For me to theorise the contrary would hold as much or as little water as your own theory. You have offered no sources yourself to clarify what your argument for non-notability rests on. I find not deleting an otherwise encyclopaeadic article on the grounds of an unproven conjecture a pretty convincing argument myself. <a href="../../../a/n/_/User%7EAn_Edwardian_Sunday_a820.html" title="User:An Edwardian Sunday">An Edwardian Sunday</a> 17:38, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>KEEP.</b> There are 42 hits on the Google page! Although I would still be hesitant to argue, as you both appear to have accepted, that newspaper articles are the sole judge of notability.</p>
<p>I have been following your arguments and as an old member of this club can help:</p>
<p>1. This club is a well known feature of St Andrews, both the town and the University. The Club is known to major national institutions as well as students from Universities around the country. It is a major part of University life and carries on a tradition of similar clubs at the University of St Andrews and elsewhere.</p>
<p>2. 30 members a year at a University equates to about 160 overall since the early 90s. It is not larger because numbers are capped and there are strict entry criteria. None the less, having few members is not necessarily a bar to notability. There are continually growing membership numbers and considerable old member involvement (including Annual London meetings). Unlike many student societies, members are expected to take an active part in the Club or resign.</p>
<p>3. Private Clubs are often not keen to release details and finding a club that does should be encouraged. Privacy may also play a part in the limited press coverage.</p>
<p>4. The page does name several Hon. members and I have been to meetings where most of those mentioned (and others who are not) have attended. Applicants are always present when they are made members, so all listed will have attended and know what the Club is about.</p>
<p>5. The information on Wentworth on this page is written in the context of his relevance to this and other Strafford Clubs. It is not a repeat of another page.</p>
<p>6. This is a small but growing club. It has links to other areas of interest such as other Strafford Clubs, Wentworth, Monarchy, student societies, the Hon. Members and Constitutional Monarchy Association. I believe that the pages are of genuine interest and unlike some student societies they go far beyond mere vanity.</p>
<p>7. These pages have been around for a bit of time and are clearly looked at and have been evolved. By all means please use the information above to edit the pages and make them more relevant. Deleting them would remove an interesting article and damage the freedom of information that Wikipedia is supposed to stand up for. 19:06, 30th November 2006 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 213.86.132.225 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_213.86.132.225_f8ca.html" title="Special:Contributions/213.86.132.225">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>I disagree. The Bullingdon Club has had several press articles written about it. The Strafford Club, seemingly, has never enjoyed such attention: it appears it has never received anything other than a couple of passing references in articles about something else related to St Andrews university.</dd>
<dd>The assertion that this club is notable in the university in town isn't a verified one, and in any case probably (in fact <i>certainly</i>) wouldn't meet Wikipedia's criteria on notability or verifiability.</dd>
<dd>I'd point out to those drawn to this page out of membership or affection for the club - these deletion debates aren't head counts (and even if they were, this article would still be deleted by the looks of it). You have to <i>justify</i> why the article meets Wikipedia's standards and therefore should be kept.

<dd>Fact is we have no idea of proving what's been written about the Strafford Club, just because it isn't on the internet doesn't mean it hasn't been done. We need to remember this danger. And can I point out also to those wanting to delete this article due to a dislike of the Club and its aims that this is not a head count. It all works both ways.--<a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECouter-revolutionary_5112.html" title="User:Couter-revolutionary">Couter-revolutionary</a> 23:03, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The assertion of notability has been verified by every writer on this page who has visited St Andrews or has been at the University. If you look at the Google search pages the Strafford Club is mentioned in numerous contexts throughout University life, also making it clearly verifiable. It is also true to say that the internet is not the only basis for veritably or notability, the club itself has produced publications which are unavailable on the internet. As I pointed earlier the club is known to a wider audience outside St Andrews, including a number of prominent members and national organisations, besides being part of a wider network of undergraduate dining clubs, many of whom refuse to release any information.</dd>

<li><b>KEEP</b> Have a look at the links for the named members, very unusual and prominent for a student society. Sandy Dancer appears to have campaigned against Wiki sites regarding Monarchy. Is this an argument about notability or content? If Sandy Dancer is Republican then it would be logical that the article would appear non-notable to him/her. Not the same conclusion that many others would come to. This looks like an attempt to supress freedom of expression, all veiws should be allowed to be heard.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 213.86.132.225 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_213.86.132.225_f8ca.html" title="Special:Contributions/213.86.132.225">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd>You quite agree with an argument based entirely on disregard for Wikipedia guidelines on verifiability and notability? You agree that consistently not signing comments in a vain attempt to try and influence a debate by appearing to be more than one person? This same anon IP has already posted several times above as the edit history shows. And the speculation about my motives is nonsense. I am not a "republican", I have no strong view either way - hardly an issue in my life. I do however oppose relentless pro-monarchist POV pushing of the kind you favour however. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECouter-revolutionary_5112.html" title="User:Couter-revolutionary">User:Couter-revolutionary</a>, User:Edwardian Sunday and this anon.

<dd>Just because users are not overly enthusiastic contributers it doesn't mean what they say here is not of note. Stop trying to rule this page like a <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junta.html" title="Junta">Junta</a>. The user with the IP address has stated that they did not know of the convention to sign a contribution. What they say is valuable and should be taken not of. If he were to have said he wanted this article deleted would you ask it to be disregarded as he had not signed the contribution, I think not. I have not contacted any one else to support my views this page, I hope user Sandydancer has not either. Yes, I do have point to view, and yes you did trick me into displaying it on my Talk page.

<li>Well, the whole of this article is already or can be covered by the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anastacia.html" title="Anastacia">Anastacia</a> article, where we can already read "The popstar created a sound called Sprock, a fusion of soulfull singing, catchy pop tunes and rock instruments never before used in her albums before." So 'sprock' is perhaps worth a wikidictionary listing, but that's all.

<li>For some strange reason everyone is against this article, I see nothing wrong with it(ok the grammars a bit off but that can be fixed!)It should be kept, all thes snobs on wiki are ruining everything,</li>
<li>The article should stay, in my opinion. I do feel it is rather bare and some pictures and a tad bit more info is needed, but that does mean if should be gotten rid of</li>

<li><b>Move</b> to footnote in article. This is not original research (there are a number of academic articles that have this same comparison, including BYU Studies and Dialogue), however, it is a good reference material for a hotly debated topic (see talk page of <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curse_of_Cain_8183.html" title="Curse of Cain">Curse of Cain</a>. It should be put into a foot note rather than deleted in entirety. (And actually, Mig, there is a similar article at <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curse_of_Ham_4ff3.html" title="Curse of Ham">Curse of Ham</a>. Unless there is a space issue, we can come up with at least one citation on this topic. However, I agree that it would be a better footnote in the article than a sub-page.

<li><b>Comment</b> You are free to move it as you please. You should also cite the multiple academic articles you mentioned. Also, you should really not fill the entire article with citations of the Bible.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I think the problem is that the article is nothing but citations of the Bible. What's missing is any encyclopedic content that tells us what to make of this comparison. It would be better to say something like "Author X notes that the LDS version differs from the King James version in the following ways....A, B, C." I suspect that this could be done in the LDS subsection of the <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curse_of_Cain_8183.html" title="Curse of Cain">Curse of Cain</a> article. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 03:59, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Edit</b> Heck is also a common surname, and at one point (in the possesive Heck's) a department store. The entry should begin with the fact that it is a euphemism for Hell or possibly Purgatory (with links), mention that it is also a common name, and then if need be discuss examples of use.

<p>Possible original research; no reliable sources and non-notable or just plain incorrect use of terminology. Whilst it is certainly true that people consensually live full time in the relationships of "master" and "slave", the article claims that "consensual slavery" refers to something distinct to other BDSM terms such as <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_Power_Exchange_8d96.html" title="Total Power Exchange">TPE</a>, 24/7 D/s, or <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master_slave_relationship_9f9e.html" title="Master/slave relationship">Master/slave relationships</a>. In my experience, this is simply not true - people use those terms for when they are living in the roles full time. The author cited BDSM forums as evidence, yet these are people who mainly use the aforementioned terms to describe their relationships.</p>
<p>The article claims a difference as to whether the slave could revoke their consent. Firstly, whilst some people may claim that the slave has given up their right to revoke consent, again there is no evidence that this is related to whether it is called "D/s" or "consensual slavery". Secondly, any such claim is just an illusion, but the author claims it is possible to create legally binding contracts to keep someone in slavery, just so long as you avoid the word slave (see the last paragraph)! But they are unable to cite sources, claiming it's a secret, apart from the example of the US Military.</p>
<p>I have attempted to resolve this in Talk, but things appear to be going nowhere. Perhaps this article could be rewritten to reflect the practice of "consensal slavery" in BDSM factually - but we already have quite a few articles on this already (also see <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slave_%28BDSM%29_9ca9.html" title="Slave (BDSM)">Slave (BDSM)</a>), and I don't think anything is salvageable here. <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 15:33, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm just browisng the nominations given that I've added to AfD for the first time. Looking at the article and talk page from a posoition of complete ignorance regarding the subject, I think what Mdwh says us well-founded. The lack of civility from the article's creator is unhelpful.<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucifer%28sc%29_15f0.html" title="User:Lucifer(sc)">Lucifer</a> 16:10, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I am not a citizen of the USA, but my understanding of the 13th amendment of the US Constitution is that it specifically and totally prohibits the ownership of one person by another.

<li><b>Keep</b> For what it's worth, I have looked this organization up on Wikipedia previously. With 18 nominations, it's clear that this will keep happening over and over, because many people find the mere existence of the group patently offensive. However, the page appears to be quite well sourced; note that sources such as paper newspapers and major online outlets may be loath to even acknowledge the group's existence or put its name in print. The group is nevertheless notable. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChubbles1212_4175.html" title="User:Chubbles1212">Chubbles</a> 16:52, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - I am not a regular wikipedia contributor but I would like my argument to be heard. Most of the dismissals of GNAA on this page are directly antithetical to the very goals and nature of Wikipedia. To suggest that an organization is irrelevent merely because it could only exist within the recesses of the internet is negating everything this site is trying to establish regarding the validity of collectively established information that only exists in a constant flux. The majority of GNAA's activities are often deleted or censored as they are intended to be parasitic or disruptive to the sites they were placed on. As such they may seem to be less prevalent and pervasive than a polling of the internet zeigeist will clearly show that they are. However, GNAA's antics have been mentioned on G4TechTV (though not by name), as well as on major news sites. They are responsible for numerous changes in the 'slashcode' and are certainly as well-known as many of the memes given ample coverage on this site. The offensive nature of this article is not valid grounds for deletion. To assert offensiveness as a grounds for deletion would be admitting that Wikipedia values the taboos and political sensitivities of the minority over the freedom of information.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would also like to address the dismissal of the previous VFDs. You are allowing Wikipedia to spite itself by argueing that a topic's history on this site is not noteworthy. The number of discussions and VFDs this article has generated SHOULD count for the group's significance. By suggesting that GNAA's contention and considerable debate does not provide notoreity, you are arguing anything documented on Wikipedia that involves the history of Wikipedia or happenings on the site should also be deleted. How many hundreds of references and articles would that negate? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.223.117.181 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.223.117.181_5777.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.223.117.181">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The articles has over 21 references, many of them from blogs and other sources. No reliable second source is not grounds for deletion. This is actually a problem with all the trolling article. It is hard to keep any information about troll groups up because the main wiki which documents is not trusted at all by wikipedia and no one else has stepped up to record the information. Regardless the article is verifiable just by the sheer number of primary sourcesIf that were the case all software aritcles and most anime articles would be deleted because no one talked about them.

<li><b>Weakish Delete</b>: I note that somebody mentioned that freedom of speech should be one such reason to prevent this article being deleted, but I must disagree, freedom of speech doesn't extend to keeping articles which for all I now could be total gibberish made up at school some day. I do find the promotion of a group that uses the word 'nigger' quite unpleasant but that's neither here nor there. I don't see why I should bother adding references to articles if totally unreferenced articles will actually be allowed to remain. That said, if it only needs references, I'd leave the article for 7 days and if no sources are added, the page is deleted and protected to prevent recreation in order to prevent a AfD no 19. <font face="Arial" color="#27408B" size="2"><b>Kind Regards -</b></font> <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHeligoland_92a7.html" title="User:Heligoland"><font face="Arial" color="#27408B" size="2"><b>Heligoland</b></font></a> | <a href="../../../h/e/l/User_talk%7EHeligoland_4c54.html" title="User talk:Heligoland"><font face="Arial" color="#27408B" size="2"><b>Talk</b></font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Heligoland_a022.html" title="Special:Contributions/Heligoland"><font face="Arial" color="#27408B" size="2"><b>Contribs</b></font></a> 01:49, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Well, there is such a thing as <b>Burger sauce</b> such as Hellman's or Kraft's. I've seen it in stores. It's not just in the UK.

Furthermore, considering such things as <a href="../../../h/p/_/HP_Sauce_84e5.html" title="HP Sauce">HP_Sauce</a> also exist as well, sauces for burger, I'm not sure a simple redirect will work either.

<dd>I'm aware, thanks. There is potentially a very good justification, however. See the sections of that page headed "Segregation and security" and "Keeping heated issues in one small area." If you're going to argue that it's an <i>abusive</i> sock, it would behoove you to provide some evidence, I think (through <a href="../../../s/u/s/Wikipedia%7ESuspected_sock_puppets_ea9e.html" title="Wikipedia:Suspected sock puppets">appropriate channels</a>, not here), rather than engaging in <i>ad hominem</i> attacks. And I don't see the username as inflammatory, for the record. Immature, yes, and probably unwise, but it's not an attack or a slur or any of the other things listed at <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUsername_0c30.html" title="Wikipedia:Username">Wikipedia:Username</a>. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 05:12, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is no justification at all. It directly violates <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESock_d787.html#Avoiding_scrutiny_from_other_editors" title="WP:Sock">WP:Sock#Avoiding_scrutiny_from_other_editors</a>, which is forbidden. It is not a sanctioned legitimate use for a sock puppet account as spelled out in the policy. Your interpretation is wrong. It's pretty simple, if you want to use sock accounts, use your regular account for AfD noms. The username violates numerous areas of <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUsername_b87d.html" title="WP:Username">WP:Username</a>. The result is that the debate is tainted, due to the suspicion of double voting. It may also be a banned vandal account within the parameters of Speedy Keep. Based on the number of established editors ready, willing and able to nominate school articles for deletion on a daily basis, we do not have to sanction sock nominations and I am shocked by the constant rush to defend these nominations. And I have launched no ad hominem attacks - I pointed out that this was a new user. You implied it wasn't. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 05:27, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, it doesn't. It is not difficult for editors to detect a contribution pattern in his edits; it's rather easy. And no ad hominem attacks? So you're not alleging bad faith, violation of policy, and now double voting on the nom's part? It might very well be true, mind you, but lacking any evidence to the contrary, I'm willing to assume good faith. In any event, I think this is getting rather tangential, so I will respond no further here. I do, again, encourage you to take the matter up through proper channels if you feel this is a case of sock abuse. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 05:38, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A contribution history dating back ten edits is not a real contribution history. I have a right to have an idea who is nominating articles for deletion based on their history - that is explicit in policy. I'm alleging violation of policy (bad faith is irrelevant) and as to double voting, a sock nomination automatically raises the suspicion. How could it not? Furthermore, <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> mandates discounting sock puppet "votes" in deletion discussions. Why should it be different for nominators? I am not aware who is behind the account - the user in question has declined to respond to messages on his talk page - and am not particulalry concerned with abuse. I am concerned with what I view as an invalid nomination by a new account. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 05:51, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It isn't clear to me where there is a reason to speedy keep or to make an AfD invalid simply because an obvious sock was used to make the nomination.

<dd>It's clear that <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrincipal_Schoolswatter_8153.html" title="User:Principal Schoolswatter">Principal Schoolswatter</a> is a sockpuppet. Sure there are a limited number of legitimate reasons for sockpuppetry, and I'd love to assume good faith, but creating an ID exclusively for AfDs creates far more opportunity for mischief, and very few sound arguments to justify the practice. That someone is unwilling to put their real contribution history behind a series of AfDs, every single one of which is aimed at a school article, seems to have more than a whiff of bad faith. That no one voting delete has expressed any concern whatsoever with this state of affairs, pooh-poohing any possible issues as merely hypothetical and "tangential" concerns, is at best disappointing. I guess if there are no objections to the practice, maybe I'll create a whole crew of sockpuppets to support my votes.

<dd>Alan, we've already had your school <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a> made with WP:SCHOOLS4. In any event, I don't see why this sort of AfD should be discounted when there is a simple and obvious thing any admin will do - simply treat the nominator as having zero weight in deciding consensus. If there were an ID that did nothing but vote on school articles that user's comments should also be given zero weight. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 06:35, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not making any points here, but our Unprincipled Flyswatter is. If even one person on the delete side of the fence were to express even the slightest displeasure at the fact that there are sockpuppets pushing your agenda, it would be a strong show of support for fair play in the AfD game. Part of finding a middle ground is recognizing that there are folks on both sides who don't follow the spirit of the process., and not standing by idly or minimizing the offense.

Also, WP:DP explicitly states that an article being a stub is not, in and of itself, reason for deletion. Finally, at <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a> there is a proposed policy in development--I would suggest we hold off on this (and any other school articles anyone may wish to nominate) until that policy is finalized and adopted, unless there is a policy specifically requiring the deletion of the given school--otherwise, we risk removing content that may turn out to be explicitly acceptable according to a broader community consensus. <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukini_322a.html" title="User:Kukini">Kukini</a> 15:05, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Actually, the editor's edits seem to have a clear reason- to nominate non-notable schools for deletion. Furthermore, as I have pointed out to you on multiple AfDs there is no such consensus. Most of the kept schools were kept as "no consensus, defaults to keep" AfDs. Furthermore, in the last month or so successful deletions have become more and more common. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 05:46, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> It is a school; schools are generally not notable; hence delete. I would like to reiterate <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a>'s point above to <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukini_322a.html" title="User:Kukini">Kukini</a> that claiming consensus has emerged that schools are inherently notable is simply wrong. No such consensus was ever achieved. In fact, most editors favoured deletion last time we went through this. But the margin of preference was insufficient to establish consensus, and no consensus defaults to keep. You may be on <i>slightly</i> stronger ground to say that more of a consensus has emerged that high schools are notable, although again, opinion remains very divided as well. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 10:44, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ganfon is asserting that the podcast's time in the iTunes Top 100 and PodcastAlley's top 10 establish the notabilirty of the podcast. First, I don't think that being in the iTunes Top 100 establishes notability. There are, or were, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/blogspotting/archives/2005/08/gaming_itunes_p.html" class="external text" title="http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/blogspotting/archives/2005/08/gaming_itunes_p.html" rel="nofollow">issues</a> with the veracity of the iTunes Top 100. I am not of course suggesting that Ganfon or anyone connected with this particular podcast is gaming the list but the fact that the list can be or could have been at some point gamed fuels my belief that the Top 100 doesn't establish notability. But even if it does, the article doesn't satisfy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> because it doesn't have any reliable sources establishing its placement. Second, I don't think PodcastAlley's top ten list establishes notability. Even if it did, a review of the October 2006 listings dosn't show this podcast in the top 300 and it's ranked <a href="http://www.podcastalley.com/podcast_details.php?pod_id=10856" class="external text" title="http://www.podcastalley.com/podcast_details.php?pod_id=10856" rel="nofollow">26th</a> for November. I'm sure this is a perfectly lovely podcast and the hosts are delightful people, but the thing is simply not notable or verifiable and has no place on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 22:13, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>What does that mean? The first part "no redlinks" seems like some sort of mantra. Of course there are two ways of dealing with redlinks other than keeping: 1) delinking links and 2) making redirects. So even if we supported your mantra there are ways of handling it.

<ul>
<li><b>reply</b> Two problems. 1) No subject is ever <i><a href="../../../a/_/p/A_priori.html" title="A priori">a priori</a></i> notable merely for belonging to a category. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Notability</a> is applied on a case-by-case basis, and it only exists for a subject if MULTIPLE, THIRD PARTY, RELIABLE SOURCES can be used to add NON TRIVIAL information to the article. If such sources do not exist, the subject is non-notable, regardless of what arbitrary category it belongs to. So the arguement <i>All XXXX are notable</i> means nothing and adds nothing to the AfD. What the closing admin needs is <i>evidence</i> that back up <i>this article's</i> notability. 2) Utility is NOT a criteria for keeping an article. The Yellow Pages are VERY useful as well, but I cannot create an article about "Jim's Plumbing" merely because plumbers are useful to know about, and his address is published in the Yellow Pages. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron</a><a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_Esperanza_2c14.html" title="User:Jayron32/Esperanza"><span style="color:#00FF00;">32</span></a> 03:39, 1 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I said to keep the articles because the information was useful to have <i>on wikipedia</i>. Obviously the yellow pages are useful, but it isn't useful to have <i>on wikipedia</i> like I said in my statement. Second of all, the closing admin doesn't "need" anything. This is a discussion on if the article should be deleted or not and anybody can give any or no reason, and the closing admin will decide what comments to use to make the decision. I don't have to cater my reasoning to fit your criteria on what you think should be used or not in a deletion debate. Third, it is obvious that anyone could find sources for this existing, as is the case for all college football rivalry trophies. Reliable sources wasn't mentioned in the nomination as a reason for why this should be delted. <b>Not</b> everything with reliable sources is notable or useful to have on Wikipedia. There are reliable sources that prove I exist, but I am not notable enough for an article. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 04:59, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Does a railroad count as defunct if no track was ever laid? It might make more sense to create an article named "List of never-built railroads of Florida" (with a better name than that) and to merge the articles into that.

<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> as above seems reasonable. Any of them that are longer than 2–3 paragraphs of law text can probably be kept as-is. If further detail can be added about the railways, the articles can be broken out again at that point.

<dd>I would agree with this <i>if</i> these names are confusingly similar to those of railroads that had an operating history. Otherwise, since redirects aren't in categories, I don't think any user would stumble across one of the redirects unless he or she actually input the name of one of these planned or defunct railroads. I would also inquire whether the user who created these entries has been notified of the AfD as he or she might have a view that could help. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 01:51, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, this is complicated, but that is what happens with bulk nominations. Railroads are funny things, with some operating solely by leased track, and some never laying tracks (indeed, Amtrak didn't own tracks for the first few years of operation). All told, I prefer the <b>Merge and redirect</b> to a unified article that can discuss the Statute in one consolidated location, unless the railroad has a significant operating history after the statute. Of course, if more information becomes available about a particular road, it can always be spun back off from the central article.-- <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanntm_9b62.html" title="User:Danntm">danntm</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDanntm_6305.html" title="User talk:Danntm">T</a></sup> <sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Danntm_aafb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Danntm">C</a></sub> 02:53, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge and redirect</b>. "Paper railroads" are a not inconsequential part of railroad history. For instance, a specialty work in the field, Thomas T. Taber III's "Railroad Encyclopedia and Atlas of Pennsylvania", lists all of the railroads in the state that were chartered but never built. That said, many of these proposed railroads are not sufficiently documented to provide material for more than a stub.

<li>Well now, this is an interesting one. There are certainly lots of fine references, but there may not be many in English. Since I'm not able to find a good discussion of different grades of fish in any of our articles, I think this article deserves a pass. What are really missing are the accompanying articles on other grades of "tuna". At some point in the future, this might be a candidate to be merged with those other grades, but as for now, this is a <b>keep</b>. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 02:19, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete, and give Couter-revolutionary and SandyDancer fish with which they may slap each other on their own time</b> - article is unsourced and a Google search doesn't turn up anything notable (which in and of itself doesn't prove anything, but still).

<dd><b>Keep</b> - First off, I created most these articles. While it is true, that Wikipedia is not just a mere collection of external links, a directory of sorts, etc. these articles are more than that. For those interested in this debate, you may also be interested in seeing the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Air_Cadet_Squadrons_in_Canada_df40.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Air Cadet Squadrons in Canada">List of Air Cadet Squadrons in Canada</a> proposed articles for deletion discussion; which has since been closed with a <b>keep</b> result. I listed the list of Air Cadet Squadrons in Canada for the same reason as Khatru2 has listed this article: it is a list and highlights what Wikipedia is not, at first glance. The list of Air Cadet Squadrons in Canada is similar to the list of hotel properties owned by various hotel chains. They list different properties/squadrons in different geographical regions. Some premises stated by various editors from the List of Air Cadet Squadrons discussion used in support of articles that are lists, like this one, include:
<ul>
<li>"If it's complete then it's a useful enough list for someone who's interested."</li>
<li>"...doesn't matter if some of the squadrons [properties] are not notable - the general topic is notable."</li>
<li>"...there are things you can do with a single list like this that you can't do nearly as easily with a list split across five or six pages - like identify gaps in the numbering, identify the highest and lowest numbered squadron, count the total number of squadrons, look at the distribution of squadrons across the country, etc"</li>
</ul>

<dd>This is the case because, I have found at least, that there is no one page on Marriott.com or the internet (quick search only) that has a listing of all Marriott properties. Visitors to this article page, can identify international property distribution, property concentrations, properties by country, total number of properties, and other GIS-like activities. This article is appears as the 3rd most relevant search result by Google for the keyword search "List Marriott Hotels", that doesn't aim to sell you a Marriott hotel room.<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuckyluke_155b.html" title="User:Luckyluke">Luke!</a> 22:18, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fair enough, a matter of perspective of use. However, the relationship that I have tried to establish here is that if a List of Air (and Sea) Cadet Squadrons in Canada, which is only national in scope, is able to survive AfD...then how can a List of Marriott Hotels, which is international in scope, not survive an AfD. If WP:NOT is to set the criteria, List of Air Cadet Squadrons in Canada should have been deleted and not been kept. The List of Air Cadet Squadrons and this List of Marriott Hotels are essentially the same - lists of entities spread across a wide geographical region owned/managed by a greater organization, all summed up into a list on one Wikipedia article. If the premises provided in support of the List of Air Cadet Squadrons in Canada managed to result in a keep, then isn't it reasonable to assume that the same would happen for similar lists like this one? <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuckyluke_155b.html" title="User:Luckyluke">Luke!</a> 02:20, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> if this so obviously meets the criteria for speedy deletion as you claim, why did you bring it to AfD? Seems like a pretty major adult magazine, a US version of a well-known British magazine (which you've also nominated). Hmm, I notice you've nominated three "adult" magazines for deletion recently... --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 23:22, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I brought it to AfD because the last {{<a href="../../../d/b/_/Template%7EDb_645c.html" title="Template:Db">db</a>}} tag I put on an article was summarily removed without making any changes to the article. Apparently you think I have a problem with adult magazines; you've made a comment on my talk page reminding me that Wikipedia isn't censored. I will respond to that there; however, I think it bears mentioning that nominating a bad article about an adult magazine isn't censorship, it's nominating a bad article. Don't go assigning presumptive motives to others' actions.<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicer1_4905.html" title="User:Nicer1">Nicer1</a> 04:34, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> OK, thanks for explaining that, and my apologies for presuming any ulterior motive. However, you have to realise that deletion, in particular speedy deletion, is not the solution to your desire for better articles, and should only be used when an article is an unsalvagable mess or blatantly unencylopedic, which these articles are not. You raise some good points below, please add them to the articles' talk pages and let some other editors improve them based on your suggestions rather than trying so hard to have them deleted. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 09:14, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> well one of the criteria for notability for almost anything is it's coverage in a monthly non-trivial publication. By extention you have to consider the publication itself to be notable. Kind of a no brainer.

<li><b>Delete</b> When an article talks about felony complaints, you'd expect to see bona fide citations of newspaper articles, and those articles should name individuals.

<p>Dear editors, I am not sure what you see in the article as promotional. There are several lines that contain strictly factual information, which can all be verified. Nothing in the article says the company is good in any way or suggests that people should visit the company. I challenge anyone who is reviewing the article to find any assumptions listed. The BBB link was a reference to verify that the company exists and has been in business for the duration of time specified. The format of the article is: 1. Company does this 2. Company sells this; nothing more. Listing a supplier for any company is simply more useful information. It is standard and beneficial to list suppliers for companies. We see supplier info all the time in government agencies, aerospace industry, pharmaceutical companies…etc. In no way does listing a supplier suggest you should buy from them. It is just more useful information to those inquiring about the company. It would be detrimental to Wikipedia and dangerous to society if we passed laws to restrict all supplier information, especially from the industries listed above.</p>
<p>You made the claim that “The next 2 links are both self-generated articles which anyone can write and publish about themselves”. This is a gross assumption; one that can be made for virtually any publication found. If a news company reviews another site and is pleased, they are most likely going to write positive things about them. You are also assuming the company has such power over the site who decided to publish the article. Regardless of an article’s origin, it still has to be important enough for others to publish it. I could only imagine the world if we starting shutting companies and people out based on our assumptions. .</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no gross assumption here. Both articles were published on PRweb which is a paid press release organization that takes company provided material and distributes it over the internet to its affiliates. Both articles list HIGH PERFORMANCE PROSE as the author or provider. This is a PR firm that lists Auto Parts Place as one of its clients, so these articles are not exactly "independent" reviews by a news company. So either your company or your advertising firm wrote these articles. The articles read like advertisements for Auto Parts Place and are sent out as RSS feeds to thousands of websites that subscribe to these feeds. Usually dozens may publish a company's press release, with the only criteria that its relevant to an industry the publication addresses. None of the websites where these articles were published wrote these articles and they published them verbatim. These articles neither qualify as criteria for Notability within WP nor as a valid, independent assessment of your organization. As such, they should not be used as a citation <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28companies_and_corporations%29_0e74.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (companies and corporations)">Wikipedia:Notability (companies and corporations)</a> nor linked because of the non neutral status of the content <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. There is also further comments regarding other items discussed here on Talk:Auto Parts Place. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalltech_9c69.html" title="User:Calltech">Calltech</a> 23:54, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe there is a double standard being applied here. I have added more external links but no one has addressed the fact that the following sites have only *one* external link which is pointing to *themselves*.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_O_Tires_a879.html" title="Big O Tires">Big O Tires</a></li>

</ul>
<p>…and the list goes on</p>
<p>A completely different standard of notability is being applied to this company. We have seen a few of the companies above plastered all over TV because of their huge advertising budgets. In the old days search engines catered to companies who could buy their way in and in the end they lost. One of the reasons <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a> emerged as a leader was because they cared more about useful information as opposed to marketing budgets. This is what Wikipedia is supposed to be about. Let’s not delete a company with a major online presence because they don’t have enough national commercials.</p>
<p>This company was listed under the category “Auto Parts Retailers”. This is exactly what it is. If this article is deleted based on notability, I would hope that the other companies with less of an online presence and 0 external links verifying their notability be re-evaluated and removed. However, I don’t believe that this would benefit those using Wikipedia, especially those looking for information about Auto Parts Retailers. --<a href="../../../i/p/o/User%7EIpodwheels_f0f0.html" title="User:Ipodwheels">Auto Parts for Brains</a> 15:52, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. A Yahoo! search for "Auto Parts Place" -wikipedia yields 15,000+ hits (Google, for some reason, "only" 12,000+).

<p>Wikipedia is NOT for sexual practices made up in school one day. The 1913 Webster Dictionary "reference", if you can call it that, is completed unrelated. The factual accuracy of this article has been disputed for months because no sources exist to support it. Where are the reliable citations for this?

<li><b>Comment</b> For background on this see the talk page. This was brought to my attention when it was mentioned on a forum I frequent as an example of unusual sexual deviance with an interesting history. As with other finds on Wikipedia you take it less as a definitive source but more as a springboard to your research. To that end I did some further looking around and found:
<ol>
<li>This is a genuine sexual practice</li>
<li>The history/etymology is utterly unsupported and the references/links don't support the statements made. I have queried them and asked for sources and these haven't been forthcoming.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>This left me with an unresolved quandry should I:
<ol>
<li>Put it up for deletion?</li>
<li>Remove nearly all of the article leaving a paragraph explanation. As Wikipedia isn't a dictionary it would probably go up for deletion anyway.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>As it has been put up for deletion I am still unsure about the best way to progress. I don't really feel it warrants an entry for itself but might favour a merge with something like <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anal_masturbation.html" title="Anal masturbation">Anal masturbation</a> (possibly in some section on the use of irritants) or it could just be deleted and if someone wants to add something on it there then they can. Ideally being put up for deletion will get someone moving to provide authoritative and independent sources so I'll withhold my vote for the moment.

<ul>
<li>Its certainly an option I was considering. Something like: "Irritants are sometimes used in anal masturbation to heighten the experience. This can include the use of items like chilli powder and, in particular, ginger. The latter practice is called 'figging' and may have its origins in the horse trade ((fact)). As well as being inserted in the anus, prepared 'fingers' of ginger can be inserted into the vagina or urethra". That is pretty much all the relevant information - I suspect such things probably need a mention in that entry but that is pretty much all that can be proved so a separate entry seems unnecessary.

<li>Actually, <b>merge</b> is a valid vote. I disagree with merging it, but it is legitimate to do so.

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree that the article needs references, as do 1000 Wikipedia articles. Figging is of course very real, I have done it many times and I know many, many people who play with it from time to time. Figging has been around for centuries since the Victorian period or before, and is not a neologism. Here are some sites that discuss it, not all are appropriate for references.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: This is the discussion page, not the article. They are not in the article -- because they don't meet Wikipedia standards for references. As I said in starting my sentence, the article does indeed need reliable references. But that is not sufficient reason to delete the article. My point in giving those references was in an attempt to assure people who are dubious that it even exists that indeed the case here is that someone needs to find good references (<b>not a reason for deletion</b>) rather than it being something that is made up, or not real (a good reason for deletion). BTW, use of references in talk pages does not require meeting WP:V. In articles, WP:V must be met, and WP:NOR is something entirely different. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomaton_fe94.html" title="User:Atomaton">Atom</a> 13:12, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: this certainly goes further than 'made up in school one day' - the practice does exist and people do call it this. However, information in Wikipedia needs to be sourced, and I know of no wholly reliable sources for this at this time. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">Matthew Brown (Morven)</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorven_2a5f.html" title="User talk:Morven">T</a>:<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Morven_de06.html" title="Special:Contributions/Morven">C</a>) 10:02, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Google book search turns up a reference to this in the horse-dealer sense: <i>The Management and Treatment of the Horse in the Stable, Field, and on the Road</i>, William Procter (1883): '... what they term "figging" them, that is, by forcing ginger up the anus ...' <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">Matthew Brown (Morven)</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorven_2a5f.html" title="User talk:Morven">T</a>:<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Morven_de06.html" title="Special:Contributions/Morven">C</a>) 10:09, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>In fact, search Google Books for "figging horse" and you'll find pages of references from the 19th Century about the practise when used on horses. I thus vote a tentative <b>Keep</b>, although I would like to see more references for this as a sexual practise, not just a horse-dealing practise. Seaching for "figging bdsm" returns one result in Italian that appears relevant (book from 2002) but (a) I don't know Italian, and (b) the book is only limited previewable on Google Books not including the relevant page. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">Matthew Brown (Morven)</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorven_2a5f.html" title="User talk:Morven">T</a>:<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Morven_de06.html" title="Special:Contributions/Morven">C</a>) 10:22, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Scads of findable references to it as a historical practice of unscrupulous horse-dealers make it more than 'made up in school one day', I think. I suspect someone in the BDSM community in the last 5-10 years happened to read some old book in which it was mentioned, thought 'That sounds like a wicked idea' and publicized it. I do suspect that claims that it's a long-standing sexual practise are complete bollocks, however; the only reference to it in a sexual context I could find in a dead-tree source was in 2002. This might make it simply too much of a neologism to be in Wikipedia, of course, and insufficiently referenced, but there's no need to accuse contributors of making it up. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">Matthew Brown (Morven)</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorven_2a5f.html" title="User talk:Morven">T</a>:<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Morven_de06.html" title="Special:Contributions/Morven">C</a>) 13:53, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, it's an argument for deleting both. "Well known" in WP:WEB must <i>at the least</i> mean "notable", because it would make no sense for something to be considered notable for the sole fact that it is being distributed by something that is not itself notable. Keenspot is not (apparently) notable, so Darken isn't notable just because Keenspot carries it. Also, there's a difference between "well known" and "visited a lot". Porn sites are also visited a lot. This doesn't make every porn image on them notable. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 15:01, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have a couple of arguments to make:
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> does say well-known, not notable. (I would claim that Keenspot is notable, but one argument at a time, see below.) To me, that implies that the bar is lower. It is possible for something to be well known and yet never received an award or warranted comment in other publications. I won't stress this too much because it comes close to wikilawyering, I think.</li>
<li>For the purposes of this AfD, I think it we should assume <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keenspot.html" title="Keenspot">Keenspot</a> is notable simply because it has an article. That it hasn't successfully been deleted yet implies a consensus that <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keenspot.html" title="Keenspot">Keenspot</a> is notable. The proper course is to nominate Keenspot for AfD first, then decide this issue. I notice you've already prod'd <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keenspot.html" title="Keenspot">Keenspot</a>, which is odd considering that <i>I</i> clearly object. I'll remember <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> if you remember <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>.</li>
<li>The nominator is a <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">single purpose account</a>, whose <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bobagal_1d1f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bobagal">only contributions</a> have been to nominate <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darken.html" title="Darken">Darken</a> for AfD. That doesn't invalidate the AfD, but it does make his motives suspect. -<a href="../../../a/n/%C3%BE/User%7EAn%C3%BEony_a6df.html" title="User:Anþony">Anþony</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/%C3%BE/User_talk%7EAn%C3%BEony_4ae4.html" title="User talk:Anþony">talk</a>) 23:26, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You know, I wouldn't normally be so adamant about keeping an article on a webcomic, but I'm amazed by this repeated and outright denial of the facts. Aside from prominent articles in a major US newspaper and <i>the</i> publishers trade magazine, Keenspot has its own chapter in The History Of Webcomics (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0976804395</a>). I've collected plenty of evidence at <a href="../../../k/e/e/Talk%7EKeenspot_8f48.html#Keenspot_notability" title="Talk:Keenspot">Talk:Keenspot#Keenspot notability</a>; if anyone has a serious doubt about Keenspot's notability, I ask you to address that evidence directly.</li>
<li>Admittedly, <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darken.html" title="Darken">Darken</a> does need work. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marmaduke.html" title="Marmaduke">Marmaduke</a> isn't so hot either. This effort would be better spent identifying specific problems with the article that could be fixed in a constructive way. <span style="color: #F06A0F">–</span><small><span style="border: 1px solid #F06A0F"><a href="../../../a/n/%C3%BE/User%7EAn%C3%BEony_a6df.html" title="User:Anþony"><b><span style="background-color:White; color:#F06A0F">&#160;Anþony&#160;</span></b></a><a href="../../../a/n/%C3%BE/User_talk%7EAn%C3%BEony_4ae4.html" title="User talk:Anþony"><span style="background-color:#F06A0F; color:white">&#160;talk&#160;</span></a></span></small> 07:35, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Would you care to retract your accusation of "repeated and outright denial of the facts"? That's way over the top. I don't think I typed that Keenspot wasn't "notable." Maybe my eyes are decieving me, but I'm fairly certain that I typed that it was not a generally well-known publisher. I'm not sure why you're being so adamant that people address your tangent about the sources you've found for the Keenspot article, when you've neglected to address the nominator's original point that this article does not meet <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>. Note in particular that "Articles should rely on reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy," and that "If an article topic has no reliable, third-party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on it." (Also, as far as your Keenspot sources go, you do know that "The History Of Webcomics" is written by a former Keenspot artist, right? So it's not that surprising that he spent a whole chapter writing about it?) -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 07:53, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're right. In my frustration, I used language that was not appropriate and I do apologize. I still don't see how anyone could claim that Keenspot isn't notable <i>or</i> well-known. Even accepting that the book might not be a completely independent source, Publishers Weekly and the San Francisco chronicle have both run pieces on Keenspot and its founders. Doesn't that hold any water? How can I prove that Keenspot is "well-known"? You seem to admit that it's notable. We have objective tests for notability which Keenspot easily passes. There are none for being "well-known", which makes it pretty easy to disregard any evidence I should bring to bear. <i>That</i> is what frustrates me.</li>
<li>I've started a discussion at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Comics_54b1.html#Advice_on_improving_Darken" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Comics">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Comics#Advice on improving Darken</a> to address the concerns you've raised in a constructive effort to improve the article. Fiction articles rely on the fiction itself to source plot summaries and character descriptions all the time. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> does include an exception for self-published sources for articles about the author when the claims are not contentious.

<dd>Still would like an accepted media reference beyond Keenspot. The talkaboutcomics interview is not enough. <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">WP:WAF</a> does a nice job of describing things that belong in articles of this sort, write a few cited paragraphs about one of these: the design; the development, both before its first appearance and over the course of the narrative; its popularity among the general public; its sales figures (for commercial offerings); its reception by critics; a critical analysis of the subject; the influence of the work on later creators and their projects. <b>∴</b> <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHere_05b1.html" title="User:Here">here</a>…<a href="../../../h/e/r/User_talk%7EHere_e90f.html" title="User talk:Here">♠</a> 03:20, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and previous statements, as I believe Keenspot itself is notable (and have made a note of such on Keenspot's talk page about some possible examples in favor of its notability), and that this notability does in fact apply to its member comics, too. As a business, there's a standard applied to get into Keenspot that generally means its member comics are also going to be known to a fair number of people already, a standard I think is high enough for recognition here. I also question the insistence for verifiability - on what information, specifically? Darken's wiki page makes no claims on its pageviews or other statistics that traditionally are considered to need extra sourcing. Is it just a matter of having to go through and cite specific pages of the comic where mentioned events happened? I'm not being snarky, I'm seriously curious if that things happened in the comic and can be pointed to on the site are enough or not. Nerrin 09:17, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, Keenspot is both notable and well-known, it's notability extends to all of it's member comics as per Anþony. If that isn't enough, Keenspot is a category, surely the items within the category should be considered notable? Darken is a work of fiction, and the only verifiability that should be required is referencing the fiction itself (such as citing the website, or citing pages which events occurred). Unless there is something in the article that talks about something that is outside of the content of the fiction, then no verifiability beyond the website itself should be required. If there is anything in the article that is outside of the content of the fiction, then those details should be addressed, not the article itself. Admittedly, the article should be written in a more Out-of-Universe approach, but that is an argument for improvement, not deletion.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholaiDaedalus_e937.html" title="User:NicholaiDaedalus">NicholaiDaedalus</a> 23:35, 29 November 2006 (UTC) <small>— <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholaiDaedalus_e937.html" title="User:NicholaiDaedalus">NicholaiDaedalus</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholaiDaedalus_a882.html" title="User talk:NicholaiDaedalus">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NicholaiDaedalus_a1d8.html" title="Special:Contributions/NicholaiDaedalus">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> should not be a factor when the article cites the fiction itself as per AnÞony's and My previous comments, and doing so does not create a <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> violation as long as inferences and analysis is not included in the article. If there is no citations, then someone needs to just pop them in. If there is any original reasearch, then remove anything and everything in the article that isn't a description of the fiction's content. Would you delete the article on <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_62cc.html" title="Final Fantasy">Final Fantasy</a> if someone wrote in that FFVIII had the best opening sequence? It's in violation of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> isn't it? No you wouldn't, you would delete that comment and leave the rest of the article in tact.

<li><b>Keep</b> I do not think something should be deleted simply because it isn't Virgin Records or a top band. This site was made to be an Encyclopedia, was it not? The purpose of an Encyclopedia is to put as much information as possible. Now, I am not saying that Darken is a bad, non notable comic. Creator Komiyan is very notable in the webcomic community. The only argument I am seeing here for deletion is that Keenspot is not notable, that's an argument for the deletion of KeenSpot, not Darken. Plus, in the webcomic community, everyone has heard of Keenspot. In fact, I think it is the most notable. I may be biased because I'm a reader of Darken, but I see no evidence here other than it's hosted by Keenspot to delete it. -Paralda <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.250.206.182 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.250.206.182_6335.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.250.206.182">contribs</a>).</small></li>
