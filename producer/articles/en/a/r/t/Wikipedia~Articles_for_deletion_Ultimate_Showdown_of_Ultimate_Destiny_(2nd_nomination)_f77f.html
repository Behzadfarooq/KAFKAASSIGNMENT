<p>The result was: this is a tricky one. Articles on flash cartoons frequently generate numerous impassioned appeals for keep on the basis that it is 'popular' ('popular' meaning something different to what most people would take it to mean - the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Man_on_the_Clapham_omnibus_e84d.html" title="Man on the Clapham omnibus">man on the Clapham omnibus</a> having heard of this - instead referring to recognition among the geek subculture), with little actual verified evidence for notability. In this case we have much the same, at least for the flash cartoon. However, as has been pointed out, this is not just a flash cartoon but a song, played frequently by a notable DJ and partly created by <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Cicierega_969c.html" title="Neil Cicierega">Neil Cicierega</a> who has enough reliable press coverage to be considered notable himself. Generally, Wikipedia consensus considers artists to confer notability on their work - albums by notable artists are considered notable enough for articles, for example. Individual songs are generally not, but when they attract this sort of attention it becomes more in doubt than your average Flash video.</p>
<p>Despite the majority for keeping - even discounting single-purpose accounts - this isn't a vote and I'm not going to describe this as a keep result; there are simply too many 'votes' that even when not from single-purpose accounts, are empty assertions of 'this is popular' and 'definitely notable' with no supporting evidence (not even a 'per x'), and on the other hand there are still legitimate concerns about verification (e.g. the reliablility of the Demento chart and the 'passing mention' nature of the Toronto Star article as extensively discussed above). But if in doubt, we keep, and there's definitely enough doubt at the end of this AfD for this to be <b>no consensus</b>. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 13:38, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is Newgrounds material, yes. But it has more than 7,000,000 views there (and 10,000 reviews I might add), and there are more internet sites, including Albino Blacksheep and Weebl's Stuff, that also host it. Plus Neil Cicierega is a notable figure even before this cartoon was released. Also, the song itself topped Dr. Demento's charts (the Funny 25) as of now.

<dd>Fortunately this isn't <i>Collection of things that impress everyone</i>, but an encyclopaedia. It is the case that the vast majority of editors recognise this as a spectacularly obvious keep. The nom only says "It isn't notable for being on Newgrounds" which is clearly true (WTF is Newgrounds?) but it is notable for a host of other reasons, which have been expounded here. Nobody has addressed them (partially because it's impossible, I would guess) and nobody will. Later we can all recall this when someone puts <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paraguay.html" title="Paraguay">Paraguay</a> up for deletion as non-notable, and laugh at the parallels to this case. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 19:13, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're welcome. It's actually pretty reasonable as both are "maximally encyclopaedic" and both have a "zero worthiness for deletion". No editors who's argued for deletion has advanced a single reason that isn't demonstratably false, and it's clearly impossible to do so. The article is verifiable and encyclopaedic. Arguing to delete this is just as absurd as arguing to delete Paraguay. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 19:21, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>No, I don't think Dr. Demento's chart counts.

<dd>That's not even <i>close</i> to a "reasonable paraphrase". Ask any PR agent, there's a world of difference between a "buzz" and a "large cult following", and you're still mixing up the song (and the CD it's on) with the flash animation anyway, they're two distinctly separate subjects which get rather blurred in this article. <a href="../../../l/e/m/Lemon_Demon_9da7.html" title="Lemon Demon">Lemon Demon</a> don't even have their own article, so why should the video for one of their songs have one?

<li>On the Dr. Demento issue, and WP:WEB, let me reiterate what you so clearly ignored. From WP:WEB #3: <b>The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster.</b> Demento certainly qualifies as a well known online (and real world) broadcaster, meeting the requirements for 'notability'. It isn't about where the item ranks on his charts. It's that fact that he is well known and distributing it, independent of the creators, on his show. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparkhead_22b4.html" title="User:Sparkhead">Sparkhead</a> 20:24, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Um, no, the intro says "The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny, often shortened to Ultimate Showdown, is a Flash animation and music video." Period.

The <i>internet phenomenon</i> originated with a flash animation/music video but spread to other formats (such as radio) To suggest the script Shakespeare wrote for Hamlet is a seperate thing from review of the play based on performances, and that you can't cobble these together to establish a single notability would be just as untenable. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 21:00, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your logic gets fuzzier and fuzzier the more you try to stubbornly maintain. Should I bother to explain why "Song is to its Music Video" is not the same as "Script is to its review"? Nah. There's no point. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 22:22, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Given that I said <i>Song is to music video as script is to play</i> I'm fairly sure that won't be necessary. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 22:27, 8 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I just made the point moot...since apparently the song is more notable than the video, I changes the focus of the article's introduction to the song rather than the video. Hopefully that will stop this particular line of squabbling. -- <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmiOfBrie_6b47.html" title="User:EmiOfBrie">EmiOfBrie</a> 01:48, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is a microcosm of Western pop culture: 3 or so minutes of music and/or video that encapsulates a very large chunk of (mostly) late 20th century pop culture. Even if USoUD turns out to be a flash in the pan and sinks without trace after a few months -- well, 9 months and counting to date -- it is significant for two reasons: firstly, by virtue of having that moment of fame, and secondly, because it reflects so much of pop culture.

<li><b>comment</b>: I came to this afd intending to close as keep since its rather unanimous, but I'm inclined to suspect that most of the keep votes are single purpose accounts. I recognise none of the usernames from previous afds, and several have a similar signature style. I can't check everybodys contrib history atm though since I'm not on a high speed connection. Could somebody check and tag?

<li>The first afd on this article did have a lot a spa's. This one doesn't. I was actually a bit amused when Bwithh added the sock warning. There's a few, but the majority of the discussion has been with established accounts. Why would you be inclined to suspect differently? After all, it's not a vote anyway, right? If a spa comes in and makes a valid point, it's still a valid point. For the second time this article has passed a deletion nomination, can we stop with the afd's now? <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparkhead_22b4.html" title="User:Sparkhead">Sparkhead</a> 12:10, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I regard the afdsock warning notice as <u>preemptive</u> - I'll add it to any afd discussion I see which begins to show signs of an influx of anon IPs or single purpose accounts - especially articles likely to have a fan following. Whether or not a large influx emerges or not is immaterial.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>- I liked the music video, but this article doesn't fit notability. The Numa Numa is different because it was on the news. <i><b><a href="../../../b/i/b/User%7EBibliomaniac15_4b0f.html" title="User:Bibliomaniac15">bibliomaniac15</a> 04:11, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</b></i>
<ul>
<li>Bibliomaniac15, you shouldn't go voting on afd's if you have no idea of the article content or history. If you check the text above and history, you already voted this article a <i>keep</i> last week. Today you voted <i>delete</i>, then changed it to a <i>weak delete</i>. Seems to show that you seem to be voting for the sheer joy of it without knowledge, or you have some sort of split persona. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparkhead_22b4.html" title="User:Sparkhead">Sparkhead</a> 12:10, 16 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not that I enjoy changing votes just for the fun of it. I have checked the history and read the article several times. Before, I voted keep because I liked the music video itself, and I didn't check <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28web%29_6df7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (web)">Wikipedia:Notability</a>. Now that I look at it, it fails notability (no news about it), but only because of massive popularity and watches did I change it to a Weak Delete. Although eventually all people and articles run to bias, I strongly suggest that those who vote look at this issue from a neutral point of view, and not because of liking or disliking it. <i><b><a href="../../../b/i/b/User%7EBibliomaniac15_4b0f.html" title="User:Bibliomaniac15">bibliomaniac15</a> 00:22, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</b></i>

<li>Maybe no news, but as stated earlier, don't you think that being (so far) Dr. Demento's top request of the year would make it notable?
