<li>I am troubled that it appears the woman in the Nebraska license, alias "Francesca A. Sample, M.D.", appears to be the same woman in the Nevada license, going under the name "Suzy Driver". If Dr. Sample is using aliases and fleeing the law, perhaps the authorities should be notified. &lt;/bad joke&gt; That startling revelation aside, I could see a few choice images being used in <a href="../../../d/r/i/Driver%27s_license.html" title="Driver's license">driver's license</a>, and if someone were feeling plucky I suppose the article could have Driver's licenses in the United States, a full article talking specifically about the U.S. licensing process and the variations from state to state.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Although the article is unorganized and missing states, like mine, the article can provide some usefulness if it cleaned-up and expanded with more information to go with the pictures. The current pictures may need to be clean-up as well.

<li><b>Rename</b> as per JDoorjam's suggestion for creating an article on [Driver's licenses in the United States]]. There are issues about copyrights, public domain, fair use etc.; I'm not informed enough to comment on these. But an article about licenses in the US and the ways they are de facto identity cards would be verifiable, NPOV and non-OR. Given that the US system is certainly a mystery for many foreigners, and also for many Americans, gives the added benefit of notability. People should be encourage to expand the narrative about each state's ID and also to contribute to the ways the automobile has become of central importance to American identity (literally). <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font style="background: #08E8DE" face="Ariel" color="#000000"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font style="background: #000000" face="Ariel" color="#08E8DE"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 02:50, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> for the pictures, at least.<br />
While this may well be a useful resource, that in itself is not a reason for it to be in Wikipedia. There are many types of useful resource which we do not include: telephone directories are useful, but we do not include lists of phone numbers; marriage registers are useful, but we do not list every wedding in the world; dictionaries are very useful, but we do not include mere dictionary definitions. The question is not "is this useful", but "is this an encyclopedia article?" And the answer is, "no, this is not an encyclopedia article, it is a collection of pictures". Therefore, we should not keep it in its current form.<br />
If the pictures were cut down to a representative sample, and the list was replaced with an actual article on the history of state drivers' licenses, the cultural significance of their differences, the controversy surrounding their use as ID, etc etc., then we could keep <i>that</i>. But we cannot keep <i>this</i>. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 16:40, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep (if)</b>for the reasons listed above. Further, I contend that this list is in fact encyclopedic. A list of items that are encyclopedic on there own is what lists are for, aren't they? And besides, unlike many of our lists, this one can be "finished". However, if those images (or the majority) are not public domain then the list suddenly becomes a liability and should be <b>Deleted</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b>, but try to expand beyond a collection of images. Maybe talk more about the security feature of each license. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENationalparks_868d.html" title="User:Nationalparks">Nationalparks</a> 03:05, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. It's an image gallery, in support of...what, exactly? What encyclopedic information is actually being preseented here or which could be potentially presented by 51 pictures? This is someone's misguided idea of completeness, not to mention the copyright violations and probable bogosity (check out the "DC driver's license" -- despite the claim on the image page, it's NOT from the DC DMV). --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 04:10, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Rename</b> per Interlingua to Driver's licenses in the United States and expand as he suggested. Seems nearly as encyclopedic as <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flags_of_the_U.S._states_e889.html" title="Flags of the U.S. states">Flags of the U.S. states</a> and, at least to me, much more interesting. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 23:57, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> There appears to be a misconception here this list is somehow a useful reference. Point of fact, many states change their D/L designs every few years, and at this point, it looks like listcruft. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 06:54, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. A collection of pictures with copyright problems? No thanks!!

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> This is inviting forgery of drivers licenses. That is not a good thing in today's climate. The responsible thing would be to delete this now! <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuckner_1986_2d2e.html" title="User:Buckner 1986">Buckner 1986</a> 16:50, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Most of the images are public (state) resources so probably no copyvio. Interesting resources to have. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Wep (<a href="../../../w/e/p/User_talk%7EWep_2ff7.html" title="User talk:Wep">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wep_a16d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wep">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Keep &amp; Rename</b> -- can someone just <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> this as no consensus? The images have got to be fair use at least, and Interlingua is right that a move to Driver's licenses in the United States is a good idea and will allow for more information. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 15:27, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> They are state licences and I doubt if a state sees the licence here they will sue the wikipedia. The "copyright vio" argument is just silly. --<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonWR12LB_24af.html" title="User:DragonWR12LB">DragonWR12LB</a> 04:38, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
