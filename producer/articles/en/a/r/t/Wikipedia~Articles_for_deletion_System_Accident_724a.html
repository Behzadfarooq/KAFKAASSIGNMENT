<p>My article, as of Thursday, October 4, 2006, includes seven external links (now nine) and five references. The summary of the ValuJet crash is rock solid, as is the summary of the Space Shuttle Columbia.</p>
<p>I have experience in business management. I am not an engineer. I ask you to consider how that might be advantageous. An engineer can tell you that the cause of the ValuJet crash was that the oxygen generators were poorly labeled. I can tell you how that can happen in an organization. Of course, if the engineer also has managerial experience, or is merely an astute observer, he or she could also tell you.</p>
<p>And most of all, I invite your help. Help make this article better. Include even more references. Specifically, I ask for someone, with technical experience in nuclear power, to help write the section on Three Mile Island.</p>
<p>I am aware that the writing style is different. But is different bad, or merely different? Must every sentence have three words in blue? I think not. And the irony is that many of these accidents have as a contributing cause a formalistic style of communication!</p>
<p>I would cite Carl Sagan as a writer who is accurate but who also allows his own voice to come through. I'm sure you can think of other writers like this. The point is not to imitate Carl Sagan, or anyone else. But try and produce as good an intellectual work as we can, that is, in Wikipedia's words, to Be Bold.</p>
<p>I have split the ValuJet section, into the ValuJet crash itself, and "Discussion of ValuJet." I have similarly split the section on Space Shuttle Columbia. I ask you to consider that that may be enough, and to consider that this is a work in progress. I ask for your vote to keep this article.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>"System accident" is a term in use for many years in scholarly publications, dating back at least to Perrow (1984). It is simply false to assert it is or or a neologism. The article is important in relation to many notable disasters, where it is simplistic to blame "operator error." A Google search shows several scholarly uses of the term in the exact sense of the article in the first page of results:"Chernobyl - System Accident or Human Error?" (1996);"Anatomy of a System accident: The Crash of Avianca Flight 052 "(1994). NASA and IEEE use the term in many publications in the sense of the article title. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 18:35, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. In those articles, the term is being used in a very intuitive and trivial sense.

<dd><b>Coment</b>Au contraire, the term "system accident" as defined by Perrow in the work cited is commonly used in scholarly analysis of system failures. Many of these are discussed in Perrow's book, referenced in the article.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 17:31, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>The article discusses accidents per Perrow's term of art "system accident" which is an accident which involves "the unanticipated interaction of multiple failures" in a complex system. There is more to the concept than is seen by looking at several accidents individually. It is a concept used in failure analysis. If this article is deleted, I will add it to my personal Deleteopedia. Maybe there could be an article on Perrow's book, or his ideas could be added to the rather sparse article on <a href="../../../f/a/i/Failure_analysis.html" title="Failure analysis">Failure analysis</a>. Any claim of OR might not be taking into consideration the 1984 book. As for post-1984 accidents, accusations of OR could be disproved by citing verifiable publications wherein the accidents are described as "system accidents."<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 17:31, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, author has shown that the term is a discrete concept and more than just the combination of the words "system" and "accident" and that it is actually used in published works. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 17:54, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
