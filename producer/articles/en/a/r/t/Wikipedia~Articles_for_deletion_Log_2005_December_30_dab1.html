<li><b>Strong Keep</b>--Potential for abuse is not a reason for deletion just as potential for vandalism is not a reason for protection. There is amble precedent on wikipedia that although some people take issue with the word terrorist, a reputable encyclopedia can use it. I think a safe way of maintaining articles would be to only list people who have wikipedia articles about them which refer to them as terrorists. Reasonable people know that OBL is a terrorist and GWB isnt a terrorist. The article can begin with an accepted definition of terrorists.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - "civilized people", again another POV term. A non "Civilised" culture often just means a non "Western Culture", certainly tribal Africans and Australian Aborigonies arent "civilised" to Westerners. So a list of Terrorists as defined by the majority of "civilized people" is just a list of people the West consider Terrorists. Lets cut the crap, this is not an innocent generic list of Terrorists, we all have a POV lets not be naive, this is a list of Terrorists as defined by Western Countries and in general the USA. - <a href="../../../u/n/l/User%7EUnlimitedAccess_461a.html" title="User:UnlimitedAccess">UnlimitedAccess</a> 19:07, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You make that last statement sound like it is a bad thing. Why the obsession of many people to be so all inclusive and PC. This is an English language Encyclopedia and naturally it is centered on the anglophone world, USA, UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada. That is inho not strange, unexpected or bad. Do you think an Iranian or Arabic encyclopedia states anything good about Ben-Gurion, or mentions him at all? Would a Soviet-era encyclopedia sing the praises of western style democracy or Winston Churchill? No, of course not. and neither do I expect them to. In the same manner, I think it is perfectly normal for the en: Wiki to be western centered.--<a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKalsermar_7a00.html" title="User:Kalsermar">Kalsermar</a> 20:20, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Trying to avoid a English POV for the English Wikipedia entirely is near impossible, but that does not mean it should not be attempted and fought dayly for. I did not mean to imply my last sentence is a bad thing. Articles can be ethnocentric and bias as long as they point that out, ie "List of Terroirst as considered by the US Government" etc... but a generic list of "Terrorists" is not useful unless it only contains those that are self admitted terrorists. "Would a Soviet-era encyclopedia sing the praises of western style democracy or Winston Churchill", I would hope not and nor should the English one either, no article in ANY wikipedia should sing the praise of anything or anyone. - <a href="../../../u/n/l/User%7EUnlimitedAccess_461a.html" title="User:UnlimitedAccess">UnlimitedAccess</a> 06:58, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Ambiguous</b> -- I say "keep" if names such as George W Bush (responsible for mass murdering of 100.000 Iraqi civilians) will be included. If not, i say "delete", because then this list only reflects the POV of men in power who have set the definition of what is supposed to be 'terrorism' and what not (always excluding their terrorising self). -- <a href="../../../a/c/t/User%7EActiveSelective_242a.html" title="User:ActiveSelective">ActiveSelective</a> 15:04, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> -- It is a well worked on and very long list, though. Under certain conditions, I could accept it even when it does not have the name of G W Bush on it: (1) When it is renamed to "list of individual terrorists" (terrorists operating alone or in small bands, independently of official powers), AND (2) when we start building a "list of state terrorists" (terrorists who have control over the official state power), including the name of... you can guess who. -- I am not trying to be funny. We do have a good article on <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_terrorism.html" title="State terrorism">State terrorism</a> which includes actions of countries such as UK and USA, and official institutes such as the CIA. -- <a href="../../../a/c/t/User%7EActiveSelective_242a.html" title="User:ActiveSelective">ActiveSelective</a> 15:04, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Locking (protecting) the redirect, is not a good idea; one should protect pages sparingly. I am afraid that allowing such redirects in will open a can of worms. Redirects should be made only if they are useful I would argue, not to prevent people from creating silly-named articles. <a href="../../../o/l/e/User%7EOleg_Alexandrov_8bb5.html" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> (<a href="../../../o/l/e/User_talk%7EOleg_Alexandrov_0298.html" title="User talk:Oleg Alexandrov">talk</a>) 00:29, 31 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Even without the protection, I'm having a hard time seeing the downside of this redir. It doesn't mislead anyone (unlike if, say, I had left <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Mountain_%28California%29_%28Diablo_Range%29_b641.html" title="Black Mountain (California) (Diablo Range)">Black Mountain (California) (Diablo Range)</a> as a redir after discovering there was a second Black Mountain in the Diablo Range), takes no noticeable server space, and I just don't see the scenario where people start putting in so many silly redirects that it becomes a problem. And I really do think one of the great functions of redirects is to preempt duplicate articles that authors may not have known were there. I'll allow that there is a countervailing issue if it's eventually decided that anons can't start new articles; the unprotected redir would allow an anon to recreate the article. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 00:59, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> This article should not exist in its present form (a list of names without any citations). Therefore, I have removed all the unsourced entries (that is to say, all of them) from the article and placed them in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_virgin_births_47fe.html" title="Talk:List of virgin births">Talk:List of virgin births</a>. I have edited the introductory paragraph to read "This article is about virgin births of any figures other than Jesus, accompanied by a verifiable reference to a source describing them as such." I have added an explanation on the Talk page. Naturally, there is no requirement that any of these characters be proved actually to have been the result of virgin births. Verifiability does not mean the fact must be proven, it means the <i>source</i> must be verifiable. The reason I dislike lists is that they tend to attract lazy insertions of unchecked, unsourced, unverified entries based on what people think they remember reading, etc. If people are willing to put in the work of creating a list that conforms to Wikipedia's policies on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">source citations</a>, I have no objection to it.</dd>

<dd>Those interested in keeping the article might begin by seeing which of our own articles on the already include a suitable citation that could be checked, then used in this article. The first couple I checked at random—<a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddha.html" title="Buddha">Buddha</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prometheus.html" title="Prometheus">Prometheus</a>—say nothing about a virgin birth, but <a href="../../../d/e/g/Deganawidah.html" title="Deganawidah">Deganawidah</a> does and it has a reference that checks out, so I'll do the first one. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 02:59, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>P. S. A separate issue, but if the list is kept it might not be a bad idea to move it to "List of virgin birth traditions". Or something like that. The existence of a virgin birth <i>tradition</i> is an easily demonstrated fact; the truth of an actual virgin <i>birth</i> is not. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 03:13, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The <i>readers</i> can set their own notability threshold, but we must all remember that <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINI_9a1f.html" title="WP:WINI">Wikipedia is not infinite</a> and every subject is not verifiable, so the <i>editors</i> must be held to a higher standard. We can verify most of the information in <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a>, but if my buddy Doug starts an article about himself, most of that stuff is unverifiable. If every person in the world decided to start making articles about themselves and other people came in and vandalized it, how would vandal-fighters know what is right and what is wrong? Furthermore, how could we manage such an influx of traffic? There are good reasons for notability requirements, although it would be nice to have a grand database of everyone in the world, but the trouble is, nobody could possibly verify any of the information, nor do we have the room for it right now. <a href="../../../j/h/m/User%7EJHMM13_dfcf.html" title="User:JHMM13">JHMM13</a> (<a href="../../../j/h/m/User_talk%7EJHMM13_2dd8.html" title="User talk:JHMM13">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JHMM13_5487.html" title="Special:Contributions/JHMM13">C</a>) <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_States.svg_d767.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_States.svg_d767.html" /></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg/25px-Flag_of_Germany.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="15" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" /></a> 10:17, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINI_9a1f.html" title="WP:WINI">WP:WINI</a> has no more to do with this than notability. There are a finite number of people on the planet, and in recorded history, whose information is verifiable. You play a dangerous game of censorship if you delete. Keep this article if the info is verifiable --Marvin147 10:41, 3 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINI_9a1f.html" title="WP:WINI">WP:WINI</a> does have something to do with this, as I have stated above. We cannot verify everything that everyone has done, and I'd like to know where you get your information, because I don't think we've even got the exact number of people on the planet down, much less encyclopedic information about all of them. Furthermore, if something is changed on their article, how could we possibly know if it's true or false? There is censorship here, but Wikipedia is not a forum for ultimate free speech. We arrive at consensuses for guidelines and policies based on the limitations we have. Unfortunately, for the reasons I have stated above (none of which you addressed in your response), we simply cannot put <i>everything</i> into Wikipedia. <i>Verifiability</i> and <i>quantity</i> are two of the important things to keep in mind here. <a href="../../../j/h/m/User%7EJHMM13_dfcf.html" title="User:JHMM13">JHMM13</a> (<a href="../../../j/h/m/User_talk%7EJHMM13_2dd8.html" title="User talk:JHMM13">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JHMM13_5487.html" title="Special:Contributions/JHMM13">C</a>) <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_States.svg_d767.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_States.svg_d767.html" /></a> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/ba/Flag_of_Germany.svg/25px-Flag_of_Germany.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="15" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Germany.svg_8993.html" /></a> 12:16, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have been supporting the general direction (which seems to be shifting of late) of not including articles on people whose notability comes from being a (not yet elected) candidate in an election. I have not cited my having been a candidate in an election as support for inclusion of the article on me. (Please note that I have not been pushing any political agenda in this, and have supported deleting many Green Party candidate articles - and the only candidate articles I've nominated for deletion have been Greens.)

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> So many notable civil/public servants in Pakistan have literary contributions viz Qudratullah Shahab, Brig. Sadiq Salik, Daud Kamal etc. I dont see any harm if one is a civil servant and writes poetry.

<p>I have uploaded some of the images of his book that I currently have. I wish I had his Urdu book otherwise I would have also uploaded those images as well. All editors are requested to please appreciate the fact that it was a pioneering effort by a Pathan to write poetry in a language which was neither his mother tongue nor national dialect. This book may have gone unnoticed at that time, probably because of the reason that nobody cares for English poets in Pakistan and especially from a conservative place like NWFP. However, there were book reviews about this book in leading English Newspapers of Pakistan viz. “The Frontier Post” and “Pakistan Observer” at that time (I don’t have copies of those reviews but everybody is welcome to contact those two Newspapers and check their archives of late 1993). Even still if editors consider that this entry may be deleted then they are welcome to do so but then someone's genuine effort might go unnoticed. I may plead that it may be <b>Kept</b>.</p>

<p>I'm sorry, but you're missing something. I wrote the article and it is quite true, unfortunately it was edited to contain various absurdities (e.g. Pulitzer Prize, Nobel Prize, engagement, etc.) The think tank, sociological ties, and Xiu Xiu are very real (though moderately obscure outside a very select group).</p>

<p>This page is nothing but an advertizement; it has nominal cultural or knowledge value. Further, several users have undertaken to update which anime series are currently running on Anime Unleashed and which have been cancelled. This makes the article more in the nature of a "program guide" than an encyclopedia article. I can see no way this article could edited or improved to make it encyclopedic <a href="../../../g/e/s/User%7EGestaltG_2c15.html" title="User:GestaltG">GestaltG</a> 05:07, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Notable in what way. I believe that the reader should be able to determine how or why the subject of the article is notable in the first paragraph. Of all of the television shows out there, that come and go, year after year, on over two hundred cable channels, how is this show notable? Perhaps if the article could be modified/edited? Also, I noted that it's still called a stub, but as you indicated, 3/4 of the article is nothing but a list of shows. What is the redeeming value in a list of shows on Anime Unleashed, from an encyclopedic view? <a href="../../../g/e/s/User%7EGestaltG_2c15.html" title="User:GestaltG">GestaltG</a> 13:08, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: Notable because outside of Cartoon Network's Toonami and Adult Swim block Anime's usually arn't featured on western Television, therefore a show that broadcast not only one but sever anime series is indeed notable. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathawk_f102.html" title="User:Deathawk">Deathawk</a> 19:01, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> even though I dislike G4 (TechTV forever!), Anime Unleashed is a good segment of their programming lineup. I too agree that it needs to be cleaned a little &#160;<font color="#0000DD"><b><a href="../../../j/w/e/User%7EJwestbrook_cdd5.html" title="User:Jwestbrook">J\/\/estbrook</a></b></font>&#160;&#160;&#160;<i><a href="../../../j/w/e/User_talk%7EJwestbrook_1c0d.html" title="User talk:Jwestbrook">Talk</a></i>&#160;&#160;<b><a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanispamcruftisement_fe39.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanispamcruftisement"><font color="red">VSCA</font></a></b>&#160;&#160;&#160; 21:23, 30 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Should we mark it for cleanup then? It's not really a stub and it's not really an article. Take out the list of anime programs and it's a stub again. But see, now in this discussion, we have had to finally state a reason why this is a notable enough subject for an entry; and that reason really has little to do with Anime Unleashed (which one might view as the cold medicine rather than the cold; does one talk about colds by talking about a cold medicine?). Any way in which this stub might then be expanded into an article will likely involve subjects outside of Anime Unleashed, for example, an article on anime in western culture. See, this is what I have been saying? Maybe it should be merged instead with any articles on Adult Swim and Toonami? <a href="../../../g/e/s/User%7EGestaltG_2c15.html" title="User:GestaltG">GestaltG</a> 00:29, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Why don't we create a page called Animes which have been broadcast on Anime Unleashed or if that won't suffice how about a category, these suggetions would be easy to implement plus we wouldn't have to mark it for cleanup.(as process could be done fairly easily) <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathawk_f102.html" title="User:Deathawk">Deathawk</a> 19:26, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Such a page as you suggest would then be again, nothing but a list or program guide, and not an article. It then would be marked for deletion and we would be back here again. <a href="../../../g/e/s/User%7EGestaltG_2c15.html" title="User:GestaltG">GestaltG</a> 19:32, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. At most it deserves a mention about anime in Western culture, as said above. So far it's a TV guide and clearly not encyclopedic. Deathawk says that this is "Notable because outside of XX and YY <i>Anime's usually arn't featured on western Television</i>". Maybe you meant <i>U.S. television</i>, which is a much, much more restricted field. In Latin America anime has been very popular for more than a while. Argentina had a local channel with a popular anime block years before CN's Toonami and <a href="../../../l/o/c/Locomotion_%28TV_channel%29_56aa.html" title="Locomotion (TV channel)">Locomotion</a> (now Sony's <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animax_%28TV_network%29_5118.html" title="Animax (TV network)">Animax</a>) came into the scene. I may be nostalgic about those early days of anime here, but I'd never even dream of creating an article about that in Wikipedia, though a well-researched article on the penetration of Japanese culture (anime, J-pop, etc.) in the West would be perfectly OK. --<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.

<li><b>Delete</b> Good idea Skrew, but the article Puppione itself is still a hoax. The missionaries came to Hawaii in 1820, and the article claims that this "Puppione" came in a voyage in 1859, which was far after any missionary ships were still arriving. I also can't find any Google results at all relating Puppione to Milan, exploration, Hawaii, or hula. I also can't find any information relating to hula and Ucello, so if someone would create that page that would be great. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuantum73_6c84.html" title="User:Quantum73">Quantum73</a> (<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuantum73_a630.html" title="User talk:Quantum73">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Quantum73_c327.html" title="Special:Contributions/Quantum73">contribs</a>) 05:32, 31 December 2005 (UTC).</small></li>

Am I missing something? This is a big deal. I don't think he deserves any credit. Brad in Seattle.</s>

This story is such an example and has inspired me, a teen who has led a life similar to Hassan's.

<li><b>Keep</b> I see no reason why Prof. McGuiness shouldn't be mentioned in the field of AI research alongside other AI researchers. The article would be better if it placed her academic achievements in context, which would also justify its inclusion. --&#160;<a href="../../../%28/a/e/User%7E%28aeropagitica%29.html" title="User:(aeropagitica)">(aeropagitica)</a>&#160;<a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title="UK"><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="UK" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> 15:17, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Yes, subject appears to be well-respected in her field, however this is not the issue at hand. Should researchers be encouraged to create their own Wikipedia entries based on their own assessment of their level of recognition in the field? This appears to be flagrant disregard for <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>, especially since creator/subject makes <i>sweeping claims about her own importance and reputation</i>. Recommend article be removed, and a fresh one started, authored by one of the above (or other) colleagues supportive of an entry for this subject (if they so choose) in order to avoid appearance of Wikipedia as a forum for self-advocacy of subjects at any level of recognition. - <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemocritus_ca4a.html" title="User:Democritus">Democritus</a>
<ul>
<li>That's a valid point, but it's so easy for someone to create an account and add the article that it actually seems preferable to me to accept (but not <i>encourage</i>) articles from the people themselves. That at least gives a little accountability to something otherwise completely unenforcable. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 16:57, 30 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Observation</b> Such acceptance is the very source of the encouragement. And if it is your position is that it is <i>preferable</i> to have people create articles about themselves, due to increased "accountability" of the material contained therein, then please familiarise your self with <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html#Creating_an_article_about_yourself" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO#Creating_an_article_about_yourself</a>, which clearly states a position rather different to that. - <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemocritus_ca4a.html" title="User:Democritus">D</a></li>

<li><b>Question</b> - Are you advocating a system of maintaining two standards regarding creation of self-promoting encyclopedia entries, one standard for those who deem themselves important, and another for those who deem themselves not? - <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemocritus_ca4a.html" title="User:Democritus">D</a>
<ul>
<li><b>Answer</b> Sure, I guess it's a double standard. But it's not "those who deem themselves important" but rather "those who we deem important." If <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Jackson_1873.html" title="Michael Jackson">Michael Jackson</a> had created his article, we wouldn't be rushing to delete it. However, if local sixth-grader James Noname creates his, then I would be of the opinion that <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> applies.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The case for "notability" of this particular subject is certainly undermined by the fact that no-one (other than the subject herself) perceived adequate notability to feel moved to create an entry. This is <i>exactly</i> why the the creation of self-promoting articles is strongly discouraged; <i>no-one</i> is capable of judging their own "importance". If this subject is indeed notable, then let this be evidenced by someone of <i>at least nominal neutrality</i> taking such note, in the form of an independently created article. - <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemocritus_ca4a.html" title="User:Democritus">D</a></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as per Dlyons493 et al, as long as the subject doesn't try to claim control over the content. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonCopy_758c.html" title="User:CarbonCopy">CarbonCopy</a> <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonCopy_919a.html" title="User talk:CarbonCopy">(talk)</a> 20:06, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - while I share <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemocritus_ca4a.html" title="User:Democritus">Democritus</a>'s concern that any self-edited article is going to be inherently biased, I also think it's a matter that should be decided on a case-by-case basis. The <a href="../../../d/e/b/Deborah_McGuinness_5acc.html" title="Deborah McGuinness">Deborah McGuinness</a> article is not bad at all and does not seem unduly promotional to me.

<li><b>Comment</b> <i>Either</i> action, keeping or deleting, will send a message of some kind. If it is kept, then let us please change the guideline described at <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html#Creating_an_article_about_yourself" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO#Creating_an_article_about_yourself</a> from "Creating articles about yourself is strongly discouraged", to, "If you would like to create an article about yourself, because in your opinion the evidence indicates that you are important, then create one. All such articles will be handled on a case-by-case basis, in which a debate and arbitration process will determine whether you were correct in your conclusion that you are, in fact, important." - <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemocritus_ca4a.html" title="User:Democritus">D</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Programme chair, dozens of invited talks at conference, holds five patents - looks notable to me. She isn't judging her own importance, it has been made verifiably clear that her peers have judged her important. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 01:47, 1 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> But, if so, then let those peers themselves evince that they have "judged her important" by creating a Wikipedia article to honour that importance. Yet so far they have failed to do so, and this subject merely called attention to herself, flouting the objectivity criterion. But notable or not, <i>anyone</i> may perceive evidence from which they conclude they are important. If Wikipedia guidelines are that we create our own pages if we decide that we are important, thereby generating case-by-case-by-case calls for arbitration, then so be it. The current stated guideline, which is quite the reverse, should be revised to reflect this. The need then arises for further guidelines by which one may determine that one's conclusions about one's own importance are proper. Is this viable? Currently, there is clear and simple system in effect. A different system could be considered, but when reduced to practice, either all should feel free to create their own pages if they have concluded they are notable, or, none should create articles about themselves. - <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemocritus_ca4a.html" title="User:Democritus">D</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Allow me too clarify something that seems to be getting overlooked. I am <i>not</i> challenging (nor endorsing) the encyclopaedia-worthiness of this subject. I am asking whether <i>this process</i>, what we are all doing right now, is the method by which future self-created articles will be decided for inclusion. (And if not, then why for this person and not others?) If yes, then let the process be so, but, let us <i>change the posted guideline to reflect the practised reality</i>. - <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemocritus_ca4a.html" title="User:Democritus">Democritus</a>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> says "Creating articles about yourself is strongly discouraged," not "Creating articles about yourself is forbidden." It also notes that this is "guideline," not "policy." I agree entirely that it's a bad idea, and most such pages wind up getting submitted to AfD. I have done a lot of these myself. I also think there's a reason why this isn't a hard and fast rule, and this situation is an example of why. <a href="../../../t/w/p/User%7ETwp_3cd5.html" title="User:Twp">Tim Pierce</a> 23:49, 1 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> If we are to quote the source, then let us do it more fully: <i>"Creating or editing an article about yourself, your business, your publications, or any of your own achievements is strongly discouraged. If you do create an article about yourself, it will likely be listed on articles for deletion. Deletion is not certain, but many feel strongly that you should not <b>start</b> articles about yourself. If you or your achievements are verifiable and notable; and are thus are suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia, someone else will create an article about you sooner or later. People are generally unable to determine whether they are themselves encyclopedic."</i>
<p>By applying these guidelines selectively, as is being proposed, you merely open the door to all comers who have determined, by whatever means, that they are "encyclopedic", to feel free to promote that fact in Wikipedia, resulting in more work and more time spent on maintenance, and in the meantime, further jeopardising the already roundly-debated credibility of this resource.</p>
<p><b>In summary</b>, if this article, or others like it, stand, then ammending <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> along the following lines would be appropriate, and would accurately reflect the state of affairs: <i>"As a matter of practise, if you guess correctly that you or your accomplishments will be decided noteworthy, then a self-created article promoting this fact is fine and is not likely to be deleted. Therefore, those who have concluded, based on the available evidence, that they themselves are an appropriate subject for a Wikipedia article, need not take "strongly discouraged", as mentioned herein, very seriously."</i> - <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemocritus_ca4a.html" title="User:Democritus">D</a></p>
<ul>
<li>In most cases, not creating an autobiographical article is good advice, as it is usually a waste of effort and frequently leads to a deletion discussion which can be somewhat humiliating to the author/subject. But it is just not a big deal when it happens, if the subject does happen to meet our notability criteria and the information is verifiable. It may also be noted that as long as articles are written under pseudonym we have no way to know for sure who actually wrote an article. If the author in this case had taken the username User:SuperMarioFan2000, rather than User:Dmcguinness, nobody would have suspected that the author was <a href="../../../d/e/b/Deborah_McGuinness_5acc.html" title="Deborah McGuinness">Deborah McGuinness</a>. For all I know, User:Dmcguinness could be some random computer geek in Taiwan (or at least somebody else at Stanford). I see no reason to change the guideline. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 14:12, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - applying this guideline selectively is an inevitable result of using selective language to define it. If the appropriate guideline should be "creating an article about yourself is forbidden," then it would be a very good idea to take this argument to <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> and obtain a consensus for that statement. But as it stands I think that the complaint about inconsistency is just meaningless. <a href="../../../t/w/p/User%7ETwp_3cd5.html" title="User:Twp">Tim Pierce</a> 16:25, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Indeed. As the policy states, the artice <i>was</i> listed on articles for deletion, where deletion is not certain (but is rather judged case by case.) Strongly discouraged is not the same thing as prohibited, if you want to actually prohibit get consensus to say so in the policy. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonCopy_758c.html" title="User:CarbonCopy">CarbonCopy</a> <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonCopy_919a.html" title="User talk:CarbonCopy">(talk)</a> 15:36, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Just be thankful I put it up on AfD instead of speedy deleting it, as it was originally tagged.

<li><b>Delete</b> a journal of which 17 issues were published, and for which there is no reliable evidence of any widespread currency.

Taylor &amp; Francis stopped printing it after five issues; is that a sign of a significant journal?

<dd>All the above ‘facts’ are FALSE indicating that it is through blatant lies that some try to have the journal deleted! First, the journal D&amp;N (formerly Society and Nature) has published not 17 but 27 issues in its over 11 years history. <a href="http://www.democracynature.org/dn/index.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.democracynature.org/dn/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.democracynature.org/dn/index.htm</a>. Second, the ‘illustrious contributors’ have submitted many articles, as anybody can easily find out by just checking the link above. Third, Taylor &amp; Francis stopped publishing it after five VOLUMES , not issues, as Just zis Guy, you know? [T]/[C] ‘discovered’ voting for delete, followed by SarekOfVulcan.

<dd>Good detective work! The point however is that Bookchin and Biehl resigned in 1997, when D&amp;N was still published by its original publisher (Aigis publications) whereas Taylor and Francis started publishing the journal …two years later (in full knowledge of these events since, before deciding to take over from Aigis, they went through all the previous issues of the journal) and continued publishing it for another five years (i.e. another five volumes of 3 isuues each) when, according to our Sherlock Holmes, discovered that Bookchin and Biehl resigned and they were so shocked by this event that they stopped publication of the journal.

<dd>This is not a hypothetical scenario but pure science fiction! I repeat: T&amp;F stopped publication not after two but after FIVE years of publication by them and SEVEN years after the Bookchin resignation. Second, can our Sherlock Holmes reply to the question why on earth a capitalist publisher like T&amp;F was so shocked by the resignation of Murray Bookchin when NO OTHER MEMBER OF THE EB has resigned since then but, instead, the EB expanded signigficantly since then (the same happened to the number of contributors and circulation)&#160;?

<li><b>Comment. Jbamb's insistence on deleting the D&amp;N entry, using in the process a series of falsified "facts" like the above one on the affiliations of supporters of KEEP, as well as the statement that the Inclusive Democracy entry was deleted because it referred to "a relatively unknown ideology" and not because of a minor copyvio (from the Inclusive Democracy external link!) is very interesting indeed. The fact that this uknown (to him) ideology reserves a long entry in the Routledge Encyclopedia of International Economy presumably means to him that this is not as reliable an encyclopedia as the Wikipedia one!

<li><b>Comment</b>: We aren't talking about those pages, we are talking about this one. Inclusive Democracy has been deleted, the International Journal on Inclusive Democracy has been deleted. There appears to be consesus on deleting The International Network on Inclusive Democracy. Everything associated with this is getting deleted. If all you have to defend this is assume I'm acting with bad faith, I think that says something about the inherent worth of these articles.

<li><b>Comment. Jbamb, it would have been much more honest not to pretend that you are a ‘neutral’ administrator on a deeply political topic belonging to the antisystemic Left when all your interests (and contributions) are on right wing-politics. The noteworthiness of this theory fortunately is not going to be judged by right-wingers who have the power, as administrators, to decide what should be and what should not be on encyclopaedias. At least, bourgeois encyclopaedias, like the one I mentioned above, (as well as the dozens of references to Inclusive Democracy you may find in books, journals --even in Google hits) have experts on the field who, even if they do not agree with the politics of what they assess, try to be as neutral as they can. Coming now to the new distorted ‘facts’ you presented above: I repeat, as it seems one has to repeat things to you so that you can assimilate them, that the Inclusive Democracy entry was deleted for a minor copyvio –nothing to do with non-noteworthiness. The International Journal on Inclusive Democracy was deleted after an obvious socketpuppet (currently under investigation) made an AfD, which is now recognised as an error by several administrators in their own WP pages. It is worthnoting that the decision to delete was taken by just two (2) votes in favor of delete, after all other votes to keep were discounted, on the dubious grounds that they were made by relatively new users (even if they were clearly more knowledgeable on the topic than the two administrators, who, like you, had no idea about it). A similar type of “consensus” is being attempted now with respect to the International Network on Inclusive Democracy. It is actions like yours that discredit Wikpedia and today the world press increasingly disputes the reliability of information it provides!19:47, Dec.31, 2005</b></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> There has been no good faith practiced by 90% of the administrators. The originator of the deletes was discredited to be a sockpuppet and was to be banned. He never was and allowed to continue his attacks using other sockpuppets. Consequently, the 'neutral' administrators sided with him and the gangsterism commenced. Personal attacks is a matter of opinion. I can say that your personal attack against us is with your above comment depicting us as "nothing more than a kook patrol."

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Democracy_%26_Nature_%282nd_nomination%29_3d70.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Democracy &amp; Nature (2nd nomination)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE EDITORIAL BOARD OF D&amp;N AND IJID</span></h4>
<p><i>removed</i> 1. We, the members of the Editorial Board of Democracy &amp; Nature (D&amp;N) and its present successor The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy (IJID) have, over the last few days, witnessed a concerted attack against the journal by an alliance of sockpuppets (who have been created by a disgruntled ex-member of the journal with a vendetta against us) and some administrators who are either apolitical (not in the sense of party politics but in the sense of a fundamental lack of understanding of politics in the broader sense) or who do not hide their hostility towards the Inclusive Democracy political agenda. This ‘unholy’ alliance has attempted to delete all Inclusive Democracy entries in Wikipedia and in some cases it has already succeeded in doing this.</p>
<p>2. The reasons for which Wikipedia have attempted to substantiate their AfDs range from silly WP copyright violations (from our own webpages!-- which, if applied to all WP entries, would lead to most of them being eclipsed) to arbitrary ‘assessments’ of the notability and significance of our entries. Such ‘assessments’ are given either by administrators who do not have any expertise on the topics they are assessing, or by others following their own political agenda which is at the opposite end of the political spectrum to the Inclusive Democracy project.</p>
<p>3. We find it humiliating, to say the least, to be subjected to this pseudo-democratic process which defames not only our journals, which have been honoured to have had as contributors and members of their Editorial Boards well-known writers such as <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Best_0f28.html" title="Steven Best">Steven Best</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murray_Bookchin_794f.html" title="Murray Bookchin">Murray Bookchin</a>, <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Bourdieu_5bf1.html" title="Pierre Bourdieu">Pierre Bourdieu</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornelius_Castoriadis_b492.html" title="Cornelius Castoriadis">Cornelius Castoriadis</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noam_Chomsky_7341.html" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/k/Takis_Fotopoulos_db26.html" title="Takis Fotopoulos">Takis Fotopoulos</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andre_Gunder_Frank_4dce.html" title="Andre Gunder Frank">Andre Gunder Frank</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serge_Latouche_55b0.html" title="Serge Latouche">Serge Latouche</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Pinter_87e1.html" title="Harold Pinter">Harold Pinter</a>-- and many other equally important writers who do not have similar WP entries—but also our subscribers who have, in the past, included such notable institutions as Michigan State University, University of Maryland, University of Wisconsin, London School of Economics, University of Massachusetts, Stanford University, Simon Fraser University, Hamburg Library, University of New South Wales, University of Canterbury, Kent; Universidade de Coimbra, Portugal; Harvard College Library,Iinternational Institute of Social History, Amsterdam; Formazione ii Biblioteca, Palermo; Bath University and many others. Furthermore, we find this process equally humiliating to the authors of hundreds of references and citations to D&amp;N and IJID in books, journals, magazines, and electronic media.</p>
<p>4. Finally, we find appalling the fact that, through Wikipedia’s so-called assessment process, self-anointed administrators with no guarantee at all of any expertise in the fields they assess use their wide-ranging powers to decide which pieces of knowledge and information are appropriate enough to be included in Wikipedia. These powers include discounting the votes of registered users who are not long-established--even if their expertise is much more relevant to the topics assessed than that of the administrators, as the irrelevant comments of these administrators frequently show. These built-in fatal errors in assessment—only some of which have been mentioned--could go a long way in explaining the growing literature in the world press on the low standard of knowledge and information provided by Wikipedia.</p>
<p>5. When we created the WP Inclusive Democracy entries, we were functioning as bona fide users thinking that we were helping the development of a free and supposedly democratic encyclopaedia that could function as an alternative source of information to the established encyclopaedias. We were utterly disappointed when we discovered the irresponsible and completely unreliable way in which knowledge on important matters is supposedly created by this supposedly alternative encyclopaedia, which clearly will never reach the standards of the established encyclopaedias because of the fatal structural flaws mentioned. Therefore, the sooner it is disqualified as an authoritative source of knowledge, the better.</p>
<p>6. In light of the above we have decided the following:</p>
<p>a) to withdraw with immediate effect ALL the Inclusive Democracy entries from Wikipedia, including those that have been challenged only on account of trivial Wikipedia copyright violations, as well as those like the entry on the founder of Inclusive Democracy, <a href="../../../t/a/k/Takis_Fotopoulos_db26.html" title="Takis Fotopoulos">Takis Fotopoulos</a>, which has not been challenged by anyone during this whole process. b) to demand the banning of any new entry on the following topics: <a href="../../../i/n/c/Inclusive_Democracy_d5d9.html" title="Inclusive Democracy">Inclusive Democracy</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy_%26_Nature_3533.html" title="Democracy &amp; Nature">Democracy &amp; Nature</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_International_Journal_of_Inclusive_Democracy_3ccd.html" title="The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy">The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy</a>, The International Network for Inclusive Democracy and <a href="../../../t/a/k/Takis_Fotopoulos_db26.html" title="Takis Fotopoulos">Takis Fotopoulos</a>.

<li><b>Comment from an outsider</b>. Before anyone pounces on me, I'm just one of the guys that reviews the AfD nominations and closes them when appropriate. The discussion above, if it can be called a discussion, is out of place. Parts of it should be conducted in the article's talk page, other parts in personal talk pages. The editorial board announcement is so terribly out of place that I should remove it outright. I'm trying to find a way not to close this as "no consensus" but it's very hard. As I see it, this is not a problem of notability but of verifiability and control of content (please correct me if I'm wrong). If a journal is published over years and receives contributions from notable people, then it's notable. But if the only way to verify anything about it is by consulting the editors, and moreover, if the editors want to have control of the Wikipedia coverage of the journal and the concepts it presents, then we have a serious problem. I can only suggest that everybody calms down and think of a suitable compromise. If you can't compromise, then this article will have to go. <b>Legal threats, editorial pronouncements, and accusations of any kind not backed up by policy and immediately accessible evidence will not be tolerated.</b> Just for the record, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a democracy</a>. --<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.

<li><b>Comment</b></li>
</ul>
<p>I wonder how Pablo D. Flores derived his ‘wise’ conclusion that the problem is one of verifiability and control. All that the Editorial Board stressed was something that for everybody else (outside Wikipedia!) is self-evident: i.e., primarily, the authentic source of information about the history of the journal, as I suppose the authentic source of information on an article on the history of the New York Times, is its editors and not any user, even if he worked for the journal for a couple of years. Also, the primary source of information on Inclusive Democracy could only be its founder and his associates, as similarly the primary source of information on social ecology could only be its founder and his associates. This does not mean that editing to add information, provided it is reliable, should not be allowed. If that were the case, the editors would not have created this WP entry in the first instance. But, it is one thing to edit in order to add reliable information and quite another to distort the FACTUAL information given by the editors themselves, or to add malicious misinformation etc, as it happened in this case. And the WP rules about negotiation, arbitration, etc. are completely irrelevant. Why the Editors of NYT will ‘negotiate’ with a malicious editor on an encyclopedia entry on their own newspaper? In any other encyclopedia such problems are solved through expertise and specialized knowledge on editing any entry. This does not of course secure ‘objectivity’, but at least rules out malicious and distorted editing. In Wikipedia even this seems impossible since it establishes ‘equal right’ of any user, without distinguishing between editors who have more qualifications to give an accurate description, particularly on factual matters, and every other user. As an astute user stresses on the matter: “The danger in wikipedia is that secondary readers of secondary sources can become primary editors! …Truth lies in the eye of the beholder! Since that article and many others after, my faith in wikipedia as a reliable source with universal value has been questioned, and I can't trust the "anyone can edit" principle anymore” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Chazz88#enlighten_me_about_objectivity_in_wikipedia_.28and_thks_for_welcoming.29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Chazz88#enlighten_me_about_objectivity_in_wikipedia_.28and_thks_for_welcoming.29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Chazz88#enlighten_me_about_objectivity_in_wikipedia_.28and_thks_for_welcoming.29</a> john sargis 19:03, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>OK, I think I got the idea now. I vote for <b>delete</b> as violation of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>; an extra reason would be the apparently unsolvable issue of <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>. I must say I considered closing this as "no consensus", but I believe that would have been unfair. All articles should be subject to the same standards. If this nomination fails, I suggest further discussion is conducted at the article's talk page before re-nominating it. However, <b>if this nomination is disrupted again</b> by personal attacks, rants about Wikipedia's ideology, or any of the other ways in which it has been disrupted above already, I <i>will</i> block the offending user(s), protect the page to avoid an edit war, and re-nominate it myself. I refuse to believe this might be necessary. We're all adults (I think). --<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Pablo D. Flores makes it clear that no criticism of Wikpedia’s ideology is allowed and he threatens blocking any offender. And yet he goes on to accuse us that, what we requested, amounts to the violation of the WP rule that articles should not be subject to the same standards (a rule that presumably does not apply to the administrators’ comments!) In fact, however, we never asked anything of the sort. We simply argued that for Wikipedia to survive, as criticisms about the reliability of the information it provides grow in the world press, it should change its own standards: i.e. a way has to be found so that primary editors’ views are not offset by those of secondary or tertiary –even malicious--editors. This is a bona fide advice. Since you have the power at your hands you can of course ban me but the future will show who is right and who was all along wrong! john sargis 9:16, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm closing this as "no consensus". The AfD process has been turned into a farce. I urge editors who voted above to come back to AfD, since I'm going to re-nominate this. I have blocked john sargis for 24 hours for disruption and seeming inability or unwillingness to understand what WP policies are about. --<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.

<li><b>Comment</b> Not that it's relevant to the issue of deletion, but the usage of this term to decribe human behavior hasn't got a passing relationship with whats natural.

<li>Of course. IMHO "insult" and "pejorative" are grossly understating the case.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Not a slang term but a quasitechnical term. I believe it was (and probably still is, statutes not being frequently updated) the <i>official</i> term used in police reports, legislation, etc. Not being a lawyer (IANAL just doesn't sound appropriate here!) I can't tell you precisely what the official definition was, but it probably had a very clear one (which likely varied from state to state and jurisdiction to jurisdiction). Could become a decent article if anyone wanted to research it. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:50, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

There are also references to "Whoever has sexual intercourse or unnatural sexual intercourse," to school bus licenses not being issued to anyone "who has been convicted of the crime of rape, unnatural act, sodomy, or the use, sale, manufacture, distribution, possession with intent to distribute, or trafficking of any of the controlled substances which are unlawful under the provisions of section thirty-one of chapter ninety-four..." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:27, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article is written in a style that seems more promotional than informative. Web searches on "naprotechnology" turn up only promotional sites from practitioners and news releases from the inventors of the practice.

<li><b>Neutral</b> - Hmm. I'm opposed to deleting things on the basis of the "red link" argument, since this is a wiki, and red links are how we grow. In addition, this seems to be a more clueful edit than the usual fare from new users, and I get the distinct impression we could well end up with biographies for some of these people. On the other hand, I don't like lists, and there are <i>no</i> links to existing pages whatsoever, so I'm hung on this one. Thought I'd comment, however. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobchurch_62ba.html" title="User:Robchurch">Rob Church</a> <sup><i><a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobchurch_99c1.html" title="User talk:Robchurch">Talk</a></i></sup> 16:25, 30 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I disagree, in that I feel lists are often good at-a-glance views of articles we have, e.g. " * John Doe (1912-1941), invented the cardboard briefcase." This clearly doesn't serve that purpose. — <b><i><a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture__f15d.html" title="User:Freakofnurture/"><font color="#006000" title="User:Freakofnurture">F<small>REAK OF</small> N<small>UR<sub>x</sub>TURE</small></font></a></i> <small>(<span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" rel="nofollow"><font color="#006000" title="User talk:Freakofnurture">TALK</font></a></span>)</small></b> <small>00:41, Dec. 31, 2005</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The presence of so many red links in this case is just another case of systemic bias. The <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Swedish_architects_2943.html" title="List of Swedish architects">List of Swedish architects</a>, which I posted a while ago, is also mostly red links, but I can attest to at least most of <i>those</i> names being those of notable architects (a few were architects unfamiliar to me, but taken from the Swedish Wikipedia). I don't really know anything about Estonian architecture, but when many clearly notable Swedish architects (including some of the most famous ones, such as <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferdinand_Boberg_b637.html" title="Ferdinand Boberg">Ferdinand Boberg</a>) are still lacking articles, Estonian architects are probably even less well-represented on the English Wikipedia. We will never get a category until at least a few biographies have been written, and hopefully the red links will encourage someone to write them - perhaps that is even the intention of the creator of the list.

<li>Estonia is a real country with real buildings, and picking a couple of names at random from the list gave me links to genuine architects (although one appears to be arguably more Canadian). Given the modernisation of the country (which is now in the EU), their architects will be pretty busy. So sneering at the article because of its title isn't exactly warranted. I suggest tagging for improvement is more appropriate than deletion, particularly as it is only a day old. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 00:22, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

I did find at least <a href="http://www.nba.com/fantasynotes_051222.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nba.com/fantasynotes_051222.html" rel="nofollow">one mention</a> on nba.com to his supposed curse, but I haven't really done enough research to come to an informed decision as of yet - no vote for now. --<a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBachrach44_302c.html" title="User:Bachrach44">Bachrach44</a> 03:06, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Abstain</b> I'm the creator of the page, and I can assure you that I didn't make it up. &#160;:) This particular curse is oft-discussed among NBA fans, particularly of the teams Abdur-Rahim has played for. (Like articles on the <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curse_of_the_Bambino_ba27.html" title="Curse of the Bambino">Curse of the Bambino</a> and other more well-known hexes in sports, this article does not attempt to take a stand on whether the curse is <i>correct</i>, only to document a phenomenon in NBA fandom and sporting culture). That said--and this is why I abstain rather than vote keep on a page I have created--<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> remains an issue. While sportswriters and others have made throwaway comments on the curse in articles on other topics, and message boards (an unacceptable source, for sure--aggregating the commentary in message boards, if we accept their contents as valid, strikes me as original research) contain reams of info on the topic, nobody of note has written <i>about</i> the curse in any detail--at least that I can find. For that reason, I abstain and wish the community consensus to decide if what's out there is sufficient to meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. --<a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEngineerScotty_c6c0.html" title="User:EngineerScotty">EngineerScotty</a> 03:22, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

Currently the page has a brief mention of the curse, but I think a section would be apropriate.

<p>It was a noble concept, but there have been too many computer viruses to list on one singular page since about 1992.

<li><b>Comment</b>: List format good, but needs bot help. I like what happened to the very first 'A' viruses in the listing: snippets of their articles (which usually don't have much information anyways) are in the list and the result is something I think is very pleasing to skim. It's just not nice to force editors to do the additional work of manually updating article info to the listing; this is something bot editors should be doing for us. If there is a virus listing at all, it also makes sense to break the list up into many small chunks by name, like what the <a href="http://www.probertencyclopaedia.com/L2.HTM" class="external text" title="http://www.probertencyclopaedia.com/L2.HTM" rel="nofollow">Probert Encyclopedia</a> does, again something for bots. No complete listing of any form of nastyware will ever be achieved, but maintaining some well-formed documentation in list format is something I believe is not only interesting to the casual reader but also can be implemented gracefully with a little disciplined help from bots. If it's needed, I'd be happy to help with getting the bots started. <a href="../../../a/-/d/User%7EA-Day_b428.html" title="User:A-Day">A-Day</a> 07:30, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: It would be a shame to throw away all the hard work that went into making this list. I use it to know what articles to write next. Researching the <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraxas_%28computer_virus%29.html" title="Abraxas (computer virus)">Abraxas (computer virus)</a> has revealed a very interesting history of virus families, writers, and creation tools, though I wouldn't consider Abraxas particularly noteworthy in terms of global threat or media attention. This list should be used as a guide for creating several smaller and more manageable lists. Eventually, I see this article linking only to the smaller lists. <a href="../../../a/-/d/User%7EA-Day_b428.html" title="User:A-Day">A-Day</a> 00:15, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: a list is more appropriate than a category when the list itself has some meaningful order or structure that can't be communicated in a category. I don't think that's the case here. If there's a strong desire to see viruses broken down by operating system, we can always make subcategories for "Windows viruses," "Mac viruses," etc. It doesn't seem to me that this list of viruses differs a great deal from a virus category page. <a href="../../../t/w/p/User%7ETwp_3cd5.html" title="User:Twp">Tim Pierce</a> 12:32, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Not a neologism. If kept, move to Medical student's disease. A Google Books search turns up a book which in turn contains a 1964 reference, below. Assuming the reference is valid, to me, that nails it: it's not a neologism, it's recognized <i>in medical literature,</i> it was called specifically "Medical student's disease" <i>at least</i> as far back as 1964.</li>

<dd>I've now found three references in "the literature" that use the specific phrase "medical student's disease." Well, OK, sometimes it's a possessive plural, "medical students' disease." The <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_convention_b251.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming convention">convention</a> is to use the most common name, so if kept, demotic or not that's where it should go, with redirects as needed from from <i>nosophobia</i>, <i>hypochondriasis of medical students</i>, <i>medicalstudentitis,</i> etc. Hodges (2004) (see citation in article) has a section which opens:
<dl>
<dd>Medical Students' Disease</dd>
<dd>A similar emergence of the body in the medical classroom is illustrated by the so-called "medical students' disease" literature. This "disease" was defined as follows: "Medical students' disease occurs when, in the process of studying an illness, medical students become overly focused on their own bodily symptoms and may falsely believe that they in fact have the illness being studied" ... the first descriptions of medical students' disease appeared in the 1960s.

<li>Is there any guideline which would clarify the difference between a notable <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horse_racing.html" title="Horse racing">horse racing</a> track and a non-notable one? Because I'm frankly not too clear on how this is inherently less notable than a lot of other horse racing tracks — granted, it's never hosted the <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kentucky_Derby_fe94.html" title="Kentucky Derby">Kentucky Derby</a>, but if that were Wikipedia's baseline standard for inclusion of a racetrack, then <a href="../../../c/h/u/Churchill_Downs_a8bb.html" title="Churchill Downs">Churchill Downs</a> would be the only racetrack on here. Which it's not. What, then, is the baseline standard? How would I determine which of the 16 race tracks in Ontario (Clinton Raceway, Dresden Raceway, Flamboro Downs, <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Erie_Race_Track_20ce.html" title="Fort Erie Race Track">Fort Erie Race Track</a>, Georgian Downs, Grand River Raceway, Hanover Raceway, Hiawatha Horse Park, Kawartha Downs, <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohawk_Racetrack_a7ac.html" title="Mohawk Racetrack">Mohawk Racetrack</a>, Rideau Carleton Raceway, Sudbury Downs, Western Fair Raceway, Windsor Raceway, <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodbine_Racetrack_6535.html" title="Woodbine Racetrack">Woodbine Racetrack</a> and Woodstock Raceway) merit articles and which don't? The bottom line for me is, I see no reason whatsoever why they shouldn't <i>all</i> have articles, and no policy or guideline that says they can't, so I have to vote to <b>keep &amp; expand</b> on this one. <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> has nothing whatsoever to do with articles on <b>sports venues</b>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 18:51, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I don't believe that every college campus building deserves its own article, and the chances of this one being the most notable building called "Chancellors Hall" (let alone "Chancellor's Hall") is as close to zero as makes no odds - the article makes no claim for architectural notability, and the building is only a few years old.

<li><b>Keep</b> Yes, it's called "Chancellors Hall". It is a unique building on the university because it features the only dorm on campus with apartment style living. I feel it deserves its own page because Chancellors Hall is a feature that sets UWEC apart from other campuses.</li>

<p>Firstly, this violates <a href="../../../s/u/b/Wikipedia%7ESubpages_22af.html" title="Wikipedia:Subpages">Wikipedia:Subpages</a>. Secondly, a collection of quotes is not encyclopedic, and thus not suitable for Wikipedia. It may be suitable for Wikiquote, but I doubt it, as it is a huge collection of similar quotes that prove a point: original research. The creator writes <i>This page is required for <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> in citing that President Bush refers to "terrorists" as "evil doers" and "terrorism" as "evil."

<li><b>Keep</b> is my first impulse, simply because the reason given is patent nonsense. Finding quotes isn't original research; are we to delete every article that cites documents that the editors looked up somewhere? OMG, looking for the Gettysburg Address is research!

<li><b>Delete</b> ... an article trying to pass the notability hurdle ... being a "local finalist' for Star Search &amp; American Juniors is not notable. Being a "contestant" on America's Most Talented Kid isn't either. She wasn't a finalist, she wasn't a winner, she didn't go on to be "discovered" as a result of the show. Wikipedia is not a means to get noticed; its the other way around.

<li>Comment: Note that her imdb bio is an autobiographical entry. The imdb entry is for the 2003-2004 NBC show. The show was dropped by NBC and picked up by PAX. According to Mariah's own website, she was a contestant on the 2004 PAX show, not the NBC show. —<a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> @ 20:11, 31 December 2005 (UTC) (comments revisd for more NPOV ..—<a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> @ 21:02, 31 December 2005 (UTC) )
<ul>
<li>On IMDB, on a personal profile page, for the main/first list of "cast", the *first* year in brackets (displayed immediately afte the show name), is the year of the *show* not the year the person was on it. There is sometimes (not always) an additional note, which shows which year(s) the person was actually on the show. In such cases, both years will show. You'll see many examples of child stars, showing a credit on a show, with the only year displayed, being a year they weren't even born in. This isn't deception, it's just a default display option on imdb. Also, imdb does let in mistakes, but they do actually review changes before adding them (unlike Wikipedia). Feel free to update the article to make clear which version she was on, and how little airtime she had. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 20:23, 31 December 2005 (UTC)|

</ul>
<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
<p>My name is Mackenzie Moreau and I currently stand as the Leader and Minister of Youth for the National Youth Council of Canada.</p>
<p>I was informed today, that this contact was making false assumptions towards the NYCC on www. wikipedia.org. Because of this I have been forced to contact you, and assure you of the council's standing at the present time.</p>
<p>I assure you, that the NYCC is not a fake, unreal council, but in fact a well known federal council that has received recognition from various amounts of federal, provincial and municipal politicians all commemorating us on our future ambitions and our past successions.</p>
<p>Please feel free to visit www.newsdurhamregion.com - search NYCC or Mackenzie Moreau, and that should provide you with reassurance.</p>
<p>Our council is a full fledged youth council, that represents youth on a federal basis, and I do not appreciate your behaviour towards the reality of our youth, and I would strongly suggest that for future reference complete all searches before making assumptions.</p>
<p>Thank You,</p>
<p>Mackenzie Moreau</p>
<p>p.s - we are to receive our completed website within the month or so!</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> User Profiles are a fraction of the number of people who post there. It actual has had over it's lifetime somewhere around 30,000 unique posters. Ask anyone who has every played for some amount fo time either Halo game and they will most certainly know what HBO is, with the number of sold products between the three games(four if you count the Mac version), plus a movie deal, I'm thinking that HBO is known nearly worldwide.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Although the article is lacking now, halo.bungie.org <i>within the realm of Halo-related sites</i> is probably second only to the official website, Bungie.net (Alexa rank 4111), who regularly posts announcements on its forum. And please remember that Alexa only works on IE for Windows, and HBO probably attracts a more alternative-browser audience.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> HBO is a huge site that reaches thousands of people and has most definantly achieved 30 000 individual posters on it's forums.--Commander Demitri Wolf 18:40, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> HBO has garnered significant media attention, as Louis Wu has been interviewed by CBS. That alone is capable of keeping it on this site, according to the rules. Also, there are more than 9,000 unique posters on the forum, therefore it can be kept. No doubt. User: Shadowsniper689 19:16 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It has been quite often been stated by the members of the Bungie team that they post and frequent the HBO forums <b>more</b> often than their own forums. I believe that with that knowledge, it could be considered important.Masterskill 22:37, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> There is no doubt that HBO is and has always been the single most prominent and critical Halo fansite (and probably Halo website overall) since the first announcement of the game. As a longtime member of the Halo community, I can vouch for this without contestation.

</ul>
<p><br />
I have pointed everything out I think makes a case for this article's inclusion in its Deletion Review. However, I will restate, for clarity:</p>
<ul>
<li>The site is not just a <a href="http://www.gtplanet.net/forum/index.php?" class="external text" title="http://www.gtplanet.net/forum/index.php?" rel="nofollow">forum</a> site, but a reference database for the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gran_Turismo_%28game%29_60a5.html" title="Gran Turismo (game)">Gran Turismo</a> series of games, across platforms - <i>Gran Turismo 2</i> on the <a href="../../../p/l/a/PlayStation_3f6f.html" title="PlayStation">PlayStation</a>, <i>Gran Turismo 3, Gran Turismo 4 and Gran Turismo Concept</i> on the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playstation_2.html" title="Playstation 2">PlayStation 2</a> - including accurate <a href="http://www.gtplanet.net/index.php?categoryid=29" class="external text" title="http://www.gtplanet.net/index.php?categoryid=29" rel="nofollow">car list</a> databases (for all regions), <a href="http://www.gtplanet.net/index.php?categoryid=30" class="external text" title="http://www.gtplanet.net/index.php?categoryid=30" rel="nofollow">track list</a> databases, <a href="http://www.gtplanet.net/forum/showthread.php?t=53155" class="external text" title="http://www.gtplanet.net/forum/showthread.php?t=53155" rel="nofollow">race list</a> databases, <a href="http://www.gtplanet.net/forum/showthread.php?t=56522" class="external text" title="http://www.gtplanet.net/forum/showthread.php?t=56522" rel="nofollow">prize car list</a> databases, <a href="http://www.gtplanet.net/gallery/gt4" class="external text" title="http://www.gtplanet.net/gallery/gt4" rel="nofollow">screenshot</a> (mostly unique, provided by users) databases and <a href="http://www.gtplanet.net/index.php?categoryid=31&amp;p13_sectionid=4" class="external text" title="http://www.gtplanet.net/index.php?categoryid=31&amp;p13_sectionid=4" rel="nofollow">video</a> databases. There is also a user-editable <a href="http://www.gtplanet.net/index.php?categoryid=44&amp;p99_gameid=4&amp;p99_timetypeid=2" class="external text" title="http://www.gtplanet.net/index.php?categoryid=44&amp;p99_gameid=4&amp;p99_timetypeid=2" rel="nofollow">fastest lap</a> database for the games.</li>
<li>The forum section of the site also contains up-to-date, and, as far as can be independantly verified, accurate information regarding the upcoming <i>Tourist Trophy</i> and <i>Gran Turismo 5</i> for the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playstation_3.html" title="Playstation 3">PlayStation 3</a>, including some of the first video footage from the game's makers of features to be seen in future games. The forum is not limited to Gran Turismo talk either, though it's fair to say that this is its focus.</li>
<li>It can be argued - and I did - that <i>Gran Turismo</i> is the top-selling title (38 million units) on the top selling consoles (70 million and 80 million units) in the world. <a href="http://www.gtplanet.net/" class="external text" title="http://www.gtplanet.net/" rel="nofollow">GTPlanet.net</a> is, by the Alexa rankings, the most-visited site dedicated to <i>Gran Turismo</i> alone, netting an Alexa ranking five times higher than the official site (whose URL was included on a flyer inside the game box!). It can further be argued - and I did - that the method by which Alexa rankings are garnered (Spyware, or the Alexa toolbar) does not give an accurate picture when discussing popularity of computer technology-based sites, as users are more likely to be computer-savvy and less likely to have such software on their machine. I'm one of the top 25 posters at the site, and I know <u>I</u> don't have Alexa nestling in my system, so none of my page views are counted.</li>
<li>In accordance with <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, the site owner was interviewed by <a href="http://itg.filecloud.com/files/file.php?user_file_id=40527" class="external text" title="http://itg.filecloud.com/files/file.php?user_file_id=40527" rel="nofollow">RadioITG</a> and the site was featured, albeit a while ago now, in Sport Compact Car magazine (for some reason) in May 2002. Though I appreciate that these aren't exactly major international headlines, they do qualify as "national press".</li>
<li>I was asked, in the Deletion Review, if the site has influenced subsequent generations of the game. This is difficult - probably impossible - to prove. Game makers do not acknowledge outside sources of ideas, for fear of leaving themselves open to Intellectual Property lawsuits. Any instance of an idea or suggestion appearing on our forum then appearing in a further version of the games, while appearing highly coincidental, cannot be proven to be causal. However, it has been said that the game makers browse GT sites - and GTPlanet's Alexa ranking makes it the most visited. Again though, this cannot be said to be causal - merely coincidental.</li>
</ul>
<p>Much of the information on GTPlanet.net is generated by users, verified by other users and then "borrowed" by other sites. An infamous case on the site was of a car wishlist for GT4. This was misinterpreted as a genuine confirmed car list for the game, and appeared on a Brazilian website, from which it made its way round the world of <i>Gran Turismo</i>, often reappearing on our forum, posted by new members with the phrase "GT4 Car List!" and a very familiar 800-line post...</p>
<p><br />
Obviously, this can be counted as my vote to <b>Keep</b> the article (though it'd need amendment). Though this is an anonymous vote, I'm not logging into my Wikipedia account to make it as my username is the same on GTPlanet - I do not want this to appear as a conflict of interest, and seek no credit/blame for this article being kept or deleted.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> AFDers know I'm one of the harshest people around about nuking forumcruft - but this is a rare exception. A well-argued, coherent case for undeletion was made and I think this site can be an encyclopedic topic. Media coverage within genre, highly notable game, apparent large userbase, etc. Meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>'s forum criteria.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> . Firstly, there are two spellings of the name but the most commonly used one is Cindy.

<li>The human married the dolphin, but did the dolphin marry the human? A human marrying or claiming to marry a dolphin is notable only for its unusual form of stupidity.

<li>It’s irrelevant whether the dolphin agreed to the marriage because the marriage is legal in Israel.

<li><b>Delete</b> The concept of marrying a dolphin is utter nonsense. To rephrase it as "a dolphin marrying a human" is even more nonsense, since it indicates some kind of voluntary act on the part of the dolphin, which we can never verify because we cannot talk to dolphins. If this stood as an article, then someone could get an article by marrying their dog. The only thing notable about that is the petty stupidity of the human, which doesn't deserve a Wikipedia entry, but an entry in a place for mentally challenged persons. Besides, this sham is a mockery of the intent of marriage, which is companionship and reproduction, and raising children. A dolphin and a human could never be married. <a href="../../../g/e/s/User%7EGestaltG_2c15.html" title="User:GestaltG">GestaltG</a> 17:06, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> “Besides, this sham is a mockery of the intent of marriage, which is companionship and reproduction, and raising children.” Does that include gay marriage?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Different cultures have different beliefs. As you’re from Pennsylvania, I’m trusting that your steretypical culture (not nessessarily you) is against gay marriage. Similarly, some cultures will find marrying a dolphin unusual but acceptable. So to justifiy a speedy deletion based on your culture’s beliefs is to ignore other cultures. My culture finds arranged marriages wrong, should anything accosiated with arranged marriages be excluded from wikipedia? No.</p>
<p>I’m not denying that marrying a dolphin isn’t absurd, but surely it’s absurdity is one of the first real signs that marriage is becoming less important and is gradually become a mockery. In which case, the article IS significant.</p>
<p>Someone who is still at school might have an assignment based on the changing attitudes towards marriage (I’m pretty sure it’s a common subject for students taking Religious Studies to write about), this article would come in useful as it would show a change in attitudes towards marriage.</p>
<p>This article sums up the changes in attitudes towards marriage during this month. Britian’s first gay marriages have taken place and to top it all off a British woman has marriaged a dolphin in Isreal. Surely, signs of change should not be dismissed as asburdities and not included. Similarly, Rosa Parks actions during the civil rights movements were seen as “asurd” but they proved significant in the civil rights movement. Thus asurdity shouldn’t be a reason why something should be deleted.</p>
<p>At the moment those believing that the article should stay may be outnumbered but we have the stronger argument to keep the article against those who want it deleted. <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEnglishrose_b44b.html" title="User:Englishrose">Englishrose</a> 18:39, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Still Delete</b> I am not going to get into a big editorial debate with you about the meaning of marriage. My comment was taken from the basic definition of marriage, from college Sociology 101 (functionalist view). You might then state (somewhat correctly) that Western Sociology has a traditional Christan bent, but the elements of that definition of marriage have been accepted by the vast majority of human cultures (Christian and non-Christian and pre-Christian) throughout history. Gay marriage and alternative defintitions of marriage are only recent. If you want to write an article about alternative forms of marriage, or add a modern section to an article about marriage, go ahead, but using this "article" is not the way to do it.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Now, as to my comment, it was meant to be taken literally as follows. First, a human and an animal of any sort, let alone a dolphin, cannot reproduce because they are not of the same species. It's part of the basic definition of a species, look it up, from high school Biology 101. Second, it's highly unlikely they could share a "marital companionship." And if they cannot have children, it's not likely (even if they "adopted") that they could raise children. How could a dolphin participate meaningfully in raising human children?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, I don't see how you could quantify arguments for keeping it stronger than arguments for deletion, especially after admitting to the absurdity of this article. Your stated reasons why the keep arguments are stronger begs instead that you write or contribute to an article about alternative forms of marriage, or modern marriage, they don't necessarily argue strongly in favor of keeping this particular article <a href="../../../g/e/s/User%7EGestaltG_2c15.html" title="User:GestaltG">GestaltG</a> 19:09, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I don't think you realize the absurdity of what you are saying here. You are apparently saying that if a government recognizes it, the article is notable and should be kept regardless of anyone's ideas of marriage. While I agree that this debate is about whether to keep the article and not about the definition of marriage (and I only mentioned it earlier to show the absurdity of the whole concept, but I also told Englishrose that I would not engage in an editoral war with him here over the definition of marriage), a government in acknowledging such a marriage would be applying a definition. Further, you are then saying that if a government recognizes a marriage, it's a marriage. That is nothing but a backdoor argument to the "alternative marriage" agenda/POV that Englishrose was trying to introduce here. Further, the legal complexities introduced by such recognition would be just mind-boggling, and obviously you have not thought it through. For example, if the human dies, does the dolphin get his/her pension? And how is that handled? The whole matter is just absurd...but I digress. This debate is <b>only</b> about whether to keep this article or not, within the definition of "encyclopedic" used by Wikipedia. It's not a debate about the definition of marriage or government recognition of such. If the marriage has verifiably been recognized by a government, then it is probably notable, and should be <i>carefully</i> included in the article to establish it's notability and then the article for deletion debate is over. However, my sense here is that Englishrose, the author of the article, has it here for another reason, he has an agenda and is trying to use this article as a means to advance alternative definitions of marriage, and this is why I have resisted and voted for deletion of this article. Englishrose and his cohorts should not be allowed to use Wikipedia as a soapbox for alternative forms of marriage arguments, or to try to backdoor their way into it by introducing this absurd and non-verifiable article about an alleged first inter-species marriage. <a href="../../../g/e/s/User%7EGestaltG_2c15.html" title="User:GestaltG">GestaltG</a> 18:02, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Simply having an article that documents that this event happened does not push POV in either way. The reader is left to draw his own conclusions about the "marriage." Now assuming this is indeed legal and recognized by Israel (a big assumption, I must confess), it would be remiss of Wikipedia to omit the story. That the state of Massachusetts permits same-sex marriage is a fact and does not imply that Wikipedia endorses the act. If this just turns out to be someone who's a bit daft and a minister or whatever that felt like humoring this woman, then it's a non-event and deserves to be deleted. <span style="font-family:Verdana;"><b><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="color: #33C;">howch</span></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="color:#0F0"><i>e</i></span></a><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="color:#33C">ng</span></a></b> <small>{<a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHowcheng_f4d4.html" title="User talk:Howcheng">chat</a>}</small></span> 07:57, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: It's now been verified (with a citation in the article) that the "bride" concedes (what should be obvious), that there's no legal signficance to this wedding. So, with no government recognition, or claim of it, nothing slightly signficant happened here. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 09:49, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as not encyclopedic. <s>The legal status has nothing to do with it,</s> [I]t's simply another "humourous news story of the day" and doesn't belong here.

<li>Putting dolphins to the side for the moment, I suggest if somebody entered into a entirely new type of marriage, that never existed in the country or the world, and it was officially recognized, that would certainly be notable and encyclopedic. Non-official unique relationships on the other hand, are rarely notable, no matter how strange or bizarre they may be. So I think you're wrong, the legal status is very signficant. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 10:21, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>First of all, Merrium-Webster has no definition for "phylosophy" so I don't even know what it is, but possibly the editor meant "philosophy" and is not a proficient English speaker.

<li><b>Delete</b> as a copyright violation. The Wikientry is entirely copied and pasted from the "About the Authors" section of website linked in the article. This makes it not only a copyright violition but a vanity article as well. When you go to the website, it's nothing but an advertizement for books, with little substantial text. So this article could also be deleted as a promotional for the website. There are at least three valid reasons to delete this entry. Fortunately, a search of Wikipedia shows that there is no article currently for the other author on the page, Ahmed Baki. <a href="../../../g/e/s/User%7EGestaltG_2c15.html" title="User:GestaltG">GestaltG</a> 17:29, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
