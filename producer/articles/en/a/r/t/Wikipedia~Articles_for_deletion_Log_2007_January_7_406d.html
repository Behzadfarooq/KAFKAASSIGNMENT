<p>It is in german language, what I saw on interwiki it is just a copy&amp;past of the article from german wikipedia. Although parts in other language then english should be deleted, it is obvious that it is more then 90% of the article.

<p>I'm finding a couple sources here, but they are mostly trivial mentions.

<li><b><s>Weak</s> Keep</b>. This appears to be one of several competing standards for "business process management" (others include <a href="../../../b/p/e/BPEL_bf2c.html" title="BPEL">BPEL</a>, <a href="../../../b/p/m/BPMN_e3d6.html" title="BPMN">BPMN</a>, and <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unified_Modeling_Language_b552.html" title="Unified Modeling Language">UML</a>, which we have articles on). This article could probably be expanded to the level of the articles on the other standards. I'm having a hard time figuring out how notable this one really is between all the seminars and press releases, but it seems to be mentioned often enough and apparently Fujitsu has a <a href="http://www.fujitsu.com/global/services/software/interstage/wnew/pr120605.html" class="external text" title="http://www.fujitsu.com/global/services/software/interstage/wnew/pr120605.html" rel="nofollow">product</a> based on it. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave6_6c0a.html" title="User:Dave6">Dave6</a> 08:32, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The article was weak before and did not do justice to the subject. This standard is the subject of intense academic research. Not only Fujitsu offers a products based on this language, but so does BEA(Fuego), IBM(FileNet), TIBCO(Staffware), and about 2 dozen others. More important from a Wikipedia point of view is the number of open source workflow projects which are designed around XPDL. The office of the Deputy Prime Minister in the UK has sponsored a national workflow project which officially endorses WfMC standards (including XPDL) for all workflow projects in the UK. There is a working group at ISO working to adopt the WfMC reference model as an official ISO standard.</p>
<p>What is more important is the number of refereed papers from conferences or well known journals which speak of XPDL. I have included citations from IEEE conferences, ACM conferences, Springer Verlag books, as well as PhD and Master's theses. XPDL is a subject which is well woven into the fabric of the information technology industry. None of the citations are WfMC publications. I tried to restrict the cited articles to those that mention XPDL directly in the title or abstract. But there are hundreds or possibly thousands more papers that mention XPDL or WfMC standards in one way or another, due to the central role that WfMC has played in the area of workflow for the past 13 years.</p>
<p>Before you delete this page, please look at these examples for comparison:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../b/p/m/BPML_1044.html" title="BPML">BPML</a> - this is a proprietary language which was implemented only by two companies: Intalio and Sterling Commerce. The standardization group has dropped development of it. This page is certainly weak, and contains no proof of notability.</li>
<li><a href="../../../i/b/m/IBM_Web_Services_Flow_Language_0c9d.html" title="IBM Web Services Flow Language">IBM Web Services Flow Language</a> this is a proprietary langauge (not even a standard) which was never implemented by any party outside IBM. I see no evidence that it "has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself."</li>
<li><a href="../../../x/l/a/XLANG_fce8.html" title="XLANG">XLANG</a> was another proprietary language invented by Microsoft, and also was probably never implemented by anyone outside of Microsoft. I see no evidence that it "has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself."</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It looks like this list is going to be deleted anyway, and I only voted the way I did as I had just stumbled over the list and figured it needed time to be populated. I left a note on its talk page before it was nominated for deletion, asking for guidelines to be set to verify what films would be included within the list. With its current title, its obvious its vague (including the improper spelling). However, the other film lists out there should not be merely deleted since categories can "easily" replace them. Lists are able to include more information, easier to sort through, and can be easier to find, instead of going through several pages of categories. There are many film lists that are well-established and populated, however, there are other lists that are just like this one. Wikipedia is for people to contribute, and lists need to be updated just as articles are.--<a href="../../../n/e/h/User%7ENehrams2020_121d.html" title="User:Nehrams2020">Nehrams2020</a> 05:14, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

A choir that performs internationally seems notable. <b><a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Wikipedia:Notability (music)</a></b> states: "<i>A musician or ensemble (note that this includes a band, singer, rapper, orchestra, hip hop crew, DJ, musical theatre group, etc.) is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria:</i> The above is the central criterion for inclusion. Below are some criteria that make it very likely that sufficient reliable information is available about a given group or individual musician." Further, (sub-paragraph 3) <b>"Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country, (superscript 3) reported in reliable sources.

<li><b>Comment</b>, see <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>, in particular the requirement for 3rd party sources.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I don't see why there would be any complaints about redirecting these. The fact that these articles exist, and especially if you look at their edit histories, shows that enough people have visited these pages (via search or otherwise) to make redirects for each worthwhile. Comments like "Please do not redirect. These articles truly do not belong in any encyclopedia which prides itself on having factual content." I don't understand at all. Redirects are not articles, they are redirects. They also discourage recreation of the articles, and the edit history is preserved, both positive consequences. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 22:20, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete all three (and do not redirect)</b>. To address VegaDark's perfectly reasonable comment, the idea of a redirect is to capture a reasonable and/or likely search term about which there is information in the encyclopedia, just not under that name. It seems to me that if somebody was looking for information about the equipment used in America's Army, they would just type <i>america's army</i> (or, <i>americas army</i>, which is a redirect, as a common mis-spelling) into the search box. I find it difficult to believe anybody would type <i>america's army equipment</i> into a search box. -- <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> <a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoySmith_db67.html" title="User talk:RoySmith">(talk)</a> 23:05, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. These articles were split out of the airline articles since many of them are quite large so some guideline on what to split out was needed. The destination lists was one of the easiest to do since it can stand on its own. Note that this is not a list of routes which would be unmaintainable. The destination lists do not change all that much. If you force them back into the articles, then we will have to deal with oversize airline articles. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 23:26, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>I prodded this article a few weeks ago, but the prod was removed. This is a seemingly non-notable match contested by two non-notable teams in memory of a non-notable person; only two non-WP Google hits for the Cup. "Gareth MacFadyen" only gets 29 unique Google hits, including many Wikipedia mirros. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 03:18, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I should also note that the prod was removed by someone with zero WP edits to any other page, but the user gave a strong rationale on the article's talkpage and attempted to improve the page.

<p>Hopeless original research.

<p>The overwhelming majority of text in this article is unsourced. Worse, the overwhelming majority of text in this article is unverifiably vague, or simply false (e.g.: analytic philosophy is not identical to anglophone philosophy, and continental philosophy by that name is primarily practiced in anglophone philosophy departments). Numerous discussions on the talk page have made it clear that this page is essentially a piece of original research by User:Lucas. <a href="../../../2/7/1/User%7E271828182.html" title="User:271828182">271828182</a> 04:02, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>The book that is <i>cited by the article</i> is not only subtitled "Comparing Analytic and Continental Philosophy", it also has a chapter on the subject of "On the Analytic-Continental Divide in philosophy" that runs to 42 pages. Then there are:
<ul>
<li>page 11 of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 3937202366</a> — where Simons argues that Austrian philosophy is "geographically continental" but "in content and tenor analytic"</li>
<li>the two chapters of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0415162513</a> — chapter 5 where Sacks examines the two traditions' approaches to a single subject and chapter 3 where Ross argues that the analytic/continential dichotomy is incorrect</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0631221255</a> — where Solomon discusses the twain on page 1</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0415242096</a> — which discusses and critiques "Rorty's attempt to restore the peace" on pages 14 to 17</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0748624716</a> — where Glendinning argues, like Ross, that the analytic/continential dichotomy is incorrect</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And those are just for starters. There are <i>plenty</i> of sources on this subject to be used, both that describe the idea of the split and that argue against it.

<li><b>Comment.</b> While there are sources on the general topic of analytic and continental styles of philosophy, that has little to do with the issue at hand, which is <i>the article</i> in question. The article makes no reference to the sources Uncle G mentions (aside from one book), and the overwhelming majority of the claims in the article would be quite difficult to trace to such sources, owing to their vagueness or falsity. Crucially, the entire article is premised on a strongly POV assumption that the titular divide exists as a sharp distinction, capable of yielding the (unsourced) blanket generalizations made in practically every line of the article. An article needing cleanup "generally requires only editing skills" -- but this article would have to be rewritten almost from scratch, quite likely including the title. And as the history of this article shows, such a global revision would likely provoke a series of reverts and edit wars that would tax the patience or sanity of all but the saintliest of Wikipedians. Given these fundamental problems of verifiability and POV original research, this article is beyond mere cleanup. <a href="../../../2/7/1/User%7E271828182.html" title="User:271828182">271828182</a> 04:03, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment. on 271828182's comment above</b>To say it is beyond cleanup and should be deleted means you must deny the premise of the book which is called, as noted by Uncle G above: "Comparing Analytic and Continental Philosophy". You should also go to the pages <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_Philosophy_ecd8.html" title="Continental Philosophy">Continental Philosophy</a> and Analytic Philsophy and suggest they be deleted too since you deny such a divide exists. Given the divide and that neither of the two mentioned above pages can satisfy the requirment of an unbiased article we need a page to details the historical course of this schism (as Rorty calls it) and also provide some clarity to the huge amount of confusion that results in philosophy because of this split. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> 14:46, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>There is nothing wrong with Anglophone/Analytic philosophy and it is not bigoted but <i>de facto</i>. Suggest the name also is kept, it balances any accusation of bias, since nor is the word Continental, used by the continental Philosophers, who tend to use Anglophone to refer to U.S./British philosophy that is called by themselves Analytic. No one said Analytic was identical with Anglophone but they are often used nowadays interchangeably. There are sources there too, in all thirteen pblished philosophers. Nor is there "evidence on the talk page" that this is original or unsourced. One comment on the talk pages suggest it is the best article they have read in philosophy. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> 22:30, 7 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. First: there are three references, not thirteen. I'm not sure exactly where the latter number came from. Second: in any case, if Analytic philosophy is not meant to be paired with the Anglophone ethnicity in any rigid way, then this should not be suggested by the forward slash. Hence the requirement for moving the article. Third: there is a contingent historical connection between Anglophone countries and analytic philosophy that no-one will deny. However, if it is true that the two are used "interchangably" by some group of people -- an assertion which remains to be proven -- then it is out of carelessness, not prudence. Grad school programs at Northwestern University, Boston University, McGill University, SUNY Stony Brook, among many other so-called "Anglo" universities, presently emphasize an interdisciplinary education which is versed in both in continental and analytic forms. Moreover, I'm sure that the Polish logicians would be rather surprised to hear about the latent anglo-analytic suggestion (for one). <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucidish_7b10.html" title="User:Lucidish">{ Ben S.

<li><b>Comment</b> The thirteen I referred to were the number of top line philosophers who wrotes essays in the book called "A House Divided". But it even took them 50 years before coming to that book, since as Rorty suggests it was in the 50s that the "take over" of English language philosophy schools occurred by the Analytic philosophers. Yet even these 13 are not the only ones who refer to this divide, it is also remarked upon by many others.</li>
<li>The issue of using the term Anglophone is a little complicated but mainly under an accusation of Anglophone bias the words used by Continentals for themselves is not Continental, they are labelled as such by Analytics. However, Analytics call themselves Analytic. So we have to add a word that Continentals use for Analytics, that word is Anglophone (or do you know a better one). <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> 14:46, 9 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To be sure, nobody doubts that there is a continental/analytic distinction in the history of philosophy. The item under question is not that, but whether or not use of "Anglo" as a synonymy for "Analytic" is a bigoted conflation.</li>
<li>The ugly story of slight and revenge is not at all grounding for Wikipedia's endorsement of it. It is curious that anyone could think that such a thing would be appropriate.</li>
<li>My alternative word is "analytic", because there is no reason which rests in facts to conflate analytic philosophy and those of anglophone heritage. "Continental (metaphysics)" may have been a more or less crappy phrase, but at least it was <i>geographical</i>, not <i>ethnic</i>. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucidish_7b10.html" title="User:Lucidish">{ Ben S.

<li><b>Comment</b>The issue of geography is made abundantly clear in the article. The reason for the article is that neither of the pages on Analytic or the one on Continental are capable of giving an unbiased overview of the split. Though both of these article do say they are defined mainly as being in distinction from the other. The issue of parsimony is not meaningless, nor is reifying. The section you refer to on pejorative uses gets across some of the heat of the division. The urgency with which a few editors seem to want to delete the article completely even thought they never edited it, also tells of this blind-spot in wiki philosophy. Anglophone seems to be the keyword here, Analytics do not like it, it seems, but why do you not like being "Anglophone", is it self-disgust or what? As to insulting those on the Continent who do Analytic in French, for example, I would say it is not insulting but a reality most of them have to read the major Analytic philosophers and they are mainly in English. Again we try to give a general sense of this divide without the one-to-one accuracy of terms that certain, mainly Analytic people, believe exists.</li>

If "most of them have to read the major Analytic philosophers", then that provides grounds for the opposite conclusions. And analytic texts, like all texts, are translated into other tongues. Those that originate in English, may be translated into French.

<li><b>Delete.</b> The title is obviously inappropriate. Indeed, the citation to Rorty which Lucas keeps mentioning is one I provided to demonstrate that analytic philosophy is something Anglophone philosophy departments started doing at some point in their history. Previously, they did something ELSE (mainly neo-Hegelianism), and they did it anglophonically. Furthermore, analytic philosophy has its most important roots in German-language philosophy - Frege, Wittgenstein, Carnap.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have argued for deletion in the Talk section. I have also attempted to make changes - which really means deleting the many errors and leaving little substance (e.g. the "Schism" section), but the main author simply reverts. Even the "endorsement" mentions that there are "blatant formal errors"! There is nothing here which could not be covered in a couple of accurate sentences in the Continental and Analytic main articles. <a href="../../../k/d/_/User%7EKD_Tries_Again_8f08.html" title="User:KD Tries Again">KD</a></p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: One amusing feature of this discussion is that as a prominent non-analytic anglophone philosopher, Rorty himself is an excellent counter-example to the title's conflation. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECHE_35ad.html" title="User:CHE">CHE</a> 04:42, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. This particular article is mainly an original-research essay and should not exist, and furthermore <i>nothing</i> should exist at the title "Analytic/Anglophone and Continental Philosophy".

<li><b>Weak delete</b> as OR essay. I know little about the issue, but I recognise that with blanket statements like "Continental and Analytic philosophers tend to ignore one another", this is one poor article. The topic is clearly notable, though. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 22:52, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Well they do "tend to ignore one another"! Wake up and read the reference material or any entrenched Analytic or Continental philosopher, you will not seem them mention philosophers other than those in their own side of the schism, anyhow the statement is backed up by a reference. Searle remarked the attidude of Analytic to postmodernism is that "most of this stuff just passes them by, they wonder, why waste my time attackingit".</li>
<li>I really do not know from where this move to delete the article rather than rename it, the article has been the work of over 40 editors over only a few months, there are 7 references to books and journals by leading philosophers which is even better than the intro to the main wiki philosophy page! Not only this but the page has to resist trained minions who can only see Analytic or Continental philosophy but never both.</li>
<li>By the way, the page was called just "Analytic and Continental Philosophy", we could rename it to this if required. The reason Anglophone was added to the name I explained above, such reasons no one seems to refute, since balance is the key to this article. However, I added an extra caveat in the article on the much disliked word, "Anglophone." --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> 09:05, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Come on, I have given any number of reasons to "refute" the new title on the Talk Page. (1) "Anglophone" just means English-speaking, which Wittgenstein, Frege, Carnap and the rest of the Vienna Circle, and countless lesser analytic philosophers were not (I mean, of course, they didn't write English as their first language). (2) As the Rorty quote makes clear, Anglophone philosophy departments existed for a century or so without teaching analytic philosophy. (3) As has been pointed out endlessly on the Talk page, and here, both these kinds of philosophy are done by Anglophone and non-Anglophone philosophers. The title has to change. As for re-writing, the main part of the article is a series of comparative sections (X vs Y). All of these are just wrong - they need to come out. The schism section has only a couple of arguably relevant entries. The rest needs to be deleted. Then just try to read what's left ("At times parsimoniously reifying concepts that are, in fact, more complexly related.") An entirely new article could be written, but I'd recommend a few, consistent sentences in the existing articles for Analytic and Continental (with balanced comments on the philosophers who have tried to understand both traditions: Dummett, Ryle, etc). As for "trained minions who can only see Analytic or Continental philosophy but never both", my undergraduate philosophy degree is from an Anglophone, analytic Philosophy Department, where I specialised in Wittgenstein; my postgraduate was based on Heidegger and Nietzsche. So I do both - which is not as freakish as this article implies. Note also that a bunch of references were added only after the article was threatened with deletion: it's not clear that the content of the article was based on that material - indeed, given the errors in the article it seems unlikely. <a href="../../../k/d/_/User%7EKD_Tries_Again_8f08.html" title="User:KD Tries Again">KD</a></li>
<li>Yes you have given reasons but they do not refute this use of the word. (1) Anglophone connotes more than one thing (2) Rorty makes clear the Anglophone was "taken over" in the 50s and remains taken over by Analytic philosophy. When a country is conquered the flag is changed. (3) I remind you each time that the artcile makes it clear that Analytic also takes place in Italy etc. and that when they read they must read alot of English, you can't do Analytic without Anglophone otherwise you can't read all the latest Analytic stuff in the journals which is overwhelmingly Anglophone (4) The comparitive sections are backed up by references, they are well known differences between these two camps as illucidated in the 10 or so references given at the bottom of the article. By the way you obviously never read the referenced material? (5) It is based closely and with quotes on these references, most of which were already there if not so explicitly. (6) The article does not make out that doing both Analytic and Continental is freakish, Rorty seems to do ok and we quote him there. Ask youself why your degree was Analytic? and further why did you switch entirely to Continental for your postgrad? Did you learn anything, what was the difference? And if there is none why didnt you do Heidegger at degree level? Again if you spent a tenth of the time on the article instead of on the talk page and here trying to delete it, you might have contributed something to wiki. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> 21:05, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

For the record, I corrected the Schism section, and Lucas reverted to the previous version. I know when I am wasting my time. <b>The References</b> - as I said above, these were dropped into the article as an afterthought when it was threatened with deletion. It would be interesting to check them (for the most part, page references are missing). The reference to Heidegger (#6) obviously does not support the (false) claim made in the article ("Continental philosophy on the other hand tends to use the term Logic more loosely...etc). Ref #8 is easily checked too, as its online, and it does not support the text in the article ("each accused of being either, too historical or completely ahistorical").

<li><b>Overall Coment Prior to Closure</b>: The article is undoubtedly controversial, inevitably so, because the issue rises between both of the main academic philosophies. Since this is an English speaking website, Analytic trained people have prepondered and wish to delete it. Why? because it shows up perhaps a whole other way of doing philosophy that is at least equal to it. The same would probably happen on the Continental website. With multiple references and 40 contributors, to delete it would be a waste and it would be giving in to prejudice. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> 22:43, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>However, the bigoted title is very much grounds for deletion. Perhaps you disagree, and maintain the position that the forward-slash is not indicative of synonymy, etc. (As you know, I think this is an entirely untenable position.) But feigning innocence and confusion over this point on your part, making a variety of attributions of bad will, prejudice, etc. is disengenuous at best. I own a book by Lyotard. I am inspired by the existentialists. But these facts, far from endearing me to your position, actually motivate me further to clear up the error. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucidish_7b10.html" title="User:Lucidish">{ Ben S.

<dd>The whole point of adding Anglophone to the title was to even up the balance, since, someone had complained that it is unfair to call Continentals, "Continental" as they do not call themselves that. Anglophone evens it up a little. So the bigotry I must tell you is on your side (regardless of what books you read) and I feign no innocence: I mentioned clearly above that I see the bigoted view coming mainly from a very English-centred philosophy. However, the same I agreed might happen on a Continental website. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> 12:16, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>THis is the kind of thing which makes progress impossible: "You have obviously not read the reference to Heidegger, otherwise you wouldn't be saying that." I have a doctorate in Heidegger's philosophy, I know Being and Time like the back of my hand; he does not say there or anywhere that COntinental philosophers understand logic more loosely in terms of Logos. Both the references I checked were wrong; given that the others were dumped long after the article appeared, skepticism is inevitable. If page numbers were provided by whoever (!) inserted them, they would be easier to check. I removed the entries under Key Moments in the Schism which didn't mention analytic philosopher or philosophers at all. I corrected the entries on Carnap and Searle/Derrida, but Lucas reverted to the previous factually incorrect entries. I would like to see the article deleted, and I am not an analytic philosopher. It is as much of an embarrassment to both schools. An article about difference between analytic and Continental philosophy could be written: the current article has a fatally misleading title, and is something like 90% wrong - either factually inaccurate or meaningless. Those calling for re-writes nevertheless have to realise, from this page and the talk page, that Lucas will block and undo any editing which changes the article fundamentally. <a href="../../../k/d/_/User%7EKD_Tries_Again_8f08.html" title="User:KD Tries Again">KD</a> P.S.

<p>According to <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>, <i>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</i>. Further, according to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>, <i>a topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and each other. All topics must meet a minimum threshold of notability in order for an article on that topic to be included in Wikipedia.</i> This article is nothing but a trivial collection of quite useless information, and it most definitely has not been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Uh, I fail to see your point there - <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_House_episodes_22f4.html" title="List of House episodes">List of House episodes</a> has not been nominated for deletion, and even though I don't think lists of the sort are worthy of inclusion here I wouldn't bother nominating them.

<li>Well, in the FLC a couple users said that the episode list would be much more complete with the diagnoses in it. As the episode list uses a fixed template, {{<a href="../../../e/p/i/Template%7EEpisode_list_d7db.html" title="Template:Episode list">Episode list</a>}}, it wouldn't be practical to force it in there. A different user had gone ahead and made the article and its skeleton, so I made lemons into lemonade. <a href="../../../p/u/l/User%7EPullToOpen_820c.html" title="User:PullToOpen">P</a><a href="../../../p/u/l/User_talk%7EPullToOpen_782e.html" title="User talk:PullToOpen">TO</a> 04:32, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Then I suggest <b>merging</b> to that article, and well, a change in {{<a href="../../../e/p/i/Template%7EEpisode_list_d7db.html" title="Template:Episode list">Episode list</a>}} to allow these things. Or couldn't it be included in the plot summary? <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_5bfe.html" title="User:Jobjörn">Jobjörn</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/b/User_talk%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_2ebd.html" title="User talk:Jobjörn">Talk</a> ° <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jobj%C3%B6rn_1184.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jobjörn">contribs</a>) 04:38, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I could help out, even though I have no experience of it whatsoever. However, inserting mentions of diseases into plot summaries - that I can do.

<li><b>Comment</b> It will almost surely be observed that <b>merge and delete</b> (or, here, <b>delete upon merge</b>) is not a tenable AfD disposition in view of its non-compliance with the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The need for a cleanup is not a reason for deletion. Why would it be "inherently POV"?--<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarabinieri_1a8f.html" title="User:Carabinieri">Carabinieri</a> 14:49, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: On further thought, the points raised by <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarabinieri_1a8f.html" title="User:Carabinieri">Carabinieri</a> are very valid. Therfore, I would like to rather adress it's <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>, as I believe it constitutes <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. Although tagged (on occassions) with cleanup since <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_2006.html" title="April 2006">April 2006</a>, it still hasn't introduced one single reference.<br />
Moreover, I would like to further question it's <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> - what exactly is the "anti-german ideology"? The article isn't clear on that, and the very first two sentences appear to contradict each other: <i>a generic name applied to a variety of theoretical and political tendencies within the radical, communist left in Germany</i> versus <i>the Anti-Germans emerged as a distinct political tendency</i> immediately thereafter.<br />
In conclusion, it seems to me that this is a weak attempt to brand opposition to the concept of nationstates (as the radical left tends to engage in) as an ideology bent on the destruction of Germany. After all, our own article on <a href="../../../i/d/e/Ideology.html" title="Ideology">ideology</a> states that <i>an ideology is an organized collection of ideas</i> - this doesn't seem to be organized, a collection or even an idea. It rather seems to be a description of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-German_sentiment_99cf.html" title="Anti-German sentiment">Anti-German sentiment</a> as expressed by <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_people.html" title="German people">Germans</a>. And <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-German_sentiment_99cf.html" title="Anti-German sentiment">Anti-German sentiment</a> already has an article. <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_5bfe.html" title="User:Jobjörn">Jobjörn</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/b/User_talk%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_2ebd.html" title="User talk:Jobjörn">Talk</a> ° <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jobj%C3%B6rn_1184.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jobjörn">contribs</a>) 19:28, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>The anti-Germans are, however, a unique current in the German left. "Anti-German" isn't just a term this article uses to describe them, but rather the way this current describes itself. I agree that the page should probably be moved to Anti-German (left-wing current) or better Anti-German (communist current). Especially since most anti-Germans would indeed reject the term "ideology". But just like the need for cleanup, the need for a page move also is not a reason for deletion. There is no single anti-German organization or even a homogenous anti-German theory, as there is a large difference between the various groups and organizations. But there is definately a current in the German left, which calls itself anti-German. And it is definately notable: there has even been an article in the Guardian about them (<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,1859705,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,1859705,00.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>), though I have to admit it's not very good. Here is some more English-language information available on the net about them just so you can get the idea who the anti-Germans are: <a href="http://www.copyriot.com/sinistra/reading/texte/antigermans.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.copyriot.com/sinistra/reading/texte/antigermans.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2145701,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2145701,00.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, <a href="http://info.interactivist.net/article.pl?sid=05/05/03/1539243&amp;mode=nested&amp;tid=9" class="external autonumber" title="http://info.interactivist.net/article.pl?sid=05/05/03/1539243&amp;mode=nested&amp;tid=9" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>.<br />
Hey, I agree with you this article is not very good. So the solution is to improve it, and I would actually be very thankful if you could help me in doing so though unfortunately most English-language sources aren't much use.--<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarabinieri_1a8f.html" title="User:Carabinieri">Carabinieri</a> 21:27, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>According to <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>, <i>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</i>. Further, according to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>, <i>a topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and each other.

Perhaps some useful content of this article could be merged into the articles on <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halo_%28video_game_series%29.html" title="Halo (video game series)">Halo (video game series)</a>, but this topic is clearly not encyclopedic.

<li><b>Incredibly strong keep</b> Are you kidding? What does "indiscriminate collection of info" have to do with this. She's the second-most notable character in one of the biggest game franchises in the world. Cortana+Halo gets 240,000 Google hits.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Far from. As a matter of fact, I have not made any mention of references or a lack thereof in my mention.<br />
The question is, how is she significant? Is she notable <i>only</i> because of her position as a character of Halo? That's notability by association, and on those grounds Jobjörn Folkesson could exist because I am related to <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carolus_Linnaeus_b3d7.html" title="Carolus Linnaeus">Carolus Linnaeus</a> - a quite far-fetched analogy but I do believe you see my point.<br />
Has she been <i>the <b>subject</b> of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and each other</i> as <b>required</b> by <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>? Notice the stressing of <i>subject</i> here - that an publication dealing with <i>Halo</i> mentions Cortana doesn't do it.<br />
<a href="../../../f/i/v/Wikipedia%7EFive_pillars_e0d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Five pillars">Wikipedia is an encyclopedia</a>.

The latter mentions Cortana when comparing another video game character to her, but does nothing more - only her name is mentioned (twice).

<li><b>Comment</b>: And yet, Cortana is notable enough to mention. That "context" is not given in the last reference is a fairly strong argument for notability in itself; it says a character in some other game functions as a Cortana.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - First of all, current lack of sourcing is NOT a reason to delete an article.

<li><b>Comment regarding the objcetions raised above during my sleep:</b><br />
The first line of <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> is as follows: <i><b>Major characters</b> (and places, concepts, etc.) in a work of fiction should be covered within the article on that work of fiction. If an <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28writing_about_fiction%29_c9f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction)">encyclopedic treatment</a> of such a character causes the article on the work itself to become long, then that character can be given a separate article.</i> I suppose we can conclude that Cortana is a "major character" - even though the dialogue is quite sparse and that she is NEVER seen in actual gameplay (only in cutscenes, right?). Comparing her to <a href="../../../h/a/n/Han_Solo_1c62.html" title="Han Solo">Han Solo</a>, star wars hero spanning three successful feature films and the subject of many many comics, is quite wrong though. But rest assured, I will come to him too - and <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Luc_Picard_499e.html" title="Jean-Luc Picard">Jean-Luc Picard</a> mentioned above.<br />
The <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28writing_about_fiction%29_c9f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction)</a> discusses how an article on said <i>major character</i> should be treated. It makes some points I'd like to raise here:
<ul>
<li><i>In particular, plot synopses and character biographies should be kept terse.</i></li>
<li><i>Articles should strive to describe the subject matter related to the real world.</i></li>
<li><i>The article should contain no original research</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If all the above points are considered, there is simply no need for an article about Cortana, as it can never ever be more than a stub. You see, even if the <b><a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html#The_primary_notability_criterion" title="Wikipedia:Notability">the primary notability criterion</a></b> is ignored (the one requiring multiple, non-trivial sources dealing with the subject, you know...), it can under secondary guidelines not be written lengthier than a stub as
<ul>
<li>In-universe prose should be kept terse - at the length of a stub, I suppose.</li>
<li>Although the article should strive to describe the subject matter related to the real world, <b>there is nothing to the describe as Cortana has no relation to the real world</b>, unless</li>
<li><a href="../../../o/r/i/Wikipedia%7EOriginal_research_757d.html" title="Wikipedia:Original research">Wikipedia:Original research</a> is applied. Sure, it might be very very tempting to fill up half of the article with a comparison of Cortana and contemporary in-real-life <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artificial_intelligence.html" title="Artificial intelligence">artificial intelligences</a>, but fact remains: <b>there are no <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a> able to provide a basis for such a comparison</b> - or any other out-of-universe analysis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As thus, we might - and <b>should</b> treat Cortana in the same way <a href="../../../a/l/y/Alyosha_Karamazov_aacb.html" title="Alyosha Karamazov">Alyosha Karamazov</a> is treated in the example given in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28fiction%29_a12e.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)">Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)</a>: <i><a href="../../../a/l/y/Alyosha_Karamazov_aacb.html" title="Alyosha Karamazov">Alyosha Karamazov</a> is a major character from the novel</i> <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Brothers_Karamazov_f032.html" title="The Brothers Karamazov">The Brothers Karamazov</a><i>.

<li>Damn, people re-writing the MOS while I am reading it&#160;:( Oh well. It doesn't really invalidate my point - out-of-universe analysis and prose on <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cortana.html" title="Cortana">Cortana</a> must necessarily be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> except for the OoU depictions of in-universe Cortana, as the primary notability criterion of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> - requiring that the subject be the subject of multiple, non-trivial, third-party sources - cannot be met. So: while failure to meet the primary notability criterion may <i>according to some</i> not be reason for deletion, the very same failure concludes that an article on Cortana must be either 100% depiction of her in-universe appearances (even if written in OoU style) <b>must be <a href="../../../o/r/i/Wikipedia%7EOriginal_Research_3347.html" title="Wikipedia:Original Research">Wikipedia:Original Research</a></b>. <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_5bfe.html" title="User:Jobjörn">Jobjörn</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/b/User_talk%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_2ebd.html" title="User talk:Jobjörn">Talk</a> ° <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jobj%C3%B6rn_1184.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jobjörn">contribs</a>) 20:39, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Why must any OoU prose necessarily be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>? Who created the character, how the depiction was decided, who did the voice, other games the character appears in or was speculated to appear in, the role of this type of character in games, are all OoU statements. See also <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/halo3/news.html?sid=6149725" class="external text" title="http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/halo3/news.html?sid=6149725" rel="nofollow">gamespot</a>, which treats Cortana with more than a passing mention, and <a href="http://www.igniq.com/2005/10/bungie-reveal-part-of-their-surprise.html" class="external text" title="http://www.igniq.com/2005/10/bungie-reveal-part-of-their-surprise.html" rel="nofollow">igniq</a>. The character is a major character in a notable work of fiction, that should be enough to establish notability. Whether it has a separate article or not is then a question of length and summary style. Given that the "list of characters" article <i>alone</i> is 37k of prose and is <i>already in</i> summary style for a lot of characters, it's difficult to imagine merging this. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 04:37, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Note that the same version you quoted (granted, not a consensus version) also said: "Major characters in a fictional work or series of works are typically notable." Interesting, no? <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 22:54, 9 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, not at all interesting - the only major character in the Halo video game series is Master Chief. It's a game, not a movie or something. Cortana's participation is limited to a bunch of cutscenes.<br />
To adress your first point: the gamespot article does indeed not contain merely a passing mention of Cortana - it rather contains three passing mentions of Cortana. Hardly enough for the primary criterion. The <a href="http://www.igniq.com/2005/10/bungie-reveal-part-of-their-surprise.html" class="external text" title="http://www.igniq.com/2005/10/bungie-reveal-part-of-their-surprise.html" rel="nofollow">iqniq "article"</a> then? Well, it says: "Cortana is conspicuously the only character moving." and links to a picture where the silhouettes of the Dead or Alive characters are featured, all still, except one female, who is jumping up and down causing her breasts to wobble. Iqniq jokingly(?) suggests that this is Cortana as a guest character in DoA. Are you seriously trying to claim that as a serious source? Yes, I can see it in the article: <i>The gaming website Iqniq has on one occasion put forward claims that Cortana will be featured as a guest character in Dead or Alive, equipped with a large pair of bouncing breasts.</i> It's so encyclopedic it hurts!<br />
Furthermore - <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Halo_series_characters_5d2c.html" title="List of Halo series characters">List of Halo series characters</a> could, and should, be severely trimmed. Even if I could perhaps some time accept Cortana as notable, I will NEVER accept <i>Admiral Whitcomb</i>, <i>Gunnery Sergeant Pete Stacker</i>, <i>Kalmiya</i>, <i>Endless Summer</i>, <i>Yayap The Grunt</i> or any of the countless COMPLETELY USELESS characters listed in there. With those removed, and the so-called major characters left in, the article will be of perfect size - even including Cortana. <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_5bfe.html" title="User:Jobjörn">Jobjörn</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/b/User_talk%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_2ebd.html" title="User talk:Jobjörn">Talk</a> ° <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jobj%C3%B6rn_1184.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jobjörn">contribs</a>) 23:28, 9 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Now, this is progress. Iqniq never claims she would be so equipped, so that part would be WP:OR. All other mocking aside, that the Cortana character was considered for appearing in the other game would be legitimate "out of world" content for an article. As for the other characters you mention, you may very have a point, but this is not an AfD on <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tartarus_%28Halo%29_299b.html" title="Tartarus (Halo)">Tartarus (Halo)</a>. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 01:32, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Great thing. That means we have found one <i>non-trivial published work from a source that is reliable and independent of the subject itself</i> - as the guideline I'm invoking requires several, find one more and write them into the article. Then I might consider withdrawing my nomination. (I am not kidding.)<br />

<ul>
<li>Did you see the digging I did below, Job? Either way, you cant just arbitrarily say that Master Chief is the only major character. Halo isn't a story about fighting aliens; end; it's got its own plot twists, background, et al. Cutscenes are essentially movies, and there are plenty- you can't be saying that video games do not have the depth of movies. <i>Cortana's participation is limited to a bunch of cutscenes</i>- um... she gives you direction throughout the entire game... In any case, the Master Chief barely speaks five lines, (Two Betrayals is him at his wordiest), so your definition of 'major' seems limited to if he's a protagonist. <font color="#FF9900"><a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Fuchs_e635.html" title="User:David Fuchs"><b>Dåvid ƒuchs</b></a></font> (<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavid_Fuchs_fab2.html" title="User talk:David Fuchs">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_David_Fuchs_d754.html" title="Special:Contributions/David Fuchs">contribs</a>) 01:53, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I didn't notice those, actually. It is a shame that the first one is a blog, the three following are from some sort of forum, and the last one comes from <a href="../../../b/u/n/Bungie.html" title="Bungie">Bungie</a>.com. (I'll comment further on them below.)<br />
But as you say, either way, my argumentation isn't really based on whether Cortana and/or Master Chief are major characters or not (as I see it, the plot IS a story of fighting aliens), but on whether an article on Cortana is warranted per the "primary notability criterion" (the one requiring <i>multiple non-...</i> you know the rest). This AfD has for my part raised doubts over whether the "primary" of "primary notability criterion" actually means it is the PRIMARY notability criterion or if it's just there to make it sound cool. (Like the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_Directive_6a6d.html" title="Prime Directive">Prime Directive</a> which undeniably sounds cool.

<li>Following the abrupt end of Halo 2, it was unclear if Cortana had been corrupted by the Gravemind or had been destroyed altogether. "Given the variety of character and story arcs at the end of Halo 2, we wanted to boil down our announcement to a few key threads," he said. "Cortana and the Chief being a galaxy apart is a situation we haven't seen before, and is something that is a powerful component to Halo 3. We are using her transmissions in the demo to give the viewer a few subtle clues to her situation and state of mind, without revealing any specifics we want to save for the game itself."</li>

<li>Five years SHOULD be enough to establish notability. If not, delete and re-write when notability has been established. While it may be true that Cortana is the subject of a lot of fan discussion, that doesn't establish it's notability, as the notability guideline explicitly requires published works.

<li>Well, I do know swedish, and as thus I read through the first one. Sadly, it does not discuss Cortana's involvement in the plot: Cortana's role in the essay consists of a bunch of plot summaries for 1) the game, 2) every single level in the game and 3) herself. While the third one, the description of Cortana, could provide some interesting insight, it does not (my translation): <i>Pillar of Autumn's artificial intelligence. The AI runs the ship and navigation per the captain's orders. Takes the form of a hologram picturing a woman with short blonde hair in a circuit board suit. She can enter all computer systems you run into in the game and take care of information. She works both as character in the movie sequences and guide during the gaming sequences. By communicating with other entities and actively seeking information that she then shares with the gaming character she often works as a narrator.</i> The only thing remotely interesting in there is the last sentence. It could very well be included in a shortened List of Halo characters article.<br />
Hey, it turns out the second one is danish. As a Swede, I can read danish to some extent. The analysis is practically the exact same as the one in Swedish, and the Cortana part reads (my translation): ~<i>Cortana is an artificial intelligence, used to run the respective systems of Pillar of Autumn. In addition to this, she is an important part of the ship's navigation system, and it is the Master Chief's task to make sure that she doesn't fall into enemy hands.</i> While this doesn't contain anything of use, it does later on say that Cortana is related to the narrating AI of bungie game Marathon - the only thing of interest to us in this essay.<br />
Well, my conclusion remains: this article should be <b>deleted</b> and interesting contents should be inserted into the list of halo characters article. <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_5bfe.html" title="User:Jobjörn">Jobjörn</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/b/User_talk%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_2ebd.html" title="User talk:Jobjörn">Talk</a> ° <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jobj%C3%B6rn_1184.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jobjörn">contribs</a>) 13:51, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Thanks for the translations and analysis. Bear in mind, though, that even plot summary in secondary sources is useful; many times, we have to rely on the exception in <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> that allows for the use of primary sources for uncontroversial, descriptive facts. And, even though Wikipedia is not a collection for plot summaries, inclusion of <i>some</i> plot summary is necessary for a comprehensiveness — at least, this is the interpretation held by most people who frequwently participate in evaluating <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">featured article candidates</a>. I don't really have an objection to a merge, though. As a note, though, if you do favor a merge, bear in mind that "delete and merge" violates the terms of the <a href="../../../g/f/d/WP%7EGFDL_b1b2.html" title="WP:GFDL">GFDL</a>, in that any text merged needs to have its edit history kept somewhere; this is usually done through keeping the old article as a redirect to the target. "Merge and redirect" is fine. If this is closed as kept, there isn't really a proscription against continuing discussion of "separate article versus merger" on talk pages. — <a href="../../../t/k/d/User%7ETKD_6306.html" title="User:TKD">TKD</a>::<b><a href="../../../t/k/d/User_talk%7ETKD_73cb.html" title="User talk:TKD">Talk</a></b> 04:47, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Wikipedia procedures are odd. As I find it hard to believe any consensus would ever arise on deleting the article WITHOUT including Cortana in the list of characters article, "merge and redirect" is my desired outcome. To me, deleting does in practice mean setting up a redirect - if nothing else so for preventing the article's recreation.

<li><b>Comment:</b> How is she not notable? She's not a character you see or hear only two times during Halo, or Halo 2, unlike Sergeant Major Avery J. Johnson in Halo 1. I will admit I may have made an overstatement, but my point still stands that she is still a notable character. I however give you kudos in defending your AfD gallantly. I will also make another point that the Cortana article, as stated previously does need to be cleaned up and sourced, but this is not a valid point to delete it. <a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuillOmega0_94e3.html" title="User:QuillOmega0">QuillOmega0</a> 19:10, 13 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> As I suppose you have read above, I will not go on in great length as to why she is not notable - or, rather, not notable enough for an own article. But basically, it lies in the requirement of non-trivial third-party sources discussing the subject in question as specified in the "primary notability criterion" of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> (and <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>, to some extent). As it has been proven (see discussions above) that an article on Cortana can't go beyond plot summary (or <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>), I think she would be better off included in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Halo_series_characters_5d2c.html" title="List of Halo series characters">List of Halo series characters</a>, and that article to be severely trimmed (as suggested on that article's talk page, yielding no results). <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_5bfe.html" title="User:Jobjörn">Jobjörn</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/b/User_talk%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_2ebd.html" title="User talk:Jobjörn">Talk</a> ° <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jobj%C3%B6rn_1184.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jobjörn">contribs</a>) 19:50, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I believe that this is either never going to reach consensus, or it's going to end up a weak keep. Personally, I feel that in the context of this being a video game, it is unlikely that there are going to be professional, scholastically written articles like you seem to want in order for it to be kept. This notwithstanding, main characters are allowed an article if putting them in the main article would make it too long. I disagree with the concept that since this is a video game, there can't be main characters besides the playable characters. One, there are novels in which she is a main character. Two, video games can be considered interactive movies, and the Halo series is a great argument for that. It is a classic sci-fi action trilogy, with a plot, antagonists, protagonists, cliffhangers, and epic battles, and Cortana is one of the characters that holds the plot together. <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> allows us to give main characters a page even without meeting the general notability guidelines, and we're allowed to use the primary sources of the games and novels to source this where other sources miss things. Also, I feel that this nomination is on the borderline of being a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> nomination. I can understand nominating a character that only shows up in one game and isn't as important to the plot like Tartarus, but Cortana is one of the main characters of a massively popular video game trilogy. As for print sources, Cortana has a whole page write-up in one of my official game manuals if we absolutely need a print source, circling back to one of my reasons for keep: it's ok for writings not to focus on her as long as they include enough information on her from which to write an article. <a href="../../../j/0/l/User%7EJ0lt_C0la_0b17.html" title="User:J0lt C0la">J0lt C0la</a> 02:19, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Umm, I don't know which sources you looked up, but this shop IS the best known lokmades shop in Nicosia (perhaps Cyprus). It is a traditional shop and only mentioned so that people have a rough indication on where to get it (for example, tourists looking up the entry "loukoumades".</dd>

<dd>Since everyone is so keen in attacking this article, and they think they know better, I have removed the contents of the article which was 'contrary to policy' (again, contrary to policy), and I'll make sure I won't bother with wikipedia again. In fact, I've had a long line of 'bits and pieces of information' that can't be found in books, or google, or anywhere else, but then again you all know what you're talking about and Kyrillis is "non-notable". This will give me a good laugh. Now, if you please, ban my account as well because I'm acting "in a way contrary to policy". Nuff said here.</dd>

<p>Probably a hoax -- the island is claimed to be "newly-named", and it is claimed that "Due to the expedience of the naming of this island, it is not yet registered on the Google search engine." The extremely vague history of the island is said to be tied in with the "Northern Russian Tribal Wars" -- which, despite the claim that it is "a label that contemporary historians use" to refer to alleged historical events, gets no Google hits either. I wonder if that is "due to the expedience of the naming" of these allegedly 150-year-old events. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 04:38, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I think that it should stick because it shows the inital uprising of the Mahdy army and their takeover of the south and the fight for Anbar that was in the same time frame, the fight for Fallujah, Ramadi, Husaybah and other cities in the psring of that year. I draw paralels with the Tet offensive so I think like the Vietnam war article has the Tet offensive Iraq should have this. The spring fighting of 2004 had a substantial inpact on the perspectiv of the war like Tet did. Like Tet it was an uprising of insurgents all over the country at the same time. This article is not about a war but a series of operations, like Tet, in a war that were interconected and had a sustantial incpact on the whole perspective of the war. This is just one battle of the war not an article about the war like CJ said.<a href="../../../t/o/p/User%7ETop_Gun_a8ab.html" title="User:Top Gun">Top Gun</a> 21:45, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This was an important phase of the overall <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq_War_58f4.html" title="Iraq War">Iraq War</a>. It illustrated the strength of the <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahdi_Army_42e3.html" title="Mahdi Army">Mahdi Army</a> and showed how the war had changed from the conventionally perceived US vs Sunni insurgents to a more complicated US vs Shia militia and US vs Sunni insurgents and Shia militia vs Sunni insurgents. The only thing that should be considered in the future is not whether to keep this article, but whether the name is appropriate--it is a little unwieldy, but as the war progresses a better name might come up for this phase. Also, the Iraq war article needs more distinctions like this--for a 4 year war, there's little in the way of officially recognized campaigns beyond the various phases of invasion, occupation, insurgency, civil war. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../p/u/b/User%7EPublicus_830d.html" title="User:Publicus">Publicus</a> (<a href="../../../p/u/b/User_talk%7EPublicus_594a.html" title="User talk:Publicus">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Publicus_a4f1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Publicus">contribs</a>) 15:49, 8 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It shows how the separate battles during that period were connected with the religious tensions, the rise of <a href="../../../m/u/q/Muqtada_al-Sadr_bed6.html" title="Muqtada al-Sadr">Muqtada al-Sadr</a> and the Mahdi Army and a departure from the idea of battling against a foreign insurgency, and how the separate battles were connected with each other. It gives a summary and a bit of perspective on the Spring campaign as a whole, and I feel that it is a valuable article. <a href="../../../d/e/f/User%7EDefenestrating_Monday_720b.html" title="User:Defenestrating Monday">Defenestrating Monday</a> 21:51, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>—the scope of the article is appropriate (the period it covers is a distinct and important phase of the war) and it could not possibly fit entirely into <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq_War_58f4.html" title="Iraq War">Iraq War</a>. If it overlaps much with other articles, they should be merged to an article dealing chiefly with this topic, but the reason given in the nomination is unsound. —<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzy_n_12cc.html" title="User:Xyzzy n">xyzzy</a><sub><a href="../../../x/y/z/User_talk%7EXyzzy_n_2d1b.html" title="User talk:Xyzzy n">n</a></sub> 23:19, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> We should definately keep this article. as Defenestrating Monday says it shows how all the battles of this time are linked together, &amp; I feel this article gives a clear explanation for how &amp; why events occured the way they did with a level of detail often lacking in other articles. Also I feel this article, unlike some others, allow you to picture events from the viewpoint of the insurgents, particulaly that of the Shi'as under Sadr. This article gives us a valuable account of these events &amp; thus is more then worthy of being kept by this encyclopedia. Redfox24 03:19, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Per Publicus; it would be a error to remove the article focused on what may have been the turning point in the current war.<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreepsbane_2964.html" title="User:Freepsbane">Freepsbane</a> 03:44, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Weak Delete</b> Her earlier books show a peak amazon rank (for "The Way Home") of #232,909. Her homeschooling books may be more notable, however. Harvest House Publishers is a specialty company with a definate agenda, which may invalidate them as a source, they are not, however, vanity press. Her other publisher appears to primarily publish religious tracts, but is also not vanity press. The most serious issue for me is the fact that only one trivial non-publisher source is given for her. The lack of sourcing does not mean the nonexistance of sources, however, and I'd like to give the benefit of the doubt, but the new community precident, as derived from the AfD for 2, The Ranting Griffon, is that if an author is notable only to a very limited group or set, then they do not merit inclusion. I have to endorse this precident, seeing as given a narrow enough set of the population, anything could be notable. Sources would strongly help salvage the article, but I haven't seen anything so far that would indicate any more notability than any other minor author. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 06:51, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"This page is a guideline" does not mean "Ignore this guideline". We have to have some way of establishing notability. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is as good as any, and she doesn't meet it. Lots of people write lots of books, but unless they are notable outside their walled gardens, they don't belong on Wikipedia. Example: C. Stephen Evans has <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/102-7082936-0324926?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;search-type=ss&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=C.%20Stephen%20Evans" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/102-7082936-0324926?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;search-type=ss&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=C.%20Stephen%20Evans" rel="nofollow">"more than a couple of books published"</a>, but he doesn't get a page on Wikipedia, because he's still non-notable outside of his little walled garden. As to the nomination itself, please assume good faith on my part. Yes, I was drawn to CyberAnth's user page. But I did not go looking for things to delete. On CyberAnth's user page, I was curious, he had linked to Prairie Muffins and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Pride_3059.html" title="Mary Pride">Mary Pride</a>, articles he was apparently proud of. The point of linking to such articles on one's userpage is to get others to click through, right? And I did. And what I found were horrible articles, unsourced, largely unverifiable, and probably unencyclopedic. Now, what was I supposed to do? Should I have backed up and said, "oh, what will people think if I nominate these?" Am I supposed to ignore bad articles just because of who authored them? That seems to me to be a poor choice if I care about the quality of this encyclopedia. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 02:35, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>CyberAnth, it is not my job to explain the policies here to you. If you're unsure what "source independent of the person" means, you need to go ask at <a href="../../../h/e/l/WP%7EHELPDESK_f3d8.html" title="WP:HELPDESK">WP:HELPDESK</a>. It is the responsibility of the editor who wants to content to stay up to establish the notability and verifiability of that content with reliable sources. When you think you have reliable sources, show them, and the editors in this AfD can discuss their merits. I am not going to run in circles for you, however. You need to start with a claim to notability. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 02:38, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Coelacan, I think it's important to give CyberAnth the benefit of the doubt here. When I look at the sources, both within the article and without, I see sources that don't successfully meet both prongs of the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> test. Either the article is not independent of the subject or she is not a primary subject of the article. For example, the <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_Library_Journal_6b78.html" title="School Library Journal">School Library Journal</a> article cited below doesn't mention Pride within the article itself, but instead cites her book as an undifferentiated one of many. It only establishes that she wrote a book on subject matter similar to the journal article. <a href="../../../p/u/b/Publisher%27s_Weekly_c64c.html" title="Publisher's Weekly">Publisher's Weekly</a> and <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amazon.com.html" title="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> likewise only establish that she's a published author, not that she has "<i>been the <b>primary subject</b> of multiple <b>non-trivial</b> published works whose source is <b>independent of the person.</b></i>" I think she likely merits inclusion within the <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeschool.html" title="Homeschool">homeschooling</a> article, but lacks independent <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> that can be established by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> in order to justify her being the subject of an article. --<a href="../../../s/s/b/User%7ESsbohio_59da.html" title="User:Ssbohio">Ssbohio</a> 05:05, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>A merge would be a good idea. However, your expressed opinion is to keep the independent article. Is there more to the interpretaion?

That page is already quite extensive, and while it could use a little bit more information about religious motivations for homeschooling, putting mini-bios about every author who is influential in homeschooling would make the page even more impenitrable. So, why is Mary Pride notable? <s>Because she is notable in the community of religious homeschooling, having written notable books. The religious homeschooling community is a large and powerful one, not a small walled community that anyone can be notable in. She has been interviewed by members of that community (although I'm doing a really poor job of getting good links or interview transcripts from google) about her opinions. Mary Pride is notable ONLY as an author, so of course references about her are very much related to her work. The article seems to have put together actual verifiable information about her background in a useful way. It would be non-NPOV to put large amounts of information about this person on lots of different pages about her books or on the homeschooling page. This small, concise article seems like a very good compromise to me.</s><a href="../../../e/n/u/User%7EEnuja_0ca9.html" title="User:Enuja">Enuja</a> 00:01, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, okay, perhaps she doesn't belong on any other pages either. That means she <b>definitely</b> shouldn't have her own page here. That whole "<i>I'm doing a really poor job of getting good links or interview transcripts from google</i>" bit is very telling though. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lk</span></a> — 00:36, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I've continued to look around, wikipedia's <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quiverfull.html" title="Quiverfull">quiverfull</a> page has a min-bio of her already. But I've rescinded my position that she's noteable as a "homeschooling" personality. It remains quite possible that she's a noteable person in the american conservative evangelical movement at large, althought I can't tell which Google hits and interviews are outside of her organization. I did find google hits of interviews WITH her, it's just that the text of the interviews were not coming up. I changed my "keep" to a "weak" one, as there is quite an effective mini-bio of her already at the <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quiverfull.html" title="Quiverfull">quiverfull</a> page. <a href="../../../e/n/u/User%7EEnuja_0ca9.html" title="User:Enuja">Enuja</a> 01:20, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Turn the <b>Delete</b> knob up to 11, (or maybe should be renamed to <i>alleged</i> loudest bands in the world?) Would only apply to bands that actually drag around their own sound equipment, anyway, which hasn't been common for years... (why pay roadies when you can just mic into the house system?) Otherwise you're just measuring the loudness of the <i>venue</i>. Then there's the lack of sound measurement parameters... <i>129.5 db</i> at what distance? Weighted or not? Counting crowd noise? Indoor or outdoor? The article mentions "32 meters from the speakers"...but there's scads of speakers. <i>engineering analysis of the compact discs on which their albums are published</i> As in how, average level, what? All CD's have a certain <i>maximum</i> level, beyond that it's just digital clipping garbage, they don't work like <a href="../../../t/a/p/Tape_recorder.html" title="Tape recorder">tape recorders</a>. Sounds like Ashare is being taken in by press release technobabble, which, BTW, he didn't bother to verify as valid. You're right, Doczilla, WP ain't Guinness... you can't even trade WP for a Guinness, unfortunately and sadly, which brings the value of the whole concept of WP into question, if you ask <i>me</i>.. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 17:55, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Really sort of an essay on the "goodness of loudness" is my take on it, the claims made are based on pretty poor research, IMHO. Apparently someone did measure the Manowar concert, but I don't see (a) how the numbers were taken, or (b) that <i>comparable</i> measurements of <i>other bands</i> were made. Also, since bands don't normally carry their own sound re-enforcement gear these days, Manowar is sort of winning a one-band race. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 21:04, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'm not aware of how notable wrestling is or isn't in Australia, as I don't have much knowledge of it. However the crux of my argument isn't really anything to do with Australia, it's the fact he's wrestled in Japan for a mainstream promotion on national TV. That's at a far higher level than anything in Australia, and makes him notable in my opinion. With regards to verifiability, I'm planning to have a look at the article and trim out anything that can't be properly sourced. However I'm hoping that the reliable sources I provided about are sufficient to demonstrate his notability, which is the most important thing. Most of the content that isn't verified at present doesn't have any bearing on his notability as far as I can see. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 11:58, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It's been suggested to me that "Pro-wrestlers are entertainers participating in a scripted performance. They aren't sportspeople competing to the best of their ability in a contest of skill. Compare them to the actors section, because that's what they are" Without wishing to take a side on that argument, I'll copy the comment here and let people react as they will. Plus I'm not sure that BIO really covers actors outside of TV and movies. Perhaps a version of the professor test should apply: "Is this guy more significant than the average wrestler?

<li>The "average" wrestler would depend on definition. There's hundreds and hundreds of "minor league" independent wrestlers, and not many who are "major league". So has this wrestler done anything to make him more significant than the hundreds of others, anything to make him stand out from the pack? Most definitely, he's been to Japan to work for a major promotion and appeared on TV. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 09:28, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>(1) I object to the first sentence of the nomination because (a) "db bio" is jargon without a clear meaning and (b) "disruption by an editor" is irrelevant to the quality of the article, which is the subject of the AfD nomination.</dd>
<dd>(2) The second sentence is clear to me and pertinent, though debatable; however, is it clear to the authors of the article who may not be well versed in WP jargon? Would it be better to say "the article fails to demonstrate the notability of the topic per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, and does not cite enough references per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>"?

<dd>This is not a criticism directed at the nominator; I think that the whole AfD process is getting bit sloppy and cavalier. I realize that clarity requires more work, but AfD is serious business not to be taken lightly or in a routine manner.</dd>

<dd>The first sentence is jargon that perhaps should be avoided, but is simply explaining why the article has been nominated here rather than already deleted, and does not in any way constitute the "premise of the deletion nomination". The second sentence is the premise, and as you say, pertinent. It would be better if written without jargon, but surely advocating keeping the article because of the words used in the nomination rather than the nature of the article, is even less helpful than using jargon? It definitely doesn't help me form an opinion. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> (<a href="../../../j/p/d/User_talk%7EJPD_1389.html" title="User talk:JPD">talk</a>) 17:43, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Question/Comment</b> What went on exactly with this guy's deletion nomination as well as the others. I notice I can't even find my deletion discussion in my cont page anymore from the original. I believe someone argued that it was originally nominated for deletion (with other wrestlers from the same organization) by someone who had personal motives against it. Now I don't follow wrestling at all, be it American, Canadian, or otherwise. But if someone is nailing these things for some type of spiteful purpose, then I think we need to be more careful before nominating it for deciding to delete, as Kevin Murray pointed out above.

<dd>Ok. But as I said before the SLAM article I added (which is an australian sports online publication) has an article which mentions him and his career far more than simply in passing. He has a cult following (which is what I would call Indy Wrestling fans in any country). So while he is not very popular outside his circle, it doesn't matter. Popularity is not requisite for notability. And as I posted previously a yahoo search of his "name" bring up many pages which mention parts of his career. So I would say that he meets notability. The Slam article (Slam being a online sports publication of the <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Sun_f34a.html" title="Calgary Sun">Calgary Sun</a>). I contend that the article, the various websites, the cult following, etc. allow him to pass as notable, and have the Slam being varifiable, non-trivial w/editorial oversight on at least one account.

<p>Very little on Google is found using "coherence therapy" "bruce ecker" (quotes included), those are blogs, primary, or selling something.

<p><b>keep</b>: 'Depth Oriented Brief Therapy' garners almost 3,000 google hits, indicating that notability for the renamed therapy is already established. The premise behind coherence therapy seems very similar to that of <a href="../../../c/l/i/Client-centered_therapy.html" title="Client-centered therapy">client-centered therapy</a>, which has been very successful because it builds upon the perspectives of clients, rather than attempting to impose external control.

<li><b>Keep</b>, The original objection to this article was that it did not yield enoughs hits on Google. As previously noted, this is merely because the name of the therapy has been recently changed from 'Depth Oriented Brief Therapy'. This therapy is considered by prominent constructivists as the premier incarnation constructivist/postmodern theory. Those interested in establishing the credibility of this therapy should see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/102-0478492-3262548?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mozilla-20&amp;index=blended&amp;link%5Fcode=qs&amp;field-keywords=essential%20psychotherapies&amp;sourceid=Mozilla-search" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/s/102-0478492-3262548?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mozilla-20&amp;index=blended&amp;link%5Fcode=qs&amp;field-keywords=essential%20psychotherapies&amp;sourceid=Mozilla-search" rel="nofollow">Essential Psychotherapies: Theory and Practice</a> by Gurman and Messer. The chapter on postmodern therapies is primarily focused on Depth Oriented Brief Therapy. Without needing to buy this book, you can search within it from the Amazon.com link for references to Ecker. There are several chapters in academic books on this therapy including Constructions of Disorder: Meaning-Making Frameworks for Psychotherapy edited by Neimeyer and Raskin and Brief Therapy with Individuals and Couples by Carlson and Sperry. There are also several articles about this therapy in the Journal of Constructivist Psychology, an APA journal. Ecker has also given keynote talks at the Constructivist Psychology Network Conference, a conference of leading constructivist academics. The University of Memphis' clinical psychology doctoral program, a leading program in psychotherapy research, has a strong focus on training their students in coherence therapy.

<li><b>Keep</b>, the objection seems to be that maybe this is an ad, but i don't see anywhere on the page where one is encouraged to buy anything...granted that one can buy books about coherence therapy, but obviously there are tons of wikipedia pages about things that can be bought, and the people that are making them (one example of literally thousands would be en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_Folk). to me this reads like a wikipedia newbie's article on a nascent technique...as stated in the article it was pioneered in the 80s, which means it's not had much time to generate corroborative writings. whether the techniques work or not (to respond to the thought of this being <b>potential psudo-scientific quackery</b>), it appears to be a genuine attempt to describe the thing. if the wiki community's job is to evaluate the efficacy of the ideas being described on wikipedia, my *keep* vote changes to a *question* and we need get after the scientology and vioxx pages next. finally, if the page isn't written from NPOV, then edits are necessary, but deletion is a bit much. edit away...

<li><b>Comment</b> This article is a mess and need some TLC. The subject is a journalist (not really an author per nomination), and some of his articles have been about Wikipedia and controversy around lack of accuaracy in our articles. Clearly the refererences within the article to G-hits etc. is odd, but telling as to potential notabillty. Why is the professor test being citied above? I don't see any reference to a teaching career. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 22:13, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> There has been a lot of work done to the article this afternoon by the original author and myself. WP notability is not a rigid nor rigorous standard. This subject has won an award for his journalism, is a recognized expert who is invited to speak at hi-tech conferences, moderates panels, and has developed a second source of notability as an author and expert on the <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burning_Man_8f2f.html" title="Burning Man">Burning Man</a> festival. Along with this there is an assumption of notability that can be inferred from the hi G-hits. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 01:42, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

As for the book, <a href="http://www.dramainthedesert.com/project_credits.html" class="external text" title="http://www.dramainthedesert.com/project_credits.html" rel="nofollow">his contribution</a> was as one of three members of the "Prose Editorial Team" and one of over <i>30</i> "writing contributors". It is also the <a href="http://www.raisedbarnpress.com/products.html" class="external text" title="http://www.raisedbarnpress.com/products.html" rel="nofollow">only product</a> by its publisher, which appears to be basically the <a href="http://www.raisedbarnpress.com/mission.html" class="external text" title="http://www.raisedbarnpress.com/mission.html" rel="nofollow">personal project</a> of the book's producer, Holly Kreuter. He has written a lot, because he's a staff writer. He has a lot of Google hits because he's a staff writer for outlets that provide their material online. Nearly all longtime staff writers for the <i>Washington Post</i> or the <i>New York Times</i> would have similar Google footprints, for example, but probably also do not meet the current notability standards. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 03:00, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm not going to vote quite yet until i think about this one, but I want to note that <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>'s mention of the "professor test" (which is included there, not simply in the notability for academics) does not specifically state that the person needs to actually be a professor or academic. The article in question <i>does</i> assert that this journalist is an expert in certain fields, which would seem to be close enough to argue for it on this basis. I also note that the professor test, which merely requires that a person be more published than the "average college professor" is a fairly low bar (I'm going to go out on a limb and say that the "average" professor probably publishes zilch, or close to it...) <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 14:01, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - He doesn't seem any more published than <i>any</i> local reporter though (who normally writes a story or two every day). All of the "sources" given in the article are either written by him or merely mention him in passing, certainly <i>not</i> fulfilling the "primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works" central criterion. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 20:51, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wickethewok, the <i>"primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works" central criterion</i> which you cite above is prefaced with the statement: <i>"This is not intended to be an exclusionary list; just because someone doesn't fall into one of these categories doesn't mean an article on the person should automatically be deleted."</i> We have evidence that he is notable in other ways.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The references became confusing when they were moved into the footnote feature and the subjects were masking the more pertinent sources. The format has been changed so that the footnotes more clearly describe valid support for WP:BIO.</li>
<li>The most notable single item is his award -- multiple (two or more) awards or reviews would make him notable per WP BIO. Serpent disparages the award above, but WP BIO doesn't say that it has to be a national or international award. We need another award or review.</li>
<li>I think that we could to look at the Businessweek discussion of his expertise along with his mention/demonstration as an expert in game technology as a cumulative review by multiple non-trivial sources.</li>
<li>Per WP Notability, <i>"Notable here means "worthy of</i> <b>being noted" or "attracting notice"</b>, <i>not "important" or "famous". It is not synonymous with fame or importance. It is not measured by Wikipedia editors' own subjective judgements. It is not "newsworthiness".</i> This subject has clearly attracted notice as exemplified by the discussion of him online and many references to his work in blogs etc.</li>
<li>If I won't be chastized for citing blog material, I can give a bunch of references to his notability, but I have avoided this source. Most of what I'm hearing here is that we need to establish <i>"importance"</i> and that clearly contradicts the guidelines.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and continue the cleanup (which seems to be going well). Not every journalist is notable - showing up in the New York Times as a one-off contributor may not establish notability in the same way that it would if he were the subject of the article. But here the person seems to be a widely published journalist with work in major publications. It's possible in some cases that a person can write for one or two of these publications without becoming notable (if he were, say, nothing but a journeyman). But I don't think that's the case here. Given the breadth of publication of his work, it seems that he meets the WP:BIO standards. I think it should be kept, and want to thank those editors involved in the cleanup effort - good work, guys.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 01:18, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The following links represents the articles about Terdiman found in the first 6 pages of Yahoo listings (60 listings) on a search for “Daniel Terdiman”; there are <s>8</s> 7 articles which are about him rather than by him, this represents about <s>13</s>12%,. Considering the thousands of g-hits on hundreds of pages, this demonstrates that a lot of people are talking about Dan T. and/or his work.

<li><b>Merge</b> In the interest of full disclosure, I took 2 CAETEC classes when I was working on my graduate degree. That being said, I can't find an external source or article about this program, but I don't think WP:ORG fits here either, as the contested prod edit summary also said, since it's a department of the college of engineering, it's not really an organization but a functional educational group. Would you try to put WP:ORG to <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Colorado_at_Boulder_4fec.html" title="University of Colorado at Boulder">University of Colorado at Boulder</a>? It is the first google hit for "CAETE". Though it doesn't seem to be the first, largest or even claim to be the best. Thus, I recommend mergeing to the University of Colorado at Boulder article, with this changed to a redirect and even a redirect created for CAETE. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecu_ba9a.html" title="User:Mecu"><font color="#CEBE70"><b>MECU</b></font></a>≈<small><a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMecu_1c42.html" title="User talk:Mecu">talk</a></small> 15:59, 7 January 2007 (UTC) <a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecu_ba9a.html" title="User:Mecu"><font color="#CEBE70"><b>MECU</b></font></a>≈<small><a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMecu_1c42.html" title="User talk:Mecu">talk</a></small> 15:59, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> to UC Boulder. A college of a university, such as the College of Engineering and Applied Science at UC Boulder, might rate an article (I suppose). The distance learning part of sich a college doesn't.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Clayton Counts has been featured in Rolling Stone, American Songwriter Magazine, the Chicago Sun-Times, the Chicago Reader, Lumpen Times, E! Entertainment Online, the Boston Herald, Entertainment Weekly, and USA Today, in addition to more than 20,000 references online for "The Beachles." By stating that his "sole accomplishment" is receiving a cease and desist, you are completely ignoring the accomplishment that got him the cease and desist in the first place, which as I just mentioned appeared in many magazines and newspapers, some as recently as December of 2006. I will do what I can to expand the article, but it should be noted that this article was first nominated for deletion by Kurt Benbenek, who is an opponent of Counts', and who has posted here under many assumed names. He nominated this article for deletion as April Winchell, another DJ who Mr. Benbenek has attacked in the past. Benbenek has attacked many Wikipedia articles as the result of having his own article deleted. He has spent years impersonating music personalities and music historians like Otis Fodder and Irwin Chusid, and even Mr. Counts. If this article is non-notable, then djBC's article is, as well. It contains about as much biographical information, BC's claim to fame is also a Beatles mash-up record, and there are fewer sources and citations, as well. Notwithstanding that, I should say that I believe that neither djBC's article nor Counts' merit deletion. Both have been covered in the mainstream press, and both are likely to continue making records in the future. It should also be noted that Demiurge did not follow the appropriate procedure for deletion, and redirected Counts' article to the "Sgt. Petsound's" page after only a single day. This should serve as some indication of how antsy he is to see Mr. Counts' article disappear. Lots of artists listed in Wikipedia are less notable than Clayton Counts. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrevorPearce_3e94.html" title="User:TrevorPearce">TrevorPearce</a> 03:24, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Also, you are incorrect about the external references. First of all, there are no citations yet on the page, but the ones on the "Sgt. Petsound's" page clearly show that the artist was mentioned in the press well before the take-down notice. You are cherry-picking to suit your argument, and I can only assume that you're not a fan, but the only reason this mash-up received a cease and desist in the first place is because it had been mentioned in many mainstream news outlets. The fact that he's released only one notable record should not be a factor in deciding whether this article is notable. I will make revisions to the article, add citations. And contrary to Demiurge's claims, according to a November 2006 interview with Mr. Counts, he is signing to a label and starting one of his own. Your assessment that he is non-notable will only mean that someone will have to write a completely new article about him in the near future. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrevorPearce_3e94.html" title="User:TrevorPearce">TrevorPearce</a> 03:36, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>And here is what Wikipedia has to say about notability for musicians and performers:</li>
</ul>
<p>- begin quote -</p>
<p>A musician or ensemble (note that this includes a band, singer, rapper, orchestra, hip hop crew, DJ, musical theatre group, etc.) is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent from the musician/ensemble itself and reliable.1
<ul>
<li>This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, books, magazine articles, and television documentaries 2 except for the following:
<ul>
<li>Media reprints of press releases, other publications where the musician/ensemble talks about themselves, and advertising for the musician/ensemble.</li>
<li>Works comprising merely trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that simply report performance dates or the publications of contact and booking details in directories.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An article in a school or university newspaper (or similar) does not automatically meet the this criteria, but facts from such an article can be used to establish that any other criteria below have been met.</p>
<p>The above is the central criterion for inclusion.</p>
<p>- end quote -</p>
<p>Demiurge has taken criteria from the secondary list, even though Mr. Counts meets the primary criteria. If we were to go around Wikipedia proposing articles for deletion every time we didn't like somebody, I doubt there'd be any articles left. If you had proposed this article for deletion because it was insufficient in its citations, that would be one thing, but to say he's non-notable is another thing entirely. By the primary criteria, Counts is notable. Record contracts, chart positions, and the like are secondary. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrevorPearce_3e94.html" title="User:TrevorPearce">TrevorPearce</a> 04:07, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><s><b>Weak delete</b></s>. Fails WP:MUSIC by any standard except press, which is a bad start. Of the articles cited, the <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> one is more or less trivial, the Herald one is about the cease-and-desist order, and the AP one is 404. That's not enough press coverage for him to be notable as a news story, and he's clearly not notable (yet) for music. Willing to change my mind if more and better press coverage is found. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User_talk%7EBikeable_218a.html" title="User talk:Bikeable">(talk)</a> 05:03, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>No offense, but how is the Entertainment Weekly piece trivial? It adequately describes the record, is a positive review, and it is not part of a more general article, i.e. it is written exclusively about the record and Mr. Counts. But to say that the article fails WP:MUSIC, except for press, is denying that press is the only criterion needed to sustain its notability. It says as much in the Wikipedia guidelines I cited. (quote) It has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent from the musician/ensemble itself and reliable. (end quote) If he is "clearly not notable (yet)," when would he become "cleary notable"? That's about the most subjective call I ever heard. Being reviewed in magazines like Rolling Stone and American Songwriter alone makes him notable. The Herald article does cover the record, but even if it only mentioned the cease and desist (which it doesn't) it is a given that the cease and desist is the direct result of having released a noteworthy record. Otherwise, why cover the story at all? <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrevorPearce_3e94.html" title="User:TrevorPearce">TrevorPearce</a> 10:43, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I added some links to the Minneapolis Star Tribune, the CBC, and Rolling Stone. Go ahead and delete or redirect it if this isn't enough. Someone is going to have to rewrite it and maintain it eventually, mark my words. Even if an article is "about the cease and desist order," it is pertinent. Articles about cease and desist orders are really about records that received cease and desist orders, and in this case also about a person who made such a record. Demiurge mentioned that there were "no external references except those that refer to the album takedown notice," but the Entertainment Weekly article was written prior to the cease and desist, as was the USA Today mention. The cease and desist and EMI's demand for Counts to hand over IP addresses only add to this article's notability. To suggest that they take away from it is ridiculous. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrevorPearce_3e94.html" title="User:TrevorPearce">TrevorPearce</a> 10:43, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I'm not a big fan of music articles about obscure bands, but this one has caused enough trouble to become noteworthy, or perhaps infamous, via media coverage. Either way this article should be kept because there are plenty of independent sources of info from reliable sources. <a href="../../../j/e/h/User%7EJehochman_26e5.html" title="User:Jehochman">Jehochman</a> (<sup><a href="../../../j/e/h/User_talk%7EJehochman_9100.html" title="User talk:Jehochman">Talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jehochman_1c53.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jehochman">Contrib</a></sub>) 16:52, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also, how is press a "bad start"? According to Wikipedia, press is the ONLY criterion needed. That's why it's the "central criterion for inclusion." How is he non-notable, when the guidelines themselves read that an artist IS "notable if he meets any of the following criteria"? This article more than meets the criteria, and is therefor notable. It should be mentioned also that Demiurge is a contributor to the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mashup_%28music%29.html" title="Mashup (music)">mash-up</a> article, which leaves me with the impression that to him this is about more than whether or not Counts is notable. He proposed this deletion out of spite, which is not in the spirit of Wikipedia, then immediately redirected the article. From the Guide to Deletion: "You should not turn the article into a redirect. A functioning redirect will overwrite the AFD notice. It may also be interpreted as an attempt to 'hide' the old content from scrutiny by the community." I'm not sure if Demiurge was also responsible for removing the Beachles mention under "notable bootlegs" on the <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mashup_%28music%29.html" title="Mashup (music)">mash-up</a> page, but it seems likely. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrevorPearce_3e94.html" title="User:TrevorPearce">TrevorPearce</a> 13:26, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thank you for changing your vote, Bikeable. I'm not sure that the Rolling Stone mention counts as a review (any more than the Entertainment Weekly article, which gave it a thumbs up), but plenty of people hated "Metal Machine Music," too, and the Beachles record does have an underground following. Personally, there are some mash-ups I like better, but this is definitely one of the more original I've seen. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrevorPearce_3e94.html" title="User:TrevorPearce">TrevorPearce</a> 18:00, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'd say no. In the US "African American" is basically short-hand for "one whose ancestors primarily come from Sub-Saharan Africa." It doesn't include North Africans and Afrikaners are ultimately of Dutch ancestry. Although occasionally jokes about White Africans in America, like <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlize_Theron_7109.html" title="Charlize Theron">Charlize Theron</a> or Teresa Heinz Kerry, are made. Anyway one area where I just don't know is <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malagasy_people.html" title="Malagasy people">Malagasy people</a> as their ancestry is largely Asian, but they are the native people of an African island.

<p>Hi guys -- I don't think I'm nearly important enough to qualify for a Wikipedia entry on myself but I'm flattered that Rev. Moon follower SteveDufour created one about me. Nevertheless its claim that i'm an "unprincipled dogmatist" isn't really NPOV. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohngorenfeld_0721.html" title="User:Johngorenfeld">Johngorenfeld</a> 13:31, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - original nomination was incomplete and formatted incorrectly, so I've corrected (I think). I also removed the "unprincipled dogmatist" comment from the article which was inserted by an anon-IP, not by the article's creator. As far as the article, I'll have to think about this. I'm sympathetic to those who do not want WP articles about themselves, but I don't think that's a valid reason for deletion. - <a href="../../../a/a/g/User%7EAagtbdfoua_3bd2.html" title="User:Aagtbdfoua">Aagtbdfoua</a> 14:20, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think that in cases of borderline notability (which I'd classify this as) that a request from the individual to remove their article seems reasonable.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> in deference to Mr. Gorenfeld; I'd normally vote "keep" on this, because the ABC news and Washington Post coverage of him certainly suggests a level of notability that's usually acceptable for inclusion--but given that Gorenfeld states that he wasn't really the <i>subject</i> of that coverage--and because it is already somewhat borderline and the subject himself would prefer not to have it, I don't see a reason not to delete. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 17:58, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I've read the arguments below and the article as it is now, and I'm still not convinced of the subject's notability. He reported a story that got national attention, but how much of that national attention did he himself get, in a way that wasn't trivial? (I'd think just a mention of the fact that he wrote it is kind of trivial, unless the coverage featured him) Does just writing a story that gets national attention make you notable in itself? I admit that it wouldn't be terrible if the article is kept, since it's verifiable and that, in my mind, is the most important aspect of notability. I'll keep an eye on the discussion and change my mind if someone finds press coverage that specifically features him. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelldot_cc92.html" title="User:Delldot">delldot</a> | <small><a href="../../../d/e/l/User_talk%7EDelldot_82a5.html" title="User talk:Delldot">talk</a></small> 19:40, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Summary</b>:</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Reason 1 to delete</i>: The subject of the article requested it. This reason may no longer apply.</p>
<p>The subject of the article is a new user, and seemed in his early comments not to understand vandalism (or not to believe the inappropriate phrase was vandalism). He happened to see the article just afterward, but not before the vandalism was removed. He can verify that it was vandalism by unregistered user 203.59.166.123 by going to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Gorenfeld&amp;diff=99070962&amp;oldid=94520311" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Gorenfeld&amp;diff=99070962&amp;oldid=94520311" rel="nofollow">history tab</a>. Perhaps he is afraid that the article might be vandalized again. Assuming he still wants the article deleted, unless he comments again here, giving his reason (other than vandalism), "Reason 1 to delete" seems to carry little weight.</p>
<p><i>Reason 2 to delete</i>: Copyvio. If there ever was a copyvio, the article has been rewritten, and there is no longer any trace of the similar phrase or two that prompted the accusation. This reason clearly no longer applies.</p>
<p><i>Reason 3 to delete</i>: Subject is not sufficiently notable. Undecided.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelldot_cc92.html" title="User:Delldot">delldot</a> says: "Doesn't seem notable enough to me. How is this subject different from other journalists?"</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman">Alf photoman</a> says: "there is a degree of notability greater than the one of an average journalist."</li>
</ul>
<p>Opinions vary on this point. <a href="../../../l/a/u/User%7ELaurence_Boyce_a99c.html" title="User:Laurence Boyce">Laurence Boyce</a> says "The English Wikipedia contains loads of articles for little known journalists," and contributor <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Dufour_1d44.html" title="User:Steve Dufour">Steve Dufour</a> says "John was mentioned by newspapers all over the United States and was interviewed on National Public Radio and ABC TV for his role in reporting on the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun_Myung_Moon_Coronation_bbf8.html" title="Sun Myung Moon Coronation">Sun Myung Moon Coronation</a> incident." Others do not find these arguments compelling, but much of the discussion above has become outdated because of improvements to the article.</p>
<p>The template above says "This is not a vote." But I have seen AfDs where lazy admins seemed to do nothing other than count up the votes (which are not supposed to be votes). Why do we have a tradition of putting our conclusion in the form of "Delete" or "Keep" in bold at the beginning of each entry? Shouldn't an admin deciding the outcome be required to check for changes to the article and read the entire discussion, looking for reasons rather than votes?</p>
<p>Since I have to go along with this questionable tradition, I will. I hope admins and others who comment on this page will <i>read</i>.</p>

<p><b>Strong Keep</b> In the official fraternity history book, The history of Alpha Phi Alpha, a development in in Negro College life by Charles Wesleym 6th printing copyright 1929,1950. Charles C Poindexter is mentioned on pages 24,26,28,30,32,33,34,35,36,37,39,41,42, and 43 (please note that pages 1-23 are introductory concerning US history).</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>On page 41</i> it specifically states "CC Poindexter deserves special mention. Without his serious and eager leadership, it is probably that the fraternal organization would have advanced more slowly. he was the moving spirit in teh literary organization which served as the predecessor of the fraternity. He acted as president of the group and continued in office during the formation of the early policies and also through the first initiation in Alpha Phi Alpha society."</dd>
<dd><i>On page 43</i>, it states "the seventh place among the Jewels, has been in dispute for some time. Mr Poindexter has been suggested for the place"</dd>

The only thing that can be attibuted to Poindexter regarding Alpha Phi Alpha is that he hosted the meeting where some of the others may have met for the first time. It's clear he fought against a fraternity from the outset, did nothing to help with its subsequent formation, and resigned once his own intentions were defeated.--<a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> 06:03, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> (1) I am not satisfied with the premise of the nomination. (2) after reading the g-hits I am convinced that there is notability as there is a recognized controversy over Poindexter's role in the forming of APA. As the first black frat. APA is clearly notable, and a controversial figure from the inception seems to be notable, especially since the controversy is ongoing. I see plenty of solid reference material at the site. However, I think the article need some rewriting and balance to the POV. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 21:30, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment on Nomination (1)</b>The article should stand on its own merits if it has any good merits, but it's clearly written from a biased POV, misquoted and distorted information, and the author has been repeatedly told that he was banned as a user, yet he continues to appear with the sole purpose of causing the same disruption his other sockpuppet ids caused.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Having said that, the user is only providing parts of the quotes to satisfy his POV. For example, when he states above "<i>On page 43</i>, it states "the seventh place among the Jewels, has been in dispute for some time. Mr Poindexter has been suggested for the place". He conveniently omits the final part of the sentence "but as noted above he was not in sympathy with the Fraternity plan. I ask, how can someone who vehmently objected to the formation of a Fraternity be considered a founder; when he clearly wanted no part of the group. Page 29 staes the orginal seven were members who were part of the both the social study club and the fraternity, and Poindexter never wanted to be a member of the fraternity.</dd>
<dd>The article in incorrect regarding the date of March 1906 to become a fraternity; it was on december 23, 1906 the name Alpha Phi Alpha society was chosen, and it wasn't until December 4, 1906 that the decison was made to become a Fraternity. Poindexter was not present for the December meeting, but resgined upon learning the group was now a fraternity.</dd>
<dd>My final comment is I don't care if the article remains, but who will volunteer for the research, rewriting and balanced POV that the article needs since this user is banned, has displayed a tendency to distort the obvious truth, biased POV, and has repeated rejected Mason, removed his references in other articles, and now wants to quote him only when he says something the user agrees with but again, he only prints the parts he wants and distorts the context and information, (biased)?--<a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> 04:31, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> CCson, your dates seem to be a bit confusing. If a fraternity was founded on Dec 4, 1906, why was the name chosen almost 3 weeks later?

Phillips, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0813123445&amp;id=yfTYV_H2XoEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA182&amp;lpg=RA1-PA182&amp;ots=eomwE1p32N&amp;dq=cc+poindexter&amp;sig=Cri-4O1YKyK2IQZASfGPwRUgDD0" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0813123445&amp;id=yfTYV_H2XoEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA182&amp;lpg=RA1-PA182&amp;ots=eomwE1p32N&amp;dq=cc+poindexter&amp;sig=Cri-4O1YKyK2IQZASfGPwRUgDD0" rel="nofollow">[41]</a> it states that "Callis was credited with coming up with the name Alpha Phi Alpha, which was adopted informally at a meeting in March 1906, and formally approved on May 23. Advertising themselves as "A Phi A." the group sponsored a dance before the close of the spring semester. During the following school year, 1906-1907, the idea of a fraternity took on a more definitive shape. Minutes from the October 27, 1906, meeting of the society show that the members again voted on the name Alpha Phi Alpha, this time acknowledging a more fraternal influece by stating, "henceforth the group [will] be known by these three greek letters." It also states on page 182 that <b>CC Poindexter served as president of this group when it was unnamed</b>. It follows on page 182 that <b>CC Poindexter in November 6, 1906 when it was named Alpha Phi Alpha.</b> This would give <b>CC Poindexter the distinction of being the first president of Alpha Phi Alpha.</b> <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarmenBryan_f3ab.html" title="User:CarmenBryan">CarmenBryan</a> 04:59, 8 January 2007 (UTC) <small>— <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarmenBryan_f3ab.html" title="User:CarmenBryan">CarmenBryan</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CarmenBryan_10ef.html" title="Special:Contributions/CarmenBryan">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<dd>Heads up all, the prior user CarmenBryan is just another sockpuppet of MyFungFu, 2Cold06, etc. The user id was created on Jan 7, 2006 and someone find there way to a delete request to provide an opion, and just happens to have a copy of the very book (on the nightstand at midnight) that the banned user references to respond to my comment. I wil however respond to his comment.</dd>
<dd>First of all, "informally" is not "officially", otherwise there would have been no need to vote on it again during the 1906/07 school year. In fact, the group was organized in 1905-06, so they could really could have said the goup was founded in 1905 even though it remained unnamed for almost a year, but the Alpha Phi Alpha history book states they chose the founding day when the group was offically voted to becme a fraternity, Dec 4, 1906. I have provided the references in the <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Phi_Alpha_482f.html" title="Alpha Phi Alpha">Alpha Phi Alpha</a> article regarding the name for Alpha Phi Alpha Society "offically" on November 23, 1906, of which Poindexter would have been the president of the "Society", however; the decison to become a fraternity and the name Alpha Phi Alpha Fraterntiy was made on December 4, 1906 without Poindexter present and against his wishes and he resigned upon learning the news.--<a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> 05:38, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Ccson, I'm not sure where you received your information from, but aren't we suppossed to assume good faith? I don't have a copy of any book. I am not any type of sockpuppet, so i'd appreciate an apology. As I stated before, I went to this link <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0813123445&amp;id=yfTYV_H2XoEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA182&amp;lpg=RA1-PA182&amp;ots=eomwE1p32N&amp;dq=cc+poindexter&amp;sig=Cri-4O1YKyK2IQZASfGPwRUgDD0" class="external free" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0813123445&amp;id=yfTYV_H2XoEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA182&amp;lpg=RA1-PA182&amp;ots=eomwE1p32N&amp;dq=cc+poindexter&amp;sig=Cri-4O1YKyK2IQZASfGPwRUgDD0" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0813123445&amp;id=yfTYV_H2XoEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA182&amp;lpg=RA1-PA182&amp;ots=eomwE1p32N&amp;dq=cc+poindexter&amp;sig=Cri-4O1YKyK2IQZASfGPwRUgDD0</a> which I gave a reference to. If you look above you stated December 23, 1906 and in your latter comment you state November 23, 1906. Your dates seemed off so I did a research on google and gave specific quotes from a book where you can see the specific quote on google. From the reading, Poindexter didn't resign upon learning the news on the day of the founding of the fraternity. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarmenBryan_f3ab.html" title="User:CarmenBryan">CarmenBryan</a> 06:03, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ccson, informally and officially.. informally (March 1906).. officially (May 23) reaffirmed (oct 27, 1906) from the book <i>African American Fraternities And Sororities: The Legacy And The Vision</i> <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0813123445&amp;id=yfTYV_H2XoEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA182&amp;lpg=RA1-PA182&amp;ots=eomwE1p32N&amp;dq=cc+poindexter&amp;sig=Cri-4O1YKyK2IQZASfGPwRUgDD0" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0813123445&amp;id=yfTYV_H2XoEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA182&amp;lpg=RA1-PA182&amp;ots=eomwE1p32N&amp;dq=cc+poindexter&amp;sig=Cri-4O1YKyK2IQZASfGPwRUgDD0" rel="nofollow">[42]</a> . So i'm wondering where did you get Dec 23, 1906? I was also wondering when you stated "request to provide an opion" what is an opion? I had no luck finding this word in the dictionary. Please clarify this for me. CC Poindexter was the first president of the greek letter organization named Alpha Phi Alpha. He did not continue on this role when it became known as the greek letter fraternity known as Alpha Phi Alpha. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarmenBryan_f3ab.html" title="User:CarmenBryan">CarmenBryan</a> 06:31, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I went to the link, however; it stated that pages 183-210 are not a part this review, so how do you know what's contained on page 183 where it would mention November 6. I should have said October 23 was the day the name Alpha Phi Alpha Society was chosen, and December 4 was the day a vote was taken to become a fraterntiy. But, the dates in your reference are in direct conflict with Alpha PHi Alpha history book. Please review the <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Phi_Alpha_482f.html" title="Alpha Phi Alpha">Alpha Phi Alpha</a> article where it provides a reputable and veriiable reference for the events that took place on October 23 and December 4 of 1906. Plus, how did you find your way to this AFD, then search the web and come back with an opinion on the AFD that was added the very day you became a wikipedian, learn how to provide links, have the wherewithall to mention "good faith", all in just over 24 hours of becoming a wikipedian? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcson_5f07.html" title="User:Ccson">Ccson</a> (<a href="../../../c/c/s/User_talk%7ECcson_5c93.html" title="User talk:Ccson">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ccson_3ce0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ccson">contribs</a>) 06:48, 8 January 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

If you look up CC Poindexter on the link you can actually view page 183. One of the writers of the book is Gregory Pecks who on page 2 is listed as a member of Alpha Phi Alpha. I have serious doubts he would give false information concerning his fraternity. The book also isn't a highly biased source which may be the case of the history of alpha phi alpha. I don't see why this book wouldn't be considered to be a good source. So now you're saying that the date is October 23rd but this is in conflict with Oct 27th reaffirmation and the May 23rd 1906 formal adoption. I've given you a glance of an actual page so you can go over this if you like. Ccson, becoming a member of Wikipedia and reading wikipedia and learning its rules are 2 very different things. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarmenBryan_f3ab.html" title="User:CarmenBryan">CarmenBryan</a> 07:14, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The result was <b>speedy delete</b> for having effectively zero content. The article's content is no more than a restatement of its title, and the title itself is false. Whilst "<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/flint" class="extiw" title="wikt:flint">flint</a>" <i>is</i> a verb, albeit not recognized as such by many dictionaries, its verbal meaning is the simple one: to furnish an object with <a href="../../../f/l/i/Flint.html" title="Flint">flint</a>. This is apparently an attempt to promote a silly protologism. (And if it isn't, then the speedy deletion criterion for not providing any context for determining what it actually <i>is</i> about applies.)

<p>Non-Notable. How can this possibly be considered encyclopedic? Their spat is hardly a controversy, it's a feud and this page is all "he said, she said". There have been much bigger celebrity feuds and the only reason this one is noted is because both are among the most ridiculed "celebrities". There's no Tom Cruise controversy page, no Brad-Angelina-Aniston controversy page, no South Park and Barbara Streisand controversy. The page creator cited the Mel Gibson DUI incident when defending this page, but at least the Mel Gibson page is well cited and well written. It also has a much larger scope and affected his entire career, this feud will be over or forgotten in a month. This article has templates for not citing references, not being wikified and not being neutral. This feud is only "big" because the talk shows make fun of it and the tabloid news shows (like ET) make a big deal of it. I'm probably going to end up nominating this page for deletion, which I don't like doing, but this page is pointless. It also sets a dangerous precedent, because if this feud can become it's own page, why not all insignificant celebrity gossip? -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion</a> 15:49, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Unless something spectacular happens (and it well could -- if one decided to sue the other, or if there was a major backlash against Trump, for example), it's probably unnecessary. "Celebrities" are not inherently interesting or encyclopaedia-worthy, despite the fawning obesiance given them by the media. Indeed, the most interesting and useful angle such an article might take would violate every Wikipedia rule: Trumps rants are clearly misogynist and homophobic. He calls O'Donnell an arrogant bully while taking every opportunity to bully her, and being famous for being arrogant on a world-class scale. He calls her mean while being famously mean, and so on. We can't say it in an article, but that's what's really fascinating about this feud, not that they are well-known people or the fact that they're feuding per se. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 19:34, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Most of the arguments against keeping this article are very subjective. Who is to judge what is worthy, relevant or useful? Isn't the point of Wikipedia to give people a forum to document (in an objective and scholarly fashion) topics that are not covered in traditional, scholarly encyclopedias? If this article is unworthy, then wouldn't the article on the Mel Gibson DUI incident be unworthy? What about the lengthy and exhaustive list of hip-hop feuds? In the big scheme of things these articles document events that are just as meaningless as the Rosie-Donald feud. Why aren't those articles marked for deletion? The fact is that this is a significant event this year for many people that is being covered and documented by major news outlets. Also, why integrate it into two seperate existing articles when the story involves three different people (Walters, Trump and O'Donnell) with a wide variety of quotes and letters and such. Having said all of this, this article does need substantial clean up and thorough citations.Rikkwj 00:06, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>If you remove the unsourced material, you are left with nothing at all. Arlo Guthrie tells a story about asking his wife what happened to a huge stack of National Geographic magazines (well, that's what he said) he had been keeping in the garage. She said "I cleaned them up last week." He said, "They're not <i>clean,</i> they're <i>gone.</i>" She replied, "Well, you can't get much cleaner than gone." If you clean up this article, it's gone. So in this case, cleanup <b>is</b> deletion. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 02:07, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I disagree. All that needs to be done is to source the unsourced material and streamline the presentation of the material. The fact is that this is a real event that is notable enough to have attracted the attention of major media outlets and the general public; it shouldn't be deleted just because it dosen't interest some people.Rikkwj 03:45, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Why are Wikiies so "DELETE HAPPY?" This forum of the Internet is not like a tradtional paper encyclopedia; the information can grow to infiniti and still fit on a computer. A paper encycolpedia must edit down in order to fit on a bookshelf. One person's article that is informative to some can be judged as redundant and unimportant to others. An example of this is sports articles to a non sports fan or teen pop culture trivia to an elderly person . THERE IS MORE THAN ENOUGH ROOM FOR INFORMATION ON WIKIPEDIA! IF NOT BILL GATES WILL IMPROVE THE SOFTWARE!!

GassyGuy 04:05, 10 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm sorry if my tone was a little frustrated - it is frustrating when editors don't put due diligence into investigating an article nominated for deletion. Given that the list is well sourced, the claim that the list inclusion is subjective is <b>demonstratably false</b>, as I noted. Given the copious reliable sources, and the passing of all relevent guidelines and policies, the claim that the subject matter is unencyclopaedic is at best dubious and at worst false. Given the profusion of other demonstratably false claims made so far <i>too vague and always subject to POV</i>, <i>subjective enough to be unworkable</i>, <i>Is this not just a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">slang or idiom guide</a>?</i> and so on, it's not unreasonable to look at a highly dubious assertion with no real rational that is incompatible with a thorough investigation of the circumstances and conclude it was an error made due to hasty judgement.</li>
<li>Which brings me to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a> - although my tone may have been a little frustrated, it's clear from my earlier comments that I did assume good faith. I surmised that the editors reached their erroneous conclusions due to oversights that were the result of a hasty investigation, rather than any sort of maliciousness. Given that an in depth, good faith investigation of the article will necessitate a "vote" of keep, the only way to assume good faith is to assume the delete "votes" were the result of honest errors that arose from insufficient investigation, rather than some active desire to damage the encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:29, 10 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Does it occur to you that you <i>might</i> be wrong? You didn't understand my point, either; my point is that a biased claim being supported by a source does not mean that you are allowed to put that biased claim in an article. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 03:29, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am confused, but, regardless, I don't appreciate the insinuation that I or anyone else didn't look at this list. How is this not just an arbitrary collection of phrases? What is this demonstrating? What makes this encyclopaedic? GassyGuy 06:22, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree that this is one of the few good list that we have here. I do think it needs to be renamed though. The "common" is too subjective to stay.

<li><b>Keep</b> absent extraordinary circumstances, assuming it's a real place with more than a handful of people.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Obviously every inhabited place isn't worthy - an apartment building is a place, and so is the street I live on (sounds like a <a href="../../../s/e/s/Sesame_Street_dd3a.html" title="Sesame Street">Sesame Street</a> song), but they're not getting articles. Also, the term village needs to be defined here - A handful of tents in the jungle can be called a "village". I've tried to look up what exactly what this region is, without any real success, other that wikipedia mirrors. Anyway, assuming it's a meaningful enough place to deserve keeping, there needs to be something in the article that explains what it is (the population, for instance) I'd say merge it into the main article of Mohali, but I'm not sure there's anything worth merging. <a href="../../../c/i/t/User%7ECiticat_8adf.html" title="User:Citicat">Citicat</a> 02:50, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Writer and composer from Turkey. Possible autobiography / advert. Is he notable? -- <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> 17:56, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>well I tried to improve my entry in accordance with the rules of Wikipedia ... also linked it to both internal and external links from which you can observe whether he is notable or not. I wonder if an entry suitable to Wikipedia on the question of "notability" should necessarily belong to an American or European writer or composer?

<p>The result was <b>DELETE</b> and Merge into the section "Muslims in Modern India" in the article <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_in_India_91af.html" title="Islam in India">Islam in India</a>. There's really nothing wrong with the article, but:</p>
<ol>
<li>A good part of the article is redundant with <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslims_in_Parliament_of_India_7059.html" title="Muslims in Parliament of India">Muslims in Parliament of India</a>. Generally, there should not be identical lists in two places, especially when the list is subject to change. This is a maintenance issue.</li>
<li>Once that list is removed, the article is short. <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_in_India_91af.html#Muslims_in_Modern_India" title="Islam in India">Islam in India#Muslims in Modern India</a> is tagged as needing expansion, so it makes sense to expand it by merging what is left of the article into that section.</li>
</ol>
<p>This doesn't mean that, in future, if editors want to add more material into <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_in_India_91af.html#Muslims_in_Modern_India" title="Islam in India">Islam in India#Muslims in Modern India</a> than will comfortably fit, a new article could not be created.

<li><b>Keep</b> I read Timesofinda <i>every</i> day and also some others. Few day ago I had read that India PM said giving Muslims equal chances. Similarly President of India had said something similar about Muslims-In-Indian-Army few months ago because there are very less Muslim in Army. It was a long debate on it. It is a fact that Indian Muslims are much backward as compare to Hindus. One can find references from India's press. Similarly when I was in USA working on H1B visa then there was many Hindus on H1B visa (in <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silicon_Valley_c36d.html" title="Silicon Valley">Silicon Valley</a>, CA) but Muslims of India was verrrry less. Hence I think a very good quality article can be created based on many references easily. I will try to contribute too on this one.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I do not disagree, but why is that a valid argument for a separate article? Why not include all this data in <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_in_India_91af.html" title="Islam in India">Islam in India</a>. I can equally argue that I should write a State of Hindus in India article and write about attack on Akshardham temple and Indian Parliament by Muslims and increasing Islamic terrorism and how it's affected Hindus. I can write about votebank politics in favor of Muslims and CPM,s support for radical Islamism etc. etc. I am sure that such an article would be AfD'ed in a second and scores of people rush in to vote "delete-delete". <a href="../../../r/u/m/User%7ERumpelstiltskin223_6de5.html" title="User:Rumpelstiltskin223">Rumpelstiltskin223</a> 23:16, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Reply: It depends on two things <b>1)</b> Importance of topic and <b>2)</b> amount of material available on it. If topic is not much important and if there is NOT much material available. Then a section in existing article is good. However, in this case the topic is very important because Muslims are lot in number and the issue is hot enough in press (see <b><a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/sunday/story/19517.html" class="external text" title="http://www.indianexpress.com/sunday/story/19517.html" rel="nofollow">December 27th Report</a></b>).

<li>I would like to support State of Hindus in Bangladesh however above mentioned sources are not neutral. You are giving me Indian News paper to show Hindus status in Bangladesh.

<li>comment - There are no "Hindu newspapers". Please read about India before you make ignorant generalizations. India is a secular country, unlike other more backward countries in the area. The word "Hindu" in "The Hindu" does not mean it is a "Hindu" newspaper but "Hindu" in that context means India. In fact, "The Hindu" is a leftist biased newspaper that frequently makes hatred against Hindus in favor of radical leftist and Islamist groups (which explains their obsession with this subject).Regarding my argument above,I think you have misunderstood my position. My point of the above statement was that none of those articles cited is justification for a separate article on this problem but is a justification for including information in <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hinduism_in_Bangladesh_341d.html" title="Hinduism in Bangladesh">Hinduism in Bangladesh</a>. To create a separate article is a POV fork. In the same vein, all this information about reports of Muslims is not enough for a separate article but inclusion into the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_in_India_91af.html" title="Islam in India">Islam in India</a> article where it belongs.<a href="../../../r/u/m/User%7ERumpelstiltskin223_6de5.html" title="User:Rumpelstiltskin223">Rumpelstiltskin223</a> 02:05, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - That creates way too many POV forks and, given the tendency for Indian Islamic and Hindu Fundamentalist editors, as well as the comrades from the far left, to troll in these types of articles it is better to keep them all in one place to avoid further disruption of wikipedia (by now, I'm sure everybody is aware of the argumentative shenanigans of some South Asian editors on wikipedia). <a href="../../../r/u/m/User%7ERumpelstiltskin223_6de5.html" title="User:Rumpelstiltskin223">Rumpelstiltskin223</a> 08:43, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>First of all, I am from Liverpool, New York, a suburb of Syracuse. I have followed the Syracuse Crunch since they were founded and never heard of a player named "Luciano DiOssi" ever play for the Crunch. In addition, the name does not register on the Intenet Hockey Database. Also, <a href="../../../r/y/a/Ryan_Getzlaf_1c4a.html" title="Ryan Getzlaf">Ryan Getzlaf</a> And <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corey_Perry_6b0b.html" title="Corey Perry">Corey Perry</a> Were Named <i>Rbk/AHL Rookies of the Month</i> in December of the 2005-06 season.

<li><b>Keep</b> ARPIA2 was worked on by actual developers of Escape Velocity Nova itself, so, in that sense, it can be considered as more than just a 'user-made patch'. Besides, why must it be deleted in vague terms of notability? Futhuremore, a quick Google search reveals more revelant results on ARPIA2 as opposed to <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolo.html" title="Bolo">Bolo</a>, which has its own article. Also to note is that ARPIA is in the process of becoming a novel and quite well into the process. How many game addons do you see becoming novels? If the plug in itself is not 'notable' enough, then it should be altered to be about the novel, and thus have the title changed accordingly. After all, are not novels 'notable'? -<a href="../../../t/w/i/User%7ETwilightPhoenix_556d.html" title="User:TwilightPhoenix">TwilightPhoenix</a> 04:23, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I'm not quite sure how the disambiguation page <a href="../../../b/o/l/Bolo.html" title="Bolo">Bolo</a> is relevant to anything. In any case, the existence of Google hits doesn't really mean anything about ARPIA2 except that it exists (which doesn't confer notability). The novel is not inherently notable either, particularly if it hasn't been published yet. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 07:08, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'd just like to point out that Counterstrike started out as a Half-Life mod and is now one of the most recognizable first person shooters on the planet.

<li><b>Delete</b> The clear conflict of interest concerning PACraddock's claims of notability concerns me somewhat, but not as much as this mod's lack of sourcing regarding the notability. I'd be a lot more comfortable with this mod if I could see some sourcing in notable third-party publishings. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Cheers, Lankybugger</a> 15:46, 8 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So what, put up a figure like "In the past four weeks since its release, 75 people have given it an average rating of 96.27%"? -- PACraddock
<ul>
<li>What are your views on the proposed <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> as a guideline for Wikipedia? --<a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPak21_529c.html" title="User:Pak21">Pak21</a> 17:46, 8 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>ARPIA2 isn't software, as it is not a self-standing application. Since it's a user-made add-on, unless Ambrosia decided to support it, it would have no reason to be the object of any kind of media coverage. -- PACraddock 7:38, 9th of January 2007 (GMT)
<ul>
<li>And therefore it's not notable and therefore not suitable for Wikipedia. Also, you have an interesting definition of "software". End of discussion, let's go home. --<a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPak21_529c.html" title="User:Pak21">Pak21</a> 08:23, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>So basically, if a few users write independent objective reviews and say for example that it has even more depth to it than most novels, or that it is considered by many players to be "maybe as good as EVN itself", this article can stay/be resubmitted (since it seems it's going to be deleted)? -- PACraddock 7:43, 9th of January 2007 (GMT)

<li>… <i>Thank you</i>, I already did, and there is no clear definition of "reliable source", and no way for me to assume that user reviews on any kind of website are "unreliable". I read every article that has been cited, and nothing excludes objective reviews. Unless there's some hidden message behind these articles that only the Wiki "<i>masters</i>" know of. Indeed, after reading these articles, I find myself intrigued as to how certain articles exist. Just to name another user-made add-on, why don't you try looking at <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jaymod.html" title="Jaymod">Jaymod</a>? Most interesting in terms of notability and reliable sources. In conclusion, I feel like only half of what has been shown to me is of any interest, and the other half of the replies here have been almost offensive… Kindly, -- PACraddock 13:09, 9th of January 2007 (GMT)

<p>The film is not notable. Both of the creators of this film are not listed on Wikipedia (The Chris Thomas we are talking about isn't listed on the disambiguation page). There are no notable ghits for "Steel and Stone" and "Chris Thomas". It sounds to me as if the creators of this film are simply everyday guys who made a small film and put an article about it on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/u/e/User%7ESue_H._Ping_f714.html" title="User:Sue H.

<li><b>Comment</b> - for what it's worth, the article consists of an explanation of what an all male dance team consists of and does: a bunch of men (or boys) who do choreographed (oppose freeform) dance. Thing is, though, that it's my opinion that the name identifies what this is (i.e., it does exactly what it says on the tin), so there's really no context.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Tram stops are in general not notable.

The stop is referenced in Google searches I've just done, but the Google hits do not yield articles etc. <b>about</b> the stop itself. The reason that tram stops are not subjects of other published works is, in my opinion, because they are relatively temporary structures: simply raised pavements with a small shelters beside - almost as easy to remove as bus stops. I must confess I had once considered nominating articles on stops on Croydon's <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tramlink.html" title="Tramlink">Tramlink</a> for this reason, but wasn't confident of getting support.

<li>Well tram stops are kind of in between bus stops and subway stations when it comes to notability. I feel that stops for trams which run in the city streets like busses can be treated like bus stops while stops for light rail systems on separate guideways are more on the level with subway stops. I am not sure exactly how the Nottingham system is. Notable or not, this article does not have much content (That Wilkinson Street tram stop serves Wilkinson Street is reasonably obvious), and it is all pretty much covered in the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Nottingham_Express_Transit_6184.html" title="Nottingham Express Transit">Nottingham Express Transit</a> article anyway (which has a system map for example). I think we can <b>redirect</b> this page there. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 09:42, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b> I see what you're saying, but in Sheffield some street-stops (ie West Street, University, Hillsborough) and some are separated from the roads (ie Valley Centertainment, Crystal Peaks, Arena/Don Valley Stadium). Some (such as Crystal Peaks, Meadowhall, University) and notable for other reasons (shopping centre, shopping centre and train/bus interchange and one of the city's universities respectively) but if the grade saparated platforms are just raise platforms. <a href="../../../l/e/w/User%7ELewisskinner_9d75.html" title="User:Lewisskinner"><b><font color="red">L.J.Skinner</font></b></a><sub><a href="../../../l/e/w/User_talk%7ELewisskinner_8921.html" title="User talk:Lewisskinner"><font color="green"><i>WOT?</i></font></a></sub>|<sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_lewisskinner_f7ac.html" title="Special:Contributions/lewisskinner"><font color="blue"><i>CONTRIBS</i></font></a></sup> 15:20, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>KEEP</b>. Reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I'm not too keen on renominating an article that was closed as Keep only a few months ago. What has changed since then?</li>
<li>The argument that this stands alone as a subject I find unconvincing. I understand the argument along this line, and it does have merit. However, I think the counter-argument that this is basically an overflow from <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html" title="RuneScape">RuneScape</a> to keep that article from being too long, and that we have many articles like that, to also have merit.</li>
<li>The raw vote total is 12-10 in favor of Keep, for whatever that's worth.</li>
<li><a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">WP:CRUFT</a> is just an essay, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> apply as this article is not a game guide.</li>
<li>The quality of the article is not <i>very</i> germane, although it does have some bearing; but generally, an article is deleted only if the <i>topic</i> is unencyclopedic. It's asserted here that a decent article <i>can't</i> be made on this topic, but that is unproven. There are (apparently) several people willing to work on it.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's not that the Keep arguments are all that strong; it's more that the Delete commentors failed to prove their case. This is the fifth nomination. Not counting the withdrawn nomination, this makes the last two closed as Keep, so I think it's time to stop renominating this article until 2008 at the earliest. The comments that the article should be renamed are well taken, and although I'm not going to do that now as part of the close, I don't see why another editor shouldn't move the article. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 07:54, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

It rarely even names the quests involved, never mind tells you how to pass them. I'm not even sure simply naming a quest counts as cruft.

<li><b>Keep and rename RuneScape history on closure of AFD</b> Immediately after. This article's problem is that it is focussed on the wrong topic, not that attention hasn't or couldn't be given to it. RS gods are not like the D&amp;D gods, or other well-detailed fictional pantheons, assertions to that affect are mistaken. Instead, RS has three main gods, representing good, evil and neutrality/nature - these gods are covered in detail in masses of citable material from the RS site. A couple of other gods get a mention. The rest are bit-players, their stories are worked through and forgotten, the developer does not write them into new quests or material.</li>
</ul>
<p>The flip side would be a history of RS - there's a page on it already available to gather info from. Writing the history of the game world instead of fixating on gods would have many advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>It would contain relevant info on the gods, much more so than the current article but also in better context than even a mass-cleanup'd gods article.</li>
<li>Readers get the bigger picture, they understand <i>why</i> the three main gods are given so much coverage, they'd understand where the lesser gods fit in - even RS players would find out new information.</li>
<li>Any character in the RS universe who is covered in detail and an important part of the history could be included, a much broader scope.</li>
<li>We'd (jubilantly) get away from the flawed argument "If the character is referred to as a god, they're <b>important</b> by default", this is plain wrong and in many cases obvious.</li>
<li>God letters and Postbag from the Hedge - here are the citations. If it's on there, it's citable, it's tangible, no we didn't just make up "The mighty black shiny thong of Thurr-Grar", click the link sweetie.</li>
<li>Every time articles are merged so they have broader scope, they improve, profoundly. The information becomes more streamlined and by definition free of fancruft, inappropriate context and uncited text - these stick out a mile and are therefore sanitized on sight. A history article does the same, it isn't about one particular caste of NPCs, it's about all of them that had an impact, it isn't even just about NPCs anymore - battles, locations, relics, aspects of the playable RS etc. ad nauseum.</li>
<li>The article would be lead from citations, rather than a splurge of muddled fancruft with none.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keeping this article as is, with the same title, will not result in a stable, meaninful article. The focus of the article is wrong and the need (as well as the objective) of what is just a list of NPCs has not been demonstrated. Characters that don't belong aren't left in the article for weeks on end because deleting them is difficult, they're left because they'll only be added again because the entire article is geared to self-defeat and conflicts with all the progress the RS series has made. Twenty contributors aren't going to change that, they'll spend their time arguing back and forth and leaving a different mess to the one they found.</p>
<p>Articles like <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_weaponry_3e04.html" title="RuneScape weaponry">RuneScape weaponry</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_armour_2013.html" title="RuneScape armour">RuneScape armour</a> and RuneScape minigames were not a success. They were filled with fancruft, unmanageable, meaningless to non-players and worst of all they missed the point - to provide relevant, readable material. <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_combat_56e7.html" title="RuneScape combat">RuneScape combat</a> (the resultant merge) has been quite the opposite. Minigames was an article I was working on myself, though after seeing it gone all I see are steadily improving articles where it used to be.</p>
<p>The experiment has been run enough times for us to learn from it - can we please accept that and get on with the task at hand? Or do we have to set up the bubbling flasks again and meet back here when the weather's warmer?</p>
<p>I should point out that the idea of a history article was none of mine, Captain Vindaloo mentioned it. If he had not done so I would be asking for this article to be deleted. However, the idea of creating a history article to turn the article upside down into a great opportunity for us and something good for our readers. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 01:38, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> No, THAT does not make sense, seriously. Let's dissect the opening paragraph of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>:
<ul>
<li><i>A <b>topic</b> is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and each other.

</ul>
</li>
<li>Now. We can all agree that <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html" title="RuneScape">RuneScape</a> is notable. That has not been contested, an behold, there's an article on <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html" title="RuneScape">RuneScape</a>. However, <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_gods_1cf4.html" title="RuneScape gods">RuneScape gods</a> is not a subpage of <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html" title="RuneScape">RuneScape</a> or a section in <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html" title="RuneScape">RuneScape</a> - it is an <b>article</b>.

<dd>Not really. "RuneScape gods is not a subpage of RuneScape or a section in RuneScape" - erm, <i>yes it is</i>, hence the "RuneScape" part of the title. And the only reason it is not a section in the main article is to keep the <a href="../../../s/i/z/WP%7ESIZE_929b.html" title="WP:SIZE">article size</a> down, otherwise we'd have a browser-crashing monster on our hands. RuneScape/Gods wouldn't work, as the page/subpage feature doesn't work in article namespace (this is to allow articles like <a href="../../../f/a/c/Face_Off_2cc9.html" title="Face/Off">Face/Off</a> to exist without technical difficulty). The <b>topic</b> here is RuneScape. This <b>article</b> contains an important component of that <b>topic</b>. <b>Topics</b> and <b>Articles</b> are not the same. A <b>Topic</b> must be sufficiently notable to deserve inclusion here. <b>Articles</b> are simply containers for these topics. If a <b>topic</b> has to be split across several <b>articles</b> to be included, edited and read conveniently, then so be it. <b>Articles</b> and <b>topics</b> are not synonymous. Most non-notable topics can only manage one article, and some notable topics can fit conveniently in one article, but in this case, the notable topic (RuneScape) is too large to fit in a single article, so it has been split across several articles, per <a href="../../../s/i/z/WP%7ESIZE_929b.html" title="WP:SIZE">WP:SIZE</a>. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is not meant for this situation. Rules like <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and essays like <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">WP:CRUFT</a> are; these are meant to keep the coverage of a topic in check. Think like a reader: you hear of something famous, and you go to Wikipedia to find out more about it. As it has a claim to fame, notability, then the reader will very likely know what makes it famous. Wikipedia would be utterly worthless to the reader if it simply repeated what makes the topic notable and nothing else. You already know that <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Beckham_f822.html" title="David Beckham">David Beckham</a> is a footballer. What use is an Wikipedia entry that just says <i>"David Beckham is a footballer"</i>? What if you want to know where he grew up? What he did before he became a footballer?

<dd>I believe this constitutes an irreconcilable difference in our views on Wikipedia. However, are you actually suggesting that RuneScape gods are <i>famous</i>? I could find more third-party sources dealing with Jobjörn Folkesson, I can assure you that. Thinking like a "reader" in the manner you suggested would make Wikipedia <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">an indiscriminate collection of information</a> - if said reader doesn't find any entry on <i><b>RuneScape gods</b></i> (you must agree it sounds completely ridiculous) on Wikipedia, there's always <a href="http://www.google.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/" rel="nofollow">the rest of the internet</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_5bfe.html" title="User:Jobjörn">Jobjörn</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/b/User_talk%7EJobj%C3%B6rn_2ebd.html" title="User talk:Jobjörn">Talk</a> ° <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jobj%C3%B6rn_1184.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jobjörn">contribs</a>) 22:47, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, thinking like the reader in my example would make <a href="../../../e/n/c/WP%7EENC_e8ee.html" title="WP:ENC">Wikipedia an encyclopedia</a>. The RuneScape gods are notable as a part of RuneScape, just as David Beckham is notable as a football player. Without RS, the gods wouldn't be notable, without football, Beckham wouldn't be notable, without <a href="../../../f/o/r/Formula_1.html" title="Formula 1">Formula 1</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Schumacher_8477.html" title="Michael Schumacher">Michael Schumacher</a> wouldn't be notable, without the space program, <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Armstrong_5dd2.html" title="Neil Armstrong">Neil Armstrong</a> wouldn't be notable, et cetera ad nauseum. Everything is connected like this. Readers interested in the major characters and backstory of RuneScape (the article has been somewhat mistitled; the Gods are the most frequent recurring characters and major players in the game backstory; see <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a>'s rename&#160;!vote) won't find this indiscriminate at all: its not a mere FAQ, Travel Guide, Memorial, Instruction Manual (at least while regular editors keep an eye on it), Internet Guide, Textbook, raw Plot Summary, Lyrics, or something stupid made up in school. It is a focused overview of the backstory of a notable MMORPG. Any ambiguity of the title is the reason we have <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_RuneScape_gods_c69c.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/RuneScape gods">links</a> and a <a href="../../../r/u/n/Template%7ERuneScape_ec3d.html" title="Template:RuneScape">template</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> The nomination reasons are invalid. Cruft is not a reason for deletion, it's a derogatory term that should not be used in an AfD. As to the rest, If there is any content that is a game guide, or original research, edit it, clean up this article. But I'd no more expect this article's contents to be deleted than I would the contents of Category:Dungeons % Dragons deities. While some of them are based on real-world deities, others are completely made up. I doubt much has been written about some of them outside the D&amp;D universe, yet they are related to something real and notable. Thus they should be included in Wikipedia. The same applies to this. Runescape is notable. It is set in a particular world. That world is notable, and verifiable as a fictional creation. These gods are an aspect of that creation, and as such should be discussed somewhere. I could live with a merge if that were proposed, I don't think the World of Runescape is given enough attention, but that's a problem for another day. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 02:17, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>There is no character list, as of yet, since the gods are in the most part the only characters which could reasonably assumed to be worth covering here - emphasis on <i>in the most part</i>. The current article is biased against non-gods yet also asserts that RS gods by their very nature are notable, which is extremely debatable (and in my humble opinion a load of pants). Worse still, it's being used as an excuse to include non-gods which are also not-notable - a weak argument which none the less has not been countered.</dd>
<dd>With the exception of the RS Locations article, <a href="../../../p/y/r/User%7EPyrospirit_RuneScape_locations_rewrite_6c0b.html" title="User:Pyrospirit/RuneScape locations rewrite">which is being rewritten</a> in a more encyclopedic fashion, Gods is the last remaining article from the original mass-split of the main article. This resulted in loads of crufty RS articles which have now been merged or deleted. Of the remaining sub-articles, combat is a mass-merge, skills is a mass-merge and wilderness is in the process of being merged. That's why gods does not hold-up in comparison.</dd>
<dd>Whilst there is nothing to 'merge' the article with, renaming the article RS history and rebuilding it will have the same effect - notable characters included, non-notable characters excluded, the actions of the gods are spelled out (which negates all the 'you can get Guthix armour' justification language in the current article), fictional battles which happened 'before' the age of RS which players access when they play the game can be included. I'm quite sympathetic with anyone who wishes for the article to be deleted, it is a mess, the article was not cleaned-up despite that recommendation at the close of the last AFD. All that said, take a look at the new locations article and the current main article, as well as combat and skills. This is what contributors can do with RS info, something much better than the gods and current location articles would lead you to believe.</dd>
<dd>If we could come to some consensus, in this AFD, that it would be a good idea to change the direction of the article and start insisting on sources being supplied, we could do some good work here. I'm worried that deletion will result in the info being splattered amongst other articles but a blanket 'keep' would just result in the article remaining meaningless to non-players, just a bit cleaned-up. We did the 'clean-up this mess' thing before, having an article simply called 'Gods' with no focus or balance is a mistake. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 05:33, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep, Rename and Rewrite</b> per Quagmire above. The RuneScape article series is rather small by Wikipedia standards, and the number of active Wikipedians working on it is limited.

<li><b>Comment about article-series notability</b> I also do not think notability applies to sub-articles of an article series, provided the parent article is notable; if notability needed to be asserted every single time, nobody would ever split any article because it (the possibility of outsiders thinking the sub-article is not notable) would make many attempts of providing Wikipedia with a document hierarchy in vain. For example, consider <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_highways_in_Queensland_23ca.html" title="List of highways in Queensland">List of highways in Queensland</a> and ask yourself the question "should we expect a sub-article to need assert notability by citing external sources?" Of course not! The <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highways.html" title="Highways">grandfather article</a> is notable, so therefore the <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highways_in_Australia_ab78.html" title="Highways in Australia">parent article</a> and the sub-article is notable too.

I would be entirely happy to keep this article, even though it looks like fancruft to me, if we could only deal with the fact that (a) there appears, even to my beginner's eye, to be a lot of OR here, and (b) no adequate case is being made for notability of the subject. Since it's not meeting our normal criteria, it should go.

<li><b>Comment</b> It looks like the article is going to be remodeled soon anyways, so your citation concerns will be addressed. However, <i>we generally do not make sure that every new section of an article is notable in-and-of-itself</i> in case it may later need splitting, just in relation to the topic being discussed in the [original] article; after a section is split off, sub-article notability depends on the parent article's notability and the size of the split. The core concept of <a href="../../../s/s/_/WP%7ESS_0b59.html" title="WP:SS">WP:SS</a> is that sizable sub-articles remain part of the parent article, just on a separate page for (a) size concerns; (b) focused editing; and, (c) reduction of page history clutter in the parent article.

<li><b>Comment</b>. If an article is a "subarticle" according to <a href="../../../s/u/m/WP%7ESUMMARY_66b7.html" title="WP:SUMMARY">summary style</a>, does the subarticle need to meet notability in its own right? Even if it is assumed that summary style is an exception to notability, I think every article must still meet the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> aspect of notability. It must have <i>some</i> references from third-party <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. Above it was stated that Michael Schumacher wouldn't be known without Formula 1. That's true, but Schumacher is not a notable topic <i>simply because</i> Formula 1 is a notable sport. (If that were true, then WP should have an article on every person remotely connected with Formula 1.) It ought to be common sense that random pit crew are not notable simply because Formula 1 is notable, unless they are discussed by reliable third-party sources. Likewise, RuneScape gods are not notable <i>simply because</i> RuneScape is notable. There <i>should</i> be some discussion of these entities in non-blog, non-forum, non-RuneScape sources. Are they mentioned in independent game reviews? I tried looking for a third party reference even for Guthix and was not successful, and I don't see where any of the "keep"&#160;!votes have provided third-party references either.

<li>I've read quite a few RuneScape reviews now, and so far none of them have mentioned the gods of the RuneScape universe. I can't even find a mention in the <a href="http://faqs.ign.com/objects/550/550093.html" class="external text" title="http://faqs.ign.com/objects/550/550093.html" rel="nofollow">extensive walkthrough/FAQ at ign.com</a>. I see the September '06 AfD encouraged a rewrite. The November '06 AfD was withdrawn because it was only two months later. It is now <i>another</i> two months later, and the article still hasn't improved much. The RuneScape gods do provide a sort of mythical background to the game. I'm tempted to say this topic should be summarized and merged into the main RuneScape article, with a result similar to the <a href="../../../u/n/r/Unreal.html#Premise" title="Unreal">"Premise" section in Unreal</a>. But with a rewrite promised above, I won't.<a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 17:54, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>On a tangential note, why does the bottom navigation template contain a link to a wikiproject task force? That seems inappropriate in article space. Also, why link to Portal:RuneScape when the regular portal template is also used, and easily recognized? <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 17:54, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The outside reader would distinguish it from trivia in that it leans heavily towards inclusion in the parent article. As you and I have stated, if the article's contents were still in a section of the parent article, there would not be an immediate problem. Interestingly, most of the delete votes here are clearly because it is a sub-article, not because it isn't verifiable. Perhaps we should nominate WP:SS at MfD or tag it obsolete? --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidHOzAu_f632.html" title="User:DavidHOzAu">DavidH</a><a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidHOzAu_91ad.html" title="User talk:DavidHOzAu">Oz</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EDavidHOzAu_59c4.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:DavidHOzAu">Au</a> 11:13, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>WP:N refers to WP:SS in the section on <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html#Merging" title="WP:N">merging</a>, where it refers to "Information which ... is not sufficient to build a full, sourced encyclopedia article that stands independent of the main subject." WP:SS is not a license to split out any part of a large article, but only those parts that can stand alone as a full, sourced encyclopedia article satisfying WP:V, WP:RS, WP:NOR. Within an article on RuneScape, if the RuneScape gods are important to a full explanation of <i>RuneScape</i> as a topic, then it is fine to describe the RuneScape gods with reference to RuneScape-published sources. However, I don't think this is enough for a stand-alone article on <i>RuneScape gods</i>. I think we should be hesitant to endorse stand-alone articles that cannot be referenced to any third-party sources. I'm still concerned that none of the&#160;!keeps have even attempted to provide a third-party reference. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 19:42, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Conditional Keep —</b> I'd like to see some referenes added (not sure how long this article's been marked as needing them), but I'm uncomfortable voting delete seeing as how it's the fifth nomination and third in 6 months, so I'd rather see this article rewritten. <a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardman_4d38.html" title="User:Wizardman"><span style="color:#0D0;background:#009">Wizardman</span></a> 19:19, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per Gimmetrow above. Notability, it has long been said in the context of biographical pieces, is not contagious. Therefore, the argument that Runescape is notable, therefore any given article which can be connect to Runescape is notable, is a weak one. Indeed, Runescape-related articles have been deleted before now. As noted, the article has not been fixed, remaining riddled with <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and liberally sprinkled with {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} tags, in spite of multiple AfDs. AfD may not be cleanup, but articles which remain persistently unreferenced are clearly problematic. Notable subjects are easily referenced because other commentators (<a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>) have done all the hard work of collecting the data. Primary sources - the game and its supporting materials - should only serve for adding vivid (and misleading?) detail. Since any compliant article would necessarily be rewritten from scratch, deletion serves to purge Wikipedia of non-compliant (with <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>) material.

<dd><b>Weak Delete</b> The main purpose of having subpages is to reduce the size of the main article. Therefore, there should only be subpages on the most important aspects of RuneScape's gameplay, such as skills and combat, which non-players researching on the game may find useful. However, the gods are not even mentioned in the Gameplay section of the main article. If a reliable source wrote a review or article on RuneScape, several paragraphs may be devoted to explaining skills or combat, but the gods are unlikely to get even a passing mention. This suggests that the gods are not a notable element of RuneScape's gameplay, and information about them is unlikely to interest non-players (or even casual players).</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Above I argued that <a href="../../../s/s/_/WP%7ESS_0b59.html" title="WP:SS">WP:SS</a> is not a license to split out any parts of a large article, but only those parts which can stand alone satisfying WP:V, WP:RS, WP:NOR. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html#Merging" title="WP:N">WP:N#Merging</a> refers to "information which ... is not sufficient to build a full, sourced encyclopedia article that stands independent of the main subject". This seems fairly appropriate here. Within an article on RuneScape, if the RuneScape gods are important to a full explanation of <i>RuneScape</i> as a topic (whose notabilty is already independently established), then it is fine to describe the RuneScape gods with reference to RuneScape-published sources. However, I don't think this is enough for a stand-alone article on <i>RuneScape gods</i>. I think we should be hesitant to endorse stand-alone articles that cannot be referenced to any third-party sources. <a href="../../../g/i/m/User_talk%7EGimmetrow_c76c.html" title="User talk:Gimmetrow"><i>Gimmetrow</i></a> 19:42, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Some of the things pertain only to RuneScape based information, and no one outside of the RuneScape realm could find any of this information extensively useful.

<p>One of twelve presenters on a Channel 4 (UK) show that got dismal ratings and was absolutely panned by the critics; none of the presenters had past form, and it doesn't look like this one has present form either.

<li>Outlining technologies is fine, that's mere secondary research from primary sources.

<p>This is a niche product. Absolutely useless on wikipedia and I'll tell you why. No one knows about this game. It is too insignificant to be on wikipedia.

<li>Well, that's what I'm working on right now. I'm not associated with the podcast and will do my best to support the article. There hasn't been any discussion on the show on the main page at all before it was marked for deletion. The original authors where never even given a chance to remedy the article before this deletion was posted. However, if I can't find anything notable about it, I will join the chorus asking for its removal. <a href="../../../a/s/e/User%7EAselman_2b51.html" title="User:Aselman">Aselman</a> 03:34, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I add the following references and arguments from the originating articles discussion page, where this should have been brought up in the first place. I preface this by stating that an immediate call for deletion without so much as a single argument on the article's discussion page violates community spirit if not policy. My references for the page follow: This podcast was originally broadcast through <a href="../../../i/t/u/ITunes_59e0.html" title="ITunes">iTunes</a> distribution as a podcast on January 1, 2005 and has produced 47 episodes that have covered the entire year. Pursuant to the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">notability rules</a>: "Web-specific content[3] is notable if it meets <b>any one</b> of the following criteria...3. The content is distributed via a medium which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster." You have been arguing here just the first of three criteria, when any of the 3 is an argument for notability. It is difficult if not impossible to argue that distributions via iTunes for a year is trival. On the podcast homepage, over 394 people have commented on the podcast with an average rating of 4.5 (of 5) stars. According to the site comments are being logged as late as January 8th. Also notable that if you run a search for <b>World of Warcraft</b> in <a href="../../../i/t/u/ITunes_59e0.html" title="ITunes">iTunes</a> 30 podcasts are returned. This show has 390+ user comments. The next nearest cast has 140 or so. Its also important to note that the podcast has two sponsors, "TypeFrag" - a Ventrillo server company and perhaps more importantly <a href="../../../u/p/p/Upper_Deck_Company_31be.html" title="Upper Deck Company">Upper Deck Company</a> sponsors the show with advertising and prizes surrounding its <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_of_Warcraft_Trading_Card_Game_dd10.html" title="World of Warcraft Trading Card Game">World of Warcraft Trading Card Game</a>. I would argue that companies that spend advertising money on a podcast, clearly makes the show as notable as ANY television show that accepts advertising. Finally, outside links to the podcast. Since podcasts are downloadable media, the reside on a single server and are advertised at multiple directories around the Internet. This is how subscribers find the show. <a href="http://www.podcastalley.com" class="external text" title="http://www.podcastalley.com" rel="nofollow">Podcast Alley</a> contains a listing for the show at <a href="http://www.podcastalley.com/podcast_details.php?pod_id=17466" class="external text" title="http://www.podcastalley.com/podcast_details.php?pod_id=17466" rel="nofollow">here</a>. <a href="http://podcasts.yahoo.com" class="external text" title="http://podcasts.yahoo.com" rel="nofollow">The Yahoo Podcast Directory</a> contains a listing <a href="http://podcasts.yahoo.com/series?s=f953fc152a336f3178bf7d4686cda7fc" class="external text" title="http://podcasts.yahoo.com/series?s=f953fc152a336f3178bf7d4686cda7fc" rel="nofollow">here</a>. <a href="http://www.podcastpickle.com" class="external text" title="http://www.podcastpickle.com" rel="nofollow">Podcast Pickle</a> also contains a listing <a href="http://www.podcastpickle.com/casts/19122/" class="external text" title="http://www.podcastpickle.com/casts/19122/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The podcast is active and clearly has a following. Moreover, it meets the requirements for notability. <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> also notes that sites that are new should be given a chance to grow. I believe that is the case here as well. <a href="../../../a/s/e/User%7EAselman_2b51.html" title="User:Aselman">Aselman</a> 04:50, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>A lot of what you've said isn't an argument for keeping. It's easy to argue that distributions of podcasts on iTunes is trivial. They host literally thousands of podcasts, not all of which can be considered notable. Popularity is not one of the criteria for deletion (or keeping), so that's irrelevant. The problem is that it's received no independent coverage. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 10:33, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Trebor, you keep arguing about independent coverage of the podcast but you are missing the fact that that is just one of three possible tests for notability. You may feel you can dismiss my argument under the 3rd test, but it meets the criteria laid out laid out under <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, that <b>a program distributed by a third party makes it relevant</b>. Independent citations of the podcast are <b>not</b> required if <b>one</b> of the other two tests there are met. World of Warcraft has over 7 million subscribers, this podcast brings news and information to that community. It is this podcast's service of that community that makes it notable. Podcasts should be tested like radio programs and there are any number of programs that have a far more limited audience and far less significance. Yet there they are in a their own article in Wikipedia. The <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_US_radio_programs_bb92.html" title="List of US radio programs">US Radio Program Listing</a> is here. All I ask is that you actually read the rules for notability completely and not stop with the first one. <a href="../../../a/s/e/User%7EAselman_2b51.html" title="User:Aselman">Aselman</a> 13:25, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

"Because they are a part of Star Wars and that has a large fanbase." Well WoW, being very similar to Star Wars, could replace the words "Star Wars" in that last sentence! It has over 7 million players.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> I did not create the article for promotional reasons and I have no other connection to The Instance other than the article (in fact I have quit playing WoW altogether); I believe that it has enough relevance to exist, regardless of "third - party sources." I did not include the Show Sponsors section when I originally created the article. That section has been removed to prevent it from appearing to be a promotion. However, I would not call it a "promotion" of the podcast because it costs nothing to subscribe to it. And aren't all articles a promotion of their topics? While <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo86_eb89.html" title="User:Leebo86">Leebo</a> says that the article "only has relevance to some WoW fans," he/she neglects that that is exactly the point of the podcast, to be relevant to WoW fans! And by some, he/she means thousands! The Instance is among the most listened to WoW podcasts (as evidenced by it being one of the few WoWcasts to have sponsors) and has one of the highest amounts in customer reviews on Itunes with over 350. It has arguably the largest fan base of contributors and show participants, whether through posts on forums, emails, and phone calls of any podcast. What is meant by those who say that they can't find any unbiased sources about the topic of the article. Why would this article require unbiased sources? There is no debate about the podcast or the topics it covers and the article has by all means a neutral POV. If you do a Google search of "most popular warcraft podcasts, "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en-us&amp;q=most+popular+warcraft+podcasts&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en-us&amp;q=most+popular+warcraft+podcasts&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">here</a> you will find the truth about whether or not this article should by AfD.

<li>Please see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a> for the criteria for notability. While a podcast might be listened to in to World of Warcraft community, whether or not that is notable enough to deserve its own article is a separate issue. Being listed on directories does not establish notability, as evidenced in the "Primary notability criterion": <i>"Non-triviality" is an evaluation of the depth of content contained in the published work, exclusive of mere directory entry information, and of how directly it addresses the subject.</i> There are a lack of published works discussing this podcast. So far all the evidence of its notability have been its listing in directories of podcasts and the amount of comments left for it on those directories.

thoroughly unremarkable song. not on any real album, and only some performance song. also so small that it's too little for wikipedia. this is a severe stub, should be removed because it is thoroughly a waste of space. no point to it, no one's ever heard of this song and no one ever will. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaanxiquake_988d.html" title="User:Shaanxiquake">Shaanxiquake</a> 00:04, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b> whoever you are you're targetting the pages I made it's wont work using the same argument twice. it's hooligans like you who ruin wikipedia; just stop this nonsense <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../p/a/a/User%7EPaaerduag_7f72.html" title="User:Paaerduag">Paaerduag</a> (<a href="../../../p/a/a/User_talk%7EPaaerduag_9362.html" title="User talk:Paaerduag">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Paaerduag_a592.html" title="Special:Contributions/Paaerduag">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Speedy keep</b> It appears this article has asserted its importance and is notable due the song writer. Very many new articles started out as small, lets give this one more time. Disagreement on the merits of the nomination. <a href="../../../n/a/v/User%7ENavou_3499.html" title="User:Navou"><font color="blue"><b>Navou</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/a/v/User_talk%7ENavou_af4c.html" title="User talk:Navou"><b><font color="blue">talk</font></b></a></sup> 00:16, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It's a song performed by a notable artist and is included on an album (I don't know how the nom defines a "real album"). It follows in the vein of similar articles dealing with a single song. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_9893.html" title="User:Soltak">Soltak</a> | <a href="../../../s/o/l/User_talk%7ESoltak_c9f0.html" title="User talk:Soltak">Talk</a> 00:48, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_EO_037a.html" title="Captain EO">Captain EO</a>. Precedent has been to only keep those songs which were released as singles or had major significance of their own (e.g. themes to a TV series ec.). This has neither, and while it was definitely performed by a major artist, IMO it is well below the bar of notability. This song is already mentioned in passing in the Captian EO article, so no real need to merge any more either. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Rundle_db17.html" title="User:Richard Rundle">fchd</a> 06:29, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> I agree with <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Rundle_db17.html" title="User:Richard Rundle">fchd</a> regarding the precedent, but would say that the c. 10 year run with the captain EO film in Disneyland <b>might</b> raise it above the bar. Its not being a hit on its own is a bit of a problem, however. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkierRMH_4ae2.html" title="User:SkierRMH"><font color="green">SkierRMH</font></a>,<font color="purple">08:38, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</font></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I would have agreed with a redirect to Captain EO BEFORE the song was placed on the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Michael_Jackson%7E_The_Ultimate_Collection_2c5e.html" title="Michael Jackson: The Ultimate Collection">Michael Jackson Ultimate Collection</a>, but now that it has been released on that album (yes the album is real) a redirect would only remove valid information from wikipedia. Captain EO is about the film. This is about the song, and the song's importance in particular. there are several song stub articles on wikipedia. but i believe that this is relevant enough to say. and if you have noticed, <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaanxiquake_988d.html" title="User:Shaanxiquake">Shaanxiquake</a> has nominated the only two articles I created for deletion. Coincidence? I think not. why target two, totally unrelated articles which I happened to create?

<li><b>Delete</b>, or at worst, <b>redirect</b> to whichever target houses it. Thoroughly non-notable song in its own right. If Captain EO is the only reason people might search it, house the info in Captain EO. By no means does this merit its own article. GassyGuy 22:42, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_EO_037a.html" title="Captain EO">Captain EO</a>.

<li><b>WITHDRAWAL BY SHAANXIQUAKE</b> This has gone far enough. The only reason I voted for this article was because it was Paaerduag's, and we've had a 'history' on wikipedia. I don't want to be blamed again for vandalism. So I withdraw this, because the act of nominating it was purely so that Paaerduag's work would be deleted. I'm already on a thin string (been blocked before) so this is it. I WITHDRAW THIS AFD BECAUSE IT WAS PURELY CREATED ON THE BASIS OF REMOVING THE ARTICLE FOR A PERSONAL VENDETTA. --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaanxiquake_988d.html" title="User:Shaanxiquake">Shaanxiquake</a> 04:02, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Interesting. There still seems to be a view from a number of editors (myself included) that this song is not notable enough for its own article and should be merged.

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Definate Withdrawl</b> we all know that song articles start out as stubs, and there are also a lot of song articles on wikipedia that are not notable, but no one deletes them. I actually think this is notable, despite my above abhorrence and offensiveness to Paaerduag. I really hope that you will understand that I don't want this article to be deleted anymore. I would feel so guilty if it was. I know that it's only fledgling but I feel it should stay. it was in bad faith that I nominated this anyway. PLEASE don't remove it, or me and paaerduag will start feuding all over again. I don't want this removed. Please just agree to let it stay so that Paaerduag can expand it at his own time. I don't want to be blocked again, or have another row with paaerduag. Please, just let's keep the article. I'm begging you. I don't want to be associated with bad faith nominations anymore. --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaanxiquake_988d.html" title="User:Shaanxiquake">Shaanxiquake</a> 05:05, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Comment/Question</b></s> <b>Delete</b> Is there any sign that the information in this article could be cited and footnoted? Yes, it reads like an original paper on the subject, but the TOPIC of the history and development of political parties in the US is certainly an encyclopaedic one. I find it impossible to believe there haven't been dozens of scholarly works on the subject, so a wikipedia article summarizing those works would be a valuable addition to political and historical projects. That said...this article in its current uncited form does not appear to be that article, but I'm wondering if it could be made into that article. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 04:27, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is original and describes things very well. There is no need to delete these valuable works such as these. Very educational and I really took my time while writing this. Please do not delete this, let us all work together to make this more wikipediaish, or w/e you guys say. after reading countless wikipedia articles, i think this has a higher quality than others!--<a href="../../../m/r/a/User%7EMrahman1991_f2d0.html" title="User:Mrahman1991">Mrahman1991</a> 00:45, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - While it might be educational, it does not fit into Wikipedia policies. Please read <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a>. -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> 00:50, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../m/r/a/User%7EMrahman1991_f2d0.html" title="User:Mrahman1991">Mrahman1991</a>: It's obvious you can write, and you're certainly willing and interested in developing a full article on a subject. These are wonderful traits in a wikipedia editor and I hope you continue working here. However <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeff3000_72a5.html" title="User:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a> is correct that the problem here is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a>. You've presented an original thought without citation or reference, which is acceptable in many fora, but not here. Wikipedia is a <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html#Primary.2C_secondary.2C_and_tertiary_sources" title="WP:NOR">tertiary source</a> that reports on information that has already been published in peer reviewed verifiable sources. However, since it would indeed be unfortunate if your pages were deleted outright, I would suggest you copy both of your current articles to your <a href="../../../m/r/a/User%7EMrahman1991_sandbox_0a57.html" title="User:Mrahman1991/sandbox">sandbox</a> and work on them there. If you can reference your assertions from acceptable sources, I see no reason why some of your information can't be merged into other articles on the subjects at a future date (note: this suggestion is if the two articles are in fact set for deletion at the end of these discussions, which currently seems to be likely) -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 19:30, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
