<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>I count 11 clear "delete" votes (including 1 from <a href="../../../s/e/e/User%7ESeesdifferent_a9d7.html" title="User:Seesdifferent">User:Seesdifferent</a> who forgot to sign his post), 12 "keep" votes (2 anons and 1 probable troll discounted) and one "merge" vote from <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkysmith_c555.html" title="User:Skysmith">Skysmith</a> who put one too many tildes in the signature).

<p>This is a non-notable high school. It should be <b>Deleted</b>. --<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHoldek_fada.html" title="User:Holdek">Holdek</a> 00:31, Mar 6, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, vanity. Sigh. I wish people were at least willing to come to the table to hash out a compromise on these instead of leaving everyone to fight it out three times a day, every day. —<a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorath_83d6.html" title="User:Korath">Korath</a> (<a href="../../../k/o/r/User_talk%7EKorath_cda5.html" title="User talk:Korath">Talk</a>) 02:17, Mar 6, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What kind of compromise would you like? I suggest a {{improve-school}} tag, which spells out what a school article should contain to make it interesting/useful enough for inclusion. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 08:45, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think a centralized discussion on schools would be in order. We are indeed repeating our arguments nearly daily; it should be possible for us to reach a consensus through discussion. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 10:48, Mar 6, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I was thinking more of guidelines for inclusion à la <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Music_Notability_and_Music_Guidelines_9d02.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Music/Notability and Music Guidelines</a>. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_BEEFSTEW_8c5d.html" title="User:Dpbsmith/BEEFSTEW">BEEFSTEW</a>'s a step in the right direction, though I regret to say I've mostly been using it like "this article is so terrible, even the radical inclusionist party should be embarrassed to vote keep for it". I think a mere {{improve-school}} template is just another way of saying that every school is worthy of inclusion, an opinion that I respect but emphatically disagree with. I'm sure everyone agrees that every country should be in Wikipedia, and not every fire hydrant should; the contention is where the line should be drawn. That every town in the world, even those with no more than six inhabitants, should have its own article seems like overkill, though I'm willing to accept it for consistency; that every high school - let alone middle and elementary schools! - in every town also should is well on the other side of the line. There's really very little to say about most of them other than location, number of students, mascot, football team name, and similar, and such is better suited to an almanac than an encyclopedia. I also remain of the opinion that, of the school articles that get created on Wikipedia, at least ninety-nine out of every hundred are vanity pages. —<a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorath_83d6.html" title="User:Korath">Korath</a> (<a href="../../../k/o/r/User_talk%7EKorath_cda5.html" title="User talk:Korath">Talk</a>) 12:00, Mar 6, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I don't see why notability shouldn't be a criteria. We use it for bands, people, companies, books and more. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveTheRed_7799.html" title="User:DaveTheRed">DaveTheRed</a> 04:28, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Notability is a <i>de facto</i> criterium, because of the amount of people that use it, and the amount of articles that are deleted <i>by the consensus</i> because of being not notable. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 10:48, Mar 6, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Delete: The "notability isn't spelled out in the deletion guidelines" argument is wearisome and false. At any rate, the difficulty for me with schools has always been that an article must give a reason for the school having a character that sets it apart. "It affects lives" doesn't work, because the local gas station affects lives. "Noted Person X went there" also doesn't work for me, unless the school <i>as a particular school</i> had some effect that can be identified in making the fame (e.g. <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._D._Salinger_afb8.html" title="J. D. Salinger">J. D. Salinger</a>'s prep school would have a good case to make, but <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_Kinsey_07a5.html" title="Alfred Kinsey">Alfred Kinsey</a>'s high school wouldn't). In this case, we have the bare facts of the school followed by a student's idea of highlights that go back 2 years and a student's ideas of the administration (that the principal's sexual orientation was a reason for removal is shocking, if this is a public school, as it absolutely is illegal to do something like that). Nothing makes this school a uniquely identifiable or significant entity. Those seeking to learn about it will do better with the county court records. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 04:59, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a school.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 06:42, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, and cleanup possible POV/unverifiable. The article explains various interesting facts about the school, and schools particular characters are important to their local areas. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 07:21, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. No evidence of notability. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 07:24, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> until notability established. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 10:48, Mar 6, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I might be willing to accept the first two paragraphs if the 'top 100' claim would provide an external cite. Presidents visiting a school isn't exceptional - politicians tend to do a lot of these things, particularly when an election is coming up. Minor, amateur, age-group sporting stuff, boring. So, a potential claim to note followed by lots of irrelevent padding which is better off in your own webpages somewhere. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 14:59, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: A BEEFSTEW of nine is the best I've ever seen before. You should DEFINITELY keep this. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathwiz2020_b5ad.html" title="User:Mathwiz2020">mathwiz2020</a> 11:07, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>A) +1</b>: The article is more than two sentences.</li>
<li><b>B) +1</b>: There is one coherent paragraph of text.</li>
<li><b>C) +1</b>: Assuming each character is one byte, the article is more than 2000 bytes (excluding the Votes for Deletion header).</li>
<li><b>D) +1</b>: There are more than three facts. <i>(OAR members attended Wootton, President Bush visited Wootton, and the cheerleading scandal.)</i></li>
<li><b>E) +1</b>: There is a photograph.</li>
<li><b>F) +1</b>: Yes, the members of the band OAR are alumni of Wootton and, considering they played at Wolftrap (a very prestigious honor), they are notable enough to be the subject of a Wikipedia article.</li>
<li><b>G) +1</b>: President Bush visiting the school appeared in a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2001/10/images/20011030-7.html" class="external text" title="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2001/10/images/20011030-7.html" rel="nofollow">White House press release</a>.</li>
<li><b>H) +1</b>: The Science Bowl and Cross Country teams make the school notable AND do not fall under F or G.</li>
<li><b>I) +1</b>: Pleasing an alumnus is a matter of opinion but, in my opinion, it would. ESPECIALLY since it mentions some 2004 alumni.</li>
<li><b>J) +0</b>: Well, a teacher could learn that many teachers are often fired, but I wouldn't give the tenth point to Wootton.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>OUTTAHERE</b> In all things, seek what is the essence... Wiki is a reference work, imho. Schools have large professional websites <b>full</b> of information.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>.
