<p>The result was <b>no consensus</b>; despite <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">SPAs</a>, and despite the armwaving nature of some of the arguments for keep, there isn't a sufficiently coherent case for deletion - some of the links presented are passing mentions, but crucially not all.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that insufficiently-sourced 'controversies' (forum posts do not meet <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source guidelines</a>) should be reverted on sight. That's not a judgement formed from this AfD, that's cornerstone encyclopaedia policy. Perhaps those personally involved with the site should <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">avoid editing the article</a> - and if that leaves no interested editors to work on it, perhaps this would merit another AfD in the near future to form a clearer consensus from outside editors, without prejudice from this one. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 01:28, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>If you could establish that it's the "biggest compliation [sic]" through a reliable outside source that might help sway some editors (such as myself) to share your opinion. If it's so large then surely there are outside sources such as prominent boxing and sports media that mention the website, right?

<li><b>Commment</b>Hey...I have no problem with the Criticism, but if it is to stay up then so should the Comment about the Criticism comment only being the view of a couple of people and certainly not the view od all wikipedians...that's a clear way to resolve the issue. You want it up fine, but I want it to be clear that it is only the view of a couple of people...can you live with that, or is your grudge just too bad to have a opposing voice...after all, wiki stresses opposing views in an article! And Beaumontproject joined only a few days ago also and the boxrec page and the John Duddy page is the only thing he has edited. And also for the record...I belong to several boxing organizations...what kind of orgs do you two cats beloing to to make such claims about boxing...are you the press?--<a href="../../../o/z/z/User%7EOzzwald35_1c5e.html" title="User:Ozzwald35">Ozzwald35</a> 16:23, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Commment</b> I welcome criticism as long as it is constructive! Just stop making wholesale deletions.

<li><b>Commment</b>Netsnipe - you obviously havent looked around the site - boxrec is quoted in countless boxing articles, you obviously have no knowledge of the subject and should probably stick to subject that you do know about. First you said it was NN, that was proved wrong, then that it was a directory- thats wrong - what next?? In fact if you search Wiki for "boxrec" you get over 800 hits!!! <a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> 19:46, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strongly Keep</b> Its a strong well known tool for boxing data. Why not delete <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a> page while you are at it?

<li><b>Definitely Keep</b> - Boxrec is the only site on the net which has the records of pretty much all active professional fighters (and thousands of retired boxers!). It's a vital source of information for ALL boxing fans. How can you even consider deleting this vital boxing website from Wiki? Many professional boxers have a boxrec hyperlink on their personal websites to show everyone their career results, which merely emphasizes how important Boxrec is! - LAWLLB</li>

<p>If Boxrec is all it's saying, surely it wouldn't be too hard to rectify it's mistake and change Duddy's nationality.</p>
