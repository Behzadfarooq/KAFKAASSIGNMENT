<li><b>ASIAN WISCONZINE</b> It had enough info until it was "cleaned up" by ZimZalaBim. --alden pascual</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - the person, not the magazine got the award. Of course, they're probably pretty much one and the same. Any idea how many of these awards the SBA gives out? And what's the level of real merit for a journalism award given out by the SBA anyway? Is the criteria good journalism, or is it just turning a profit sooner than expected? <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 04:16, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Here are some points for your consideration:</b></li>
</ul>
<p>1. The MAGAZINE is the FIRST AND ONLY ALL-INCLUSIVE MAGAZINE IN WISCONSIN. It is a milestone in itself. 2. <b>The publisher has received various certificates of recognition from the governor of Wisconsin, the Dane County executive, and the Mayor of the City of Madison</b>3. Most recently, the publisher and editor received the 2006 Journalist of the year award for the State of Wisconsin from the US Small Business Administration. 4. Asian Wisconzine is the ONLY VENUE for discussions of issues being faced by Asian Americans in contemporary America. It is a printed magazine with an online version distributed free in hundreds of retail outlets in Wisconsin, and has hundreds of paid subscribers in the academe, professional circles, neighborhood centers, and individual homes.</p>
<p>Like I said, the award is for the publisher and editor which she received because of the magazine. The magazine has already covered a lot of issues and can be viewed on the website's archives (www.asianwisconzine.com). The award can be verified at www.sba.gov as a pdf file. (<a href="http://www.sba.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/wi_milwaukee/wi_pr0611.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.sba.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/wi_milwaukee/wi_pr0611.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.sba.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/wi_milwaukee/wi_pr0611.pdf</a>) -Alden Pascual</p>

One minor, regional award is not enough to merit the inclusion of an article on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Delete</b>. It was clearly started as an advertisement, and one award doesn't make it notable enough to stay. While I am sympathetic to minority groups, especially in America, I'm not sympathetic enough to let this stay. Also, this is another case of the word 'Asian' being used only to refer to people from East Asian countries, like China and Japan. Asia is a gigantic continent, stretching from Palestine to Japan, with more cultural diversity than any other continent. Please learn this. I could go on about how 'race' hasn't been an accepted concept in Anthropology since the '60s, but you get the picture. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack-Velvet_7592.html" title="User:Black-Velvet"><font face="Rage Italic" size="3" color="black">Black-Velvet</font></a> 07:37, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>
<ul>
<li>Now, why do you have to make it about an issue of race? The word "ASIAN" is used primarily to name the magazine, in case you didn't think about that. I am tired of all of this. Just delete it so you can satisfy your ignorance and only chance of overpowering someone. -alden pascual</li>

<p><b>Wikipedia improves through not only the hard work of more dedicated members, but also through the often anonymous contributions of many curious newcomers. All of us were newcomers once, even those careful or lucky enough to have avoided common mistakes, and many of us consider ourselves newcomers even after months (or years) of contributing.</b></p>
<p>New contributors are prospective "members" and are therefore our most valuable resource.

<dd>Keeping all articles made by newbies and respecting mewbie edits are two very different things.

Being a magazine isn't notable; being the first (anything)-in-Wisconsin is probably not notable; being the first (ethnic group)-(anything)-in-Wisconsin even less so. Being in a local time capsule (link given as evidence by creator) isn't notable. Simultaneously claiming it's an "Asian" magazine and "ALL-INCLUSIVE MAGAZINE" (whatever that means) at the same time sounds like grasping for excuses - not that it's evidence of non-notability in itself. Author invites people to come to Madison WI to get proof - lack of verifiability outside Madison <i>is</i> strong evidence of non-notability. (P.S. to Alden Pascual: Implying that Wikipedians have some agenda and "don't want us to express our voice or even to show our existence" doesn't help you look reliable.) --<a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7ECloseapple_0d0e.html" title="User:Closeapple">Closeapple</a> 11:25, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
