<li><b>Keep it</b> - It's just a page to catalogue the history of the game, which the players are very proud of and spend lots of time on. Just because certain people don't appreciate the game doesn't give you the right to try and delete the article about it. As you can tell by the external links, this game has been written up in other places, it has a big history behind it, and many dedicated members. I also find the term "fancruft" to be very offensive. <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahalia56_48fb.html" title="User:Mahalia56">Mahalia56</a> 03:18, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I usually use the term "fancruft" sparingly. This article does not have a professional or neutral tone, and harms Wikipedia, and if not for other users by possibly providing a biased or possibly unverified point of view. The community owns the articles, not the individual. It may well be played in many other areas, but there are no third party references to verify, nor does it try to assert its notability neutrally. We do have the right to attempt to delete articles we genuinely think do not belong in Wikipedia, bad faith nominations are <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> violations.

<dd>Well we've spent lots of time editing this article, and for someone like yourself to come along and decide it should be deleted... it's disheartening to say the least. We're constantly trying to make it better as we are not yet Wikipedia experts. Also keep in mind not everybody's first-language is English.

<dd>First thing, trim and formalise the article. Make us understand what it actually is. Establish its notability. Use formal language. If people spend a lot of time on it, then surely, they can spend a lot of time making even better so it can be saved? Provide evidence of its impact on culture or the world. Then, yes, I will change my vote.

<li>Fine here's a compromise. Firstly, information has to be trimmed a bit, there's way too many tables with too little context. Secondly, until the awards ceremony doesn't have a huge impact, or at least it has a smaller impact that the Urapopstar concept as a whole. I suggest <b>merging and redirecting</b> the awards page to this one. Then <b>cleanup</b> is needed for the page. I will then vote <b>weak keep</b>. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 04:36, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Are there better ways of removing vandalism and deleting possibly detrimental articles? You tell me. It is very likely I will vote keep for this article, anyhow. The idea is to determine consensus by calling an requests for comment for deletion, which is what afd is. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 14:09, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>No change in my vote. The article still does not provide any proof of notability beyond a brief reference in print media and a review in an online paper. No verification is provided for the article's bald claim that it has received "a large amount of web traffic." Most of the article is nothing but a summary of what happens on the "pop charts" within its fictional world, without that context even being consistently clear. It reminds me of the cruft we've been forced to repeatedly delete that documented message board flamewars as if they were a topic worthy of Ken Burns. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 19:18, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
