<p><b>Delete</b>.This description of a lebanese city, Jounieh, is more of a tourist brochure than a real article (see for yourself). So I started a <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stub.html" title="Stub">stub</a> article <a href="../../../j/o/u/Jounieh.html" title="Jounieh">Jounieh</a> that would have a more encyclopedic content (in addition to a more suitable name) <a href="../../../5/0/0/User%7E500LL_0dba.html" title="User:500LL">500LL</a> 16:26, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>After making a Google search, I found out that it is taken from this <a href="http://www.jounieh.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.jounieh.org/" rel="nofollow">site</a>. But this is not the only problem: It's content is not encyclopedy-like (read it for yourself), it's like taken from a touristic brochure.

<li>Now marked as a copyvio. That is a deletable offense (but should be reported on <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_b9ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems">Wikipedia:Copyright problems</a>, not here). The fact that the original version was poorly written, however, is not usually considered a good argument for deletion. More often that not, that's cause for {{cleanup}}.

A notice that the article was unencyclopedic was removed by another user, as was a previous move-to-Wiktionary notice.

<li><b>Delete</b>. If anybody thinks it is a notable fact about Heinlein that his publisher decided to print three of his novels together, then it should be mentioned in the Heinlein article, or perhaps in the articles about the novels. (We have an article on each of the three novels already.) If a particular edition of a novel or compilation of novels was so notable to book collectors or for some other reason then we could conceivably have articles about them. For example, perhaps the term "Heinlein Trio" occurs frequently in discussions of his work. But the independent notability would have to be established.

<dd>If you've had speaking roles in released films and you're not on the IMDb then you haven't been trying.

<li>I would say that appearing in 8 feature films (albiet indie ones), plus television work, makes her a professional actress by just about any reasonable measure. There are loads of actors out there who would love to work that regularly. Think of how many actors don't even make it to their first or second feature film role, much less their eighth! If you're asking me to prove that she's not also a waitress or something on the side, I can't, but even if she did have another job it wouldn't necessarily make her not a professional actress. The body of work alone proves it. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 13:09, Feb 11, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think "feature film" gives too much credibility to these movies. First of all, they aren't films at all; they were shot on video. Second, all Diane Mela's movies are by the same guy, Legge. Looking at IMDb, none of the movies report making any gross. The only reported budget (for Honey Glaze) is $2000, which, after subtracting technical costs there is maybe a few hundred dollars left over to pay all actors and crew. And that's a later, and therefore likely higher budget movie. I see no television appearances listed. So what we have here is a friend of a very minor B-movie director who appears, either for free or for pennies, in these movies he makes, which never seem to make it to theatres. Here's what an online reviewer and self-proclaimed Legge "expert" said: "We’re talking zero-budget DIY film-making here - shot for very cheap on location on video camera using friends, neighbours and family as actors." There may be actors who might want to work that regularly (if you can call 7 roles in 16 years "regular") but probably not for free. Sorry, but I just can't see how she can be professional. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 18:07, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>COMMENT</b> I think we have the answer why this R. demon is all hepped up about wanting to delete these actors. It's because with his own words on this page he says that IMDB will list anyone on the IMDB if they've worked on any film and yet he doesn't even rank "anyone" with his bit of extra work on The Time Machine. <b>He's a want-to-be actor himself!</b> He's just jealous of these people! You don't "do" extra work unless you want to be an actor!!! Also, note that his friends who have made films aren't on IMDB either!!! So they must be really low on the totem pole too!!!&#160;:) lol <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlank_08b6.html" title="User:Plank">Plank</a> 00:16, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Interesting theory, albeit completely retarded. Could I be on IMDb for being an extra in a single movie? I don't know; I haven't tried, because that would be pathetic. And my friends who have made films actually <i>are</i> on IMDb, and I find it odd you would say they're not considering you know absolutely nothing about them. Am I jealous of Diane and Robin? Well, somehow being in a handful of universally panned B-movies without making a dime off it doesn't sound like a dream come true. I suppose they might have been fun to make though. No, if I'm jealous of anyone I doubt it's Michael Legge's friends and neighbors. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 00:26, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, I will not keep my observations quiet. My name is being bandied about by fiend and even on other VFD's! It is being implied that I am advertising or that I am part of a plot! Half the articles I began to work on have been deleted! There must be a motive to these people attacking all my contributions! I have a right to make these comments and I'd like to see you shut me up. You have a real nerve Gamaliel singling me out to chastise. Is it policy for users to personally attack people that articles are written about. I've noticed fiend making fun of casting aspertions at and insulting almost every person of whose article he has voted to delete. Some of the things he has said could be considered slander! You are in fact personally attacking me Gamaliel by posting your comments here you could easily have left me a message. Peoples motives are important this demon fellow is abusing VFD and is following all my edits and contributions around. He has even accused me and others of vadalizing Wikipedia because we contributed to articles that he did not like. What do you call that? I call that grossly stepping over the bounds of civility. Where were you then. I don't care if you are an administrator don't you dare single me out to yell at and neglect any others who have been campaigning against all my articles and have been making comments about me "personally." <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlank_08b6.html" title="User:Plank">Plank</a> 03:27, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Personally, I'd like to see any evidence backing up anything Plank has just accused me of. There should be a record of it somewhere if it's true. Sure, I've made an occasional quip about some of the people who have articles, and their weak claims to notability (and I am by no means alone in doing so), but I hardly see how that qualifies as "abuse" or "slander". I suspect Plank thinks I'm "following him around" because I nominated to delete a bunch of "actor" substubs he created (these two included), but all that involved was a simple peek at the page for that "Democrazy" movie he is so cracy about; they were all right there. And he might want to note that I did not nominate "Democrazy" for deletion, nor did I even vote to delete it when someone else did, so this is hardly a vendetta. Someone needs to take his pills (oh, is that slander?). -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 06:13, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Wikipedia is for the general public, not academics who are already away of all the semantic finesses. Relevant information should be made available in the most convenient possible way providing that the article does not break any policies.

<dd>Thank you for your reply. I don't understand what you mean when you said "semantic finesses". Do you mean to say that Wikipedia users might not be aware that "Duchess" is the feminine of "Duke"? I find it hard to believe, but if that is so, how about a redirect to <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_of_Cornwall_4e4b.html" title="Duke of Cornwall">Duke of Cornwall</a>? The story of the title is already there. <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess.html" title="Princess">Princess</a> redirects to <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince.html" title="Prince">Prince</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empress.html" title="Empress">Empress</a> redirects to <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emperor.html" title="Emperor">Emperor</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/c/Duchess.html" title="Duchess">Duchess</a> redirects to <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke.html" title="Duke">Duke</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/u/Countess.html" title="Countess">Countess</a> redirects to <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count.html" title="Count">Count</a> etc. <a href="../../../d/u/k/Category%7EDukedoms_d1ef.html" title="Category:Dukedoms">Category:Dukedoms</a> shows that this has been the standard, and I believe this is more pratical than having a fork for every feminine form of the title.

<li>Your comment is even more apropos given the special characteristics of the title Duke of Cornwall. There is never a Duchess of Cornwall in her own right. Duchess of Cornwall is a <a href="../../../s/t/y/Style_%28manner_of_address%29.html" title="Style (manner of address)">style</a>, a <a href="../../../c/o/u/Courtesy_title.html" title="Courtesy title">courtesy title</a>, not an actual title. Indeed, until the Camilla Bowles situation developed it has generally been a secondary courtesy title, since the wife of the heir to the throne is entitled to use the style Princess of Wales, which is a higher title. We have several articles already explaining British peerage and titles, courtesy titles, styles, etc. We also have a couple of articles which include the same material as in this article covering the Camilla Parker Bowles situation. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 22:20, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>BM, I guess I missed something in this discussion. People just come here and vote based on an argument which I contested on the first few minutes of the VfD vote: that the history of the title is already covered in <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_of_Cornwall_4e4b.html" title="Duke of Cornwall">Duke of Cornwall</a>. It seems people are giving their opinion without even bothering to read what others have to say on this topic. Am I being ignored for violating some Wikipedia policy or guideline?

I would support keeping it as an article on "Regan, Duchess of Cornwall" or as a disambiguation page with links to "Camilla Parker-Bowles", Duke of Cornwall" and "Regan, Duchess of Cornwall" but as a stand alone article about Mrs. Parker-Bowles it doesn't make much sense.

<p>"Keep". It should, however, be expanded. The style of "Duchess of Cornwall" has had usage in the 20th century. After the accession of Edward VII to the throne on the death of Queen Victoria, his son, Prince George, the Duke of York, was not immediately created Prince of Wales. There is some thought that Queen Alexandra was a driving force behind it because she did not want someone else known as the Princess of Wales given her long connection with the title. Prince George and Princess May were, therefore, known as TRH The Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York until he was created Prince of Wales late in 1901. User:GaryR 12:07, 14 Feb 2005 (EST)</p>

<li>It just occured to me that naming an article 'Duke of wherever' is invalid anyhow, unless that title has been held by just one person. If all the 'Duke of...' articles were renamed 'Duchy of....' you could have a history of the Duchy (which most of the 'Duke of' articles seem to be anyhow) plus internal links to individual Dukes AND Duchesses of wherever.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - there are many individual years articles in Wikipedia going right up to individual years several centuries hence. You'd need to put a VfD on a lot of pages. If someone has an astronomical prediction to make for the year 2100, or if a piece of fiction takes place in that year, it makes it a valid article.

<dd>I'm sorry to tell you this, but you're deeply mistaken and might wish to consult any standard reference text for a quick refresher on the difference between a <i>language</i> and a <i>dialect</i>. Further, my use of the word <i>intelligible</i> was a reference to its use in the article, as an example of (and commentary on) its unencyclopedic tone. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 04:48, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'm quite familiar with the debate over what is a "language" and what is a "dialect" and some political/cultural factors often factor into people's decision over whether to call something a language or a dialect, but current usage of what constitutes a language in a purely linguistic sense seems to be based on mutual intelligibility, which is admittedly hardly a straightforward criterion, and many continuums and varying degrees of intelligibility exist that cloud the issue, e.g. Dutch/German, Danish/Norwegian/Swedish, Hindi/Urdu, etc. If it is a mixture of Italian and New England English, this could mean many things from a full-fledged pidgin (unlikely but such things are known to happen) to English with some Italian words and a heavy accent, and if the mutual intelligibility of this speech with American English is in question I think we should keep the content to see if we can further investigate the matter rather than simply deleting it. — <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELivajo_e5ea.html" title="User:Livajo">Ливай</a> | <a href="../../../l/i/v/User_talk%7ELivajo_0eb6.html" title="User talk:Livajo">☺</a> 08:14, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Huh? This has <i>nothing</i> to do with any political debate over some spoken dialect with characteristics of a discreet language and I guess I should repeat, my use of the term <i>intelligible</i> was meant as a comment on the article's tone, not the characteristics of the dialect. The question addressed by this VfD is whether or not this specific local neighbourhood dialect is encyclopedic (there are thousands of these around the world, they're a natural phenomenon of language). <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 17:04, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Newton is a close suburb of Boston with a population of about 90,000 in all, and 12% of the population is of Italian ancestry. Nonantum (The Lake) is one of 14 "villages" within Newton, and is predominantly Italian-American. Newton is a cosmopolitan, quite wealthy, suburb and it is hard to believe that any neighborhood of it would be isolated enough to develop a distinctive and enduring dialect beyond a few minor vocabulary variations. The obituary referenced above says the dialect was created by "a few old-timers" who blended Italian, English, and Romany (Gypsy). That doesn't sound very notable, but if it has some linguistic or social characteristics that have made it of interest to scholars, I'll change my vote. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 14:32, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Rename</b> (and disambiguate) or <b>delete</b>. The term 'Climate theory' is much more often used in the context of <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weather.html" title="Weather">weather</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/t/Meteorology.html" title="Meteorology">meteorology</a>, and <a href="../../../c/l/i/Climate_change.html" title="Climate change">climate change</a> than to refer to the good Baron's theory. Perhaps a disambiguation page at this title, with appropriate links to climate, weather, and psychology topics? I fear that a plain redirect would <i>not</i> take most people where they wanted to go. If there is a substantial amount to be said on the topic then move this article to Climate theory (psychology) or something similar. Otherwise it can quite happily exist as a section within the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_de_Secondat%2C_Baron_de_Montesquieu_27c6.html" title="Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu">Baron of Montesquieu's</a> article. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> | <a href="../../../n/a/m/User_talk%7EName_00f8.html" title="User talk:Name">Talk</a> 16:50, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> is correct. This is neither original research nor patent nonsense. It is the discredited theory of a historical figure. I'm not sure it deserves an independent article, however.

Given that it is discredited, I don't know what could be added. I'm inclined to <b>redirect</b> for now. Future editors can turn it into a disambiguation page when they need it later.

<li>Further comment: I am slowly going through my paper references (books and magazines) looking for dates to add to these timeline pages from railroad history around the world. As railroading in the US began in earnest in the mid 1830s, it's quite likely that I'll find additional births to add to the 1795 page. Since I don't know what they are off the top of my head, I can't just blindly add them, but add them as I find them. <a href="../../../s/l/a/User%7ESlambo_7b8d.html" title="User:Slambo">slambo</a> 19:23, Jan 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>It appears that this nomination was never placed on the main VfD page. So, to be fair, I'm adding it today.

<li>This page should not be deleted. How would Christians or Jews like it if we deleted their page? Also, this page said that this a new religion! Why would it be on Google yet? It apparently has been kept quiet until now because of fear of people not accepting it as a religion. I certainly accept Christianity and Judaism and all the others, but I don't believe in them. Just because you don't believe in it doesn't mean everyone doesn't!!! You need to leave this page on because some people do believe in a Great-Concrete-Pack-Mule being the god. You say that it is unbelievable, but its only as unbelieveable as the Christian "God", or the Egyptian Gods, or whatever religion YOU are. i mean, how outrageous is it that "God" created everything? I have a hard time believing that, and scientific facts have an easy time of backing me up. All religions have a beginning, most back in the so called "BC" times, but this one was created more recently. To end, why don't you try thinking about all the crazily insane stuff in YOUR religion, and then you will see that it is not a good thing to do to criticise other people's religions. <i>unsigned comment by anonymous user:24.18.105.189</i>
