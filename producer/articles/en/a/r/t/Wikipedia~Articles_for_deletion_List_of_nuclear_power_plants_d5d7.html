There would be nothing wrong with having this list in the larger article except it might make the article too long.

Now I'm editing the list of nuclear power plants by adding features I said, but I'm afraid when matter will go to USA's power plants 52K size limit be reached again--VAR-loader 19:45, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>And now that I look at it, the whole thing could do with a face-lift. How about we shift USA's list into a new page and expand on that there? At the same time, Canada,China,France, ie. all countries occupying major size on that page shifted to new pages. If all the larger countries have links, the page will turn tiny. I'd be happy to take this on as a project, and expand on those individual pages later... <span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../x/c/e/User%7EXcentaur_defa.html" title="User:Xcentaur">xCentaur</a> | <a href="../../../x/c/e/User_talk%7EXcentaur_db5b.html" title="User talk:Xcentaur"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span> 19:50, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Question</b> This is confusing. What is being done? A "List of nuclear power plants" is useful. It's the sort of information people seek on the internet. By country would be good. <b>Keep</b> if this is what is going on, namely the discussion of whether or not to keep this list. A nuclear power plant is not the same as a nuclear reactor. A List of nuclear reactors could be a page with links to the various types of lists, although there are so many small research reactors, it seems unwieldy. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 20:43, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I think it would be better to present list of nuclear power plant as a tables with detailed information by world regions, countries and plants.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The tables do carry useful information, especially containing, as they do, the type of reactor at each facility.

<li><b>Comment</b> So, then List of nuclear submarines, should also be a redirect to List of nuclear reactors, because nuclear submarines, like nuclear power plants, contain nuclear reactors?

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Where it turned up is that nuclear submarines, just like nuclear power plants, have nuclear reactors. You're suggesting that something with a nuclear reactor, nuclear power plants, be redirected to nuclear reactors. I'm asking if everything with a nuclear reactors should be redirected to nuclear reactors. Power plants, just like submarines have different types, coal-fired, natural gas, riveted boilers, welded boilers, different types of turbines, different types of coolants. So, nuclear power plants and nuclear submarines both have nuclear reactors. If nuclear power plants should be redirected to nuclear reactors, shouldn't everything else with nuclear reactors be redirected to nuclear reactors? And if not, why not? And if other things with nuclear reactors are not redirected to List of nuclear reactors, why should power plants with nuclear reactors be redirected there? By your submarine answer it seems that nuclear power plants should not be listed in List of nuclear reactors, but rather in List of power plants. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 20:13, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> As for power plants, well, of course they're not all nuclear. Maybe I fail to see the point you're bringing up... you wish to redirect anything related to nuclear applications to this one page? That would be stretching the concept of encyclopedia integration, no?

<li><b>Comment</b> Again, as above, if not everything, why set aside only power plants with nuclear reactors and require they be redirect to List of nuclear reactors? A nuclear power plant is no more or less a nuclear reactor than a nuclear submarine. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 20:13, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>My most sincere apologies if I offended any reactor purists by even vaguely suggesting that one is <i>more</i> a reactor than the other. The fact of the matter still remains that nuclear submarines deserves to be listed under types of submarines. we're looking at the context here, are we not? as you've explained at length above, different submarines have different types, all the types and sub-types could be listed on one page. on that page would be a little heading 'nuclear submarines', and under that heading it would explain how reactors are used, and somewhere there would be a small link which takes you to 'list of nuclear reactors'. there is a <i>very</i> big difference between linking an article and re-directing one. <span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../x/c/e/User%7EXcentaur_defa.html" title="User:Xcentaur">xCentaur</a> | <a href="../../../x/c/e/User_talk%7EXcentaur_db5b.html" title="User talk:Xcentaur"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span> 20:32, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't think we're even talking about the same subject, so there is not point in continuing. You seem to think that a nuclear reactor is the same thing as a nuclear power plant. It's not! A nuclear reactor is <i><b>not</b></i> a nuclear power plant or vice versa. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 20:41, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I assure you, I know very well what you're talking about, don't clutter this page with your condescending assumptions. You miss my point here. Its absurd to <i>redirect</i> every single page related to reactors to the list in question. <span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../x/c/e/User%7EXcentaur_defa.html" title="User:Xcentaur">xCentaur</a> | <a href="../../../x/c/e/User_talk%7EXcentaur_db5b.html" title="User talk:Xcentaur"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span> 20:51, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not condescending, it's from your statements, and your failure to assert any reason why nuclear power plants, which are not nuclear reactors, should be in a list that redirects to nuclear reactors. That you consider something <i>absurd</i> is simply your POV, as you have offered no evidence for its absurdity, particularly in the face of your asserting, without any reasons, that one category of things that contain nuclear reactors should be treated as if they <i>are</i> nuclear reactors, while other categories of things that contain nuclear reactors should not be treated as if they were nuclear reactors. I have to understand the underlying reasons for a move in order to make a decision. I don't, so I asked. You haven't answered, and you have given no reasons, and you appear to again be equating nuclear power plants with nuclear reactors, as if you don't understand the difference--if you don't understand the difference, there is no point in discussing the issue with, or with you responding to my questions. If you do understand the difference, then user your understanding to clarify for me why you think only one class of things that contain nuclear reactors should be treated as if it is synonymous with nuclear reactors, but others shouldn't. If it's <i>absurd</i> to direct every single page, then why is it not absurd to direct some, and what is the qualifying characteristic for which ones should be redirected and which ones shouldn't? <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 21:56, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just to clarify,the list of nuclear power plants was taken from list of reactors, that is the only reason that I'm saying that we do not need two lists with the same content. Which is why for nuclear power plants, I suggested a re-direct, and not for everything else. Now, you can go ahead and re-direct a dozen pages, with my blessings. I've just lost interest here. <span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../x/c/e/User%7EXcentaur_defa.html" title="User:Xcentaur">xCentaur</a> | <a href="../../../x/c/e/User_talk%7EXcentaur_db5b.html" title="User talk:Xcentaur"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a></span> 05:30, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

I'm going to place links on these articles in "List of nuclear reactors" and to rewrite that article by splitting power plants and research reactors in different sections. So, there's really no need in keeping the existing article "List of nuclear power plants"--VAR-loader 22:43, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The nice list of European reactors by Var-loader (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_power_plants_of_Europe_and_CIS" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_power_plants_of_Europe_and_CIS" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_power_plants_of_Europe_and_CIS</a> ) includes some but not all closures of December 31st 2006 (7 reactors), see PRIS database of IAEA at <a href="http://www.iaea.org/programmes/a2/" class="external free" title="http://www.iaea.org/programmes/a2/" rel="nofollow">http://www.iaea.org/programmes/a2/</a> .<br />
Regarding the <b>plant-reactor</b> discussion, I propose to simply use the general reference for reactors, as eg by the IAEA, numbering the reactors of the same plant (eg: Doel-1, Doel-2, Doel-3 and Doel-4 reactors for the Doel nuclear power plant or NPP). If you make a table, you name the reactors that way in the same column, and it at once makes it clear that they all belong to the same plant. Sorry I am totally new to Wikipedia, hope this comment is ok, sorry if not. --Jputte 13:11, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, this is standard American format, numbering the reactors. I didn't know it was IAEA, also, so, yes, it would have been clear, as the table is not complete, that this was what was done. Always useful to add clarity to a discussion, Jputte, and thanks for contributing.

<p><b>Keep</b> as List of nuclear reactors, further sorted by regions per Var-loader. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 20:57, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Well, I had re-wrote the article <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_nuclear_reactors.html" title="List of nuclear reactors">List of nuclear reactors</a>. Now it contains only non-power plants reactors and links to three lists of nuclear power plants sorted by region and country. France, UK and USA sections of these lists should be expanded. Does anybody help to do it?--VAR-loader 22:18, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>'<i>keep</i>--keep and work out how to divide the material. if it makes sense to have one list for nuclear reacxtors in powerplants and one list for other one, the titles should be changed to maker that clearer.
