<li><b>keep</b> - Declaration of potential conflict of interest: i'm the person who started the page and probably have contributed most of it. Back to the AfD request: Quote from <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>: <b>However, research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is, of course, strongly encouraged.</b> In other words, wikipedia policy <b>encourages</b> us to collect related factoids and organise them. Tom harrison claims that the selection is "selective", but hasn't tried adding what he alleges are the missing factoids. i agree that bias by omission is bias, and have done my best not to omit relevant NPOV facts. IMHO i have not stopped anyone from adding missing facts - please check the history and discussion pages. As for merging into <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States-Iran_relations_7086.html" title="United States-Iran relations">United States-Iran relations</a> or <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran-Israel_relations_beae.html" title="Iran-Israel relations">Iran-Israel relations</a>, the problem is that the conflict involves all three of these countries together; it has only come to crisis in the past few years, especially during 2005-2006; and it is already about 30kb long (source), which is hitting the maximum recommended. A potential name change could be to <b>2005-2006 claimed US-Israeli threats to attack Iran</b>, but then there would need to be some verifiable references claiming that the threats do not exist. <a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBoud_7cef.html" title="User:Boud">Boud</a> 15:00, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>This is a synthesis of facts in so many ways:
<ol>
<li>The mere allegation of "threats" is mere speculation based on current policy. A nuclear-armed NK isn't acceptable either, but it's pretty clear we're not about to attack them.</li>
<li>the three-country link. There's no link between the U.S. and Israel other than expressed concern over Iran's nuclear weapons programme. That's hardly unique and many other nations have expressed such. Yes, they are the most likely to strike Iran, but that's OR and not apropos for this article.</li>
<li>combining "possible attack targets" in this article. I don't see the point of combining this with the threats or perceived threats other than as crystal-balling a future attack.</li>
<li>Motives. When the U.S. hasn't even issued an overt threat to attack, merely stating that it doesn't wish Iran to be armed with nukes, and now we're speculating about oil? Speculation on the motives of a yet-to-happen event is just terrible.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>It seems like this is being written as a precursor for a presumed or predicted Iran-Israel-Iran war. If that happens, go ahead and write up your Precursor, Targets, Motivations, etc. Until then....it's groundless. --<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 18:34, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> -- Interesting that every single Keep vote has come from a non-American. Should I trouble myself to detect some bias there? For my part, I didn't make a judgment on the article's POV, but on its plain original research. Essays and op ed pieces certainly have their place, but encyclopedias are not among them. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 18:11, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, I'm an American, and I think the information should be kept. I don't see as much of an NPOV problem as others do. There's lots of WP articles that have implied perspectives, even if they're simply cultural blind spots. In this case, it's good to have material which provides an alternate viewpoint.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> - the article itself is POV/OR in its title; why bundle the actions of the US and Israel into one article, other than to imply a deeper relationship on this subject between the two nations than a shared concern? I'd consider changing my opinion to split to "US threats..." and "Israeli threats...", though it would still have some POV problems, albeit ones that could possibly be solved by editing. — <a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAKADriver_8b44.html" title="User:AKADriver">AKADriver</a> <a href="../../../a/k/a/User_talk%7EAKADriver_2c54.html" title="User talk:AKADriver"><font color="#FF0000">☎</font></a> 19:26, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The information presented here is not all that bad from a factual standpoint, but the intent is obviously to draw some sort of unique conclusion. Too much crystal ball and too much original research. If it happens, create the article then. There is a reason Americans are keen to delete it, and it's not national pride; it's that this article takes certain concepts for granted that aren't widely believed here. Given that there could be shifts in the foreign policy of the US government after elections this year and in 2008, this could all be so much rubbish anyway. — <a href="../../../a/k/a/User%7EAKADriver_8b44.html" title="User:AKADriver">AKADriver</a> <a href="../../../a/k/a/User_talk%7EAKADriver_2c54.html" title="User talk:AKADriver"><font color="#FF0000">☎</font></a> 19:14, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> ref 1 sounds to me like self-defence (reaction to attack), which is not quite the same as a threat, but could be a non-OR reason for changing the article title; refs 2 and 3 are about Ahmadinejad's remarks, including the misquote of "wiping off the map", which are already in the article <a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBoud_7cef.html" title="User:Boud">Boud</a> 12:00, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Reluctant <b>delete</b>. The article as it stands is strongly POV, but it is commendably well-researched, well-sourced, and contains a useful collection of references to an Iranian perspective on the current crisis. However, I cannot see any way in which it could be turned into an BPOV article, because its raison d'?tre is its attempt to tell the story from an Iranian perspective. To my mind, that's a story worth telling, but not on wikipedia. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> 08:36, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Yes. First of all, the title "Threats to attack Iran" imposes that the US and/or Israel deliberately threaten Iran. It is not the case. Iran actively procures nuclear technologies that will allow it to have nuclear weapons in 5-10 years, while US and Israel react verbally to these actions. It is not a symmetrical situation, and highlighting the threats, as is done in this article, serves Iranian propaganda by making the verbal threats look as frightening as Iran's nuclear plans. Second, every insignificant statement said by any US official is recorded, as if it is really important and reflects an official policy. Again, US officials are just reacting to Iran's actions and statements, which are an order of magnitude worse. All this makes me want to just delete this article and put just a small paragraph about the whole issue in "United States-Iran relations". --<a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabi_S._4020.html" title="User:Gabi S.">Gabi S.</a> 12:46, 11 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree that the title could be changed to something more NPOV, but that is not a reason to delete the article. I don't understand your claim that the threats are not deliberate. How can you accidentally, repeatedly threaten to invade a country? These threats have been repeated numberous times by many high level US political figures. It is widely believed that the US is threatening Iran. It is daily news. Rebels in Iraq have vowed to defend Iran from attack, so they must believe it too. Many writers and commentators, including numberous respected US journalists have commented on these threats. The former UK foriegn minister commented on them. France today declared it would not support such threats. It is notable.</dd>
<dd>You say that US politicians are simply reacting to Iran's actions. By this I assume you mean Iran's production of nuclear fuel. Why do these politicians react to Iran's actions with talk of bombings and invasion, while they give no such reaction to <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/world/latinamerica/articles/2006/04/20/brazil_quietly_pursues_own_nuclear_path/" class="external text" title="http://www.boston.com/news/world/latinamerica/articles/2006/04/20/brazil_quietly_pursues_own_nuclear_path/" rel="nofollow">Brazil's recent announcement of production of nuclear fuel</a>. Surely this difference of responce is notable?</dd>
<dd>Finally, Iran has no proven plans to produce nuclear weapons. The only countries which accuse it of secret plans are the US and Israel. On-one else seems to think there is a great threat. Infact the entire issue of this supposed Iranian conspiracy theory, true or not, has no evidential backing and is based solely on US and Isreali government statements. If this article is deleted, then there is a very strong case to also delete <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction.html" title="Iran and weapons of mass destruction">Iran and weapons of mass destruction</a>. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeabhcan_6ae7.html" title="User:Seabhcan">Seabhcán</a> 13:26, 11 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The article contains no comments from US figures other than speculation from journalists and other outsiders about unnamed high-level officials having made up their minds on the matter, and the official U.S. position which is fairly vague about invasion.</dd>
<dd>WMD is not solely nuclear weapons, there is well cited material regarding Iran's biological and chemical weapons programs in the Iran WMD article.</dd>
<dd>The link between the US and Israel is OR. Until such an event happens and you can point to a link between the two countries, these shouldn't be covered together.</dd>
<dd>Moreover, as I stated above, the article is collected around crystal-balling a potential attack - listing potential targets and motivations. This is silly and absurd when there is only speculation about treats to attack/invade. If and when such an attack is made, these no longer become OR. However, basing an article on speculation is crystal-balling. --<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 15:26, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>President Bush has stated publically "all options are on the table," and specifically refuses to rule out military action. Pretending this is not a threat is naive. Abe Froman 15:23, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Why should he rule out military action, and why would you expect him to, invasion or not? The link is speculative and OR.

<dd>Yes, but I'm not proposing we put my speculation in the article. You are. Bush has said all options are on the table W.R.T. North Korea, as well as the speculated tax hike, for strengthening social security, and many other policies. The belief that "all options are on the table" somehow translates to "we'd really like to do this" is a fallacy and speculative on your part. --<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 16:27, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b> - i think the relevant NPOV definition of <a href="../../../t/h/r/Threat.html" title="Threat">threat</a> in the wikipedia is <i>A threat is also an explicit or implicit message from a person to another that the first will cause something bad to happen to the other, often except when certain demands are met. Often a weapon is used. ... <b>The message may be vague and implicit in an attempt to avoid blame, including legal consequences, while still clear enough to serve its purpose</b>,</i> (<b>emphasis</b> added) except that the definition in our case concerns States, not individual people. i think the last sentence may particularly help for people who think that "All options are open" statements are vague. In a legal system, many options are closed. In a typical legal system, a policeman walking around carrying a gun does <i>not</i> have "all options open" for using that gun; in fact, he has a very restricted set of (legal) possibilities for using that gun. <a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBoud_7cef.html" title="User:Boud">Boud</a> 00:55, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
