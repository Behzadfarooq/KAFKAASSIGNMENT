<p>This is a collective AfD for about two dozen <i>Lists of primary route destinations</i> in English counties. The List of Primary Route Destinations in Wiltshire came up for deletion a few days ago.</p>
<p>Each of these lists a couple of towns in the particular county without comment or context. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a repository for original data or contextless links. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 13:44, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete all</b>. No context. Each entry seems to be little more than a list of major towns, which should be covered by the specific counties' articles. <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithD_2f0d.html" title="User:KeithD">KeithD</a> <a href="../../../k/e/i/User_talk%7EKeithD_fbd8.html" title="User talk:KeithD">(talk)</a> 14:49, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Far from contextless lists, these are lists of primary destinations, the places you'll see on signposts on major roads, and they're grouped by county. They're not all towns, because not all destinations are towns (see List of Primary Route Destinations in Tyne and Wear which includes <a href="../../../t/y/n/Tyne_Tunnel_21cc.html" title="Tyne Tunnel">Tyne Tunnel</a>). I honestly cannot understand what would cause anyone to wish to delete these excellent, useful list articles. As a simple "for instance" example of how they could be extended and improve the organization of information on Wikipedia, the destinations in each list could be annotated with the major roads leading to them, and the articles on these roads in turn could link to the appropriate lists of primary destinations. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 14:57, 12 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In the present state, these lists are absolutely contextless. On their own they are also original data, which does not belong here. One possible outlet for them would be to move the data into the county that they live in. Another would be to put them into a <b>Wikiatlas</b> with the roads that they are linked by. The format of an itinerary (i.e. a road or atlas in words) that you suggest is too clunky to be useful. Even if they were put in the form of an itinerary one would list the cities not by counties but by the road that passes through them. 129.215.195.81 15:41, 12 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure where you get the idea that this is original research. Primary route destinations are designated by, and published by, the Department of Transport. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 16:39, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>C'mon, Tony. This is a scattered travel guide. No one searching for encyclopedic information would look for or in these articles. It can't possibly serve any value to us. / <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmosin_1004.html" title="User:Karmosin">Peter</a> <sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmosin_2125.html" title="User talk:Karmosin">Isotalo</a></sup> 15:58, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete all</b>. Good god, are we going to start making lists for every "destination"? These places <i>have</i> articles. Or use a map! --<a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFang_Aili_a8ed.html" title="User:Fang Aili">Fang Aili</a> 15:38, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Also, it is not clear as to what, exactly, a "primary route destination" is. If this is kept, I suggest changing the name to something else. --<a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFang_Aili_a8ed.html" title="User:Fang Aili">Fang Aili</a> 15:51, 12 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Primary route destinations are well defined in the UK and are commonly included in atlases, maps and gazetteers (and, you may not be aware, encyclopedias competing with Wikipedia do normally incorporate at the very least an excellent atlas). The designation is useful for, for instance, gauging distances on the English and Scottish mainland. One would expect to find in a good encyclopedia tables of primary route destinations and their distances from one other.</li>
<li>I don't buy the proposition that "No one searching for encyclopedic information would look for or in these articles." In fact I find the suggestion simply incredible. Were I looking for information about the political geography and transportation in a county, I'd expect to find a list of the primary destinations of the major roads, and this is precisely function that these really excellent articles provide. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 16:33, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>These lists fail at all the points you raise. They are not maps, they are useless for estimating driving distance between major points or any of the points you mention – really, in which regard are they "excellent articles"? <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 19:07, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete all</b>. Wikipedia shouldn't need to be a handholding guide for someone trying to follow road signs in England.
