<p>This is an article about one of the civilian contractors who was kidnapped in Iraq and eventually beheaded. I am submitting this to VfD as a test case, since there are several such articles. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 02:51, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. While the kidnappings and beheadings of contractors, reporters, etc, in Iraq are incidents that were certainly very notable, the individual contractors are not, and don't warrant encyclopedia articles, Wikipedia not being a memorial. In general, the articles are about the kidnapping/beheading incident not about the person. Accordingly, all of the articles about the individual beheading victims should be deleted, and either a section added to the appropriate article about the Iraq war describing these incidents, or else a new article created covering them. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 02:51, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I agree with BM above. But I don't think this information should get lost, I just don't think it should be on an article by itself. Having information about all the hostages in Iraq in one place would be much better. At first, the appropriate article for this seems to be <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-invasion_Iraq%2C_2003-2005_4f4c.html" title="Post-invasion Iraq, 2003-2005">Post-invasion Iraq, 2003-2005</a>. But that is already too big, so maybe a new article should be created for the hostages. I believe, though, that this will be frowned upon by most VfD voters, who will unfortunately vote "keep" on this one.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a> 04:05, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Keep. He was world news for days (if not weeks) at the time, so is obviously notable, although the article could do with added context. The dozens of others who have been similarly murdered since may not qualify for dedicated articles, but he certainly does.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 04:19, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I have doubts about this. Being in the news for weeks makes this notable for now, but will people remember this a few years in the future?

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm not proposing the information be removed, only that the information currently in multiple articles under the names of the victims, be restructured. The articles aren't really about the victims. In general, I think articles titled with a person's name should be a biographical article about that person. If the outcome of this VfD is Redirect or Merge, it is fine with me. I wish there was some system other than Redirect pages on Wikipedia to index a term or name. Encyclopedias have indexes. If someone is not notable enough to merit an article, but has figured in an important incident, we can have a redirect page titled with the person's name to the incident article . But, there might in fact be several articles mentioning the incident, and a redirect can only be to one other page. The set of redirect pages do not actually form an index, even though sometimes you see people (e.g. Jimbo) say that the redirect pages are like an index. To some extent, Google Advanced Search (where you can limit a search to just en.wikipedia.org) is a workaround, but we are then letting Google decide how Wikipedia should be indexed and the results ordered, and Google results will also include Talk pages, User pages, Wikipedia name space pages, etc. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 14:03, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Consolidating the information about the victims onto one page might be an agreeable option—not for the ones about which there is a good deal written, but for some of them—but you can try that without VfD. It is a reasonable enough point to make that these victims' whole lives are not necessarily encyclopedic, just their involvement in whatever events they are notable for. However, I still vote to keep because I think the organization of the information should be dealt with by the people who work on these articles as they think is appropriate. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 19:36, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>That is true, and it occurred to me to just merge and redirect them myself without getting any sanction from VfD, since one does not have to have admin powers to do that. However, VfD is one of the few places where one can go to test the consensus on an issue like this, although it will tend to be muddied a bit by misplaced (in this case) deletionism versus inclusionism concerns. In contrast, the articles' editors are apt to think the articles should exist, so that doesn't seem like a good place to start. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 20:51, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It would be less muddled if you would say upfront you are hoping for a merge, or would be content with one. The VfD tag says "A request has been made for this article to be deleted".</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Merge</b> into a central article, then redirect. This article has almost nothing about its supposed subject, and the "see also" list is bigger than the article itself!

<li><b>Merge</b> to one article about the series of events, and <b>Redirect</b> each name of someone documented as relevant to that article. These people are in general notable only for their involvement in these kidnappings and deaths (for reasons other than their own individual actions). Admin should review each article for evidence of sufficient notability to warrant keeping. <b>Comment</b>: I believe BM was not attempting to make a destructive point; he posted a test case of one member of a group and asked for a consensus on best course of action. He explained his reasoning in WP-policy-related comments. I have less confidence in RaD Man's constructive intent based on some votes I've seen here in recent weeks, but we all should follow the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith</a> Wikiquette guideline, please. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 00:20, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>It is true that I have a strong tendency to vote for deletion of articles submitted here, and to submit articles from time to time myself. However, you will note that I don't vote delete on all articles. I generally don't throw in many "me too" keep votes, because usually when I would vote keep, the article doesn't need any help from me to be kept. For that matter, I frequently don't bother voting on the obvious "delete" cases, either, although I might if I have something to say. If I cared about being characterized as a "hard core deletionist", I could make plenty of honest "keep" votes to balance things out. However, actually I don't object much to the characterization. I'm not running for anything, and if there are people here who hate my guts because they think I'm a deletionist, that doesn't really bother me. Perhaps I will occasionally persuade someone with arguments, even though he might think I'm a deletionist. I do object to the implication that anybody characterized as "hard core deletionist" cannot possibly be participating in good faith. Suggesting so seems to be overstepping the bounds of civility. I hope that people who object to my perceived "deletionism" will observe Wikipedia strictures about civility, as I generally do, with the occasional lapse for which I apologize in advance. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I'm glad someone has suggested this. These are sad, grubby little articles, all of them, with links to murders, and aggressive reversion of anyone who tries to delete them. Nick Berg's contains four links to the video of his death in the article itself, not just external links, plus a link to a post-murder photograph, perhaps so we can print it out and stick it up as a poster. Others contain the URL to the beheadings via ogrish.com, where you can also watch young girls having sex with horses while you wait for the snuff movie to download. The information about all these victims should be consolidated into one article, written in an encyclopedic way, with some respect for the individuals, no videos, no death pics. It has no chance of happening, but that's my vote anyway. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> 05:31, Feb 13, 2005 (UTC)</li>
