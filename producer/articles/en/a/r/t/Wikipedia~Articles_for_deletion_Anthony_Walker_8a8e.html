<dd>Pavel, I think you meant it does <i>not</i> establish notability? Anyway, it's too earliy to vote on this article, as we don't know what will develop.

<li><b>Delete</b>, Sad as it may be, Wikipedia is not a memorial. And even if it was a lead story, not all lead stories merits their own articles. I would suggest merging this article into one that deals with racism. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInter_454c.html" title="User:Inter">Inter</a>\<sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInter_a37b.html" title="User talk:Inter"><font color="green">Echo</font></a></sup> 13:43, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - as above says if you look at the Stephen Lawrence Wiki entry it begins "Stephen Lawrence (September 14, 1974 - April 22, 1993) was a black British teenager living in London, UK, who was murdered in April 1993 at the age of 18. While waiting at a bus stop with his friend Duwayne Brooks, he was attacked and stabbed by a group of five white teenagers." which is very similar to this one - racist attack starting at bus stop. How can you have one in but not the other? Unlike the trigger-happy states this stuff rarely happens in UK so it is very notable to us, like <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damilola_Taylor_08ad.html" title="Damilola Taylor">Damilola Taylor</a> and SL he will be a household name. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECashandhoes_7429.html" title="User:Cashandhoes">Cashandhoes</a> 14:03, 31 July 2005 (UTC) — <i>(<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECashandhoes_7429.html" title="User:Cashandhoes">Cashandhoes</a>'s <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cashandhoes_a36f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cashandhoes">9th</a> edit.)</i></li>

<dd>Funny, here in the "trigger-happy states", we have very few murders where four white kids embed an axe into a black kid's skull after taunting him for dating a white girl. Or, when British Asians set a Scottish kid on fire by dousing him with petrol. Or, when five white kids stabs a black kid to death. Or, shoot innocent Brazilians.

<dd>Because you lot have guns dished out like cakes whereas they're banned here and hard to get so we need to use other methods to murder! 62.254.64.14 11:18, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> this isn't a "memorial" as such, it's not mourning the death of someone, more info needs adding about the shockwaves this sent around the UK, media/pressure groups reaction in the aftermath of Stephen Lawrence, etc Placidity 16:26, 31 July 2005 (UTC) — <i>(Placidity's <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Placidity_cd89.html" title="Special:Contributions/Placidity">7th</a> edit.)</i></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I'm sure the family and friends of Mr Walker (RIP) will be delighted to see you gimps discussing reasons why he is not notable enough and qualifies deletion. 62.254.64.14 19:36, 31 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - This is an invalid argument. Can you explain to my cousin why her still-born baby isn't mentioned in the encyclopedia? Can you explain why my parent's neighbor two doors down why her daughter who was shot in a drive by shooting wasn't mentioned in the encyclopedia? Both made the newspaper, but neither are encyclopedic.
<ul>
<li>Was your cousin's baby or parent's neighbour's daughter on the front page of The Daily Mirror or The Independent? Did they replace suicide bombers as the nation's main headline? No. Mr Walker (RIP) is highly notable and the way this page is going with reasons why he should be deleted / excluded days after he died is in extremely poor taste. 62.254.64.14 12:14, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Splendid <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_to_pity.html" title="Appeal to pity">appeal to pity</a>, Mr. Anonymous. Terrible things happen all the time. You may be surprised to learn that we don't owe every murder victim a place on Wikipedia. I'm voting to <b>keep</b>, not because I think we callous "gimps" owe it to Walker's family, but because this seems to have become a notable incident in its own right.

<li><b>Keep</b> - for now. It's in the news so it's not necessarily going to be completely accurate, but it's notable because it's an <i>apparently</i> racially-motivated murder with an <i>axe</i> in a normally quiet area of Merseyside; not a run-of-the-mill gangland shooting. Maybe by the time this vfd comes to a close the story will have disappeared, but I think the nomination's a bit hasty. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlowerparty_4b7e.html" title="User:Flowerparty">Flowerparty</a> <sup><a href="../../../f/l/o/User_talk%7EFlowerparty_6764.html" title="User talk:Flowerparty">talk</a></sup> 19:54, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, one of the main reasons put forward for deletion is that Wikipedia cannot be a roll call of all victims of so-called 'hate' crime. Why not? If someone is murdered because he is black, Asian, white or gay, there is every reason why this crime of ignorance should be noted in Wikipedia. It was only through Wikipedia that I found out about the savage and cruel murder of the young, white Scottish lad <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kriss_Donald_bff5.html" title="Kriss Donald">Kriss Donald</a>, who was killed by a cowardly pack of animals (although at least it looks like they may all have been caught).

<li><b>Keep</b>. This seems to be noteworthy, although the article needs a lot of expansion. Steevil 18:11, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Best to keep it for now, but we need to keep a careful eye on its tone. By the way, do not remove the VFD tag on the article until it has been officially closed by an admin. I've had to revert an anon IP's edit. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_JPS_fb9e.html" title="User:The JPS">The JPS</a> 20:37, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Hi, this is Jaime Sullivan. I'm Anthony's best friend and I'd like to say, on behalf of his family and friends, we'd very much like to see this article remain. As people have said, it's just as important as any other major news story, and also a reminder that not only racism, but also community spirit and pride still exist today. It IS a notable story and believe me, he was and always will be a very, very notable person. Thanks very much.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> this is a sad story but Wikipedia is not a memorial. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesBurns_5f2a.html" title="User:JamesBurns">JamesBurns</a> 05:38, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I believe this article meets the criterion "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events" from <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies</a>. <a href="../../../p/u/n/User%7EPunkmorten_c486.html" title="User:Punkmorten">Punkmorten</a> 23:25, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, this has nothing to do with being a memorial and everything to do with the fact that Walker's murder is a notable and newsworthy event. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen-w_c1ef.html" title="User:Ben-w">Ben-w</a> 06:52, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Transwiki</b> to WikiNews and <b>Merge</b> into an article about hate-crime victims. As much as this is a tragedy and something that should never be forgotten, the sad truth is that if you make an article for each hate crime murder there is out there we'll probably never see the end of it --<a href="../../../t/-/b/User%7ET-Boy_4523.html" title="User:T-Boy">T-Boy</a> 08:47, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
