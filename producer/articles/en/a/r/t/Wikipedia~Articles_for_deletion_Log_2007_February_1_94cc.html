<dd><b>Comment</b> The material in the article is covered quite well in other articles already. The reason the article exists is that one user kept getting his POV rewriting of those sections reverted, so he took his bat and ball and wrote his own article instead. The reason I think it should be deleted instead of rewritten is that overlap. The small fraction of useful content in the article exists elsewhere already, where it fits better. <a href="../../../o/r/p/User%7EOrpheus_fee3.html" title="User:Orpheus">Orpheus</a> 03:29, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> In theory, we could have an article narrating academic discussions of this topic (if indeed there are any). In practice, this, and probably anything else we may produce will be nothing other that original research and point of view, at best nodding to some external sources to defend a point of the original wikipedia thesis.

<li><b>Keep</b> Chin Ce, redirect Gamji College to his page. Him and his work are covered by multiple independent sources.

<li><b>Keep</b> The so-called "Google test" is nonsense since it assumes anything and everything is on the internet, which simply is not true. Plus, many Third World authors self-publish on the internet these days because it is their only resource. I agree that this article needs to be cited with source material provided, but it has not been proven that it is non-notable and should be deleted. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStudierMalMarburg_d798.html" title="User:StudierMalMarburg">StudierMalMarburg</a> 19:20, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Ok, this was apparently nominated in October, but how it survived is frankly a mystery. First of all, it has not improved since the last time; second, as per precedent, such as the <i>Halo</i> weapons lists, it should be deleted, as per the reasons to be outlined; ah, now the reasons. First, its original research. Second, no sources, Third, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a game guide</a>. Finally, I quote wikipedia's policy from the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_guidelines_for_administrators_a507.html#Rough_consensus" title="Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators">admin's guide</a>: Basically, the guidelines "<i>which warrant that articles and information be verifiable, avoid being original research, and be written from a neutral point of view are held to be non-negotiable and cannot be superseded by any other guidelines or by editors' consensus.</i> It is not veribfiable since it has no sources, has plenty of OR, and isn't written from a neutral point of view.

Did anybody consider asking on the article's page for sources? From looking at the talk page and history it would appear that has not been the case, that ought to have been the first port of call and not going to a hastly made AfD. Thus for these reasons I completely reject the idea this article ought to be deleted right now.

<dd>Honestly, who but Halflife 2 players care what the console ID of the crowbar is? And apparently, this IS trying again later.

<dd>It isn't a very nice way of trying again for sources (talk pages with tags as needed is how you ought to first of all do it), and as you pointed out it has been AfD '<i>but</i> it wasn't included in the nomination. It would have been very handy for past voters to go to there and see the many reasons given in the previous AfD for keeping it. As for reference to the variable names, this is hardly different than refering to error order of Euler's Method. How else than mathematicians would be interested in that?

<li>Nothing is "intrinsically notable." We have <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">objective standards of notability</a> here that must be followed. Furthermore, the problem is that the article is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverified</a> and potentially unverifiable: this is non-negotiable on Wikipedia. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChardish_570b.html" title="User:Chardish">Chardish</a> 21:59, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm aware of the notability criteria; my comment wasn't quite meant to be taken literally (apologies for the imprecision). The point was that common sense tells me it's notable. (I do concede that my idea of common sense might not match anybody else's.) Anyway, I will not doubt that lack of sources is a problem, but I'm wondering what exactly might be unverifiable. I won't deny that a lack of sources is a problem, but I don't think it's one to delete an article over, either. - <a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFurrykef_4620.html" title="User:Furrykef">furrykef</a> (<a href="../../../f/u/r/User_talk%7EFurrykef_1184.html" title="User talk:Furrykef">Talk at me</a>) 22:19, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The trouble with unverified information is that there is no way of confirming its accuracy, which is necessary for Wikipedia to be an accurate and reliable resource. Take the following statement, for example: <i>Opponents argue that exposure devalues magic tricks by removing their potential to surprise or amaze audiences.</i> I have a few questions immediately: 1) Which opponents argued this? 2) What was their actual argument? 3) When did they make the argument? 4) Where can I find out more about this argument? Instead, I'm relying upon an unknown editor on the Internet to summarize the argument and remove any specificity from it. Because I don't know where <i>the editor</i> got the information from, I have no guarantee that he didn't just invent it himself (or perhaps played <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil%27s_advocate.html" title="Devil's advocate">Devil's advocate</a> in an attempt to explore all possible arguments.) The information, therefore, is completely free of credibility or reliability. Now the bigger problem is that <i><b>the entire article is like this</b></i>, which is <i>very good</i> reason to delete it. <a href="../../../n/r/s/WP%7ENRSNVNA_d83b.html" title="WP:NRSNVNA">No reliable sources, no verifiability, no article.</a> - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChardish_570b.html" title="User:Chardish">Chardish</a> 22:34, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But that particular statement is a well-known viewpoint about magic. That doesn't excuse the lack of a source, but it means a source could easily be found. For example, <a href="http://www.billpalmer.com/exposure.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.billpalmer.com/exposure.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.billpalmer.com/exposure.htm</a> is a potential source (in particular, the section that begins "Let me give you a not entirely hypothetical situation."), if not a particularly great one, but it was one of the very first google hits I found. Anyway, the "Arguments" section as a whole is indeed problematic, though, but I think the section preceding it is decent. - <a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFurrykef_4620.html" title="User:Furrykef">furrykef</a> (<a href="../../../f/u/r/User_talk%7EFurrykef_1184.html" title="User talk:Furrykef">Talk at me</a>) 10:56, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>We've been over this one before.

It now <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Pseudoscience_List_of_articles_related_to_scientific_skepticism_6a9a.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Pseudoscience/List of articles related to scientific skepticism">resides there</a>.

For some reason though, QuackGuru has found it necessary to not only recrate the same list in mainspace, but to append <b>368</b> references, apparently in an attempt to justify its inclusion in article space. Not only does this fly in the face of the consensus reached in both prior debates, it smacks of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>.

<li>I still think this meets CSD G4, but failing a speedy deletion, I'd naturally go for <b>Delete</b>. The references generally have nothing to do with establishing each list item's inclusion in the article; if what Kesh says is true, they were just blindly added from each item's corresponding article. Inclusion criteria are non-existent, and that's probably because they're impossible to give.

<li>The only actual difference is the extreme number of references appended to the list. The list itself is identical and there is still no serious inclusion criteria given. In fact, the references are simply copied &amp; pasted from the articles themselves. It appears that QuackGuru just went through and copied <i>every</i> reference from <i>every</i> article listed, and pasted them into the list. This does not appear to be an actual attempt to satisfy their reasoning for adding the items to the list, but an attempt to get around <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> by making an <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 02:46, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> <i>Unprecendented Change is the theme.</i> The List of articles related to quackery was a stand alone list without any references or organization. It was a long and unfocused list. Now, a new and different "shorter and more focused list" with verifiable references meets every aspect of Wikipedia guidelines. The List of articles related to scientific skepticism as gone through a "massive remodeling". Everything has been categorized, organized, and well written. It was NOT a re-creation of the list of article related to quackery that was a long list with any sentences or references. This was an amended list that has gone through a massive change. I invite you to look at the history for the proof. Thanks. New and different articles are allowed to be created. This new list had references and sentences and categories. Obviuosly is it very different from a long long that had everthing mixed up togther. Additionally, the closing admin asserted if everything was referenced it could be back on mainspace again too. Not only is it referenced, it has sentences and categories that were not there before. And the intro paragraph has been updated with a lot more detail for inclusion and focus. This is an easy <i>keep</i> when you look at the history when it was in mainspace under the list of article related to quackery compared to a <i>different,</i> &gt;&gt;&gt; The list of articles related to scientific skepticism. &lt;&lt;&lt; A massive improvement is a reason for mainspace. <i>This newbie article deserves a chance for many Wikipedians to contribute (over the years) and improve further.</i> It has distinct parallels to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_pseudosciences_and_pseudoscientific_concepts.html" title="List of pseudosciences and pseudoscientific concepts">List of pseudosciences and pseudoscientific concepts</a> which has had its own beginning.

<li><b>Delete</b> As stated above, this is clearly OR, with no solid criteria for what articles to include or exclude.

<li><b>delete</b>. The material in project space is what should be returned to article space. It is a perfectly straight-forward NPOV list of appropriate WP articles and so on. The page now in article space has added a list of references on each of the specific topics, &amp; a paragraph of added description or some of them.. This is first of all redundant, because the articles being referred to have the references and the discussions. Selecting one or two key references for this list out of the usually great many in the articles will always be controversial, as will be writing a succinct summary. The pages for the specific articles are the ones for these controversies, or everything will be continually being argued at both places. The final section on phraseology is the worst, because this gives examples, which makes a third place for the discussions. However, the introductory paragraphs of this article seem useful; but still they are found elsewhere. Just maintaining an agreed upon list will be difficult enough.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>the best its proponents can say for it is that the new article "ought to be allowed to compete"--compete for what--maximum continual confusion?</dd>
</dl>
<p>Examine for example the annotation for UFOs, which attempts to synthesize the evidence. Such attempts will prove to take matters which have been approximately reduced to NPOV elsewhere and reargue them. Very few of them are simple factual descriptions or definitions of the subject matter, but even those are often controverted. Some of the opposition above highlights this--it is opposition to particular parts. This is a direction that will prove disrptive. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 04:47, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete for now</b> At present there's only two entries. I'm not even convinced the Figo one technically occurs during the 2007/2008 season, but I could be wrong on that. As for the other, the source states "Slovenian international striker Zlatko Dedič has left Parma FC to join Serie B side Frosinone Calcio on a free transfer, having previously agreed to make the move in the summer when his contract expired." which means he left in January 2007, which means it happened during the 2006/2007 season anyway. So we're left with just Figo, and it seems a bit premature to have an article with one entry. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 04:14, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> for multiple reasons: because <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a> (has this league started its 2007/2008 season?); because this is excessive detail, not relevant to understanding anything encyclopedic about Serie A or futbol/soccer in general; and because a "list" with one entry doesn't meet WP's list guidelines. I don't think a player transfer is ever encyclopedic, but a case could be made that the recent transfer of <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Beckham_f822.html" title="David Beckham">David Beckham</a> was noted widely enough to pass WP:V. To me that's still Wikinews, not Wikipedia content, but at least there's been published discussion of whether it heralds a new era of USA soccer being taken more seriously. This list has no context that purports to show any significance. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 18:43, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, as I voted originally. I don't understand why <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">WP:CRYSTAL</a> is continuously brought up. That's what got the original AFD overturned in the first place. (Quoting from the Crystal Ball section: <i>All articles about anticipated events must be verifiable, and the subject matter must be of sufficiently wide interest that it would merit an article if the event had already occurred</i>. Player transfers appear to be of sufficiently wide interest, per <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_English_football_transfers_2006-07_48f4.html" title="List of English football transfers 2006-07">List of English football transfers 2006-07</a>, and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_transfers_of_Serie_A_-_2006_2007_season_c909.html" title="List of transfers of Serie A - 2006/2007 season">List of transfers of Serie A - 2006/2007 season</a> and the single event already listed is verifiable, per the reference source. Expectations that the list will grow do not seem outrageous, but, even if Figo was the only player to transfer in or out of a Serie A team this next season, that doesn't make the transfer any less or more notable (maybe more notable; but, that's a separate argument). <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 12:39, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thank you to those favoring keeping this. I've made some further edits and notes to address concerns. --Timdyson 20:44, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. Subject seems only notable within its own industry. It's biggest claim to fame is lauching Microsoft in Europe 25 years ago, and its own website is apparently the only source for that. For a PR firm, you'd expect it to have more mainstream press if it were truly notable in the WP sense. Also, while I have tried to remove the POV, it still feels like an advert, and there's not much left. I also have serious <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">COI</a> concerns. The creator even mislabled the 2005 Holmes award so that it looked like Agency of the Year rather than the more limited Technology Agency of the Year, and I don't know if the good faith assumption holds here due to the COI. Finally, the existence of articles on similar firms is just <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">INN</a>. I'll have to look at the other articles mentioned for possible prod/AfD. -- <a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButseriouslyfolks_e848.html" title="User:Butseriouslyfolks">Butseriouslyfolks</a> 22:22, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>As the creator and the person with the COI I'm happy to address any of the concerns above. SHort of getting Steve Ballmer to post something stating that he appointed the firm back in 1982 along with a former exec Bob O'Rea I'm not sure there is much we can do to verify that we did launch Microsoft. THere are numerous timelines on the web that confirm that Microsoft was launched in Europe then such as <a href="http://www.cisnet.com/glennmcc/pc-hist/" class="external free" title="http://www.cisnet.com/glennmcc/pc-hist/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cisnet.com/glennmcc/pc-hist/</a>. There are numerous articles about this firm, most recently in the Financial Times but also in publications such as Business Week which discuss the fact that it is the first PR agency to open a virtual office in Second Life. I would assert that if you remove this firm you should remove all other PR firms. --Timdyson 22:55, 1 February 2007 (UTC) Having done some homework on the matter it seems the criteria for corporations are:</p>
<p>A company or corporation is notable if it meets any of the following criteria:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>1. The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company or corporation itself.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations2 except for the following:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Media reprints of press releases, other publications where the company or corporation talks about itself, and advertising for the company.1</li>
<li>o Works carrying merely trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that simply report extended shopping hours or the publications of telephone numbers and addresses in business directories.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>2. The company or corporation is listed on ranking indices of important companies produced by well-known and independent publications.3</li>
<li>3. The company's or corporation's share price is used to calculate one or more of the major managed stock market indices.4 Note this is not the same as simply being listed on a stock market. Nor is it the same as being included in an index that comprises the entire market.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This company meets both of the first two criteria listed and I would therefore respectfully argue that it should not be deleted.--Timdyson 23:41, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> per Leebo. It's, quite frankly, a decent page. Timdyson, can you verify with any references that it does in fact meet criteria 1?--<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECastAStone_9a4a.html" title="User:CastAStone">CastAStone</a>|<a href="../../../c/a/s/User_talk%7ECastAStone_a48a.html" title="User talk:CastAStone"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 00:33, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Just to point out, both articles are about Second Life and the subject happens to be one of the firms there.

<li><b>Keep</b> We are a bunch of college students making this thing. There is no other evidence that it exists yet except on our site becuase we only started working on it last week. Our company has no notability becuase, again, we just started it last week. Heck google hasn't even looked us over yet to put in a search. I'd put more of the story line and charactors and things like that up to try and prove it, but we haven't finished writting it yet. This thing is our final project for the course and it will be completed. If it isn't, all 19 of us, fail, and do not graduate. At least give us a few days to put more up before making the decision.

<li><b>Keep</b>, is the Dean of Education. So it would seem he is more than just a "common professor". Must say, at first I was suspecting this was a hoax at first glance and had already written out my delete vote... but because he is the Dean (even if it is merely of a nothing at all school it seems, maybe...) I'm going to give him the chance of getting a proper article being written. But if that doesn't happen in a few months (or whatever) from now, then it should be deleted. I've made a start on it myself to help along future editors, by including three links. One of them the CV, in which it mentions publications etc.. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 12:47, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>delete</b> in this case I do not think notability could be demonstrated. He is associate professor at a small non-research college calling itself a university, and that is not usually notable. Deans are probably not intrinsically notable, except at a few universities. But in major universities they invariably come from among the more distinguished professors, so the situation rarely occurs. For notability as an academic administration of a small almost entirely undergraduate college, he'd need to be president. As a final touch, the article on the college here doesn't mention the school of education. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 06:08, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Sorry about the Search and Destroy thing. What I mean there is that there might be other redundant articles like these for other nationalities that only restates info from better articles. I do not mean a childish witch-hunt all over Wikipedia for any articles that sounds trivial. I think, assuming good faith, that this AFD's goal is to make Wikipedia and Category:Presidents of the Philippines better and not just something to pick fights with us Filipinos. <i>So cool lang</i>.</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. OK, I'll answer that. For things like schools and churches notability doesn't arise simply from existence. If every school were "notable" this would have the practical effect of depriving the word of meaning when talking of schools: we would have the equation "school = notable school". Rather, notability for schools is like notability for people: we think they are notable when they do something which marks them out from their peers. For schools we might regard them as notable if they consistently educate their pupils to a high level of excellence in Latin, say, or if they meet a special need. A school is not notable simply because it teaches: all schools do that, so it's rather like eating or breathing for a person. Notability arises when a school outperforms ( or, sadly, underperforms ) in its tasks. For example, we have an article on <a href="../../../e/t/o/Eton_College_8864.html" title="Eton College">Eton College</a> because, somehow, it's managed to educate an enormous number of successful UK politicians: it does something different, though it's not clear what the "magic ingredient" is. Similarly, we have an article on <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvey_Milk_School_6210.html" title="Harvey Milk School">Harvey Milk School</a> because the school is providing something that virtually no other school is doing. As it happens, I have reservations about the wisdom of the Harvey Milk School approach to education, but I strongly feel we should be documenting their work, and I strongly support retention of its article here. But for Southwest High there is no evidence that the school is doing something unique: it's not doing anything special that marks it out. There's no evidence of sustained academic excellence, nor does it appear to be winning notable awards for its educational policy on a consistent basis. It isn't meeting a need for special educational facilities for a minority group, and although it may be a good school it is pretty much just another normal school. Giving it a Wikipedia entry is like giving an entry to the ordinary guy you see every day: he's a good, honest guy, and he works hard, but he's just like the rest of us. Southwest High is a good, honest school, working hard to educate its students, but it's just like most other schools. Show us something unique and interesting about a school that has relevance outside its local community, and I'll gladly advocate retention: in the past I've advocated retention of school articles for reasons that have varied from <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birendra_Sainik_Awasiya_Mahavidyalaya_a4ad.html" title="Birendra Sainik Awasiya Mahavidyalaya">being the only military school in its country</a> to <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herndon_Elementary_School_368a.html" title="Herndon Elementary School">entering into a unique business partnership with a federal agency</a>. Notability, it seems to me, arises from doing something different that people might want to know about, not simply from existence. I hope this helps explain the opinion I express below. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 16:29, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Well-stated, but not quite right, I think. Although it is true that "notability does not arise merely from existance," the general notability criteria at <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> make it perfectly clear that the subject of an article need not be exceptional or extraordinary. excellent or abysmal. Schools don't have to do something unique or admirable or different, although they are, of course, all different in sufficient detail to result in the publication of official government reports and published news stories about their activities and their performance, This is all that is needed to make them "notable" per WP:Notability.

Thus, the primary notability criterion is a way to determine whether "the world" has judged a topic to be notable.

<dd>Since there is no consensus guideline on school notability, it seems to me that many of the efforts to delete school articles are contrary to policy, since they are based on subjective personal opinions about what should not be in Wikipedia that go beyond accepted consensus. There is no arguing taste (even if people do it all of the time). If the deletion-inclined want to prevail, it seems that their discussion should be at {WP:N]], where they could try to build a consensus that to achieve "Notability" in general, any subject must be exceptional and interesting. Finally, regarding "interesting:" I do not think that every article here should have to be able to catch the interest of any user who drops in and presses the random article button. Most of the users of this project are not idlers trying to becomed enlightened by Wiki-browsing—they are looking for something specific. It is much more important that anybody who drops in to look up something specific finds something useful. Preferably something that is thorough,NPOV, and verifiable.--<a href="../../../h/j/a/User%7EHjal_95ba.html" title="User:Hjal">Hjal</a> 01:06, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Before I start, isn't there policy here about being civil? Some editors above clearly did not learn everything they needed to know in kindergarten. Since I just finished a version of this elsewhere, I will go on at some length:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The only way to reach a consensus here would be for everybody to just give up. There have been one or two previous thoughtful posts to the effect that the participants in all of these discussions didn't appear to be heading toward a consensus on what does or does not make schools notable, and the only possible resolution was for the deletionists to accept that all schools (more or less, with a few exceptions) belong in the project, while the school inclusionists should agree to work on developing guidance (probably at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Schools_9658.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Schools">Wikipedia:WikiProject Schools</a>) about what makes an acceptable school stub and what doesn't. I think that this is the only solution.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We should all also accept that a new school article should not go to AfD unless it has first been prodded and ignored for months or tagged for CfD, if appropriate, and subsequently challenged. If every farm boy that made it to the major leagues for a week in the 1930s is automatically notable; if every English football team playing at a level I never heard of is notable; if every company included in a stock index is notable, then every school is notable (or darn close).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>All of the school AfDs that I've participated in or looked at have resulted in a keep or in no censensus and keep by default if anybody from <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a> participated seriously. The few high schools that have been deleted recently were not only candidates for good articles, some of them were notable by the strictest interpretation. Look at the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Windward_High_School_1938.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Windward High School">AfD for Windward High School</a> and then look at <a href="http://www.windwardhigh.org/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.windwardhigh.org/index.html" rel="nofollow">its website</a> for five minutes--it looks like one of most innovative and interesting new high schools in the country, but a dozen people who made no effort to research the school and one administrator sent the article to the void.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is the only test that a high school or other public school article should have to pass, and almost every school could have a good article written about it that meets that policy, just as they could meet <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. Good editors will have to revert <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a> violations frequently, unless posting by anonymous IP are restricted, but that's true of many articles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Every school is the subject of numerous publications by reliable sources. Every school. The information may not be available online, but it was published and it's out there. Public schools are planned and built following, in almost every case, multiple public meetings and formal public hearings; for teh past 40 years, most require significant environmental review and documentation; most are the subject of a bond election; many are conroversial, with local disputes by NIMBY neighbors and remote parents, struggles within the district or City for funding, dusputes with state education departments over designs and budgets, and hiring of the first and subsequent principals; followed by bond issues and parcel taxes to replace derelict buildings; sports dynasties and football coaches fired for incompetence; extraordinary teachers and pedophiles; and, however derided because of their universality, the mandatory reports required in the UK, California, and almost everyplace else are, in fact, not just verifiable and, generally, reliable, they are evidence of the "notability" of schools in the eyes of the whole community. These are not just "records," like a utility bill or a traffic ticket; they are complex, expensive, sometimes comprehensive, "reports." That we mandate them, pay for them, and dedicate scarce staff resources to them demonstrate the significance that society places on the differences between schools, their faculties, their facilities, and the success of their students.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Almost every "notable" person went to school. Their schools get listed in their biographies (almost every serious biography about a modern person discusses their education). A blue link to their schools makes it easier for editors to write good articles about people, without having to do separate lookups about the person's schools themselves. It makes it a better article for subsequent readers, who can decide whether they want to know more about the subject's educational abckground or not.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Almost every city and many CDPs have schools, and the rest are in one or more school districts or individual school attendance areas. Having school articles to link to allows the settlement's educational system to be discussed in summary or in a few bullets, with detailed information in the appropriate district or school articles. And, yes, localities provide a good place to list useful information about schools that have not attracted an editor willing to start a serious article about them. In either case, coverage of local schools makes for a better locality article, while links to separate school articles keep articles about small towns from being overloaded with school information.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I realize my discussion is specific to the U.S, in some ways, but I'm sure that similar arguments apply in most other countries. I also realize that many school articles are subject to constant vandalism, but it is usually fixed easily and without getting trapped in endless revert wars. I realize that the opponents of school articles are sincere in their belief that Wikipedia should include only "notable" schools (by which they usually seem to mean "extraordinary" schools), but I know that they are wrong. Jimbo has spoken on this issue, and even though it was not <i><a href="../../../e/x/_/Ex_cathedra.html" title="Ex cathedra">ex cathedra</a>,</i> I know that he was right.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, this specific article is not even a very good stub.

<li>WP:SCHOOL is not the only notability criterion that applies to schools. The general <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> will do just fine. To say that all discussions about the notability of schools should default to keep just because the specific notability policy is in flux is <i>ludicrous</i>. And don't pretend like AfD's don't result in the deletion of bad school articles all the time. North Side High School (Fort Worth, Texas) is heading there right now. Nothing is automatically notable, and schools are no exception. Unless valid sources can be presented, the school should go.

<p>I originally tagged this article as A7 because it does not assert that the subject is notable. It was reasonably suggested that AfD is more appropriate because the subject purportedly has extremely large corporate clients. I took a quick look in google and gnews and got plenty of hits, but the subject is a PR firm, so that might just mean it is successfully propagating its clients' press releases. Rather than have me spend the night on google trying to prove the negative, let's hear from persons in the know why the subject belongs in WP. -- <a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButseriouslyfolks_e848.html" title="User:Butseriouslyfolks">Butseriouslyfolks</a> 04:09, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete unless better references provided</b> The only valid reference provided <i>within the article</i> is the People magazine bit (myspace pages unfortunately aren't considered reliable sources). As discussed in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> the article should at a minimum have <i>multiple</i> non-trivial external references for verification. The above comments seem to indicate that the article could possibly be expanded with reasonable references and information, and if that happens I'll reconsider my recommendation.

<li><b>Keep</b> She is mentioned routinely on Hollywood Gosip magazines and websites. Now she will be a notorious pornstar.

<li><b>Keep</b> "Page is plagued by original research" is an argument for improving the article and removing the OR, not for deleting the whole article. Kardashian is mentioned in many tabloid news sources and people will come to us to find out what the fuss is about; the article should be kept to make the encyclopedia more useful to our readers.<a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 17:42, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> As a wikipedia user, if I come to wikipedia to find information, I want it to be there regardless of whether or not the article is about a pathetic person or thing, the fact is that there is a place for knowledge here that we can't find elsewhere. I trust this encyclopedia a great deal for information that stands out above ordinary blogs and opinion rags, I appreciate the fact that when i read something in the news about someone whom i know nothing about, I can come here and learn something about them, even if they are useless people.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is certainly not a space issue the page takes up a minimal amount of space. The issue of her notoriety is obviously resolved as per above. She is well known enough now that people will remember her and recognize her. Her notoriety is unlikely to fade with the impending release of her sex tape.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This AFD is rather ironic since there's been talk in the mixed martial arts blogosphere that Fitch is someone who does not get the <a href="http://ufcjunkie.com/2007/01/31/ufc-68-jon-fitch-disappointed-by-undercard-status/" class="external text" title="http://ufcjunkie.com/2007/01/31/ufc-68-jon-fitch-disappointed-by-undercard-status/" rel="nofollow">recognition he deserves</a>. Still, there are just enough articles written about him by independent sources, <a href="http://www.mmaweekly.com/absolutenm/templates/dailynews.asp?articleid=2288&amp;zoneid=4" class="external text" title="http://www.mmaweekly.com/absolutenm/templates/dailynews.asp?articleid=2288&amp;zoneid=4" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.mmafighting.com/gettingtoknow/jon_fitch.html" class="external text" title="http://www.mmafighting.com/gettingtoknow/jon_fitch.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, with a <a href="http://www.ufc.com/index.cfm?fa=news.detail&amp;gid=2840" class="external text" title="http://www.ufc.com/index.cfm?fa=news.detail&amp;gid=2840" rel="nofollow">third article</a> written by the UFC themselves, which may not count as an independent source. Fitch is a UFC fighter (the UFC is among the top organizations worldwide in mixed martial arts) who also is the #7 ranked welterweight according to <a href="http://www.mmaweekly.com/absolutenm/templates/topten.asp?articleid=13&amp;zoneid=15" class="external text" title="http://www.mmaweekly.com/absolutenm/templates/topten.asp?articleid=13&amp;zoneid=15" rel="nofollow">MMAWeekly</a>.

<dd><b>question</b> is #7 notable? if it were 1-3, I could understand. what are the criteria for the organization? he sounds like he nips at the edges of notability, but is not yet there. for the record, I'd like you to be right. I found him doing a related name search, always want genuine notables to stay. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKintetsubuffalo_0363.html" title="User:Kintetsubuffalo">Chris</a> 08:19, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>By organization, I meant something like a sport league. While the UFC is not technically a sports league like the NFL or NBA, since it's not in a team sport, it functions almost just like one. Fitch could be considered a major league fighter in that sense, and like any major league player, his status in the majors depends on the subjective evaluations of whoever controls the purse strings. I do recognize that he is on a borderline in terms of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria, and I can't say being #7 confers automatic notability (albeit I think it strengthens the case), but a search for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22jon+Fitch%22+ufc&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22jon+Fitch%22+ufc&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">"Jon Fitch" ufc</a> in Google yields 36,000+ hits and enough verifiable material to expand the article beyond a stub, especially on the topic of his fighting career.

<li>This is nothing like a dictionary article. It is an encyclopaedia article about hum polls, explaining who uses them and the rationale for their use, not a dictionary article about an idiomatic phrase "hum poll". It is a stub. We don't delete stubs simply for being short. We delete stubs if it can be shown that they are unverifiable or impossible ever to be expanded beyond stub status. Only the nominator has come close to addressing this, but xe didn't actually do research to see whether and what sources exist. Xe merely counted Google hits, <i>which is not research</i>. For all that xe knows, each of those 150 hits could be a detailed article by a reliable source about hum polls.

<li><b>Delete</b> I'm not even sure if it counts as original research rather than a pointless list of random anime that (may) have twist endings, with an unsubstantiated claim that these are somehow more significant and difficult to follow than twists in other media.

<li><b>Delete</b> Anime's a medium, not a genre. This is not only OR, but slanted OR based on a mistaken assumption. There's nothing intrinsic to animation that makes twist endings more complex than in print, live-action film, or radio drama -- that's a factor of the writing and direction. Additionally, I doubt there's anything about anime that makes its twist endings broadly different from any other twist endings, so I see no purpose in keeping this article unless a source making such a claim can be produced. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 06:13, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>As I've made clear elsewhere, I'm fine with the concept of self-published. However, has this band had any radio play or significant club appearances or press? Sales over a small number of privately sold copies? They're on Amazon with a sales rank of ZERO. Their site isn't even a direct URL--it's a free hosting. If not, they're not notable enough to have an entry. It would fall under the category of "Self promotion."<a href="../../../m/z/m/User%7EMzmadmike_686e.html" title="User:Mzmadmike">Mzmadmike</a> 13:24, 1 February 2007 (UTC)mzmadmike</p>

<p>I don't believe anyone from the band created this entry, but it may be (as mentioned above) a form of promotion. On the contrary, the band has founded a mind-blowing style, almost a genre, that is just in it's beginning stages. This may of interest to someone. Whether or not they're approved of by the Wikipedia staff makes no difference to their uprising. No, they don't usually play at overpriced 21 and up venues or clubs, rather in basements or bars. They play for mainly underground, all-ages audiences that are the Chicago suburbs area punk scene. Their popularity is gaining across the US, the UK, Japan, Austria, and probably some other countries- just in a very underground way, and they cannot play in these areas. Delete this entry if you so desire, but only if it is breaking some sort of Wikipedia law, do not discriminate. It is a guarantee that this article will re-appear in the near or distant future, due to the band's (and the scene's) rising underground reputation. (This was unsigned)</p>
<p>++++++++ Without rancor, let me point out that EVERY band believes this to be the case. Can you list some articles in zines of some kind, industry commentary, sales numbers, anything? If they're so underground they don't have notice, they are, by definition, not something to be listed in an encyclopedia. I get less than 400 Ghits once I remove "Rage Against the Machine" who had an album of that name, Wiki's references and duplicates. Everything I see is myspace and blog references. A Wiki article needs references to support it.<a href="../../../m/z/m/User%7EMzmadmike_686e.html" title="User:Mzmadmike">Mzmadmike</a> 03:31, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think the problem is that most of the articles or pages put up that are promoting Evil Empire are by the band themselves, and they haven't had anyone make a page or article for them, until now (unless this wiki entry is made by the band as well). I found one page, but it's in Japanese, and it doesn't translate well. But, if self-promotion is how the band wants to do it, it's all their choice, I know for a fact that they are ok with people promoting them, and PEOPLE have, just not many online writers that are in some authoritative position to write about them. They have most-likely been in their local newspaper as high-schoolers. I'm not really trying to keep this article from being deleted, I'm just stating some facts and trying to point out that they are very popular to punk scenes around the country, despite their lack of corporate sponsorship or online reviews. And, I would really appreciate it if I was talked to as a normal person, rather than mocked and talked down to, thanks. Sorry I'm not educated on how to sign things or use Wikipedia code.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nobody is saying that there is a problem with self-promotion. However, Wikipedia has policies that all subjects must be notable. Bands that lack any reputable sources attesting to notability do not meet article guidelines. For more information, please see <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. While there are many outlets for self-promotion, Wikipedia isn't one of them. It isn't appropriate to use a Wikipedia page to help establish notability.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> He's the general secretary of a student organization representing 700,000 students, but the point about none of the other general secretaries having articles is well taken.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I just wanted to address some of the above concerns. Firstly, none of the other gen secs have a wiki, but as I have explained clearly in the article, the current gen sec is unique in that he is an unaligned independent who has defeated a heavily backed party candidate - for the first time in almost two decades. Secondly, regarding <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanejellyroll_84c0.html" title="User:Janejellyroll">janejellyroll</a>'s fruitless search, I just wanted to draw attention to the highly unusual spelling of his first name. Most of the references pertaining to him spell it with the conventional double t, hence the apparent lack of references when the correct spelling is searched. Thirdly, with regards to none of the references establishing notability, can I draw attention to the fact that Chuk has been mentioned extensively in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Age_3d42.html" title="The Age">The Age</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sydney_Morning_Herald_4298.html" title="The Sydney Morning Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Australian_d6f4.html" title="The Australian">The Australian</a> newspapers, with the former photographing him for their newspaper and the SMH devoting most of an article to him.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Further to this, Chuk's election is described <b>in detail</b> in no less than <b>seven</b> other Wikipedia articles. I have gone to a lot of trouble to reference this article to prove notability. Finally, and most particularly, before you cast your vote, I urge you to first visit the <a href="../../../f/e/l/Felix_Eldridge_56d7.html" title="Felix Eldridge">Felix Eldridge</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rose_Jackson_367e.html" title="Rose Jackson">Rose Jackson</a> articles.

<li><b>Keep</b> per comments made by Walid khalil.

<p>Because of the length of the article, I had to do a little homework. We have a rule that says Wikipedia can write about hoaxes as long as everyone understands that they're hoaxes. Fair enough, but the hoax must be notable in real-world terms. This one produces less than 500 ghits (or less than 100, depending how you count), and not one from a reputable independent source. The website to which the article refers is inactive and has been taken over by an advertising directory. In short, it looks like this was made up in school one day. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 08:21, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would like to point out that any term that finds currency among fanfic writers is going to be disproportionately represented on Google, while often not being represented at all in publications (as opposed to personal sites, fansites, and forums).

<dd><b>Compromise? - merge/redirect</b> -- OK, I see your point and the consensus seems to be delete or merge (as noted below, I had overlooked the option of merging before). How about merging the content into the <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incest.html" title="Incest">incest</a> article and then turning this page into a redirect (as it obviously has relatively wide use--even if only among fanfic writers)? The new section in the <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incest.html" title="Incest">incest</a> article would be titled not "twincest" but something like "incest between twins" and would mention the term twincest only in the context of being a fanfic term. This would also avoid claims of NOR based on applying the term to particular instances in fiction or real life. I don't anticipate it would take me more than 5-15 minutes to complete the merge and subsequent cleanup. If you express your support for this proposal, I will go ahead and do the merge (without your support as hte nominator, it may seem as if I'm going against consensus even though at least 4 editors have supported <i>keep</i> or <i>merge</i>). <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 06:55, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

Incest among twins, on the other hand, is a subgenre of erotica, pornography, and fanfic.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Allow me to flush out my argument by responding to the article's criticisms:
<ol>
<li>"It violates <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>/is non-notable" - see the Google search above; the term gets over 80,000 non-WP or WP-mirror hits. Now granted, many of those hits do not meet <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, but it is proof that the term has widespread usage (even if within a somewhat specialized community).</li>
<li>"It is a dicdef" - it is not just a dicdef as it provides actual examples (including 2 nonfictional) and other content. Only the first line is a definition--what about the rest of the article?</li>
<li>"It violates <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>" - given the very clear and simple definition, it doesn't take <i>any</i> research to note that the <i>incestual</i> sexual scene between the Sorrel <i>twins</i> in Cruel Intentions 2 qualifies under that definition. The examples don't have to mention the source by name. If a politician says that Germany is going to invade the country south of it, east of Switzerland, north of Italy, and west of Hungary, he/she doesn't have to name Austria for us to understand what he's referring to and to include the comment in German-Austrian relations.</li>
<li>"It's a fanfic/fanart term" - this is essentially the same criticism as the first. Yes, it is a fanfic term that has relatively wide usage. Being fanfic is no reason for deletion.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><b>A final comment</b> regarding the article's potential for expansion. I expect there would be a significant amount of notable research on this subject within the general literature on incest (twincest being a subcategory of incest). <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 19:17, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><i><a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_molestation.html" title="Child molestation">Child molestation</a></i> is "disgusting and illegal" but it's an encyclopedic topic. I cannot help but think that you are voting simply out of a negative emotional reaction to the topic. In an AfD discussion, we should consider whether the article merits to be in this encyclopedia, rather than whether or not it's a pleasant topic to ponder/read about. You claim its non-notable, yet the term gets over 80,000 Google hits (this still excludes all print sources that aren't available online). You claim it's poorly referenced, and I agree with that (in part)--so put an unreferenced tag on the article. Finally, you say it's OR--how so? What part of it is original research (there is no new, unique synthesis of material--it's simply a compilation of a few examples)? <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 22:51, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>If you enjoy twincest that's your business. This is an encyclopedia, not a forum for sexual fantasies. There's one single reference. Most of the examples are ambiguous and/or works of fiction.

<li>Firstly, I do not, as you put it, "enjoy twincest". To say that I do is equal to saying that those who created the "child molestation" article are child molesters and contributors to the "Holocaust" article favor genocide. Secondly, this IS an encyclopedia and it should include terms that have wide usage, despite how unpleasant (either for one person or for many) the subject matter they concern. There's a single reference <i>in the article</i>, but there are &gt;80,000 ghits. I'm sure at least a few of these can be used as references. I note, again: if the problem is references, add an "unreferenced" tag. Thirdly, there is nothing in my comment that is an attack. "Voting out of a negative emotional reaction" is inappropriate for AfD, but certainly nothing insulting. I can't imagine anyone ever saying: "Yo mama so [insert some term], her vote on a Wikipedia AfD was based on an emotional reaction." Finally, I believe my statement was a reasonable (though I realize not possibly incorrect) induction given the text of your vote: "Original research, poorly referenced, and not at all notable. <i>Plus it's disgusting and illegal</i> (emphasis added). I merely asked you to clarify your reasons for claiming that the articles is OR and NN.

<li><b>Keep</b> The meaning of the term is instantly comprehensible, and as has been noted, used many thousands of times. Significant major works (Wagner, Lucas) have key themes involving twincest. Stating that they are fictional is without merit as WP contains numerous articles on fictional subjects (Shakespearean characters and Back to the Future characters come to mind as representative examples.) The existence of the article does not imply support for the practice. <a href="../../../r/i/n/User%7ERingbark_23e5.html" title="User:Ringbark">Ringbark</a> 23:01, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The article could have the more general title Incest among twins (a number of the "popular culture" examples listed are non-fictional). I initially supported merging it to <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incest.html" title="Incest">Incest</a> but decided against doing so after comparing the two articles. Incest is usually a form of (non-consensusal) abuse (and the article explicitly treats it as such), whereas incest among twins essentially amounts to a genre of eroticism, pornography, and/or sexploitation. I think the article could be a good, if relatively short (not stub-length though), article if someone were to make the effort to expand it (I say someone instead of me because, as my edit history can prove, my editing interests lie in other subjects). In any case, I think this article can stand on its own as a stub, and if anyone wants to make it a section elsewhere, I have no objections (my objection is to the content being deleted).

<p>I am not sure about this one. Definitely it has to be heavily edited, as it reads like a cross between a CV and a PR sheet (but this is not a reason to delete). It lacks any reference but personal websites of the subject (but this is not a reason to delete). Somebody regularly patrols the article, removing NPOV or OR tags and deleting other people's remarks in Talk (but this is not a reason to delete). I don't feel as this person might be actually notable, even if what the article says is mostly true (but this is not a reason to delete). So I'd like other people to have a look into it. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoochelaar_237d.html" title="User:Goochelaar">Goochelaar</a> 08:52, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>A REPUTABLE ARTIST UNDER ATTACK</b> Geoffrey Giuliano is the premere rock historian and writer of his time. The controversy here is simply a personal attack on this noted author, actor and syndicated radio host from a fringe group of Hare Krishna's who have been dogging Giuliano for years ever since he renounced their particular form of religious fervor some ten years ago. They have put up a very, very libelious website and now are attacking this Wikipedia entry to try and further disdcredit Giuliano. Google this man and you will see he has a long career in the media and is certainly most notable for his dozens of books etc. Please see through this defamation. Researching Mr. Giuliano is VERY VERY easy. While some may not like what he has had to say in the media for almost thirty years he is indeed very accomplished and continues his work internationally.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Not only is Giuliano a very well known author but he is also a noted film actor currently filming three major motion pictures in large roles in Asia (Bangkok Adrenaline, Cargo and Slumberland). The sources WERE all there with live links to various subjects within the article but were vandalized about two months ago and deleted. Please check the history well and you will see this is indeed true. Why the controversy regarding this very well know well published American author? I believe the post concerning defamation posted above to be correct. Giuliano's thirty something books are well documented and available on amazon.com and every other major book selling operation globally as are his nearly 100 audio books published by the likes of Random House. Please consider WHY this strong attack on a well known artist! There are people who clearly do not like what he has written and vare seeking to erase his profound literary contributions due to their personal bias and this is just not right. I also do not see how this article is not well written. I have spent some five hours researching the content and it is indeed accurate.124.120.182.79 23:25, 1 February 2007 (UTC) Freethought Joe</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The comments above about the importance of the "very well known author" were once again made by Giuliano himself, anonymously. He lives in Thailand, and it came from that country. Plus, it's written in the same dumb style he writes everything, just read it and compare, 'cause it's as clear as day. He's abused wiki too much, it's gettin' ridiculous! Oh, and by the way, Give Peace a Chance!--Lennon's Ghost</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The comments refered to above as coming from Giuliano were made by myself, a nearly twenty year reader of his many fine books. While I have heard he has made some films here in Thailand I can assure you I have NEVER met him and that the thoughts herein were, and are, my own. There are MANY folksd here in Thailand Bwana! Besides, he IS a highly notable author. That is a matter of record. What is all the fuss about, if indeed, it is not simple character assination?124.120.185.95 11:24, 3 February 2007 (UTC) Freethought Joe From Kokomo</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Amazon lists several books of his (<a href="http://amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/102-9725984-7581748?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=Geoffrey+Giuliano&amp;Go.x=5&amp;Go.y=9&amp;Go=Go" class="external autonumber" title="http://amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/102-9725984-7581748?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=Geoffrey+Giuliano&amp;Go.x=5&amp;Go.y=9&amp;Go=Go" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>), so he's notable, but article needs heavy cleanup. The comments above suggest to me that Giuliano or one of his partisans will relentlessly patrol the article to attempt to ensure that it violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>, and any other policies found inconvenient to the goal of promoting Giuliano.

<p>To repeat a liable IS a liable and Kevin Hanley and Eye were very sucessfully sued for the publication of the above article. removing actionable material I am sure is VERY MUCH "Wiki". Thus I will do so forthwith. Please see article below:</p>

<p>Joe, you remind me of Nixon. The link you gave doesn't lead to anything referring to a lawsuit against the EYE or its writers, it leads to a letter to the editor that was printed in the EYE. It is interesting, though--the letter is complaining about an article they had just printed about Giuliano, and it was written by a woman who worked for him as a researcher on several of his books. I don't think the EYE was too afraid of a lawsuit about the article, though, 'cause they added a sarcastic heading to her letter. Hmmm, someone who depends on ya for her bread and butter writing a letter to the editor in your favor--is that anything like "Guiliano fans GLOBALLY are being notified"? Gimme Some Truth!--Lennon's Ghost</p>
<p>I see the article has been reduced to one sentence. But still those claims, although provable by a www search, are not properly referenced here. That is the rule...references must be given. Please list at least several references that are neutral 3rd party published reviews or articles, and list your published books with ISBN# in Wiki reference format. Please listen to Goochelaar, who is trying to help.---2 cents</p>
<p>ALSO, even BAD articles, if properly referenced, can prove notability.---2 cents</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, dig up sources, and wikify. As a polite reminder, it is a good idea to Google something you are not sure about the notability of.

<li><b>Comments</b>. Much of the above discussion should have been posted to the article's talk page, not here. Relevant to the notability aspect of the deletion debate is the exchange in <i>Eye Weekly</i>. Giuliano's anon partisan deleted the link on this page to the unflattering article, but the <i>Eye Weekly</i> article does serve to show notability and argue against deletion. Link: <a href="http://www.eyeweekly.com/eye/issue/issue_05.11.00/arts/books.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eyeweekly.com/eye/issue/issue_05.11.00/arts/books.php" rel="nofollow">[36]</a> Although the anon asserts there was a successful lawsuit, I find no online evidence of any such thing.

Finally, I don't agree with the above anonymous comment (the one in all caps) inviting Giuliano to edit the article about himself.

<p>CHANGING MY VOTE FROM "DELETE" TO "KEEP OFF THE GRASS": I'm persuaded now by all the good discussion on here that Giuliano IS notable (in his own lovable sod way)and that "we can work it out." But--I'm concerned about the son of Tricky Dicky who keeps changin' things back and deletin'. While I'm changin' my vote, I think the discussion should remain open for a while, 'cause the anonymous block and lots of vigilance and mannin' the barricades is gonna be needed to keep the blue meanies away while the evolution revolution of this entry goes down!

<p>THIS ARTICLE IS 10000000000% FACTUALLY CORRECT HERE IT IS PLEASE USE IT: Geoffrey Giuliano (born September 11, 1953 in Rochester, New York) is a American writer of dozens of commercially published, best selling books translated into some sixteen languages over twenty five years. He is also a noted film actor and syndicated radio show host. Raised in Albion and Olcott Beach, New York, Giuliano was the youngest of five children. He and his mother, Myrna Oneita Juliano, moved to Tampa, Florida at the age of twelve where he first became interested in acting, Vedic philosophy and fine art seriography as a young man. Geoffrey became enamored of the emerging hippie movement in 1967 and went through that door taking with him as he puts it, "All the very best of what my generation was about. The drugs I left behind early on and never went back, although LSD, in particular, was an important portal for me. It opened me up in many beautiful ways. Most importantly, pointing me eastward in the direction of disciplined yoga, Vedic philosophy, vegetarianism, a life free of addictions and much more. That was the point in which my adult values were really formed. I thank God everyday for India and everything I have known and seen because of Her. America gave me birth, but India made my bones." Giuliano attended Hillsborough Community College (HCC) and in the mid 1970s, SUNY Brockport (where he was later named one of the top fifty students of all time) near his hometown of Rochester. In August 1976 he married college sweetheart Brenda Lee Black (later author/animal rights activist, Vrnda Devi) and together they had four children, Sesa Nichole, Devin Leigh, Avalon Oneita and India Skye. He also has a young son from another relationship, Tulsi Mala Kuptsov born in Bangkok in mid July 2003. In the late 1990's Giuliano founded the umbrella charity, SRI/The Spiritual Realization Institute (and later Sri Radhe International Inc.) which manifested as a free veggie food pantry (Dasa Food For All) in Lockport, New York, as well as an animal sanctuary, Devotional Yoga center, spiritual retreat and not-for-profit publishing house. In 2000 he also founded a charity in aid of the abused women of Radha Kund, North India called The Vrndavana Widows &amp; Children's Trust which feeds, clothes and provides acute medical care for the holy residents of this sacred village. Giuliano has written some 36 critically acclaimed, scholarly, internationally bestselling, though often controversial, biographies on such luminaries as John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Brian Jones, Pete Townshend and several audio works (100 to date) on subjects as diverse as Frank Sinatra as well as archival interviews with survivors of the Titanic entitled, "That Fateful Night: True Stories of Titanic Survivors In Their Own Words." Giuliano has also written two London Sunday Times bestselling biographies, "Dark Horse: The Secret Life of George Harrison" and "Blackbird: The Life And Times Of Paul McCartney." Along the way, he has collaborated with such pop luminaries as Cream/Blind Faith drummer Ginger Baker, Pete Townshend, Dr. Timothy Leary, Richie Havens, Ben E. King, John Lennon's sister Julia Baird, 'Legs' Larry Smith, and British BBC TV presenter Gloria Hunniford, among many others. In late 1998, Random House Audio asked Giuliano to form a company for them called Tribute Audio, which produced a line of celebrity, interview laced, original spoken word CDs, all written, produced and narrated by the author. He worked in that capacity for some five years. In 2003, Giuliano founded a successful publishing house, SRI Books, as a resource for publishing his more esoteric literary works. On November 19, 2005, a film, "Stoned: The Wild &amp; Wicked World of Brian Jones," based on his bestselling book for Virgin in the UK, "Paint It Black: The Murder of Brian Jones" premered in London. The movie was directed by Stephen Woolley and co-produced by Nik Powell, the producing team behind such films as "Mona Lisa," "Interview with the Vampire" and "The Crying Game." At the Bangkok Film Festival in February 2006 Woolley and Giuliano fell out over what Giuliano felt was, "A thoroughly botched adaptation of my book as well as obvious ommissions in reference to my credit in the making of this horrific, pretentious and historically inaccurate film. It is a load of self interested garbage. If Woolley spent ten years of his life making this, he wasted the better part of his professional life for nothing!" As a singer songwriter Giuliano has written for and/or recorded with George Harrison, Richie Havens, Ben E. King, Steve Holly, Ginger Baker, Denny Laine, and 'Legs' Larry Smith [ex-Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band]. His has released two CDs, "Chocolate Wings" (2001) and the haunting Indo fusion work, "God Dwells Within" (2006). Giuliano has been a sterling (and much lauded) advocate for animal rights since the early 1980's for his very public renunciation of the fast-food giant McDonald's after portraying their promotional personality, Ronald McDonald, for some two years in Toronto, Canada. Shocked at the hypocrisy he found within the company's mammoth corporate structure Giuliano testified for the prosecution in a famed 1991 London court case known as McLibel. He has been very public on his views as an ethical lacto vegetarian ever since. In an interview he gave in London some years later, Geoffrey summed up his bad experience playing Ronald north of the border. "There's no question that I was manipulating these children. I was a highly paid, highly trained, highly polished actor. Every show was a performance and I had a mandate to get that message out there, and yeah, it was not too hard - anybody can manipulate a child. I just went home one night, and I said, 'I cannot do this, I can't live with myself if I continue to do this.' Giuliano also played the Marvelous Magical Burger King for the Burger King Corporation doing shows and other appearances throughout New England. The seasoned author /actor has spoken widely regarding his turbulent term as the McDonald's clown and the shadowy ethical implications of factory farming and animal rights. Giuliano has been an ardent vegetarian abstaining from meat, fish or eggs since 1970. Giuliano has resided primarily in Southeast Asia since 2000 with his two grandchildren, Kashi and Varsana Jones and his filmmaker daughter, Avalon Giuliano, with whom he co-authored several books and DVD documentaries ["The Beatles Scrapbook" and "John Lennon: Working Class Hero" - KRB Music]. Their latest tome, "Revolver: The Secret History Of The Beatles," was published by Blake Publishing of London in mid 2006. Giuliano is a thirty five year student of Vedic philosophy from the Gaudiya Vaishnava school of Hinduism (Bhakti, or Devotional Yoga) under the noted Bengali master, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami. Giuliano was also co-author of a particularly stirring work on ethical vegetarianism with his wife, Vrnda Devi, entitled "Compassionate Cuisine," published by SRI Books in 2003. In recent years Geoffrey has returned to his early career as an in demand character actor, recently co-starring in the Hallmark Channel mini-series, "Jules Verne's The Mysterious Island" as Captain Tweezer Lee with Patrick Stewart and former British actor/soccer star Vinnie Jones. In August 2006 he was cast in a French film entitled "Cargo" which was filmed in Bangkok. In September he signed to co-star in an action adventure film (also in Thailand) entitled "The Devil's Playground." In late 2005 Giuliano was hired by American radio syndicator (KGB) to host a series of two hour radio shows, "Geoffrey Giuliano's Roots Of Rock". He has also worked in the theatre at various times over many years. He has performed voiceover narrations for such clients as McDonald's and Burger King. Giuliano has also worked tirelessly against the perils of crack cocaine addiction having been personally touched by the issue when several young people close to him became addicted.</p>

<p>This article bothers me. First it is an uncited biography raising <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> concerns, even thought there are sources in existence <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/farright/story/0,11981,1044274,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/farright/story/0,11981,1044274,00.html" rel="nofollow">Guardian for instance</a>. Second, the claim to notability is being a suspect in a high profile case (<a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Lindh_b5c8.html" title="Anna Lindh">Anna Lindh</a>), but the man completely innocent, and I really don't think that a person who had nothing to do with the murder should be burdened with having a Wikipedia article on him. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 10:31, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I disagree on it redundancy to <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> and is highly relevant. I might suggets you come to Dublin and slot the <a href="../../../u/2/_/U2.html" title="U2">U2</a> article into the U2's Dublin article. Those two articles - <a href="../../../u/2/_/U2.html" title="U2">U2</a> or <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin.html" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> - do not connect into a coherent U2's Dublin - both geographical (Dublin) and historic (U2) information not giving much appreciationas to where U2 came from</dd>

<li><b>Keep!</b> - This article shall not be deleted. The concept of anarcho-monarchism may be rather obscure, I agree, but it's interesting enough to warrant keeping the article.

<li><b>Keep</b> There is more here than just a neologism and Dali. I am not an expert here but this seems to a part of the far-right that is mirror maze reflecting and distorting the left. The principal cite is an article by Wayne John Sturgeon, a major contributor of <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_Green_5587.html" title="Alternative Green">Alternative Green</a>. He has contributed important articles on <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Harrington_eed2.html" title="Patrick Harrington">Patrick Harrington</a> a former Leader of the National Front, among other far-right figures. This article is notable not because it's "interesting" but because it can explain, in part, a world in which Kadfhi, the IRA, and anti-globalist may at times act in concert. Sources can be developed for this article which needs to be improved.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdivorce_959f.html" title="User:Edivorce">Edivorce</a> 01:24, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> There is nothing wrong with resurrections if they constitute an improvement. The article still has room for improvement, and can be further expanded as stated by Edivorce, and become a source of interesting background information. Speedy deletion is certainly NOT an option, nor is deletion for the sake of deletion as proposed by some of the more zealous deletionists. Please give this article a chance to grow and further develop. <a href="../../../l/h/o/User%7ELHOON_0f9d.html" title="User:LHOON">LHOON</a> 09:33, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, it's not an improvement. I just looked at the history, and the original "resurrection" was actually much worse than the original article and was clearly not a recreation, but another attempt to create an article on the subject. The revisions that have taken place since than have made it closer to the old article. I think it would be helpful if an admin can look at the old version before it was deleted and compare it to the current version, and tell us what they think. It's been a while since I saw the old one and my memory is fuzzy, but I'm pretty sure the intro is the same. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><b><font color="black">Ungovernable Force</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_Poll_dd8a.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force/Poll"><font color="green"><sup>Poll: Which religious text should I read?</sup></font></a> 19:16, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article was proposed for deletion in December and the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_MyPhotoAlbum_6f6e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/MyPhotoAlbum">result</a> was "no consensus."

<li><b>Weak keep</b>, has a bunch of references at the bottom.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Previously the vote was 2-1 in favor of keeping. I disagree with the conclusion that there was no consensus before. In addition, it is a well-known and well-used website, there is no earthly reason to want to delete an article about it. --Lee Vonce 21:06, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete unless article is expanded</b> There are a bunch of reference links in the article, but where's the actual article? It appears to be only one sentence saying that this is a "photo sharing site". Unless this article is expanded to have at least <i>some</i> information worth noting, delete the article and recreate once a more filled-out article can be submitted. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:55, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This magazine is published in India. The readership figure appears to have been calculated by taking the circulation and multiplying it by an average of five readers per copy. I removed the readership claim and replaced it with the circulation of 120,000, as stated on the publisher's site. Verifying the circulation is more difficult than one might expect. For a U.S. publication, I would check the listing in one of the publications of Standard Rate and Data Service (SRDS), which receives the circulated figures audited by the Audit Bureau of Circulation or similar agencies. I am not sure what the Indian counterpart of SRDS is. I visited the Audit Bureau of Circulation in India at <a href="http://www.auditbureau.org" class="external free" title="http://www.auditbureau.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.auditbureau.org</a> , but access to its data requires a login and password. Similarly, a U.S. publication might be mentioned in Advertising Age magazine, but I don't know what the Indian counterpart is. I think that independent published references exist, but being in North America, I can't easily find them. --<a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEastmain_2651.html" title="User:Eastmain">Eastmain</a> 00:09, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> While 120,000 is a lot, does this really qualify it as "best-selling" in a country like India? Not that I doubt the claim, but I'd rather not accept it at face value.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I have reviewed the references, but do not find that they support a claim of notability. I am particularly uncomfortable with the reference claiming architectural merit, which seems to be from the personal website of a local architectural enthusiast: this is merely a statement of preference, not a substantial claim. We need to see something more like "the Texas Architectural Association rated the building one of the top 3 most architecturally significant buildings in Texas." That would be notable.

<dd>No, that's no OK. You don't even claim that all schools are notable, instead insisting that schools should be kept, notable or not.

<li>comment i ment All high schools/ upper leval schoold anywhere in the world how smail they might be should be kept because someone could add more information on them. to be honest i been trying to start an article every high school in the USA when i start the page adding a little amount of information than add the Expand tag so other people can expand the article to mold it to a bigger and better one so all i am saying that how big or small high schools should be inclueld here on wikipedia even if they noteable or not i hope explanes my view if not i will try again later ok<a href="../../../o/o/7/User%7EOo7565_d6e0.html" title="User:Oo7565">Oo7565</a> 21:17, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You basically repeated the same argument I questioned before but with more words this time. I'm still confused as to why you want to include what you admit might be non-notable material.

<li>Comment let me try this again i hope this helps it my not who knows. The information whick might seems non noteabel to you and me it might mean a lot to someone who goes or went to that school which make them proud to part of the school. one more thing at least my mind we (all) of us have no right to say schools are noteabel or not i hope this helps if not if you do not mind i will try again but this time maybe leave meassage on my talk page instead of here ok<a href="../../../o/o/7/User%7EOo7565_d6e0.html" title="User:Oo7565">Oo7565</a> 22:56, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm not going to leave a message on your talk page only because I think this exchange is relevant to the AfD discussion. Your argument is flawed in that your basic reason for inclusion is that "it might be notable to someone". Notability is not subjective. In addition, I'm proud of my old high school but it doesn't have an article and I wouldn't presume to create one. Why not? It's not notable. Again, I must stress: Notability is not subjective. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_9893.html" title="User:Soltak">Soltak</a> | <a href="../../../s/o/l/User_talk%7ESoltak_c9f0.html" title="User talk:Soltak">Talk</a> 23:00, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nonnotable candy. I found 1500 ghits for &lt;"apple drops" candy -wikipedia&gt;, and at least half of those were unrelated to the subject. Admittedly, the candy was popular before the Internet age and has ceased to be significant. But isn't that the whole point? Those of you who vote "keep" should defend that vote by cleaning up the unverified parts of the article. I'm not sure it's worth the effort. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 07:30, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article was created last fall and at the time I felt it was a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a> and a duplicate of information already present in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Six_Million_Dollar_Man_a7fa.html" title="The Six Million Dollar Man">The Six Million Dollar Man</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bionic_Woman_e236.html" title="The Bionic Woman">The Bionic Woman</a>. I let it be in case it was expanded, but it was not. My rationale for nomination is that I can find nothing to support that Universal Pictures or any other entity officially group the two TV series together under this title, and that this article simply duplicates information already present in two other articles. See also the present AFD underway for a similar article, Movie (series). Note that if this AFD results in deletion there is also a related category that may need to be renamed or examined. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 15:06, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>A list of a whopping two people. I'm sure someone could write a fascinating article on race and ethnicity and the NHL, but this is too specific a topic to ever have any content. When NHL players of Korean descent, NBA players of Japanese descent and MLB players of Armenian descent get created, I will be nominating those too. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 15:54, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Two items does not a list make. Perhaps the topic can be reworked into an article along thelines of Ethnic diversity in the NHL?

<li><b>Keep</b> - There is no reason to believe the list won't grow in the future and even if it doesn't, there's no reason it shouldn't exist now.

<li><b>Delete</b> Or if we were to keep, why don't we create an NHL players of kazakhstani descent, etc...

<li><b>Keep</b> - So the article is knocked down to three lines and then almost immediately hit with an AfD for being too short. Cute. And I must say it reflects poorly on the AfD when the one who proposed it personally stands guard over the article reverting expansions; do I smell an agenda? I agree that the article's unsourced or poorly sourced content needed to be cleaned out, but it's going to take time to replace that stuff with better, more objective content. As has been noted, unverified is not the same as unverifiable.ShroomofDoom 00:57, 5 February 2007 (UTC) [ <small>This is the users first and only edit. - <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">Francis Tyers</a> <a href="../../../f/-/m/User_talk%7EF-m-t_cc17.html" title="User talk:F-m-t">·</a> 11:32, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</small> ]

<li><b>Keep</b> Appears to be a bad-faith nom. Removing the majority of an article (uncited or not) and then immediately AfDing it seems suspect to me. Especially when the nominator made no effort to reply to the ongoing discussion on the talk page until three days later.

<li><b>Comment</b> It was an unfair comment, but this is a rather strange deletion vote. She acknowledges that reliable sources exist, so the article is verifiable, even if it weren't currently verified (which I would dispute). It's also clearly notable -- even the short version of the article has two independent print sources. This is a strong argument to keep, not to delete. Also, since people insist on misreading the citations as to web pages, I have removed that aspect and reinstated them in what I hope is a clearer fashion, referring to the original documents themselves. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 19:58, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My vote stands based on the rationale of almost all the keep votes, namely, that the article was cut down and then AfD'd. The full article should be deleted, and to suggest otherwise is to ignore WP Policy. If you want to start with a referenced stub, then delete this pile of OR and start over. I agree there are sources out there that REFERENCE it, but not necessarily that such sources make it notable. The same book, for example, spends a paragraph on minor fetishes such as attraction to clocks and plants. --<font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a4a9.html" title="User:Elaragirl"><font color="SteelBlue">Elar</font></a><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a_7dff.html" title="User:Elaragirl/a"><font color="orange"><b>a</b></font></a><font color="SteelBlue">girl</font><small><sup><a href="../../../e/l/a/User_talk%7EElaragirl_228e.html" title="User talk:Elaragirl">Talk</a>|Count</sup></small></font> 22:44, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>So people should keep unreliably cited/uncited information in just because it's on VfD? That's not a good thing to think. If so, I could go to any number of articles on VfD and make up a bunch of stuff about them to make them seem like great articles. The information should be more reliably sourced precisely <i>because</i> the article is on VfD. I don't think this is a malicious VfD. Hashish doesn't seem to have an agenda. He/she had not even edited any articles relating to furries before nomming this for deletion. Heck, I think the article as it is should be deleted, but it could be a great article on the subject with sources. Aren't furries usually complaining about MTV and Vanity Fair doing something? Those things are probably about yiff, aren't they? If this article gets deleted, an article that asserts notability and gives cited information beyond a dicdef would most likely be approved by the majority here, and I'm sure that most would not be against a creation. <a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVoretus_d72f.html" title="User:Voretus">Voretus</a> 19:40, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment:</b> No valid assertion of notability appears in the article at this writing, later than Vigo's two items above. <b>Neutral</b>, because some minor and passing notability might be shown by the added sources. Avoiding self-reference isn't a primary policy, but where Wikipedia-related stuff is the primary claim to notability, we need to make sure there is truly substantial independent source material, such as featured discussion of the ability of collaborative projects to protect themselves from being commercialized.

<p>Probable hoax. No ghits for it, and this article has no references or sources cited. It also appears to be either an advertisement, or a joke article, or something similar.

<li><b>Keep</b> What is notability? I have edited the article myself with great care and every entry is true and verified. Why can I not contact Avraham? It has been in existance for some months already and I have already had it accepted by other WIKIPEDIA "policemen". Please dont delete this page. Murray Wilson is clearly of great international stature and is a senior manager in the United Nations, he is clearly of greater status and stature than many others in his alumni groups. He was awarded the Iraq medal by the queen for service and bravery. I cannot think of a better person for inclusion in WIKIPEDIA, especially as many other entries are just local sports people who have achieved little in their lives. Please contact me. --Muzzamemphis 18:17, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Much information about him has had to be restricted due to his signing of the Official Secrets Act. If you can lay out minimum requirements for "notification" I am certain they can be met. --Muzzamemphis 18:43, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Apart from notification, which is for clear reasons I have explained, dont you agree that someone of his great stature, selfless devotion to humans in crisis, and humanity is ideally suited for inclusion??--Muzzamemphis 18:45, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Please read <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 19:20, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Those make him suited for some recognition somewhere. Wikipedia is not that place, unless you can find independent sources which give non-trivial coverage to his work. Thousands of people do service work within foreign countries, and thousands of people are UN bureaucrats. The only claim that comes close to notability is being awarded the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq_Medal_fcf7.html" title="Iraq Medal">Iraq Medal</a>, but per that award's article, "The medal, therefore, continues to be awarded for either thirty days service in Iraq or, in the case of aircrew, for ten sorties flown into Iraq." Anyone killed or injured in that service also gets the medal. I don't see any reason to consider that a major award; thousands of people have already been awarded it, presumably, based on the listed criteria. <b>Delete</b> per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> unless <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> are found which show he's been recognized for individual accomplishments not shared by thousands of others. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 19:31, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>If it is the case that merely being one of many is the reason for not including him, then why inclde rugby players, of whom there are thousands, or writers, of whom there are again thousands. And few of them have any lead role in society. Wikipedia must not become UK or Eurocentric. it is and must remain an international tome.
<p>Apart from the Iraq medal, Murray has been arrested and tortured by Saddam Huseins Baath party in 1990, he created the first Conflict Management Unit in the world within the UN system, he negotiated directly with the Khmer Rouge in 1996 to try and recover kidnapped friends. Thousands of people dont do this, almost nobody has given up 20 years of their lives with such dedication and sacrifice. On this point the previous contributer is just wrong. I just dont see how you can say that the bass player from Supertramp, or the pianist who accompanied some famous singers can be included whilst this genuine hero is ignored. He also has signed letters of thanks from Donald Rumsfeld, Hillary Benn and L Paul Bremmer. I would call all of this non-trivial, but as was stated in the discussion, the oficial secrects act and personal security means that for obvious reasons hias name could not be widely acknowledged. He would not have been proposed if he were just one of the aid workers who gives up a few months to prove themselves but he is a true and genuine leader in his field. I would suggest that any decisions in this matter be made by people who understand the sector and the profession. As far as notability is concerned then more references can be found. This processjust seems like a very confrontational and subjective way to expand the base of knowledge, who are these faceless "policemen" anyway? Personal tastes and jealousies should not come into the discussion, how about John Corrie, Tory MP, one pf thousands over the years, has done nothing of note ever, you tell me who deserves to be ibcluded?</p>

<dd>Well, there's User:Muzzamemphis, who created the page. There's User:World community, who seems to be a SPA and after calling Keith Moffatt "a complete nobody" a few lines up also added that assertion to his article. There's an IP address that, based on the last couple of edits, seems to belong to User:Muzzamemphis. And there's a categorizing bot, and the AfD tag. I hope you didn't think that all of the links in the article were sources; they were just links to the websites of the organizations mentioned. --<a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxamegalon2000_b578.html" title="User:Maxamegalon2000">Maxamegalon2000</a> 15:31, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Definitely Keep" - I have known Murray Wilson since 2001 through my role as a member of staff at the Department of Peace Studies at The University of Bradford. Murray's contribution to this field has been significant enough to gain attention. Insights he has gained have been shared with hundreds of students within the Department of Peace Studies in guest lectures and informal seminar discussions. Many students have described his work as a real 'inspiration' in their own efforts to make a difference in the world. Such practical insights are what ensure academic debate is grounded in reality. If Wikipedia is to be of value, then people like Murray must be included. His work is not trivial. It is of profound value in a troubled world. It must also be stated that this is not about ego. So much of Murray's work happens behind the scenes and will never be published. This article must not be deleted. It's as simple as that. Michael Fryer.

<p>I respectfully argue that <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorvus_cornix_890e.html" title="User:Corvus cornix">Corvus cornix</a> is mistaken. I am the article's creater, and I have not removed any tag from the article. Furthermore, <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorvus_cornix_890e.html" title="User:Corvus cornix">Corvus cornix</a> later acknowledged on my talk page that his original PROD tag was mistaken.</p>
<p>I believe he has me confused with a newly registered user who created a number of arguably non-notable entries for similar companies yesterday.</p>
<p>At any rate, based on the following published guidelines for notability, I believe that this article should remain published and is both non-promotional and neutral:</p>
<p>Criteria for companies and corporations</p>
<p>A company or corporation is notable if it meets any of the following criteria:</p>
<pre>
  1. The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company or corporation itself.
         * This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations2 except for the following:
               o Media reprints of press releases, other publications where the company or corporation talks about itself, and advertising for the company.1
               o Works carrying merely trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that simply report extended shopping hours or the publications of telephone numbers and addresses in business directories.
  2. The company or corporation is listed on ranking indices of important companies produced by well-known and independent publications.3
  3. The company's or corporation's share price is used to calculate one or more of the major managed stock market indices.4 Note this is not the same as simply being listed on a stock market. Nor is it the same as being included in an index that comprises the entire market. The broader or the more specialized the index, the less notability it establishes for the company.
</pre>
<p>The company has been the subject of numerous articles (*not* press releases) in its industries' journals of record, satisfying #1, and is ranked annually in ranking indices in those same journals of record, satisfying #2. The sources currently cited in the article satisfy these requirements, but I will add more. Davedonohue 19:21, 1 February 2007 (UTC)Davedonohue</p>
<dl>
<dd>Mr. Donohue is correct in that I keep mixing him up with User:Timdyson, but both are creating articles on the same company and editing each other's articles. I did not say on Davedonohue's Talk page that my prod wasn't valid, but I did change the reason for the prod because of my mixup of the two editors. The reasoning for my prod nomination still stands, as does my reasoning for this nomination for deletion. <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorvus_cornix_890e.html" title="User:Corvus cornix">Corvus cornix</a> 19:25, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>As the person who seems to have created this problem I'd first like to apologize if I have broken any rules. I would hope that anyone who researches my company will soon learn that the businesses are all notable in their field. Deleting them from wikipedia would be somewhat unfair given there are other similar firms listed and their entries are no more supported. --Timdyson 19:58, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorvus_cornix_890e.html" title="User:Corvus cornix">User:Corvus cornix</a> did change the prod reason - apologies for not noticing that on my own page. I maintain that this article pertains to a company that meets both criteria #1 and #2 above, thus satisfactorily establishing its notability, and suggest that if the deletion discussion continue, those who disagree should cite why they believe it does NOT meet those criteria.</dd>

<p>Yes, he is mentioned as a co-author of papers on urology in the listed sources, along with a Dr. Bush who is likely his father.

<li>The only way you can submit papers to the American Urologic Association is to be a member which requires you to be a doctor. Aaron Bush is 13 when he started, not leaving him time to attend medical school. Also the last person listed on authors for medical papers is the author, the other people are usually research assistance. Also look up patent number 10/779.354.</li>

</dl>
<p>Short and simple: these articles are original research, are speculative, and have no clear definition against which their claims can be weighed. I urge <b>deletion</b>.</p>
<p>The first inherent problem with the articles lies in their namespace. Each article discusses the countries in the context of becoming the next "superpower". Superpower is a political science term usually used to talk about the two powers in a bipolar system (USA &amp; USSR in Cold War), or the one power in a unipolar system (USA today). In essence, a superpower is defined by the polarity of the international system--that is, a calculation of <i>relative</i> power--not by the absolute material, political, economic, of cultural factors it possesses. These articles catalog the absolute material etc. factors possessed by these countries, but provide no definition for what constitutes a superpower, or discuss when and how China/India/EU might finally become considered a superpower. Moreover, if the international system does not move from unipolarity to bipolarity, but instead moves from unipolarity to multipolarity (if China, India, and EU all rise concurrently, for example) than no state will be considered a superpower, because the term isn't used for the polar powers in a multipolar system ("great power" is generally used). The namespace, right off the bat, makes a rather large assumption about how the world is going to turn out. It's speculative at best, but really it's simply misleading. Superpowers are not superpowers because of absolute capabilities, but because of relative capabilities. One could write an entire article on why China will be the next superpower based solely on American decline, with no facts about China at all, simply because superpower status is relative.</p>
<p>Furthermore, relative power is defined by political scientists in myriad ways--most academics and politicians define power using different relevant capabilities (e.g. most use military, some include population, some include political system, some include economic, some include manufacturing output, some include urbanization, some include energy use, some include territory size, some include global reach capabilities, some include sway over international opinion, some include cultural influence, etc. etc. etc.). Measuring some of those factors leads one to different conclusions about relative power than measuring other factors. If the articles stick only to military and economic factors, then they are presenting a view biased towards Realist IR theory; the they use economics, political system, and international influence, then they are presenting a view biased toward Liberal IR theory; if they present the view that "superpower" status is a socially constructed term, then they are biased toward Constructivist IR theory, etc. Even if they present research on all the possible factors, they are still advancing original research.</p>
<p>This leads me to the second, and more serious, problem with these articles, is that they are original research. <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> specifically states that the following is to be considered original research:</p>
<ul>
<li>It introduces an analysis or synthesis of established facts, ideas, opinions, or arguments in a way that builds a particular case favored by the editor, without attributing that analysis or synthesis to a reputable source;</li>
</ul>
<p>What we see in this collection of articles is not a discussion of various published sources and their views on China/India/EU's potential to become a superpower. Few if any authors are directly mentioned in the text at all. What we see are a number of sections asserting something about China/India/EU -- it's big, wealthy, growing, has social problems, has economic problems, etc. Mostly primary sources are cited. But since there is no standard for what constitutes a superpower other than relative power, there is no way to cite primary sources without the articles becoming an argument-advancing synthesis.</p>
<p>If the articles only cited and discussed secondary sources (i.e. experts discussing their theory or criterion about China/India/EU's rise), the article would still be unencyclopedic. No other Wikipedia article would be allowed to have a {{Template:Speculation}} and {{Template: Future}} on them, knowing full well that the expected event may not come to pass for <i>at least</i> 15-20 years, if not 50 years. Especially an article about social or political issues, which are subject to the most extreme and unpredictable vagaries and vicissitudes of nearly any subject covered by Wikipedia. But these articles, by their very nature, would need such tags, because even the secondary-source authors are engaging in speculation about a future event that may or may not come to pass.</p>
<p>Let's do a thought experiment: if Wikipedia had been invented back in the 1980's, there would have been a strong temptation to write an article on Japan as an emerging superpower. We look back on this as silly now (evidenced clearly by no attempt ever having been made to start one for Japan in the current series of emerging superpower articles). But in the 1980's Japan was kicking the USA's butt--huge growth, special cultural advantages, high technology, etc. There were scads of articles coming out predicting the Japanese century ahead, and Japan as the next superpower competitor for the United States. Fast forward to today--if that article was still around, what would we do with it? Japan clearly hasn't lived up to the predictions from the 1980s. We would most likely delete the article once it became clear that Japan wasn't going to live up to the hype. But what would the criteria for deletion be? We could still have such an article, listing all the demographic, economic, cultural, military advantages that Japan has today, just like the articles we currently have on China/India/EU. Arguably Japan has better qualifications currently than India does, if you measure by certain criteria (economy) and not others (population). There would be no structural difference between a Japan article and the articles we currently have.</p>
<p>This is why the concept of an article on XYZ country as an emerging superpower is inherently flawed. The articles are based on absolute capabilities rather than relative systemic capabilities, they assume a bipolar rather than a multipolar world to come, they synthesize primary sources to build a case not attributed to reputable authors, they will remain speculative and future-predicting for <i>at least</i> 15-20 years, and in light of historical predictions of superpower status they clearly aren't encyclopedic. <b>Wikipedia articles should not be written about predictions of future events, it's that simple, no matter how many primary sources are used to back up one side or the other side of the case.</b></p>

<dd>Not to get into a battle over nomenclature here, but that would be a hypothesis.

<dd>There's no doubt that a great deal of work went into assembling all the data. That's why I urge merging relevant data in relevant articles (China's economic info into <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economy_of_China_c1d6.html" title="Economy of China">Economy of China</a>, etc). There are certainly authors, both academic and popular, who predict the rise of these countries. Those predictions belong in the articles about those authors and books. Collecting them together under the nomenclature of "emerging superpower" is misleading and original research. But, even if we found those articles and authors, the subject matter would still be unsuitable for a wikipedia article. Classification of a country as a superpower or even as a great power is a holistic, relative, and subjective affair. We have articles about economic miracles--but those are quantifiable and based on objective, absolute measures of material facts. "Superpower" status is not nearly the same--it depends not only on the country in question, but upon all the other major countries in the international system. Like I said above, one could write an article about the rise of China to superpower status written entirely in terms of U.S. decline, with nothing at all about China in the whole article--because superpower status is relative. Moreover, different criteria are relevant to different authors: some are realist, some are liberal, some are constructivist, some are marxist--all pick different factors reflecting international power--thus, the whole project is subjective in a way that Chile's economic miracle is not. The article would remain speculation and predictive of a future event for at least a decade if not several. I know of no other Wikipedia articles given that kind of leeway in discussing speculation.

If they are just a bunch of isolated scholars all working on the same problem linkage might be original research, but as soon as you have, say, an edited book or a colloquium "Will China be the next superpower?" there is good reason to discuss the research in one article.

<dd>With all respect, there are edited books and colloquiums on all manner of speculative subjects. Cruise the think tanks in DC or academic fora and you'll see meetings discussing nearly anything. This does not mean that Wikipedia ought to have articles on every speculative subject discussed, even if there's an edited volume published about it. The articles themselves do not use secondary sources, do not cite authors and experts, and do not present each author and expert's opinion seperately--it's all merged together, synthesized into one large argument-advancing piece, with no attribution. Just look at the talk pages to see what a honeypot these articles are for nationalists and racists adding completely unfounded material to these articles. There is no way to salvage these namespaces based on verifiable, non-speculative sources that solves the problem of the inherent assumptions made in the namespace alone, much less the article text.—<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerceval_c015.html" title="User:Perceval">Perceval</a> 23:38, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's an interesting question, but inherently a presupposition. It preassummes that the world will become bipolar instead of multipolar. So it's an article not only on what country is likely to gain relative to all others, such that only it and another country have enough of the relevant capabilities within the international system to be considered superpowers (a subjective standard, as political scientists will admit), but it's also an article that bases its speculation upon another speculation about how the world will turn out (i.e. that the world <i>will</i> change from unipolarity, and that it will go to bipolarity not multipolarity). While articles on speculation are explicitly disallowed (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#CRYSTALBALL" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#CRYSTALBALL</a>, point #3), articles on speculation based upon a speculative, unspoken presupposition are <i>clearly</i> out of bounds. That being said, there are numerous articles discussing structure in the international system, by realists, liberals, and marxists alike. They discuss historical structure, current structure, and how structure might change in the future, or whether structure is even a worthwhile way to think about international relations. They further discuss what criteria ought to be used in determining a great power (not surprisingly they almost all disagree), and whether the number of poles really has much of a determinant effect on the behavior of states at all. Because such classifications (great power, superpower) are based heavily on these types of assumptions (relevant criteria, necessary share of capabilities, relevance of structure, IR theory school, etc), it's a very very bad idea to label specific countries unless you are explicit about who exactly is labelling them (e.g. <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenneth_Waltz_4e3e.html" title="Kenneth Waltz">Kenneth Waltz</a>) and why (e.g. Waltz notes that country X had a big army relative to other countries in those years). Trying to compare countries as great powers or potential superpowers is a guaranteed disaster, because you'll be mixing authors, theories, criteria, and there will be no standard upon which you could cross-compare the countries. In sum, it ought to be avoided.—<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerceval_c015.html" title="User:Perceval">Perceval</a> 00:29, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>(Reset indent)</i> Well, here is a hypothetical example that would be acceptable under our rules:
<dl>
<dd>The question whether China can be the next superpower has attracted significant academic and popular attention. A <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superpower.html" title="Superpower">superpower</a> is defined as ... In his book "China, the Superpower of the 21st Century", Prof. Prefect writes "China has the human and natural resources to become the dominant player in Asia within 100 years, second only to the U.S.A. in global influence". This conjecture is critized by Prof. Hallmonitor who writes: "Despite its size and human capital, China is at least 50 years away from creating the necessary political and social institutions to allow a rise in regional prominence", etc., etc.</dd>

<dd>Interesting example. More likely it would feature "Prof. Prefect defines a superpower/bipolarity XYZ", "In his book he talks about how current trends relate to the criteria for superpower status: example 1,2,3,4...", "Prof. Beeblebrox defines a superpower/bipolarity ABC", "In her book she talks about these other current trends and how they relate to the criteria for superpower status." One structural problem with such an article is that there are very few books or papers written specifically against such a point, i.e. there are no journal articles with the title "Why China Won't Be a Superpower", even though a number of people do not believe China will be the next superpower. As such, the article would most assuredly be one-sided, and run into potential NPOV problems. Finally, there would need to be some way to resolve the namespace problem, such that it doesn't presuppose a speculative outcome.—<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerceval_c015.html" title="User:Perceval">Perceval</a> 01:39, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Rename and repurpose articles... maybe?</b> Without having more time to thoroughly review these articles, I have to say they appear at least on the surface to be well written and generally well referenced, at least for purposes of verifying individual facts. I agree with the nominator that the overall theme of whether or not a country will become a "superpower" is original research, though, and quite speculative. While I do think these articles need to be altered to remove the speculative properties, I also suspect there is quite a bit of useful, verifiable information about these countries within these articles. And since the articles are quite large, merging that information directly into the main article on each country might be problematic. I'm guessing that the ideal solution would be to rename and repurpose the articles so that they discuss various significant geopolitical and economic factors about the country, and link it as a subarticle to the country's main article. Also, if possible, locate a few more secondary references that contain similar analysis to whatever original analysis is contained in the articles so that those bits of potential OR can be backed up by published analysis saying similar things.</li>

<dd>Worst case, I would suggest deleting the articles but copying and pasting them into user space as draft articles.

<li>I'm curious as to why you <i>strongly</i> favor keeping it when you acknowledge that there are a lot of unclear factors. The problem is not necessarily with content--most of which is cited. The problem is whether such an article can avoid being inherently original research, when based on a speculation about a long-off future event, and with a built-in assumption that the world will become bipolar rather than multipolar (an event that has little or nothing to do with the absolute material capabilities of one country, but is related to the relative capabilities of all countries in the international system). In this sense, the article not only speculates about the future power of one country, but in the namespace alone makes an assumption about the power capabilities of <i>all states</i> 15+ years into the future.—<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerceval_c015.html" title="User:Perceval">Perceval</a> 04:41, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>As I've said on my talk page, I think the solution here is to tack an OR tag on and comb out the sludge. There's no question that there can be (and should be!) an article discussing the different answers people have given to whether or not China's going to be a "superpower." As long as we <i>report</i> on speculation, it's fine. If you have a namespace problem, AfD is not the way to go. It's a "strong" keep because these are AfDs on very highly developed articles worked on by many (and I think a fourth nomination for AfD is excessive.) <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 05:27, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I put these articles up for AFD because I didn't think an OR tag would be enough--the articles are defective in their fundamental premise. I appreciate that they are highly developed, and the raw data used can be used elsewhere profitably, but the premise of the article is one that cannot avoid OR and is inherently based on speculative presuppositions.

<li>There are essays trying to predict how the structure of the international system will change, certainly. But they are essentially speculation--speculation based on theory and trends, but speculation nonetheless. Point #3 states that extrapolation and speculation are disallowed, and that's what this article is: extrapolating current trends to speculate on China's rise to superpower status. Point #1 states that future events are permissible "only ... if the event is notable and almost certain to take place." Certainly, China's rise would be notable, but it is not at all certain to take place. Moreover, that it rises specifically to become a superpower (in a bipolar system) rather than as one of many great powers (in a multipolar system) is even less certain to take place.—<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerceval_c015.html" title="User:Perceval">Perceval</a> 06:39, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

They are mostly primary source material about China's GDP, military size, demographics or China's social problems, etc. I have a valuable discussion above with <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> regarding what an article based on credible research might look like. However, I still maintain that such an article would be inherently misleading because of the built-in assumptions about systemic polarity (that the world will become bipolar instead of multipolar). Further, they are speculation about an event proposed to happen at the very least a decade into the future. Point #1 says that an article about the "2016 U.S. presidential election and 2036 Summer Olympics are not considered appropriate article topics because nothing can be said about them that is verifiable and not original research." The same would apply to China because of the long time span regarding its potential rise.—<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerceval_c015.html" title="User:Perceval">Perceval</a> 08:08, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>You have a bunch of complaints that you have confused. One is that the page as is has lots of OR. Solution: comb out OR or add OR tag. The next is that you think that people who ask if China is going to be a superpower are wrong to do so. Solution: find credible sources that say same and create "criticising the question" section. Finally, you repeat the claim that P#3 does not apply and P#1 does, which we've already discussed. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 16:45, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Those are not my arguments. I argue that the concept of the page itself leads to OR: all the facts are well cited, but the facts are synthesized (chosen, placed together, justified) to make an original point. The facts are not there to back up a published expert's claim, they are there because the <i>editors chose</i> those particular factors as important. That is original research. You can't comb out OR when the whole concept of the page is OR. Second, I don't think it's wrong to ask if China will be a superpower. What I'm saying is that China becoming a superpower is not dependent on China--superpower status is based on relative not absolute power. So listing a bunch of facts about China is meaningless, no matter how well cited, because China as a superpower is dependent on two things: its power relative to every other powerful state in the international system, and whether the system changes from unipolarity to bipolarity or multipolarity. Neither of these things can be examined by listing the attributes or issues facing China. Finally, point #3 says that we can have articles about credible research that is predictive, but these essays are not <i>about</i> credible research, they <i>are</i> research. Where are there any authors discussed who put forward research on China as a superpower, not simply speculation? Are any china-superpower theorists given a section or even named in the text? No there aren't. The only people named are those cited for specific facts used to support the broader points <i>being made by the editors.</i>—<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerceval_c015.html" title="User:Perceval">Perceval</a> 22:22, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sorry to misunderstand you. I think we agree that an article along the lines of "Summary of discussion of 'China as superpower' from notable sources" is something wikipedia should have? <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 22:45, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I wouldn't go so far as to say "should". For instance, articles on books or authors who put forth such theories are certainly viable, as long as those articles describe and summarize the argument rather than finding facts to buttress it. If we eventually amass a collection of such individual articles, I would not be against a survey article that overviews all of the individual articles and provides links back to them. But I don't think we should set out with the object of a "china as a superpower" article.—<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerceval_c015.html" title="User:Perceval">Perceval</a> 22:45, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete all</b> merge useful information. I thin that we have a conception of 'superpower' which has different aspects such as economy, military, etc. There is nothing wrong with <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economy_of_China_c1d6.html" title="Economy of China">economy of China</a> citing a reference to China's impending superpower status. The problem is we don't know the final outcome and calling it "emerging superpower" is drawing conclusions about an unfinished game. The United States as an emerging superpower is already an article... we just call it <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_United_States_%281918%E2%80%931945%29_8d7f.html" title="History of the United States (1918–1945)">History of the United States (1918–1945)</a>. If China/Indian/EU is considered a superpower someday then the time of their emergence will get a history article. Until then we will cover the growth in economic, etc. articles. As a secondary resort I would accept <b>rename all</b> to International power of foo because it at least does not attempt to predict the future. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 04:23, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem with rename all is that there is no standard by which to judge "international power". Realists judge military capabilities and economic production, Liberals judge regime type, economic development, weight within international institutions, Marxists judge on a core-periphery analysis of the state and by the character of its economic system, etc. Which capabilities are the relevant ones for international power in that case--do you choose one theory (an bias the article) or choose all theories (and make a bizarre synthesis of all the theories together)? Moreover, which capabilities are international capabilities and which are domestic capabilities? These articles discuss a lot of things that are essentially domestic --internal social instability, national culture, etc. International power of Foo would be just as much original research as these articles. I wholeheartedly agree with your point about USA as emerging superpower == history of the united states (1918–1945).

No need to include long-winded speculation about what country the next superpower will be. It would not be out of bounds to mention various states that have been considered possible challengers to the United States, with appropriate citations, but I would stop short of marshalling evidence on behalf of those nations.

<dd>Nobleeagle, it's not about the articles being sourced. Anyone can see that every fact presented has a source, sometimes multiple. The problem is the inherent assumption contained in the article's premise, and the synthesis of these primary sources which advances an argument. 1) There is no commonly accepted criteria for superpower status - so listing all the material and cultural factors for a country's rise is meaningless, and there is no clear point at which China could be said to be a superpower. 2) Superpower is a label applied to bipolar or unipolar powers, thus it is not a measure of absolute capabilites, but of relative capabilities within the international system. Thus, presenting a list of factors in one country's rise has nothing to do with whether it will or will not become a superpower. What matters is the relative growth and decline of all powers within the international system, and which capabilities/factors are considered relevant to the measure of a country's power. The article does not and cannot provide that relative context, and provides no criteria on what factors are relevant to a state's power (a subject upon which there is wide disagreement within IR theorists, as you should know). 3) <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#CRYSTALBALL" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#CRYSTALBALL</a> does not allow articles speculating on events that might possibly occur in several decades maybe, based on extrapolation of current trends. It's original research, plain and simple. 4) The primary source data can easily be used on the relevant country subpages (Culture in China, Demographics in China, Economy in China, etc), so none of that research will be lost. 5) The articles are not about current theories on China's rise--no authors or their theories are cited by name, no sections are devoted to individual authors and their criteria or definitions. These articles present primary data synthesized to argue one side or the other, and the primary data is assembled not based on published theories but on the editors' whims.—<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerceval_c015.html" title="User:Perceval">Perceval</a> 08:23, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep or rename</b> This article covers a referenced and notable intilectual concept. This article should stay. Perhaps it should be renamed and given a less speculative title.

<li><b>Strong Delete All</b> These kind of speculative articles are very un-encyclopedic and annoying. Just because they source other people who state their predictions of the future doesn't make this a real topic; an encyclopedia doesn't have a list of oracular speculations by different people. Who goes to an encyclopedia searching for an article on "_____ as an emerging superpower" anyway? Besides, the articles are always at risk of selective referencing that emphasizes a certain view. The POV emphasized is in support of the country becoming a superpower. <b>These articles are like POV forks except that there are no articles for the other POV. They are inherently dedicated to a POV.</b> And honestly, could anyone here get away with an article about <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China as a Doomed Nation</a> or <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India as a Failing Failure</a>? Of course, those titles are exaggerating the concept, but my point is that people would find the other half of the POV fork unacceptable, and so this half should also be unacceptable. Even if there were opposing POV articles, the obvious action would be to integrate these into a neutral whole, assuming that the "oracle" problem is resolved. In sum, these speculative compendiums of carefully selected trends and quotes have no place in an encyclopedia that aims to be a neutral repository of verifiable facts taken from reliable sources. They are antithetical to the encyclopedia's goals. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 07:29, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

Someone, somewhere is willing to write about it--and then we'll have a multiplication of these articles on nearly every big country, because every nationalist wants to have their country represented in Wikipedia as the next emerging superpower. They'll fill it up with all the primary source information on GDP growth and military power that the current articles on China/India/EU have. But there remains no standard upon which we can say yes to India but no to Brazil. Moreover, where does it stop? Next we'll have Uzbekistan as an emerging regional power, Argentina as an emerging regional power, Indonesia as an emerging regional power, and on. This is the problem with speculative articles--there's no way to say no once you've opened up the floodgates to articles about what might possibly happen decades from now maybe.—<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerceval_c015.html" title="User:Perceval">Perceval</a> 08:37, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>These are users that have worked with the articles, I don't at all support Perceval's deletion of pages without informing the main editors to the pages. They are also members of WikiProject Power in international relations. To not one user did I tell them what to vote, I told them that it was up for deletion, to inform them. Indeed, one user I contacted told me on my talk page that "something has to be done with the articles, because at the moment they are like essays". I'm sorry if you take my actions wrongly, but I feel I have done nothing wrong by telling involved users about the article. I thought it was general Wikiquette to tell the largest contributors that the article they have spent time on is up for deletion. <b><font color="#000080">—</font> <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobleeagle_e018.html" title="User:Nobleeagle"><font color="#000080">N</font><font color="#12098A">o</font><font color="#120ABA">b</font><font color="#2015E3">l</font><font color="#1364EA">e</font><font color="#2BA4EC">e</font><font color="#1364EA">a</font><font color="#2015E3">g</font><font color="#120ABA">l</font><font color="#12098A">e</font></a></b> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/b/User_talk%7ENobleeagle_accc.html" title="User talk:Nobleeagle"><font color="#2015E3" size="0.2" face="Arial Narrow">[TALK]</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nobleeagle_dfb1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nobleeagle"><font color="#2015E3" size="0.2" face="Arial Narrow">&#160;[C]</font></a></sup> 23:39, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I was just trying to raise the possibility for comment, not actually accuse Nobleeagle in any "for sure" way. The wording of all of the notifications was neutral of course, but it can still be votestacking if it is clear that a certain user will vote a certain way just upon any notification of the debate. I don't think all of the cases were this clear, but some of them are arguable, such as those users who were active in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Power_in_international_relations_2c42.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Power in international relations">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Power_in_international_relations</a>. The most blatant example is of that Rumpelstiltskin character; his strong pro-Indian and pro-Hindu POV warring on a variety of articles leaves no doubt that he would vote "keep" here.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> This material should be merged into relevant super topics like "Economy of China", "Foreign Relations of China" et al, sans the original research, which a lot of the article currently consists of. I was originally going to say weak keep or rename, but after reading the article a bit more carefully and really thinking about it, I changed my mind. My basic problem is this...an encyclopedia is a catalog of "things that exist". "Things" can be concepts, ideas, phyiscal objects...blah blah. Wikipedia is the same, except the medium allows it to track changes in those "things". That's where it get dangerous. Some things do not change over a relevant time scale, like the size and composition of a planet, and on the other side, some things change rapidly. The very title of the article, and most notably, the word "emerging", suggests the latter. Look at it this way, if this were the title of a book or an article, its corresponding encyclopedia entry would be to describe the book, not to present the underlying material to the reader that is engineered to advance that books argument. That is what this article represents...a thinly veiled attempt to advance an argument based on a vast collection of sources taken together. Sounds like an essay, not an encyclopedia article. Most of the content here is well organized, and possibly useful. However taken together, with the title, and the content, and the way that it is presented, it is clearly original research by synthesis.--<a href="../../../i/r/e/User%7EIRelayer_de15.html" title="User:IRelayer">IRelayer</a> 23:09, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I do not deny that the articles need changes and possible chopping down, they use primary sources too often and would be better if every source referred to the nation's actual superpower emergence. but I would like to draw an analogy. There is an article called <a href="../../../e/f/f/Effects_of_global_warming.html" title="Effects of global warming">Effects of global warming</a>, which details future effects that may or may not occur relating to global warming. Much of the article is well written and is attibuted to particular people, which is what this article needs. However, the concept is the same: <b>Effects of global warming is speculation over a future event that may or may not occur, but the speculation itself is a very current event. Similarly, emerging superpower hypotheses are speculation over a future event, but the speculation itself is a very current event.</b> The articles tend not to say that "The Chinese military will become better than the United States by 21 May 2014", it says stuff about the recent military rise that is currently troubling the United States. Both articles are well sourced, both possess the same premise. <b>The emerging superpower concept is similar to the future global warming impacts concept, if the latter belongs to Wikipedia, so does the former. Thus the concerns don't relate to the concept and their validity (unless Perceval wishes to nominate Effects of global warming for deletion), the concerns relate to the OR and Primary Source use which is presented in the article.</b> To fix these things, you use a TALK PAGE, not an AFD, Perceval hasn't even bothered touching the talk page and telling everyone his concerns so that the articles can be helped. If you say delete because of the concept of the emerging superpower doesn't belong to Wikipedia, then what are your views on the global warming hypotheses on Wikipedia, if you say delete because the article is OR, then that's not the way to go, you instead should tag the article and place messages on talk pages. <b><font color="#000080">—</font> <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobleeagle_e018.html" title="User:Nobleeagle"><font color="#000080">N</font><font color="#12098A">o</font><font color="#120ABA">b</font><font color="#2015E3">l</font><font color="#1364EA">e</font><font color="#2BA4EC">e</font><font color="#1364EA">a</font><font color="#2015E3">g</font><font color="#120ABA">l</font><font color="#12098A">e</font></a></b> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/b/User_talk%7ENobleeagle_accc.html" title="User talk:Nobleeagle"><font color="#2015E3" size="0.2" face="Arial Narrow">[TALK]</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nobleeagle_dfb1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nobleeagle"><font color="#2015E3" size="0.2" face="Arial Narrow">&#160;[C]</font></a></sup> 23:49, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Nobleeagle, I respect your opinion on this and other deletion candidates, but I don't believe your comparison to <a href="../../../e/f/f/Effects_of_global_warming.html" title="Effects of global warming">Effects of global warming</a> is valid. There are lots of articles on Wikipedia that mainly concern future events. Video games and movies with an impending future release dates are good examples, but some of the more prominent ones are: <a href="../../../r/i/s/Risks_to_civilization%2C_humans_and_planet_Earth_178e.html" title="Risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth">Risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth</a>, <a href="../../../e/s/c/Eschatology.html" title="Eschatology">Eschatology</a>, and <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultimate_fate_of_the_universe.html" title="Ultimate fate of the universe">Ultimate fate of the universe</a>. These articles have one thing in common in terms of structure: they are all primarily summaries of documented, sourced <b>theories</b> relating to a number of topics. The difference between these (and the global warming article) and the article under discussion is that the latter is a collection of <b>facts</b> (figures, statistics...primary sources) combined in such a way to present a unified theory <b>OF ITS OWN</b> that does not appear anywhere in the source material. In other words, the articles I mentioned all present documented theoretical information relating to a central topic whereas this article presents a collection of seperate facts as one theory, the theory that China is "emerging" as a superpower. If the article instead presented theories from political scientists, historians, and such, it would be acceptable, but as it stands, it is problematic and original research.--<a href="../../../i/r/e/User%7EIRelayer_de15.html" title="User:IRelayer">IRelayer</a> 08:22, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Indeed, on <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPerceval_4c03.html#Emerging_superpower" title="User talk:Perceval">my talk page</a> Nobleeagle and I discussed the comparison and my position was as follows: ":<a href="../../../e/f/f/Effects_of_global_warming.html" title="Effects of global warming">Effects of global warming</a> is not a perfect article, and it's not free from original research. However, it is leagues better than the emerging superpowers series. #1, it is not inherently predicated upon an assumption: the superpowers series assumes that polarity will shift from unipolarity to bipolarity, while it is just as plausible that polarity will shift from unipolarity to multipolarity (in which case there would be no superpowers, but simply a set of great powers). #2, it discusses individual authors' theories one by one and attributes those theories directly in the text. Take a look at the first major section: <a href="../../../e/f/f/Effects_of_global_warming.html#More_extreme_weather" title="Effects of global warming">Effects_of_global_warming#More_extreme_weather</a>. Each paragraph begins with the particular theorist/paper/book/etc and discusses their particular contention. The article, for the most part, does not marshal primary source data chosen by wikipedians and assembled by wikipedians as evidence, unlike the superpower articles. #3, the relevant indicators chosen by scientists are scientific, and thus not nearly as arbitrary. Indicators chosen in political science are far more arbitrary, and rely principally upon the author's theoretical school (realism, liberalism, marxism, constructivism). While there is an objective measurement of global temperature and climate change, there is no objective measurement of what constitutes a superpower much less what constitutes state power within the international system."—<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerceval_c015.html" title="User:Perceval">Perceval</a> 22:45, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It would be interesting to try deleting "Global Warming", since it <i>is</i> essentially a position paper backed up by a bunch of scientists. Perhaps the science allegedly involved prevents the deletion from happening. Science tends to be whatever description of reality that is agreed upon by considering the known information, and is usually the conclusion that every logical scientist will reach if they look at the evidence. On the other hand, the same cannot be said of "emerging superpower" opinion pieces. People usually have to put this forward, and then select specific evidence to back it up. It is a POV; others could select different evidence to show that the country is going down the tubes. There isn't a 'scientific' way to make these assertions. And while I could perhaps make, as previously mentioned, an <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India as a Failing Failure</a> article, or have certain Pakistani people make it for me, this wouldn't be tolerated because it would attempt to defame and insult that country, and imply that the country is headed nowhere. And yet there is the opposite article, that serves to puff up a country based on a few editorials on the internet! Hopefully, these halves-of-a-POV fork will be deleted to stop this unscientific silliness. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 17:47, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>However, clearly your "half of a POV" statement crumbles under the fact great pains have been taken to include opposing opinions - both POV's are clearly present and no conclusion is reached, to the fury of the nationalists and the detractors alike (apart from in, possibly, the title. Gramatically it does not invite a conclusion but describes an argument. Practically, it seems to. Perhaps it should argued for it to be changed to perhaps "Probablity of China pertaining superpower status" or something similarly long-winded, but that does not require an AfD). The reader is, throughout, invited to make their own judgements on the basis of the facts and the opinions of the media, but only the information is provided; a la an encylopaedia. 88.104.185.62 19:23, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Even the token criticism added is editorial. It communicates that the country will be a superpower once it addresses a few certain problems.

The problems signified are the hurdles that must be overcome. I'm sorry but I don't understand the point you're trying to make. Criticising China's human rights record, India's troubles with Pakistan and the EU's fractured nature is certainly not something I'd have in the article if I was trying to make it one sided!! 88.104.185.62 00:04, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>A country becoming a superpower is a prediction or presupposition of the structure of the international system. Superpower is a term indicating relative not absolute power. That means that China could become a superpower without growing at all--all that would be required would be the decline of its rivals (the U.S., Europe, Japan, Russia, India, etc). Writing a story about China becoming a superpower filled with facts about the country's material advancement is inherently confused and misleading, because it demonstrates a misunderstanding of the concept of relative power vs. absolute power. Moreover, suppose all potential challengers to the U.S. grew quickly, not just one. Then the world would not move to a bipolar system (with two superpowers), but to a multipolar system (in which the term superpower is not used, but "great power" usually is). Thus an article about China becoming a superpower also presupposes that no other countries will grow quickly enough to become a challenger. You can see why writing an article about a country becoming a superpower is therefore inherently problematic: it misunderstands the concept of a superpower on two levels (relative power vs absolute power, and bipolarity vs multipolarity). Wikipedia articles should not be premised on an erroneous speculative prediction.—<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerceval_c015.html" title="User:Perceval">Perceval</a> 22:45, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Article states subject directed plays, but fails to say where and with whom. The only reputable reference sources cited don't have dates or article names. The article gives the impression that he performed for Madonna, but a closer inspection indicates that he performed in a private suite at the stadium where Madonna was singing. Nothing there satisfies <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> or <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/k/User%7ECaknuck_4acf.html" title="User:Caknuck">Caknuck</a> 22:49, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

If there is an article named <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burrito.html" title="Burrito">burrito</a> and one named <a href="../../../t/a/c/Taco.html" title="Taco">taco</a>, the subject is more than adequately covered there.

<li><b>Delete</b> Article is entirely unreferenced. The list appears to simply be unreferenced original research. Now if this were a referenced article about, say, the history of various fillings for tacos and similar foods and a discussion of different cultural tastes in fillings, that might be an interesting read if the article were properly referenced.

<li>I have taken a second look at these two lists, and I think on second thought what is actually needed is a <b>merge</b> of those parts that are referenced into a single List of ingredients in Mexican cuisine or something like that; it is silly to have them listed under a particular dish, like tacos or burritos, but there is some good info here. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 00:09, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Nope, won't work, since tacos and burritos aren't just <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexican_cuisine.html" title="Mexican cuisine">Mexican cuisine</a> but like Pizzas are found in a variety of cultures. Better to just include the information in the main article on the food. That way you can include examples from all cultures. Besides, the Mexican cuisine article barely talks about the food at all, it's mostly just a directory. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 00:36, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> to <a href="../../../t/a/c/Taco.html" title="Taco">taco</a>. Unlikely to be a hoax but too trivial to be an independent article. <a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWooyi_6e7f.html" title="User:Wooyi">Wooyi</a> 00:24, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would actually object to a merge to <a href="../../../t/a/c/Taco.html" title="Taco">taco</a>; just as <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamburger.html" title="Hamburger">hamburger</a> makes no attempt to list all the possible toppings for a hamburger, I don't think <a href="../../../t/a/c/Taco.html" title="Taco">taco</a> should. On the other hand, I think a List of Mexican food ingredients or something like that might be useful.

<ul>
<li>A look at <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamburger.html" title="Hamburger">hamburger</a> does, however, several <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamburger.html#Serving_style" title="Hamburger">paragraphs</a> that describe Hamburgers as they are served around the world, in a fashion that is not completely different from this list, the primary difference being that it's written in a paragraph style. Which is exactly how I'd prefer this information to be merged into <a href="../../../t/a/c/Taco.html" title="Taco">taco</a> or the other article into <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burrito.html" title="Burrito">burrito</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 01:03, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Of course, a nickname is trivia, but a list of children of world leaders is not. Some of these children become more notable then others, especially those put in the spotlight or have a political future because of their political parent's status. They would most likely be considered 'nobodys' if they were not children of these leaders. They play an important part in the life of the leader. Look at the Bush twins, they have done nothing notable, yet because their father is President of the U.S. they have become notable. Take away his Presidency and his daughters wouldn't even have an article in Wikipedia. Same goes for Chelsea Clinton, no Bill and "who's that girl?" Being a child of a world leader is notable. <a href="../../../j/j/m/User%7EJjmillerhistorian_b2eb.html" title="User:Jjmillerhistorian">Jjmillerhistorian</a> 13:41, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>There is no question that Irish people suffered prejudice and racism in America and elsewhere, but the term "hibernophobe" is a neologism.

<li>Unfortunately, wikipedians have gotten in the habit of inventing terms for ethnic prejudice - see <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Iranianism_c948.html" title="Anti-Iranianism">Anti-Iranianism</a> which was just cut down from 90k to 35k after barely surviving an AfD for example. The problem with all of these -isms is that the terms don't exist outside of wikipedia and because the writer of the article is defining the terms there is a serious possibility of abuse. For example, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Iranianism_c948.html" title="Anti-Iranianism">anti-Iranianism</a> listed as racism all sorts of actions the US and other countries had taken against Iran that were (even according to the article) motivated by political strategy and economics. The best thing to do to avoid these kinds of problems is to use the terms that scholars use. Searching Google scholar, I found over 100 citations, including a few books for either "anti-Irish racism" or anti-Irish prejudice", with significantly fewer for "anti-Irish sentiment" or "anti-Irishism". My preference would be to choose either "anti-Irish prejudice" or "anti-Irish racism". <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> (<a href="../../../g/a/b/User_talk%7EGabrielF_4fa3.html" title="User talk:GabrielF">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GabrielF_3b60.html" title="Special:Contributions/GabrielF">contribs</a>) 14:30, 7 February 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<p>Yes, the article can use clean-up, but the character is not non-notable by any means. He has a major role in the movie - and certainly not an article for deletion. By using your criteria, half of the Star Trek entries would be deleted.</p>
<p>Besides, you should discuss it in the Talk pages before arbitrarily deciding by yourself something should be deleted.</p>

Such a DAB page should be created in any case since there are mentioned a few other Joachims already on the saints page. The dab page should not only link to the saint's page (whose current name is in line with that of many other saints inluding his own wife) but also to the Star Trek film in case the character Joachim remains with out own article (which is what I am voting for) <a href="../../../t/i/k/User%7ETikiwont_2b2d.html" title="User:Tikiwont">Tikiwont</a> 11:02, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>SAVE</b> - I vote to save, for the following reasons:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The character has a significant role in the TOS episode "Space Seed," which was the foundation for TWOK.<br /></li>
<li>Many film scholars have stated that TWOK is an allegory for Moby Dick, with Khan being Ahab. This being the case, Joachim is very much Khan's Starbuck; loyal, but questioning Khan's actins and motives. He is more than a mere "button-pusher." He is Khan's right-hand man.<br /></li>
<li>In non-canon Star Trek books, Joachim is a major character, especially in the Eugenics Wars and books about life on Ceti Alpha V. Yes, it's non-canon but many readers of these Star Trek books would come to this Wikipedia page to read a biography of the character.<br /></li>
<li>The point was made that if Michael Eddington doesn't have his own page, Joachim shouldn't either. Well, I think Eddington should have his own page! He deserves it just as much as Joachim.<br /></li>
<li>Yes, I have heard the rumors as well that Joachim plays a major role in Star Trek XI. As time goes on, people will want to know who this guy is and this article will help refresh their memories.<br /></li>

<li>Are you sure about that? I expected the article to mostly feature well-known terms ("dittohead", "feminazi", "al-[media]") sometimes cited in newspaper articles on the program, but I think a lot of this stuff could have no reliable third-party source and easily qualifies as Rushcruft. Some of it seems to be article humour too. See the entry for "Long-haired, maggot-infested, phony-baloney, plastic-banana, good time rock and roll, FM types". That said, <b>keep</b> for the notability of those terms that are actually notable. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 02:38, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Sarfati is not sufficiently notable as either a creationist or as a chess player. Sarfati fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. In the previous AfD of this article(which ended with no consensus) I argued for keeping the article since additional sources had been provided by David D and because Sarfati was frequently mentioned at scienceblogs.com (which is a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> for most purposes). However, none of these sources mention him in a non-trivial fashion or were discussions in the comments section which are for obvious reasons, not reliabe. Even the most non-trivial of the sources simply argue against arguments he has made. A list of newspaper articles were also given in the last AfD. However, most of those are op-eds which mention Sarfati in passing or other articles which have a short blurb from him.</p>
<p>The claim that he is notable as a chess player is also not credible — there are no non-trivial sources about him as a chess player, and one could even argue that the current chess section constitutes a synthesis that just barely survives <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Wikipedia's no original research policy</a>. Even if you google for "Jonathan Sarfati" + chess the first two pages of hits have three chess pages that mention him; the rest are creationism related sites, evolution related sites, or Wikipedia and its mirrors. The closest to anything notable about chess that I can find is that his chess standings in some tournaments have been mentioned in newspaper chess columns. See for example <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE1D61F3CF933A25756C0A96E948260" class="external autonumber" title="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE1D61F3CF933A25756C0A96E948260" rel="nofollow">[85]</a>. Some of the chess hits are just his reviews of chess books on Amazon.com such as <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Secrets-Practical-Chess-John-Nunn/dp/customer-reviews/1901983013" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.ca/Secrets-Practical-Chess-John-Nunn/dp/customer-reviews/1901983013" rel="nofollow">[86]</a>. It took me a long time to acknowledge/realize this since creationism is an issue I'm very interested in, but the conclusion is unmistakable: Sarfati is not notable enough to have a Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 00:11, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Tentative Keep</b> Found one mainstream city newspaper article which supports claim that the creationist Jonathan Sarfati was a national chess champion for NZ ("EX-WGTN MAN'S BOOK ON EVOLUTION POPULAR", Bob Shaw, 291 words, 5 February 2001, The Evening Post (NZ) via <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factiva.html" title="Factiva">Factiva</a> - this article also suggestst that Sarfati was quite successful as a creationist author in NZ and the US, although the journalist writes that 250,000 of his main book are "in print" rather than actually <i>sold</i> - this sounds like misleading inflation of a subject). A Jonathan Sarfati is listed as a national champion on a website which seems to be the official NZ chess association site (though its a bit of amateurish website)<a href="http://www.nzchess.co.nz/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nzchess.co.nz/" rel="nofollow">[87]</a><a href="http://www.poisonpawn.co.nz/nzcftitles.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.poisonpawn.co.nz/nzcftitles.htm" rel="nofollow">[88]</a>. There's <i>almost</i> enough proof here for a solidly referenced claim that he is a national chess champion. No opinion on the creationist stuff - didn't look into it once the chess angle seemed to be checking out. I agree that the article should be pruned to avoid the impression of puffery / resume abuse of wikipedia. I'm also certainly open to counterarguments showing that Sarfati's claims to chess championship are dubious. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 00:32, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Undecided</b> If the facts in the article are as stated I think he is might be notable enough.

<li><b>Abstain</b> as I have a conflict of interest.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I am president of one of the chess clubs (www.croydonchess.com) which has hosted Jonathan Sarfati for a blindfold simul and can confirm the other chess references above as regards his chess history (e.g. chessgames.com). I frankly suspect the Sarfati article is being targeted for deletion because of his creationist position. Shall we now go on a witch hunt and target, for example, PZ Myers (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PZ_Myers" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PZ_Myers" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PZ_Myers</a>) whose claim to fame appears to be threefold: he is a professor, he is a trenchant critic of creationists, he runs a blog.

<ul>
<li>This doesn't have anything to do with Sarfati being a creationist. If you noticed, the last time this article was nominated for deletion the current nominator (me) argued for keeping the article. In any event refferences to PZ Myers are at best an argument of the form <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS</a> and not terribly useful. In general, Wikipedians are not inclined to listen to arguments claiming that deletions are occuring out of bias. While the chess success may be an indication of notability, we still don't have multiple, non-trivia, independent <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> about Sarfati which as discussed in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">Wikipedia's biography policy</a> is the most fundamental issue. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 02:28, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

Rayment</a> rightly pointed out during the last deletion attempt: 'I struggle to find an evolutionist on Wikipedia with a section titled "criticisms" or similar, but on Wikipedia it's considered POV to simply describe a creationist's beliefs. And some of the criticisms are presented as truth, such as "those scientists do not demonstrate any manifestation of religious faith". The only POV in this article is an anti-creationist one.'</li>
<li>In any case, JoshuaZ has produced nothing at all that wasn't discussed previously, when the attempt to delete was rejected 2-1. It is highly improper to keep trying so soon after. Nothing has changed since he wrote: "Keep per sources from David D. Also if it counts at all he has been frequently rebutted at Scienceblogs which has in the past been considered to meet WP:RS. JoshuaZ 23:10, 16 November 2006 (UTC)" And as shown, winning the chess championship of his country is sufficient by itself for an article entry.60.242.13.87 02:51, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sarfati is not only mentioned in a nontrivial capacity, his work has been the subject of several rebuttals on TalkOrigins. The detractors can't have it both ways, and need to decide whether TalkOrigins is a reliable source, as they have previously stated, or it isn't and therefore should not be allowed to be cited as a WP:RS for any article on Wikipedia because WP:RS cannot be cherry-picked to suit an editor's whim. As only one example of many WP:RS (<a href="../../../n/a/i/NAiG_ee9f.html" title="NAiG">NAiG</a>, ChristianAnswers.net, Tekton Apologetics Ministries, Scott E.C. and Branch G. (2003), etc.) that have either featured, written about, or rebutted Sarfati. 58.162.2.122 08:24, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> for the chess record alone. It seems clear from websearching that he's been the NZ champion once and represented the country at the chess olympiad more than once. Although he does not seem to have played ranked chess for the last 7+ years there will certainly be enough material to write about his chess career in a NPOV and verified way.

<li>My sources tell me that his picture has been on the front cover of <i>New Zealand Chess</i>, the official publication of the NZ Chess Federation, quite a number of times, e.g. when he won the title of NZ Champion. JoshuaZ's searches are likely biased towards American ones, and against publications from pre-Internet days (e.g. Sarfati's title was in 1988), so would not pick up on these. An international encyclopedia should be neither Americocentric nor ageist.60.242.13.87 06:54, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Very emphatic keep</b> - there ought to be a policy of banning users who repeatedly RE-nominate for deletion that have survived such votes in the recent past. At a minimum, there should be a period of 12 months between votes for deletion on a single article. Now, to the point. This guy was New Zealand's chess champion.
