<p>This article is not about the recent report in the <i>Sunday Times</i> that Israel is planning a nuclear strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, rather it is an analysis of Israel's capability to launch such a strike. As it stands, this article needs to be deleted because of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball.</a> This article treats the alleged plan as something that Israel admits (i.e. frequent statements like "Israeli claims that..."), when in fact Israel claims that the Times piece is not accurate. The very title of the article asserts that Israel in fact <i>did</i> propose such a strike, which is completely POV. I removed the most obvious OR from the article, an assessment of the potential radioactive fallout, but the second section is also OR. If we have an article on this topic, it needs to be about the <i>Sunday Times</i> article, NOT about the allegedly proposed strike. It would need to be called something like Reports of an Israeli plan for a nuclear first-strike on the Natanz facility. The question then becomes, Is the Sunday Times piece notable? Policy is foggy here, there doesn't seem to be a specific notability guideline for current events and the general notability criteria really don't work (ANY current event is by definition going to have multiple published works about it. Personally, I don't think that a newspaper report that generated a few days worth of controversy but seems to have been otherwise ignored is at all notable. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 00:32, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - we can't justify having an article for every news story that appears in the press, no matter how interesting.

<dd>I would agree that the content has been much improved. There are still some problems. The article needs to be renamed, for one thing and the opening sentence needs to be changed from "Media reports..." to "A (date) report in the <i>Sunday Times</i>..." or something similar. I'm not sure voting to delete purely on the basis of OR is appropriate at this point. However, the question of notability still stands. This is more of a problem with the wiki not having clear standards of which current events are notable than any problem with the article itself. By the way, I would like to respond to a comment you left on my talk page, which IP should I respond to? <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 14:59, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I will be happy to move the page if we can agree on a good title. The problem is that the title needs to reflect that this is a reported plan and it is difficult to do this without getting too wordy. One possibility is to name the article <i>Revealed: Israel plans nuclear strike on Iran</i> - the title of the <i>Times</i> article. Lets discuss it on the article's talk page. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 18:51, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Among other issues, the notability of such an article can only be evaluated historically, after a significant passage of time. If no strike takes place, history will forget this article and the allegedly proposed strike very quickly.

<li><b>Keep</b> current version, though I would also support merging with <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natanz.html" title="Natanz">Natanz</a> as suggested above. I don't know what this article looked like when the AFD was first posted, but it seems like a reasonable, well-sourced article with relatively little POV (though I can see areas for improvement). The lead needs work, although it's fine as the start of a section within the Natanz article. The key to this are the sources, which are considered reputable. Obviously the article will need to be revisited when and if the report turns out to be disproven, or if such an attack occurs. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 06:25, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> the Sunday Times article is real, and it has gained international attention. Editorial issues are not arguments to delete an entire article.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> As the originator of the article, the intention was to use these unfolding events as an illustrative case study of the more general concept of nuclear preemption. I note that nuclear preemption does not seem to have been dealt with yet on wikipedia which is a pity since it is an important aspect of nuclear deterance which is clearly becoming more relevant due to the inevitable march of technology. I have proposed that the original article be merged into <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plans_for_strikes_against_the_Iranian_nuclear_program_c6aa.html" title="Plans for strikes against the Iranian nuclear program">Plans_for_strikes_against_the_Iranian_nuclear_program</a> which should in term be linked to from nuclear preemption as an illustrative case study. This move would deal with the article name being POV which, I agree, is inappropriate. In its current form the article does not violate <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> or <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. I strongly disagree with your opinion that "Personally, I don't think that a newspaper report that generated a few days worth of controversy but seems to have been otherwise ignored is at all notable." in that a potential aggresive nuclear first strike is clearly a major event in human history .... potentially only the third to be precise. I also find it interesting that you hold this opinion and yet have contributed such articles as <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2006_Seattle_Jewish_Federation_shooting_e26a.html" title="July 2006 Seattle Jewish Federation shooting">July_2006_Seattle_Jewish_Federation_shooting</a>, which would seemingly also be inappropriate by your standards.

<ul>
<li>The difference between this and <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2006_Seattle_Jewish_Federation_shooting_e26a.html" title="July 2006 Seattle Jewish Federation shooting">July 2006 Seattle Jewish Federation shooting</a> is that one actually happened while the other is a newspaper article. A nuclear strike is a major event in human history. A <i>plan</i> for a nuclear strike is not. A report of a plan of a nuclear strike id <i>definitely</i> not. Further, Wikipedia is not the place to "use... unfolding events as an illustrative case study" of anything. That's original research. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 02:54, 20 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are claming that wikipedia should not contain articles on potential events that have not yet happened? I suggest you read more of wikipedia which will soon disabuse you of this notion. Wikipedia has many articles that relate to circumstances that have not yet come about. One pertinent example being Iranian acquisition of nuclear weapons, which all parties currently agree has not yet happened but which many experts assert is likely to happen. Speculation on Iranian nuclear weapons has been wide spread in "newspaper articles" which, despite your implication that this renders the subject matter unworthy for inclusion into wikipedia, has resulted in a substantial article on (as yet non existent) Iranian nuclear weapons (including numerous media quotes): <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction.html" title="Iran and weapons of mass destruction">Iran_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction</a>. Leaving aside the high relevance of the article in question here to the theory of nuclear preemption, risks of nuclear bunker busters and israeli-iranian-american political relations for the moment: Even when using the criterion of relative probability of a potential event as the basis for deciding whether to include it in wikipedia, the event in question here scores highly:
<ul>
<li>Israel has stated categorically that it will not allow Iran to acquire nuclear weapons.</li>
<li>Experts assert that the Natanz facility is invulnerable to conventional attack, a view I share given my own particular professional expertise.</li>
<li>Experts assert that there is a high probability that Iran will attempt to develop nuclear weapons in the short term.</li>
<li>The history of diplomatic relations between Israel, the USA and Iran are, in my opinion, not encouraging to the prospects of a peaceful settlement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Finally, I find your preemptive blanket claim that the use of examples within (as-yet-uncreated) wikipedia articles unequivocally constitutes original research spurious and nonsensical. LochVoil 16:16, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think it is clear that the SUNDAY TIMES ARTICLE itself, the furor it has caused, and the implications of its allegations are certainly highly notable, but the article as written is only speculation based upon the Sunday Times' allegation. If the article is renamed to something along the lines of "2007 Sunday Times article on Plans for Israeli Nuclear First Strike on Natanz Facility", much of the current information on its military and technical implications and human cost could stay but it would be in addition to the context of the article itself, theories as whether the leak was sincere or saber-rattling, the international response, etc. If we are given more reason in the coming months to think that Israel is infact planning on a nuclear first strike on Iran, than I think the article could and should return to its present form. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexeiSeptimus_d337.html" title="User:AlexeiSeptimus">AlexeiSeptimus</a> 19:42, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
