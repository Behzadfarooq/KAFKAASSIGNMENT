<li>People keep asserting that such a consensus exists, but so far nobody has pointed me to any policy page that says any such thing. The fact that secondary-and-lower schools are always hotly debated in AfD suggests that there is no consensus that all high schools are notable. <b>Lack</b> of consensus to <b>delete</b> does not imply a positive consensus in the other direction. It just means... there is no consensus.

<li><b>Comment</b>:Part of the problem is that, while there isn't a consensus to speak of, there <i>is</i> precedent, because handfuls of high schools have survived AfDs with votes of "(Precedent says) all high schools are inherently notable". Indeed, some people are of the opinion that any and all high schools are <i>on their own merits</i> notable, which I find sketchy, but I'm willing to live and let live if someone's willing to take the time to write an article about it. While there isn't an official consensus, Wikipedia has been acting as if there were an "unspoken consensus" for a while now. - <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheNuevara_65d1.html" title="User:CheNuevara"><font color="darkblue">Che Nuevara:</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../c/h/e/User_talk%7ECheNuevara_5bc9.html" title="User talk:CheNuevara"><font color="red">Join</font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="darkgreen">the</font></a> <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheNuevara_navbar_e72b.html" title="User:CheNuevara/navbar"><font color="orange">Revolution</font></a></sup> 20:18, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Since I became involved in 2003, it has been frequently asserted that "high schools are always kept" and therefore there's a de facto precedent. Back in 2004, I wondered whether this was true, so I spent some time tracking high school VfDs and the actual results can be found at <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_HS_e67d.html" title="WP:VFD/HS">WP:VFD/HS</a>. It was not even close to true. I don't mind disagreement about high schools, but I do mind misrepresentations by people attempting "proof by repeated assertion" of each others' inaccurate statements of nonexistent policy, nonexistence consensus, and nonexistent precedent. I really wish these discussions would address the individual articles. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 17:55, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

To me a school should have to have notability in the form of a newsworthy event occuring there, a noted program, or something of the like. To simply say when it was formed and some "famous" alumni is not doing much. And that's not to say I don't give them a chance, I've cleaned-up a lot of articles to a few lines worth of stubs in hopes that someone more familiar with them could give them notability, but this has been around since March with few improvements made. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 15:30, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</s></p>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> Had no claim to notability. Per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information. This means that in every topical area, we need some basis for discriminating, and in specific for schools that we need some school specific reason for keeping. This article gives us no reason to believe that anything noteworthy ever happened there or that it was the beginning of any noteworthy movement larger than itself. Contact notability is suspicious as best - being the spouse of a notable person does not automatically provide notability, and that relationship is a lot more significant (and usually longer lasting) than attendance at a school - so even if the graduates were notable that would not necessarily make the school notable. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 15:57, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia is an encyclopedia but it is different from many other encyclopedia. If we maintain that a High School is not notable because it is a High School, then the same should be said of a great many articles from certain TV programmes etc. Perhaps we should just leave these articles be, as they do not cause harm, they share information which may well be relevant to educational researchers, local communities and other persons not yet known. It would certainly be interesting for me to see pages on all the High Schools in Coventry, England and know that wikipedia was such a useful repository. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidkinnen_8d64.html" title="User:Davidkinnen">Davidkinnen</a> 16:45, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article is simply a stub just like 90% of the articles on wiki and I don't see a crusade to delete 90% of the website. Just click random article a few times to prove my point. There doesn't have to be a claim to fame to keep an article. I feel that for any article three or four sentences is fine and for a high school -date founded -where it is -anything interesting -etc works. It will be years or decades before even half of the stuff on wikipedia is actually "good" but if someone walks in off the net and types in this school they'll know a few sentences about it.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> per basically all above, and because me, friends, and teachers have written a relatively long article on our high school that took a lot of work, and I don't want to see all these articles of high schools get deleted. They are valuable articles. Another reason to keep high school articles is that they act as gateways from their students to Wikipedia. When students find out that their school is on this big, free, editable encyclopedia, they edit it. Point taken, some of this is vandalism and not notable stuff, but they really are gateways that can bring in valuable contributors. There really isn't any reason to delete this. -<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappa.jake_9f3e.html" title="User:Zappa.jake">zappa.jak</a><a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappa.jake_templates_esperanza_8fd0.html" title="User:Zappa.jake/templates/esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a> (<a href="../../../z/a/p/User_talk%7EZappa.jake_141a.html" title="User talk:Zappa.jake">talk</a>) 18:48, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This is not a vote on all high school articles but on this specific one. The point is that merely being a high school is not enough notability so the article must give some depth to be worthy of an article (In the same way I couldn't write a "James Ringold" article just because I'm a human being and other human being bios exist) <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStaxringold_44f9.html" title="User:Staxringold">Staxringold</a> <sub><a href="../../../s/t/a/User_talk%7EStaxringold_cc7c.html" title="User talk:Staxringold">talk</a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left: -16px; margin-right: -16px;"><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Staxringold_5836.html" title="Special:Contributions/Staxringold">contribs</a></span></sup> 19:32, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Public high schools are finite, verifiable government entities - and are notable by nature. Any worthwile encyclopedia of public schools would have an entry mentioning Kent-Meridian High School. Furthermore, this particular high school also would be included in any complete annotated encyclopedia of gay rights as it could be of use to scholars and researchers of the development of human rights of sexual minorities. If it's not your cup of tea, may I suggest you ignore it and move on to a different article; or better yet, improve it. (Although as I write this, the article in question is better cited than the vast majority of Wikipedia articles.) One of the main goals of Wikipedia, according to <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a>, is to bring forth the "sum of human knowledge" for free, this includes articles that are trivial to some of us, but vital to others. - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavodd_2d13.html" title="User:Davodd">Davodd</a> 02:29, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> (as per Silensor), really, the basis for this deletion is whimsical. This article should not bear the brunt of the ideological qualms of a certain number of deletionists. Sure, there needs to be a standard of WP School articles. But there is necessarily a gradual process in achieving this aims, otherwise the project will be unable to thrive and develop in its evolutionary way. To delete such an article purely because it has not achieved "Good" or "Featured" article status is ridiculous. The notability of such articles has been asserted previously and held by admin precedent.

<li><b>Further Comment</b>: The page is cosiderably improved than the state it was in when it was nominated. It was only a stub before - no sentences, no pictures, no references etc. I'm glad the nomination spurred you into make something of your page but you could have accomplished the same objective without spamming and ugliness. Pages that have been nominated before, which the creator and/or others support and want to keep, have been kept on the basis of the statement of that wish and a promise of a good faith effort to improve the page, without the unsavory use of spamming and making an ugly issue out of a mere nomination. You could have done the same. I have already indicated I will never ever touch a high school page again for any reason.

I have no point of view about high schools at all -- didn't even know this was a hot-button topic, and anyone who says it was a bad faith nomination did not take the trouble to look at it's history (or even read this discussion) to learn that the article was a stub when it was nominated and since has been improved and merged with Kent School District article.

<dd>* Here, I completely object to the use of the word <i>Spam</i>. My messages were specifically directed at active members of the project that is dedicated to the improvement of school articles, which I thought was entirely apropos. Also how is asserting wikipedia policy a "personal attack"? Since you brought up stubs, the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">wikipedia policy on deletion</a> states that the stub-nature of an article is not necessarily a problem requiring deletion.
