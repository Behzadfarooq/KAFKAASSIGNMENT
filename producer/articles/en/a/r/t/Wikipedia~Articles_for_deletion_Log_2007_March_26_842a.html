<p>Singer whose claim to fame is performing at anime conventions. However, she's signed to a <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">non-notable label</a>, the article reads like a profile and not an <a href="../../../e/n/c/WP%7EENC_e8ee.html" title="WP:ENC">encyclopedia article</a>, and outside the four albums, two of which Amazon has <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/103-6080818-0098233?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=%22Kristine+Sa&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/103-6080818-0098233?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=%22Kristine+Sa&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go" rel="nofollow">not heard of</a> (one of the albums <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#CBALL" title="WP:NOT">isn't out yet</a>), the article doesn't assert any kind of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">notability</a>.

<dd>I would call the non-triviality of those sources into question, especially seeing as the first interview appears to have been conducted in an instant messaging program.

<dd>Your comment that the websites do not establish the notability of their content by their anonymity is well taken, but my feeling is that these sites are sufficiently non-trivial that their coverage of the subject of the article establishes her notability.

<dd>Well, I was referring to the interviews and not the websites themselves, though all three of the websites are non-notable (they wouldn't meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, but that's an issue for another time). I would never consider an interview conducted in an instant messenger a reliable source. The second and third interviews are better, but they still don't establish anything other than that she's a singer signed to a <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">non-notable record label</a>. --<b><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">Core</a><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECoredesat_227a.html" title="User talk:Coredesat"><font color="#006449">desat</font></a></b> 16:43, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think the source of the first interview is not instant messenger, its the website that posted the interview, with the mode of the interviewing taking place over some internet chat program. I'm not sure I agree with you on your comment re: <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, but I will whole-heartedly agree that this is not the place to discuss it. Isn't the point of this AfD discussion to determine whether she herself is notable, irregardless of her music label? My impression of the article is that it is about Kristine Sa, not about her record label. My opinion of the websites are that they are non-trivial sources of information that establish her notability. Thanks for the responses &amp; good points.

<li><b>Delete/Merge</b> Suddenly, I find myself realising why it's nominated, I did some thinking about this matter on the bus today, and worked out why it should be deleted, the site is not particularly notable, there are been little/no press coverage (even by parent company APN's publications), the company has a small market share, (but still is <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_Me_8de4.html" title="Trade Me">Trade Me</a>'s largest competitor). Not to mention, that one source is bias, and another no longer exists. The other two are from places I've never heard of.

<p>The actual importance of this café is not supported by sources, while in the latter part the article looks and feels like spam for their publishing activity. The unique contributor to the article, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Poetry62_2b90.html" title="Special:Contributions/Poetry62">Contributions/Poetry62</a> is also a contributor (often the main or unique one) to several articles about authors published by Giubbe Rosse: Menotti Lerro, qualified as "the youngest author of the Giubbe Rosse's collection" (which I am going to propose for speedy deletion after this debate), Silvano Zoi (similar to the previous one), <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vittorio_Vettori_dc1a.html" title="Vittorio Vettori">Vittorio Vettori</a> and several other ones of dubious notability. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoochelaar_237d.html" title="User:Goochelaar">Goochelaar</a> 11:06, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>My opinion</b></p>
<p>Dear friend, my idea of project was to improuve all the authours as much as possible. I love my town: Florence, I love Giubbe Rosse, and I love poets.</p>
<p>The reason because I improuved more one article than others is because Lerro has many pages on internet talking of him and also because I use to read his poetry, considering him a young and clever author and if <a href="../../../g/i/o/Giorgio_B%C3%A0rberi_Squarotti_27a2.html" title="Giorgio Bàrberi Squarotti">Giorgio Bàrberi Squarotti</a> (the main italian critic) and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Roberto_Carifi_d9d0.html" title="Roberto Carifi">Roberto Carifi</a> affirm it, I think we can trust them...</p>
<p>Well, about the notability of Giubbe Rosse... If you read the page about <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugenio_Montale_ef8b.html" title="Eugenio Montale">Eugenio Montale</a> you will find also the word <a href="../../../g/i/u/Giubbe_Rosse_1c93.html" title="Giubbe Rosse">Giubbe Rosse</a> inside, claiming the important and historical role it played in Italy and for our literature. Moreover in the actual 'collana Giubbe Rosse' is published the book of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario_Luzi_1471.html" title="Mario Luzi">Mario Luzi</a> (the most important italian writer we had in the last 50 years), and if Luzi published his last book here before to die, I think there is probably a reason...</p>
<p>My Idea was - when I had time - to improuve as much as possible - all the Giubbe Rosse's authors and some one I think could also help to improuve it, as happen for many stubs...</p>
<p>In conclusion, I just want invite you, before to affirm about the "dubious notability of <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vittorio_Vettori_dc1a.html" title="Vittorio Vettori">Vittorio Vettori</a>", to do some more search about this author because his notability is impossible to hide.</p>
<p>The same we can still say about <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manlio_Sgalambro_0a60.html" title="Manlio Sgalambro">Manlio Sgalambro</a> and others.</p>

<p>Conflict of interest and questionable notability. The creator and major editor of this article (apart from a couple of IP editors) is <a href="../../../e/d/g/User%7EEdgarszilde_4d2d.html" title="User:Edgarszilde">Edgarszilde</a> who is a member of the band. Band doesn't have an website, only a MySpace (99 friends, 1191 profile views), their MySpace lists this article as their website. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Satellites+LV%22+&amp;hl=en&amp;start=180&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Satellites+LV%22+&amp;hl=en&amp;start=180&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">Google</a> gets 161 hits, a lot of which relate to the other members' projects or are to buy/download their music. Only claims of notability are radio airplay and music video screenings in Latvia; winning the <i>Grand Prix of the biggest rock music festival in the Baltic States "Liepajas Dzintars"</i> (whatever that means); <s>and winning <i>two prestigious Latvian Music Awards in 2003 (Best instrumental album of the Year and the best debut award)</i></s> <sup>misread, award was for side project album</sup>. But still... it's so conflict of interest! If this article goes, can someone delete the album articles and all the images too. <a href="../../../k/o/l/User%7EKollision_3672.html" title="User:Kollision">kollision</a> 10:15, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Answer: First of all, it seems that the conflict of interest is based on the lack of knowledge on music scene in the Baltic States. It is important for me to educate the reader that the population of Latvia is less then 4 million. Only 60% of whom are Latvian origin. This concludes that bands popularity and importance in this country can not be based on millions of webpage hits. This alternative band self releases its recordings, therefore does not depend on any music companies and is respected only by smaller group of people. Of course "whatever that means" music festival, as you call it, in readers home town, assuming it is Texas or even NY, is without any significance, but lets not forget that www is created for everyone in the world and not just for Canada or the US. This band is significant in its region and culture, therefore it is also important that anybody in the world can access this information. Thank you. Is Wikipedia MTV, FOX and Hollywood representative, or informative and educational internet portal? What is critical here? To write about popular but ordinary pop stars who have their own webpages (payed by companies) and millions of google hits, or educate people about more significant and sapid cultural activities of the world?</p>

Nothing against your band, but this is Wikipedia, therefore the band must be notable (see <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Wikipedia:Notability (music)</a>) and this article should not be used for self-promotion or advertising (see <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_interest_727a.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest">Wikipedia:Conflict of interest</a>), plus you could do with some <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a>.

<p>Notability:</p>
<p>As I read through the notability list, Satellites LV has had several charted hits, shows abroad, full albums, singles, newspaper and other printed media articles and interviews. I must add that Satellites LV includes in itself many musical projects who have released records in Russia and Japan. Satellites LV is more considred a group of active (10 years) and mutually conected musicians rather than just an ordinary band. It has won awards and has received positive reviews from critics. Satellites LV is notable in its region. Most of the information online is in Latvian, therefore unavailable to you. About self promotion: This article does not advertise any websites or new albums, singles, posters, t-shirts, or any other merchandise. It has been added clearly only for information purposes.</p>

With an AfD a week old, running with a clear consensus to Keep, the odds the article will be deleted are now enormously slender.

<li><b>Comment:</b>: well I already did my&#160;:*<b>STRONG KEEP:</b> However as the author it appears that the general vibe is to have this article deleted. No hard feelings here, I understand why it would be questionable. I personally feel as if it is notable enough to be kept. This is based on his reputation, many endorsers and list of artists he has recorded or performed with. However I fully understand how those who arnt familiar would vote for Delete based on the quality of the article that I made.

<li><b>Commment</b> - I know the subject of the article personally so my opinion shouldn't count as a vote, but I think that the rationales for deletion given here don't quite measure up. The Libertarian Party is a major political party (3rd after the blue and red teams, not the satanists) and there does seem to be a consensus on Wikipedia for including candidates, so to delete them simply for losing doesn't seem very logical to me given that notability doesn't come and go. Unless I am very much mistaken this was not created by the candidate himself and even if it was that is not an argument based on the merits of the article, given that all the info is cited. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">Savidan</a> 15:48, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Few people would consider the Libertarians a "major" anything, and they certainly don't get the third most votes in the land; I'd say the Greens have that locked in now. There are specific criteria for politicians in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, which this subject does not meet. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 16:08, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>reply</b> at issue here is not whether or not the Libertarian Party is an important political party. At issue is whether or not there is enough reliable source material about which an encyclopedia articla can be written, in-so-far as that source material is written itself by people unrelated to the subject, and in-so-far as the amount of material contained therin is enough to make anything more than a stub of an article.

<dd><b>comment</b> In the US, neither the Libertarians or the Greens have counted as major. Anyone from one of them who wins a seat will of course be notable, and in my opinion anyone who loses but does about as well as the other two.

<p>I was going to mark this as a speedy, but then I reconsidered and instead added a {{notability}} tag. The author removed the tag and rewrote the article so that it reads more like an advertisement, and left a note on the talk page telling people not to "vandalize" the article. While this could be real, it looks suspicious. <a href="../../../j/u/j/User%7EJuJube_a9d8.html" title="User:JuJube">JuJube</a> 01:38, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Let me start by saying this is not an advertisement i just like the idea of secret shows and i think it should have a wiki. Secondly as some of this may be subjective, which can be changed, it is all from the MySpace Secret Shows page. Lastly why would u delete a perfectly good article just because it needs some touching up. After all the more articles the better and i assure you all of this has sources even the qoute: "it is notable for bringing great bands to small towns" is from the official page. P.S. myspace secret shows IS real. o ya and sry for deleting the notice i was just mad u (or someone else deleted the page b4 it was even finished. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartini833_929d.html" title="User:Martini833">Martini833</a> 02:01, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well it's definately notable for more reasons. It has <b>famous</b> bands. Over 38 shows and has been running smoothly for more than a year. It is definately as notable as any event in the music scene and saying that it's not because they are "secret" is just like saying things that haven't come out yet and are not announced shouldnt be on wikipedia.. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartini833_929d.html" title="User:Martini833">Martini833</a> 02:08, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>OK if you can give me three logical reason why this is NOT notable instead of trying to counter everything I say then I will admit it is not notable and you can take over. And by the way if i dont think it's logical than sorry no way is this article being deleted without a "notable" (hahaha used ur word) reason. Anyway i worked so hard on it and it is my first full fledged aricle so could u find out the facts (or just read the article cus the facts are all there) youll see that this is no advertisement and it is all *(dare i say) notably correct. BTW this was really hard to do with the wikipedia code i wasnt familiar with so...... STOP ruining a perfectly good article.

<dd><b>Comment</b>I realize it can be a bit difficult to get used to Wikipedia guidelines and I'm sorry if you feel as if people are giving you a hard time. However, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> provides some really good information about how to determine whether things are notable and it says <i>"A topic is generally notable if it has been the subject of coverage that is independent of the subject, reliable, and attributable."</i> Can you find any sources, other than those affiliated with myspace.com, that identify this group of shows as notable? Nobody doubts that this is a real group of shows. However, the standard for Wikipedia is not truth, but attribution and notability. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanejellyroll_84c0.html" title="User:Janejellyroll">janejellyroll</a> 02:22, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How about this. From Wikipedia w/e "WHY DON'T YOU" you're the one that cares... and i think you know this by now MySpace Secret Shows is real and the article is fine. You just don't have anything else to do but delete things because it probably makes you feel good. How about u delete your ****ing profile and leave a good article (in this case myspace secret shows) alone. GAH you got me to tht level were im p***ed off. Thnk you</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Leebo is actually trying to help you by letting you know what you can do (add sources) in the next five days to reduce the chances of this article being deleted. I know that it can feel a bit overwhelming to be in the middle of this right after creating your first article, but try to keep a cool head. As for the other article you mentioned . . . the fact that other articles with similiar faults exists doesn't give any article a free pass. We judge each article individually. You have the next five days to improve the article. I've seen situations before where people have changed their opinions on an article after amendments were made to it. If you feel this strongly, why not channel your energy into improvements rather than tussling with other editors here? <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanejellyroll_84c0.html" title="User:Janejellyroll">janejellyroll</a> 03:13, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I read the article. First off, your argument that it's not "secret" when "secret" is in the title isn't convincing. It also doesn't matter, there's plenty of articles on <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freemasonry.html" title="Freemasonry">secret things that aren't really secret</a>. The issue is, there's no independent press whatsoever on this. Supposed I put these words on my page, I found out about a show, and came back with "Oh, okay, these are real, keep them". That still wouldn't be enough, since to pass <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>, you need independent, third-party sources. A newspaper article, a web post from a reliable site, a peer-reviewed journal, what have you. Something beyond a forum anyone can post to. The issue here is not whether it's true or not. The issue is whether it can be verified independently. As the article stands, it can't. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsaSatsui_7afe.html" title="User:UsaSatsui">UsaSatsui</a> 21:49, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>After minor rephrasing for this page not to look like an ad this page should be updated by taking off the deletion notice because I have found an article that confirms its notability: "MySpace.com announced today it will commemorate the first birthday of the community's <b>most popular franchise, Secret Shows</b> presented by Chili's, by launching an alliance with Best Buy. Under the deal, <b>MySpace Secret Show artists will receive promotion in more than 550 Best Buy stores nationwide</b>." -ClearStation.

<li>Martin, I used to write press releases, and trust me, this is one. (a) It is posted to a discussion board, it is not a news article by an independent news agency. (b) there is no by-line or author other than "business wire" which is a <a href="../../../w/i/r/Wire_service.html" title="Wire service">wire service</a> (as is Comtex who's logo appears in the corner. (c) it has the <a href="../../../b/o/i/Boiler_plate.html" title="Boiler plate">boiler plate</a> "About MySpace" section at the end, common to all press releases. (d) it has contact information at the end for people at MySpace.

<li><b>Comment</b>Could somebody please point me to where this is "well documented" stuff, particularly in "in medical journals and in more mainstream media outlets" is, because an exhaustive search honestly failed to yield anything of the kind see <a href="../../../c/a/s/Talk%7ECassandra_phenomenon_4243.html" title="Talk:Cassandra phenomenon">Talk:Cassandra phenomenon</a>. Just one woman with a Bsc in psych creating a "Cassandra affective disorder" she is honestly not qualified to create, for which the only verifications anyone can find come from her own homepage which is certainly not "peer reviewed" in any sense and, as such is original research. (The only references to "Cassandra syndrome" we could find anywhere are actually misnomers related to this issue that often defined it quite differently!) There is a single reference made by Tony Attwood MD to "Cassandra phenomenon" which defines it totally differently to Maxine Aston's "Cassandra affective disorder". The only other references come from Judy Singer who runs a yahoo group and self publishes papers on the strength of her BA see <a href="../../../a/s/p/Talk%7EAsperger_syndrome_c0a4.html" title="Talk:Asperger syndrome">Talk:Asperger syndrome</a> and a* lawyer called Sheila Jennings Linehan who surely isn't a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> for psychology at all, even if she didn't somewhat misrepresent all the other sources. I just do not see how such a muddle of "conditions" that contradict and misquote each other, created by people who are not qualified to create "conditions" in the first place, based on entirely anecdotal evidence, with no formal research, could be considered notable? --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 08:03, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I can't point you to any medical journals offhand, but I can say that the term "Cassandra Syndrome" was mentioned prominently in the film <a href="../../../1/2/_/12_Monkeys_439e.html" title="12 Monkeys">12 Monkeys</a>. However, the term I remember has the more general definition of (paraphrasing) "knowing the truth but being unable to convince anyone of it." In the film it was applied to people who predicted terrible disasters, whose warnings were ignored. At the very least, the term "Cassandra Syndrome" and the related "Cassandra phenomenon" are real terms, though the current article does not accurately reflect the meaning. -- <a href="../../../i/k/n/WP%7EIKNOWBEST_f5b0.html" title="WP:IKNOWBEST"><font color="black">Y<b>|</b></font></a><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">yukichigai</a> (<sub><a href="../../../y/u/k/User_talk%7EYukichigai_f252.html" title="User talk:Yukichigai"><font color="blue"><b>ramble</b></font></a></sub> <small><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_Viewpoints_and_Arguments_65e4.html" title="User:Yukichigai/Viewpoints and Arguments"><font color="red"><b>argue</b></font></a></small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yukichigai_f895.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yukichigai"><font color="green"><b>check</b></font></a></sup>) 08:59, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and Rewrite</b> - I can't dig up any medical journals that contain the term, but I'm fairly certain that the current article incorrectly defines the meaning of the term. "Cassandra Syndrome" was featured prominently in <a href="../../../1/2/_/12_Monkeys_439e.html" title="12 Monkeys">12 Monkeys</a> (see my above comment) and the term can also be found in a number of texts on mythology, philosophy, and psychology.

<li><b>Comment</b>The use of the term in one work of fiction really is not enough to make it notable. But if you know of other sources, failing web citations, just tell us what the textbooks you know of are, which can easily be checked and is far more persuasive than citing nothing at all, as at present. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 09:54, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The term appears in some fictions, but that does not make it notable. Unless medical citations, or more than the one book, can be found, this cannot be notable. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECallix_8aef.html" title="User:Callix">Callix</a></li>
<li><b>Delete</b> We did some rather exhaustive research on this term with regards to Asperger's, and made direct contact the sources to whom the term is referenced.

<dd>The term cassandra is likely to find disfavor with professionals as it has a) sexist overtones (cassandra is a woman who prophesizes doom), b) is commonly used sarcastically (nobody has the gift of prophesy) and c) the common greek translation is "helper of men" tho a minority of scholars claim it translates to "one who ensnares men."<a href="../../../c/e/i/User%7ECeilingCrash_9a07.html" title="User:CeilingCrash">CeilingCrash</a> 13:35, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep and rewrite</b> per Yukichigai. Perhaps move to <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cassandra_syndrome.html" title="Cassandra syndrome">Cassandra syndrome</a> as well. The terms "Cassandra syndrome" and "Cassandra phenomenon" are commonly used with the meaning Yukichigai describes. The current content of the article, trimmed down, could serve as one example or application of the term. This snippet I found through Google Books hints at the kind of sources that are out there: "Sontag identifies the Cassandra phenomenon as a frequent convention of the disaster genre and one of the standard hallmarks of the heroes in sci-fi disaster films of the 1950s and 1960s - 'the hero tries to warn the local authorities without effect; nobody believes anything is amiss' (1966:211)." Michael Carden, in <i>Sodomy: The History of a Christian Biblical Myth</i>, from Equinox Publishing (2004). See also R.J. Johnston's <i>Dictionary of Human Geography</i>: "If the author is seeking changes to avoid a dystopian scenario, the work may produce the ‘Cassandra effect' or the ‘self-refuting prophecy'" (Blackwell Publishing, 2000). <a href="../../../p/u/b/User%7EPubliusFL_ece6.html" title="User:PubliusFL">PubliusFL</a> 20:08, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is what categories are for? A list serves equally well, so ... I don't see how that's an argument to delete. No reason has been presented as to why this list is inherently inferior in its ability to manage the relevant information than the category. In fact, this list provides additional information that is not present in the article. Also, I oppose merging this list into <a href="../../../l/a/s/Las_Vegas_bf20.html" title="Las Vegas">Las Vegas</a>, as it would unnecessary clutter the latter article. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 04:00, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>No, neither of us wants to add this article to shotokan. What you are probably thinking of is that he wants to add it to the major styles of karate template, one example of which is in shotokan. Based on the fact that I have no heard of this style in 14 years of training, and that google has less than 30,000 entries for it, I think it is certainly not a major style. That has nothing to do with the article itself though.<a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogueNinja_9f31.html" title="User:RogueNinja">RogueNinja</a> 17:17, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

I'm not sure how regular martial artists measure notability among the "many offshoot martial arts," but in the Ghits I see sites from Serbia, Bulgaria, Hungary, Rumania, Italy, France, Germany, Switzerland, Poland, the US, Russia, and more, which is enough to convince me that the topic meets my notability standards. However, I don't see anything from independent, third-party sources about Fudokan. --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice"><span style="color:indigo; border:thin solid cyan; background:aliceblue">Groggy Dice</span></a> <span style="border:thin solid gold;"><a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGroggy_Dice_aa9f.html" title="User talk:Groggy Dice">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Groggy_Dice_610a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Groggy Dice">C</a></span> 04:20, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep.</b> MedHelp is notable and should stay on Wikipedia for 3 reasons. 1. It was founded in 1994 and is one of the first Healthcare community sites on the Internet. It precedes by several years, sites such as WebMD, Revolution Health and HealthBoards, all of which have articles on Wikipedia. 2. According to media measurement services such as HitWise and CommScore it is among the Top 10 largest healthcare online healthcare communities on the Internet, with 2.5 million users per month. 3. Several MedHelp articles have been referenced by wikipedia authors in their articles on topics such as Dyshidrosis, Proteinuria etc. Fdesouza 05:55, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Based on the feedback, I have added sources -- one article from Time Magazine, 3 articles from the Wall Street Journal and an interview on the US Department of State Global Issues Magazine, all highlighting the work that MedHelp.org does.

<li>In addition to the sources above, 22 medical-related articles on Wikipedia (eg Dyshidrosis, Milton Diamond, Proteinuria, Addison's disease, Swyer syndrome, Nicotine gum, Vaginoplasty, Diabetes mellitus type 1, Adverse effect (medicine), Androgen insensitivity syndrome, HLA-DQ8, Herpes simplex, HLA DR3-DQ2) cite articles from MedHelp as sources.

<li><b>Keep</b> -- ob-note: it was rewritten (by me). The article is clear as to why it is a notable episode: as an attempt by ABC to bring non-regular viewers of the serialized drama up to speed, presenting for the first time a linear re-telling of the <i>Lost</i> storyline. Further, it is particularly exceptional for a clip series, as it handily won its timeslot-- up against the original programming of every other network. Finally, it is extensively referenced beyond what is included for even "regular" <i>Lost</i> episodes. --<font size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 06:49, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The 3rd example you have there isn't even accurate. <a href="../../../e/p/i/WP%7EEPISODE_008d.html" title="WP:EPISODE">WP:EPISODE</a> says nothing about clip shows and is a page that specifically discourages episode articles. People often misunderstand the first part of that page, "<i>Wikipedia contains a large number of articles on television episodes. There is some disagreement as to whether every episode of every show "deserves" an article, which leads to a large number of AFDs for such articles. The following suggestions aim to promote the creation of high-quality articles about television shows and their episodes, which should help to reduce acrimonious AfD debates.</i>" This means that the page hopes to reduce the number of AfDs via merges and preventing episode articles, which is different from not taking existing pages to AfDs. The first example calls it a notable episode, without even explaining why. I don't doubt that you will find people who want to keep something like this, but that means nothing if there is no reasonable logic behind it. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 01:04, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>How about we <b>merge it with <a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_%28season_1%29.html" title="Lost (season 1)">Lost (season 1)</a></b>.

<li><b>Oh noes</b>. While the article in its current form is much different from the version that went to AfD before it would behoove editors to review that previous AfD before adding to this one.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Therianthopy might deserve an entry in the dictionary but not here. The term is a real term but is not used by the academic community. What this article is refering to is <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthropomorphism.html" title="Anthropomorphism">anthropomorphism</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shape_shifting.html" title="Shape shifting">shape shifting</a>. The term terianthropy is being plugged these days by a group of folks on the internet that think they <i>are</i> animals are <i>part</i> animal or can transform <i>into</i> an animal, etc. The standard Usenet werewolf type crowd. So while the term is correct the problem is that sources being taken and then twisted in order to apply to the term "therianthropy". It's like reverse research (creation science?). You'll find that almost none of the sources cited use the term, it's an <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">origianl research</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologism</a> that's pretty much <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 13:16, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. At first blush it looks like the article is fairly well-written and referenced, but as argued above, the references are about the related topics of lycanthropy and the like - they do not deal with the subject of therianthropy. That leaves us with a pretty clear-cut case of <a href="../../../s/y/n/WP%7ESYN_b7b5.html" title="WP:SYN">WP:SYN</a>.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> - article as stands is worthless, purge and allow recreation once someone is willing to find some references and assert notability... the notability of furry stuff is consistently overestimated on WP IMO. I had a user subpage about that once, but I forgot where it was&#160;:( Anyway, most of the top google links are promotional or WP mirrors. WP is based on other work, right? Well, if there's not much encyclopedic information said about a subject, there's not much WP can really say. <a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMiltopia_1488.html" title="User:Miltopia">Milto LOL pia</a> 19:52, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: This isn't so much&#160;!"furry", as simply using animal-morphic characters to avoid treading on copyright toes. The original concept is a pastche of "Cutey Honey", the comic itself successfully deconstructs the Anglo-US/Soviet/Nu-Nazi trichotomy which has polarised world politics since 1933, and it's <i>notable</i> in the sense that people inside and outside the field know of it. Were this a vote (which I know it isn't) I would be inclined to the <b>keep</b> side of the "argument", but as it isn't .... -- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a> 13:59, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

But it's still a lot better than most of the totally unreferenced, not-at-all-notable bios to which I've been saying "Delete" on each day's AfD list.

<li><b>Comment</b>: This came up last year with regard to one of the other Naruto plot articles -- see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Plot_of_Naruto_I_9202.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Plot of Naruto I">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Plot_of_Naruto_I</a>. Personally, I'm conflicted. (1) We don't normally delete articles that could be cleaned up; (2) I'm torn about just how much plot summary is appropriate for serial works. According to the notes, this article currently covers approximately one hundred serial chapters of the work -- how much plot summary is appropriate for 100 issues of the manga? (3) Ultimately, if the article had more out-of-universe info, I would probably be ok with about this level of plot summary, maybe a little less. Given that it doesn't, I'm torn about whether to delete the article to encourage editors to do a better job next time or to leave it in the hope that the editors eventually clean it up. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 14:03, 26 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>TheronJ, I know you have worked on WikiProject Comics articles before, so I ask you to think about how many of those articles are merely plot summaries that cover 100 issues of a series in such detail. <a href="../../../5/2/_/52_%28comic_book%29.html" title="52 (comic book)">52 (comic book)</a> will cover 52 issues when it is finished, but the summary is maintained s at about ten paragraphs, and it has a lot of external sources that discuss the real-world details surrounding the series. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> (<big><a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChrisGriswold_df5d.html" title="User talk:ChrisGriswold"><span style="color:red">☎</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ChrisGriswold_d1f8.html" title="Special:Contributions/ChrisGriswold"><span style="color:black">☓</span></a></big>) 14:30, 26 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree, Chris. There's no question, IMHO, that the comics project has led the way on this problem, and articles like <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultimate_Spider-Man_%28story_arcs%29_a5ec.html" title="Ultimate Spider-Man (story arcs)">Ultimate Spider-Man (story arcs)</a> and <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultimate_X-Men_%28story_arcs%29_f143.html" title="Ultimate X-Men (story arcs)">Ultimate X-Men (story arcs)</a> are much, much better that the Naruto plot articles - both because they make a concerted effort to include helpful, non-plot information and a concerted effort to keep the plot information limited. I'm mostly torn about whether deletion is appropriate for an article like this, which I agree (1) needs clean-up badly; (2) probably won't be cleaned up for years if ever; and (3) is very likely to constitute a copyright violation because of the depth of plot summary relative to non-plot information. I'll think about it and see if I can come off the fence. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 14:49, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - This is in no way a "grotesque violation of the subject's copyright" or a "clear violation of Wikipedia policies and fair use criteria." It fits perfectly with "a plot summary may be appropriate as an aspect of a larger topic." It takes a bit of plot summary to describe 400 magazines and 250 television episodes. It has to be broken down a bit, and that's what this is, see <a href="../../../s/s/_/WP%7ESS_0b59.html" title="WP:SS">WP:SS</a>. If you just glance at the page it looks like it's only covering a few episodes, but it's actually covering over 100 issues of the manga.

<li><b>Keep</b>, as it is an aspect of the larger subject of <i>Naruto</i> as a whole and thus not subject to exclusion by WP:NOT#IINFO 7 alone. Plot summary was deemed important to the subject, and forked from the main article, then from the Part I article in a natural Wiki process to keep pages readable and concise. That said, it could certainly use some improvement. It shouldn't be written from such a percise perspective, but rather a general one, focusing on what's important. More importantly, it needs to be well referenced to the source material so people researching the subject can trace their path back to the particular episode or chapter they're interested in. –<i><a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunslinger47_cf62.html" title="User:Gunslinger47">Gunslinger47</a></i> 03:10, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

You can give me some line about how single episode summaries have some greater importance than an article with multiple episode summaries crammed together, but the only real difference is that one has cultural references/trivia, and the other doesn't.

<li><b>Keep</b>- I'm not sure, and this may be my bad memory kicking in, but I also believe this was discussed before and a Keep consensus was made. Also, this is a useful source for people who truly would like to find the information, as with anything else on Wikipedia. As such, why delete something that a good number of people find useful? There's no point, in my opinion. Steelesaber 20:06, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - I agree that this article needs trimming down once more (I may do it myself when I find the time), but I see no reason that this article should be removed considering the many, many other plot synopsises for TV series/movies/books/etc. that exist on Wikipedia, nor do I see any copyright violations. It is not step by step as it omits many details, but it does act as a guide on how the story has progressed.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is a plot summary written by watching the series and deriving conclusions from it, and it doesn't attribute any of the claims.

<li><b>Comment</b> So what, are you just all for deleting the article because you don't watch Naruto? I've said it once, and I'll say it again: it is serving it's purpose as an encyclopedic article by providing information. In fact, the article is even titled "Plot of Naruto: Shippuden". Not "Summary of Plot of Naruto: Shippuden." The only "reason" I see for it's deletion is that some people are against Naruto, and just want to mess with Naruto's fans. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.215.11.249_8ee4.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.215.11.249">72.215.11.249</a> (<a href="../../../7/2/2E/User_talk%7E72.215.11.249.html" title="User talk:72.215.11.249">talk</a>) 05:28, 28 March 2007 (UTC).</small>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Naruto is a long series, thus wouldn't it make sense, for the sake of a complete summary, that the summary itself would be long as well? Splitting it according to the arcs is one thing, but this article definetly shouldn't be deleted (somebody already tried, unsuccesfully). Viewtiful Rekk 12:28, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The page is obviously long and detailed enough to provide an alternative to reading/viewing the source material, and thus constitutes copyright violation. The Hidan and Kakazu section is particularly egregious in this. It's also a completely pointless page, as if it were shortened to a decent level (as has been done with longer series) then it would fit in a main Naruto: Shippūden article. That's the sort of article we need, not something that goes against numerous Wikipedia policies like this one. Stylish Alastor the Stylish 19:02, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and reduce</b>. While it's true that articles should not just be plot summaries, the existence of one adds to the meaning of the subject matter. Therefore, this article should not be thought of it's own article but part of the Naruto article. In response to claims that the article is too long, I fully agree, though, with the second-to-most-recent arc concluded, it is now possible to clean up that area, which is by far the largest.--<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrenchman113_bb46.html" title="User:Frenchman113">Frenchman113</a> <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFrenchman113_63b9.html" title="User talk:Frenchman113">on wheels!</a> 19:06, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>There IS too much content in this article, if there is only 300 espisodes now, what will this page look like when there is 400 or 500? Obviously, the article needs a trim, but there seems to be no one who is willing to do it, probably because of its size. Why don't we create a particular board of users who trim the article monthly? I think that splitting the article will create too much of a fuss, some arcs are just not long enough, its not worth an entire page. <a href="../../../z/a/c/User%7EZachary_crimsonwolf_a512.html" title="User:Zachary crimsonwolf"><font color="black" face="comic sans ms"><b>Zachary</b></font></a><a href="../../../z/a/c/User_talk%7EZachary_crimsonwolf_b0a6.html" title="User talk:Zachary crimsonwolf"><font color="crimson" face="comic sans ms"><b>crimsonwol</b></font></a><a href="../../../z/a/c/User%7EZachary_crimsonwolf_Esperanza_d658.html" title="User:Zachary crimsonwolf/Esperanza"><font color="green" face="comic sans ms"><b>f</b></font></a> 13:14, 14 November 2006 (UTC) 13:41, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - People are complaining about the level of detail, but let's compare it to some other page on wikipedia. First, there's about 2 issues of the manga for every 1 episode. This page is covering 100 issues of the manga, so that's about 50 episodes. This page has about 11,000 words, so that's 220 words per episode. Now a Featured Article episode from House, <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilot_%28House%29_19e7.html" title="Pilot (House)">Pilot (House)</a>, has about 600 words in its plot summary. Those episodes are twice as long, so it has about 300 words per 22 minutes, which is 136% more than this page. That's a Featured Article, so people who know what they're doing have cut that synopsis down the best it can be done. If you compare it to some <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Stargate_SG-1_episodes_00dc.html" title="List of Stargate SG-1 episodes">Stargate</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Heroes_episodes_cc09.html" title="List of Heroes episodes">Heroes</a> episodes, it's even smaller per minute. The more I think about it, this isn't even too detailed, it's just that being on all on one page makes people think it should be deleted. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrine_Fisher_e4db.html" title="User:Peregrine Fisher">Peregrine Fisher</a> 18:23, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>It's less detailed than the House episode featured article. I'd like to see a consensus on how long plot summaries should be. Until then, using featured articles seems like a good way to judge. Personally, when I write anime episode summaries, I make them about 150 words. See <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_of_Desire_6ca8.html" title="Star of Desire">Star of Desire</a> for an example. I think 220 words is pretty good considering the 16000 page views this aticle gets every day. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrine_Fisher_e4db.html" title="User:Peregrine Fisher">Peregrine Fisher</a> 21:03, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep/Spilt</b> i think this article may be two long and much controversy because of its usefulness to many users but i think recoomending it for deletion is a rash descision... A wikiproject may be in order to help fix this article. Spilting in to seprate parts can help as well. On another hand i think a good idea would be to trim the Sections to less detail after the episode pertaining to that section is released which can greatly shorten the article over time. Reccomding this for deletion isnt something to take lightly because its two long copyright violation doesnt seem like a pertaining issue as it just records without posting content. if you posted the manga here i assume it would be a different story Matthew2c4u 20:51, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>comment</b> I believe that people who doesn't enjoy this anime or just hate it for some reason should not have a say on this, as it may only be to get this summary deleted, I also think that if it's too large of a summary then we could devide it into arcs. deviding this aummary into arcs might take a lot of work but I know it's possible and even if i'm not good at this i would gladly help devide it.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Okay, enough with the hate accusations. I enjoy the series, but this article seriously needs to go (or at the very least, get split). Put things into perspective. It's not that I don't like the series; quite the contrary. This is the only anime I watch on a regular basis nowadays. However, this is not a Naruto fansite: This is an encyclopedia, and thus its articles have to be of encyclopedic value and must fit a certain standard. Per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, articles that are strictly plot summaries are in fact not encyclopedic, and the article on its own is not near Wikipedia's quality standards in terms of its tone and excessive details. This could be fixed, but not without breaking the article into smaller parts. So, I maintain the split decision that I had above, but I am not opposed to an outright deletion. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYou_Can%27t_See_Me%21_320d.html" title="User:You Can't See Me!"><i><span style="color: #C0C090">You Can't See Me!</span></i></a> 03:17, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep, but clean up</b>. This article is a great source of information for those who don't have the actual manga handy, but want to research it. However, the degree to which it covers the plot is a bit excessive, and I feel that it should be reduced to a basic summary of the plot's outline, leaving only the more important events of the series, rather than an in-depth explanation of every little thing that happens. Is it absolutely necessary to know that Konohamaru started fooling around with the Shadow Clone Jutsu after he learned it? No, not really. It does reveal more about the characters, but that's why many characters have their own articles. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazedNinja_4d7e.html" title="User:CrazedNinja">CrazedNinja</a> 05:42, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b>. Though I do admit, this file is massive and would definitely hinder those with slower browsers and computers. However, I see no reason to remove it completely. If it does get too much, how about separating the article into the plot synopsis section of each character, like the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_in_Bleach_8f0f.html" title="Characters in Bleach">Bleach</a> page, or, for example, <a href="../../../i/c/h/Ichigo_Kurosaki_d008.html" title="Ichigo Kurosaki">this</a> page. That way, we can all see plot details attributed to each main character and keep the file size reasonable at the same time. Stuntman15 17:09, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I agree. Kind of Like what the Other person had said. Trim it into other articles. But based on arc, Unless the arc is short, in which case group those ones with the longer ones. Look, plain and simple: I haven't gotten the subbed comic yet, I can't find it either, I like this to be used as a source until the chapter it describes Releases. That way, I know what is going on. Besides, Seriously, Like was also stated quite simply put: If you look at the length of everything that has happened in both the manga and anime of it, you'll see that this plot is actually VERY SHORTENED from what it could be. It needs to be trimmed into smaller arcticles. I tried to do so a few minutes ago, but Wikipedia wouldn't let me.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Distinctly one of the most notable surgeons in his field as the previous AfD clearly noted. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Agne27_bd48.html" title="Special:Contributions/Agne27"><sup>Cheese</sup></a>/<a href="../../../a/g/n/User_talk%7EAgne27_a02f.html" title="User talk:Agne27"><sup>Wine</sup></a> 18:55, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I notice he had cited only 1 articles and managed not to give any current academic affiliation. Checked PubMed, and he has published a total of 7 articles total over the last 8 years in specialty journals. On what basis do we say he his a leader in his field? Because he says so?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Look at the sources. One book from a major publisher refers to him on a single page, and another book from a minor publisher does the same. His CV lists also 7 abstracts, and 9 other presentations, including a poster session. The pictures of from either his own site, or a commercial site run by an MD in the area of his former practice,". There are societies and awards for surgeons, and there is no evidence he has ever won any of them. Rather, there is good evidence he didn't,because if he had , this article would surely say so. Neither does his website. He is a member of the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons which is good, but then only 3 local societies. I checked two other plastic surgeons at random: 17 societies for one, 19 for the other, both including the main one, "Fellow, American College of Surgeons." A FACS is a distinguished surgeon. But he is not one of that group. Nor is he a member of the American College of Surgeons, a more inclusive group of notable surgeons. He is not associated with any major Arizona teaching hospital, or a clinical faculty member of an Arizona medical school.</dd>
<dd>What i do learn from the website is that this article does not quite honestly give his credentials. It lists him as clinical professor of plastic surgery at OHSU, while he was actually an assistant professor. The article lists him as a fellow, but this is not in his CV (A fellow is a sub-specialist in advanced training after the completion of full residence training in the speciality. It would have been an appropriate step, if there was any evidence he had done it.)</dd>
<dd>As for the ghits, there's about one genuine one per 30--an announcement of a lecture. . Many blogs and testimonials, personally published sources, but this would be expected for this subspecialty.--I looked at the first 50 one at a time: One of them says "Unfortunately, Toby Meltzer has since relocated to Scottsdale, Arizona, having been unable to find a hospital in Portland that fit his requirements and would extend him operating room privileges" &amp; blames it on his willingness to do FTM surgeries. I also see "Toby Meltzer considered the standards of care to be mere guidelines. " explained by gratitude that he apparently operates on patients without the standard waiting period. (neither of this should be added to the article, for they are blog postings or the equivalent. I did not come across the many posted complaints that accompany some other surgeons. )</dd>
<dd>Looking at additional patient support web sites, he does seem to be notable in that special group, and that did cause me to switch from weak delete to keep--just as a scientist can be notable popularly though not professionally, so can a physician. I think I finally got the right impression. He seems to be a charismatic maverick--possibly he does not choose to pursue the usual professional activities, rather than being unqualified.</dd>
<dd>But I do say keep -- and then all the unsupported information will be removed. The number of his surgeries is unsupported; that he developed the operations is unsupported; and the description of the techniques belong in a more general article unless he can be shown to have developed them. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 04:28, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>event was one of many thousands of annual gatherings of lots of Christians around the world. Current sources are the website of the event itself, and a tiny mention in the local press. Note that there was no national press coverage, and the local coverage was minmal.

<dd><b>Weak Delete</b>, I agree in just about all points per nomination, but if it could be proven to me that "Love Oxford was a history-making Christian event" is correct, I'd change to a weak keep.

<dd>It was certainly historical for Oxford, involving reuse of a very old, discarded law, and bringing out more people onto the streets than in any other public gathering in the city for the last several centuries. I realise Wikipepdia is not a catalogue of reality and all its minor happenstances, but of significant, noteworthy points of fact and history, ones likely to be searched for by users. I think this qualifies for that. Easily. 86.130.247.16 02:45, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I doubt that it brought more people out onto the streets than at any time for a few centuries.

<p>Although undoubtedly notable among the university's students, I don't feel this guitarist is notable enough for an entry. Yes, has been playing for 28 years, but only live and in a small area.

<p><b>Undelete</b>.At what point does one reach "Wikipedia status"? Is it a quantitative "they are known by x number of people" or is it something more complex? While I understand the spirit behind the deletion of pages, I feel that given the vastness of wikipedia it cannot be compared to a simple encyclopedia. I'm sure it is a great feat to have your name written up in Brittanica, for example, but should it be as difficult to be written up in wikipedia? These are not simply rhetorical questions, as I really would like to know peoples thoughts about this. I haven't been editing for that long so I'm still trying to figure things out. <a href="../../../j/e/_/User%7EJe_at_uwo_2966.html" title="User:Je at uwo">Je at uwo</a> 20:21, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Rick McGhie has attained a cult status at one of the largest universities in Canada. There is not one student who has walked the campus who doesn't know of his musical stylings.

<dd>The thing is, Wikipedia is trying to be a fairly reliable encyclopedia, and thusly has some standards about what can be in it in terms of reliable references. And part of those standards is that there have to be sources for articles that are notable for some degree, for instance, stuff like blogs or personal websites really aren't acceptable. Trying to reference oneself is even worse, unless you're like some super awesome notable professor of religiosity or something, and by the encyclopedic standards that I presume Wikipedia is going for, referencing oneself really isn't considered useful.... <a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHomestarmy_5e94.html" title="User:Homestarmy">Homestarmy</a> 15:02, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Do Not Delete - a first summary</b> This article should not be deleted. Many of the points below have been drawn from the previous debate on whether or not to Merge the article. The result of that debate was for the article not to be merged.
<ul>
<li>Reliable sources: Apart from the secondary debate over whether millions of people reading hundreds of blogs that repeatedly use the term Friedman Unit count as a reliable source, the term has appeared in print media as referenced in the article. If you have problems with the print media that the term has appeared in, then please do not just say "that doesn't count" or "that's not a reliable source." You will need to explain why those specific publications are not reliable in the context of the wikipedia guidelines.</li>
<li>Neologism: The neologism rule is in place to keep people from using Wikipedia to coin a term. In the case of the Friedman Unit, the term is already widely used without the help of this article. While the google test does not assure notability of a term, the many and varied hit results for the Friedman Unit show that it is widely used by millions of people. If you no not think that millions of blog readers do not count as the wide use of a term, then please explain why they do not count.</li>
<li>Wikipedia is not a print medium: It is a founding principle of Wikipedia that is has space for entries that would not otherwise make it into a print encyclopedia. Because if this rule, it is important to remember that if an article is in doubt, it is better to err on the side of caution and keep the article rather than delete it. If you think that Wikipedia does not have space for this article, then please explain with evidence.</li>
<li>I don't like it: While the "I like it" argument is not a good reason for keeping an article, it is also equally important to remember that "I don't like it" is not a good reason for deleting it. Editors on both sides need to ask themselves this question before they make their arguments so that they do not do a disservice to the Wikipedia community by letting their subjective opinions overshadow their reason.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For these and many other reasons that I am sure other people will list, this article should be kept. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidhc_c2ac.html" title="User:Davidhc">Davidhc</a> 18:00, 26 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Excuse me, <i>millions</i> of people <b>use</b> this term? Please provide a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> for this. Several political bloggers have used it, although notably the person for whom it is named does not. I can't see any comments above that use the "I don't like it" argument. As to the <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> argument, given that search results for just about any term in Wikipedia will show Wikipedia in the top 5 results, the fact of an article here pretty well guarantees that Wikipedia has an effect on the popularity of a term (which one could term the "observation affects the outcome of an experiment" argument). There have been other recent examples where news sources and blogs have taken their information about current events right from the Wikipedia articles in development at that time. The term was coined by <a href="../../../a/t/r/Atrios.html" title="Atrios">Atrios</a> and deserves a place in the article about him. There is no consistent definition or usage of the term at this point. Until that stabilizes, the article should be deleted with a redirect to Atrios. The examples have to go regardless of whether or not the article is deleted. <a href="../../../r/i/s/User%7ERisker_ce88.html" title="User:Risker">Risker</a> 18:38, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>a) What print source are you talking about? The only source I saw brought up on the discussion page was a Huffington Post article that spent a total of three sentences discussing the term. I heard tell of a single mention in Editor and Publisher that is inaccessible to most readers, including myself.</li>
<li>b) From <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>, "To support the use of (or an article about) a particular term we must cite reliable secondary sources such as books and papers about the term — not books and papers that use the term." So far, we just have three sentences from HuffPo. Blogs, like it are not, are not considered reliable sources on WP.</li>
<li>c) I think you're misstating <a href="../../../p/a/p/WP%7EPAPER_01fc.html" title="WP:PAPER">WP:PAPER</a>. Nobody is arguing that we should delete this article because it would not show up in Britannica, or anything to that effect. WP:PAPER does not justify the inclusion of articles that are poorly sourced or cover topics that are not significant enough. Those are the points of contention here, not whether this article would be included in a paper encyclopedia.</li>
<li>d) I don't see anyone using the "I don't like it" argument here, and I don't expect anyone will, so I'm not sure what you're saying. If you want my subjective opinion on the term, I'm a fan of Atrios and think the term is funny and illustrative. However, objectively, it does not come close to meeting the requirements necessary to have an independent article on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroctotheface_7023.html" title="User:Croctotheface">Croctotheface</a> 18:42, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>"hundreds of blogs that repeatedly use the term" is the form of argument that is required at Wiktionary, because it is an argument about whether a word is in use. It is irrelevant to Wikipedia, because it doesn't demonstrate the existences of <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a> that document a subject. <b>Counting Google hits is not research.</b> To demonstrate that reliable sources exist, you have to <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cite sources</a> that document (not use — <b>document</b>) this purported unit. You have to show, with cited sources, that this unit has been researched and documented outside of Wikipedia, in accordance with our <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policies. Excluding the sources <i>that cite this Wikipedia article itself as their source</i>, and the unreliable sources such as pseudonymous postings on discussion fora, there is <i>not a single source in this article</i> that documents this purported unit. There's only one source that even documents the fact that one person has made the same prediction repeatedly, something that is incorrectly presented when presented in an article on a unit of measurement that has not actually been documented anywhere. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:51, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>; the article is full of citations, and not all of them are blogs; apparently, this term has indeed gained some currency in the print media. I can't see any policy this violates. <tt><a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus horridus</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECrotalus_horridus_e0ed.html" title="User talk:Crotalus horridus">TALK</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crotalus_horridus_e95d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crotalus horridus">CONTRIBS</a>)</small></tt> 18:44, 26 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What does "gained some currency" mean? I mean, the article itself says something to that effect, but it seems to be incorrect. If anything, the section that lists publications that have used the term is misleading, as it cites blogs (say, from the Washington Monthly) but gives the impression that the term has appeared in print edition of the magazine. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroctotheface_7023.html" title="User:Croctotheface">Croctotheface</a> 18:50, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>It violates the <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policy, given that it takes roughly thirty quotations from different people talking about things that may happen months into the future and synthesizes from them the novel conclusion that there is a unit of measurement. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:55, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Editors and Publishers</b> Just to give one example of a secondary source: Along with the listing on the main page for the Friedman Unit, there is in individual entry in discussion page on the use of the term in an article in the print edition of Editors and Publishers. This article, you can read an excerpt included in the discussion, acknowledges that the term is widely used and is accurate in its description. This is all that is needed to verify the term Friedman Unit and keep this entry. The whole point of a secondary source is to find a reliable source (in this case a print article that was written by professional journalists and approved by professional editors) that documents the use of the term. The purpose of a secondary source is to provide documentation of existence, not act as proof of existence in itself. If you have any proof that the Editors and Publishers is not a professional print media, or that the article is a hoax, then please I would like to see it. Also, please read the article and the article's comments page before you post here and vaguely claim that reliable sources do not exist, because both the article and the discussion reliable secondary sources clearly. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidhc_c2ac.html" title="User:Davidhc">Davidhc</a> 22:00, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. I have done several <a href="../../../h/e/y/WP%7EHEY_63b4.html" title="WP:HEY">WP:HEY</a> efforts on behalf of neologisms, and some of those resulted in a keep or no consensus result; obviously, I'm liberally inclusionist. In this case I looked around and saw little that could be done, as much as <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>. I pushed and prodded in the merge discussion for reliable sources and the elimination of original research, and there was some improvement -- but ultimately there are only marginally reliable sources even using the term at all, such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Huffington_Post_085a.html" title="The Huffington Post">The Huffington Post</a>. Now, I could defend a list of citations of "in the next <i>N</i> months" predictions <b>if and only if</b> they were accompanied by a citation of a reliable source calling that prediction a "Friedman" (and I personally would accept Atrios for these, as this is a subarticle on his term, as long as notability had been established otherwise). I am pretty sure that a very brief such list could be extracted for illustration purposes in the <a href="../../../a/t/r/Atrios.html" title="Atrios">Atrios</a> article. But he hasn't done that for all of the examples cited; the list seems to be merely finding as many "in the next N months" citations as possible, which only really illustrates what Atrios is originally complaining about, i.e. the prevalence of such predictions. So most of the list would have to go even if notability were established, because it's synthesis. All that said, I have urged that the authors of the article give it a more appropriate home such as Demopedia or Dkosopedia, where the predictions may be compiled under more hospitable inclusion policies. I would indeed like it if this term were a notable neologism, but as it stands, I don't think it passes muster. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 22:06, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. There's no denying the term's indebtedness to Atrios; however, the phrase has currency beyond Eschaton (one of the twenty most influential publications in the U.S., in my opinion) &amp; beyond the blogosphere in general--I've heard it in conversation. It's a succinct critique of U.S. policy in Iraq and, more pointedly, of the U.S. media's failure to question authority. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillbrock_ae1b.html" title="User:Billbrock">Billbrock</a> 23:54, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, there are plenty of references in the opening paragraphs that establish this term has expanded beyond Atrios' blog - even into "mainstream". The specific political motivation in using it aside, it does seem to have become widespread in certain significant circles. If the big list of examples in the later part of the article is too ORish or otherwise unweildy it can be trimmed or removed, but that's a content and cleanup issue rather than an AfD one. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan Derksen</a> 01:10, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. I came upon this article and found it to be useful; I have seen the term in a number of places and was pleased to see that Wikipedia had an article on the emerging meme. Along with others, I added some sources demonstrating its use in various mainstream publications. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Oaf_699c.html" title="User:Bill Oaf">Bill Oaf</a> 03:18, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per the supporting arguments previously mentioned. In response to the <i>Editors and Publishers</i> argument, I'd like to point out that the article merely mentions <i>in passing</i> that certain bloggers use the Friedman Unit. The term appears once in the entire text, while the article itself is devoted to a different subject. However, notablility requires the topic being <i>the subject</i> of at least one substantial or multiple non-trivial published works. This neologism has never been discussed in any level of detail by a reliable source, let alone being the subject of one. —&#160;<i><a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelw_29ad.html" title="User:Kelw">Kelw</a></i>&#160;<small>(<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelw_ef75.html" title="User talk:Kelw">talk</a>)</small> 05:30, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Dhartung claims to "like it," then goes on to ignore all the sound arguments for keeping it as Editors hashed out over the past month in the Talk page. (I just lurked on there as I assumed those who favored merger or deletion were just a bunch of trouble-makers whose suggestions would not be taken seriously.) Many who favor deletion ignore the clear acceptance of web sources in the OR guidelines. Dhartung asserts, with no basis in fact, that HuffingtonPost is a "marginally reliable source," when (as the Talk pages make clear) it is written by well-known and highly-regarded journalists -- repeated below. He dismissively makes passing reference to "even using the term at all, such as The Huffington Post" -- while failing to mention that the phrase "Friedman Unit" won HuffPo's award for "<b>best</b> new phrase of 2006! That's much more than "using the term at all"! And it casts doubt on Dhartung's objectivity and good faith in this discussion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is just one of the many sound arguments on the FU talk page, all of which apparently need to be copied into here if critics are not willing to engage in good faith discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li>The original-research guidelines state: "citing book, print, or <b>reliable web resources</b> [sic] demonstrates that the material is verifiable and is not merely the editor's opinion." So web resources are explicitly allowed...</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../h/u/f/Huffington_Post_7abe.html" title="Huffington Post">Huffington Post</a></b> is a reliable web resource. It is: (i) widely read (online <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?site0=huffingtonpost.com&amp;site1=economist.com&amp;site2=usnews.com&amp;site3=washingtontimes.com&amp;site4=foreignaffairs.org&amp;y=t&amp;z=3&amp;h=300&amp;w=540&amp;range=1y&amp;size=Medium&amp;url=menufoods.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?site0=huffingtonpost.com&amp;site1=economist.com&amp;site2=usnews.com&amp;site3=washingtontimes.com&amp;site4=foreignaffairs.org&amp;y=t&amp;z=3&amp;h=300&amp;w=540&amp;range=1y&amp;size=Medium&amp;url=menufoods.com" rel="nofollow">outranking <i>US News &amp; World Report, The Economist, Foreign Affairs, Washington Times,</i></a> over the past year). (ii) Its feature-story writers include some of the most notable names in American politics. Well-known journalists among its <b>blog-writers alone</b><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/index/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/index/" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> include [starting alphabetically with "A"]: Chris Ahearn (President of <a href="../../../r/e/u/Reuters.html" title="Reuters">Reuters</a>!!), Mary Ann Akers (columnist for <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_DC_48ce.html" title="Washington, DC">DC</a> insiders' magazine <i><a href="../../../r/o/l/Roll_Call_e6ff.html" title="Roll Call">Roll Call</a></i>), Charles Alexander (23 years writing for <i><a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Magazine_89f3.html" title="Time Magazine">Time Magazine</a></i>), Roger Alford (law professor at <a href="../../../p/e/p/Pepperdine_University_93cf.html" title="Pepperdine University">Pepperdine University</a>), Graham Allison (<a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_University_9346.html" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a> professor, former Dean of Harvard's <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kennedy_School_of_Government_ef09.html" title="Kennedy School of Government">Kennedy School of Government</a> for 12 years, former Assistant Secretary of Defense, author of six books in political science and policy), Jonathan Alter (senior editor and colunist at <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/Newsweek.html" title="Newsweek">Newsweek</a></i>), Eric Alterman (prolific writer and commentator), Tom Andrews (former US Congressman from Maine), George Archibald (over 20 years writing for the <i><a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Times_50df.html" title="Washington Times">Washington Times</a></i>), etc. -- those are a few examples just from the list of last-names beginning with "<b>A</b>"! Huffington Post is not just some random blog populated by anyone who can type. (iii) The lead author on the Huffington Post article<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eat-the-press/2007/01/02/media-winners-of-2006-ho_e_37571.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eat-the-press/2007/01/02/media-winners-of-2006-ho_e_37571.html" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> that declared <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedman_Unit_c145.html" title="Friedman Unit">Friedman Unit</a> to be the "best new phrase of 2006," Rachel Sklar, is widely published in: <i>The New York Times, The New York Post, The Village Voice, Glamour, New York Magazine, The Financial Times</i> and numerous other publications, and is a frequent guest on MSNBC's <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scarborough_Country_f8e9.html" title="Scarborough Country">Scarborough Country</a> TV show.<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/contributors/bio.php?nick=rachel-sklar&amp;name=Rachel%20Sklar" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/contributors/bio.php?nick=rachel-sklar&amp;name=Rachel%20Sklar" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> In short, Huffington Post clearly fits the criteria for a "reliable web resource" which "demonstrates that the material is verifiable and is not merely the editor's opinion," as specified in the Wikipedia guideline on no original research. And HuffPost declared "Friedman Unit" to be the <b>best</b> new phrase of 2006.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, that's just one of many dozens of sound arguments for keeping this article, despite any doubts raised on first-glance. <a href="../../../e/u/g/User%7EEugene_Banks_b53d.html" title="User:Eugene Banks">Eugene Banks</a> 08:23, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Huffington Post may be a reliable source. However, the article that mentioned the term was about another subject and spent a total of three sentences on the term. As others have noted, that is not sufficient to establish that a neologism should have an article on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroctotheface_7023.html" title="User:Croctotheface">Croctotheface</a> 11:38, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also, just to clarify, everything that is "not original reserach" does not automaticlaly become notable. In order for a subject to have its own article, it must be notable. As such, your quote from <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> deals with whether or not text can be included within an article, not whether a topic can have its own Wikipedia article. The standard at <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, as others have mentioned, is being "the subject of at least one substantial or multiple non-trivial published works". I don't see a single published work, let alone a "substantial' or "non-trivial" one, of which the Friedman unit is the subject. It was mentioned in a trivial way (3 sentences) in a Huffington Post article. It was not the subject of that article by a long shot. It was apparently mentioned in passing in an Editor and Publisher article. Again, it was not the subject of that article. Where's the notability here? <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroctotheface_7023.html" title="User:Croctotheface">Croctotheface</a> 12:14, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>What's the best protocol, should all discussion on this be placed here (copied here -- as only a small portion of the anti-delete arguments have been so far), or left on the article's Talk page? I'm increasingly suspecting that the arguments for deletion are a disguised form of POV, most likely relating to the highly contentious Iraq war. E.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Do not delete</b>. I spent only 5 minutes googling this term, and what do I find: an interview on <a href="../../../c/n/n/CNN_2435.html" title="CNN">CNN</a> TV, by <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Kurtz_9076.html" title="Howard Kurtz">Howard Kurtz</a> no less, in which Tom Friedman himself is asked about his repeated use of the "six month" time-frame. No mention of Atrios. It is such a common notion that Kurtz doesn't even feel the need to name his source. He doesn't use the exact two words "Friedman" and "Unit", but there is no question what he is referring to: "you [Tom Friedman] were chided recently for writing several times in different occasions 'the next six months are crucial in Iraq,' 'the next six months.'" This article never should have been flagged in the first place. <a href="../../../e/u/g/User%7EEugene_Banks_b53d.html" title="User:Eugene Banks">Eugene Banks</a> 09:07, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Generally, whenever someone uses an "it must be" type of construction, it's because he or she believes something but recognizes that the sources don't actually support it. In this case, you're arguing that "there is no question" over what Kurtz is referring to, but if there were, why doesn't he mention it? Why do you need to hang your hat on the rather dubious notion that this term is SO notable that nobody even needs to use it? We're dealing with a neologism that currently has its own article, not a question of whether Friedman was criticized in a notable way over his repeated use of "the next six months" in relation to Iraq. I would agree that in the latter case that it is completely legitimate to mention that Friedman has been criticized. That could go, say, here: <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Friedman_9ada.html#Friedman_Unit" title="Thomas Friedman">Thomas Friedman#Friedman Unit</a>. However, the fact that a subject meets the threshold of verifiability required to be mentioned WITHIN articles is not the same as achieving notability through <strike>multiple non-trivial mentions in reliable sources</strike> being "the subject of at least one substantial or multiple non-trivial published works" per <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. Without notability, the term can't have its own article. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroctotheface_7023.html" title="User:Croctotheface">Croctotheface</a> 11:43, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The main article on the Friedman Unit cites at least three print publications which cover the term in their articles. This meets the guideline of "multiple non-trivial published works." If you disagree, then please explain how these three publications do not meet the "non-trivial" standard. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidhc_c2ac.html" title="User:Davidhc">Davidhc</a> 16:04, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Also note that the term must be the <b>subject</b> of multiple non-trivial published works. Even if The American Prospect or Washington Monthly mentioned the term in the print edition of their publications, and not merely their blogs, "mentioned in" or "used in" do not meet the standard of notability that I quoted. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroctotheface_7023.html" title="User:Croctotheface">Croctotheface</a> 16:23, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Let's see. An interview of Friedman. Lots of talk about "six months." No use of the term "Friedman unit." If I had seen that interview, would I have any reason to think that "six months" would equal "Friedman unit" or vice versa? If the term was not used in the interview, then the interview cannot in any way be used as an example of the term. <a href="../../../r/i/s/User%7ERisker_ce88.html" title="User:Risker">Risker</a> 12:19, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Multiple non-trivial sources</b> There seems to be a lot of confusion over examples that people bring up in discussion and the examples that are in the article. (If you have good examples of the use of the term, please add them to the article.) The sources currently cited in the article are:</p>
<ul>
<li><i><a href="../../../e/d/i/Editor_%26_Publisher_6ef1.html" title="Editor &amp; Publisher">Editor &amp; Publisher</a></i></li>

<p>If you want to delete this article, then you are going to have to prove why ALL of these sources do not meet the non-trivial guidelines (I would say most of them are way above the criteria for non-trivial). You can not just go on slamming the Huffington Post or examples that are not in the main article and then say there is no notability.

<dd>We've discussed E&amp;P and HuffPo at length already, so I won't repeat those arguments again. Daily Kos is a blog. The American Prospect citation is from TAPPED, the publication's blog. The Washington Monthly citation is from Kevin Drum's blog, which is published on the WM's website. In your last comment, you said that "three print publications...cover the term in their articles". In fact, this coverage is from blogs, which is not the same thing, per <a href="../../../r/e/l/WP%7EReliable_sources_20af.html" title="WP:Reliable sources">WP:Reliable sources</a>. Besides that, these blogs just use the term, which is enough to satisfy inclusion in Wiktionary, but not here. You have yet to show that the "Friedman unit" is <b>the subject of</b> multiple non-trivial published works. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroctotheface_7023.html" title="User:Croctotheface">Croctotheface</a> 16:46, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Thank you for acknowledging that the term Friedman Unit is covered in all of the sources listed above. Please also note, that as explained above in the discussion, the wikipedia guidelines do not exclude blogs. So please explain to me why this article is up for deletion? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidhc_c2ac.html" title="User:Davidhc">Davidhc</a> 17:08, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Per official Wikipedia policy <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a>, blogs are self-published and therefore cannot be reliable sources.

<dd><a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVILITY_dc24.html" title="WP:CIVILITY">Civility</a> is valued here, first of all. Second, "covered in X sources" does not establish notability. As I've said more than once now, <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> calls for a topic to be "the subject of at least one substantial or multiple non-trivial published works" for it to meet the threshold of notability required for it to have an article. I have not seen a single published work that the "Friedman unit" is the subject of. I've seen it used in a couple of blog posts, and maybe mentioned in passing here or there, but that's it. Regarding blogs, I suggest you reread <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Blogs written by experts whose blogs cover their area of expertise can occasionally be used as sources for <i>content</i>, subject to very specific restrictions, per <a href="../../../s/p/s/WP%7ESPS_9b02.html" title="WP:SPS">WP:SPS</a>. Kevin Drum's blog, for instance, may have a sufficient pedigree to source content, though even something like that could very likely lead to disputes. However, something can be sufficient to source <i>content within articles</i> and still fall well short of <i>establishing notability</i> required for a topic to have its own article. I'd recommend rereading all the policies and guidelines at issue here if you're still a bit unclear about the difference. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroctotheface_7023.html" title="User:Croctotheface">Croctotheface</a> 17:38, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Do not delete, do not merge, do not blank.</b> Croc, firstly, you seem to be engaging in the following style of argumentation: You make argument X. Opponents make arguments A, B, and C. You then conclude "We've already discussed X," trying to get the last word while ignoring the previous discussion. (And if X is rebutted, you then add argument Y.) WP:Reliable Sources concludes: "This page in a nutshell: All material in Wikipedia must be attributable to a reliable, published source." This has been done, with <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedman_unit.html" title="Friedman unit">Friedman unit</a>, many times over. Additional sources keep being added -- I just added <a href="../../../c/n/n/CNN_2435.html" title="CNN">CNN</a> (see above). The fact that E&amp;P has an article with FU as a subject is really all a WP article needs as proof of reliable sourcing and non-original research. (Perhaps a definition of "subject" is in order? Wiktionary: "Subject: 1. In a clause: the word or word group [usually a noun phrase] that is dealt with.") You keep raising the bar on this article as to what a reliable source must be. (Now it seems you're saying it must be the only subject of an article? That's ridiculous. Or perhaps only appearing in a mass-circulation magazine? But <i>E&amp;P</i> is <b>far</b> more notable and credible than e.g. <i>Time Magazine</i>. Each time you ignore new evidence and previous arguments I suspect you are surreptitiously engaging in POV.) The fact that HuffingtonPost is a highly credible online source (whose authors and editorial process are better than most print outlets) also stands alone as sufficient sourcing. (Perhaps we should examine the credibility of journalists and editorial process in other sources frequently used on Wikipedia; the <i>Washington Times</i> comes to mind immediately.) On a whim I just Googled and discovered that the FU concept has been picked up in French, as well, e.g. "Ca vaut les six mois de Friedman pour un dénouement en Irak." The fact that there are many sources for Friedman Unit (including the others cited elsewhere, Kevin Drum, CNN, Washington Monthly, etc.) casts doubt on your willingness to engage in reasonable discussion.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, part of the confusion may be a philosophical difference. What is important is the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Platonic_ideal.html" title="Platonic ideal">Platonic ideal</a> of the concept, the abstraction. Ideas are more important than physical manifestations of things. So what is important about "<a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedman_unit.html" title="Friedman unit">Friedman unit</a>" is the concept (including the never-ending series of six-month projections about war that are forgotten as the period ends, and the widespread uses of this concept which needs to be demonstrated by examples). Thus, the fact that Kurtz on CNN did not use the 10 letters (a, d, e, f, i, m, n, r, t, and u) rearranged to spell "Friedman Unit" is truly not important. There is no doubt that Kurtz, interviewing Friedman about the latter's repeated use of a never-ending six-month horizon in regards to the Iraq war, is discussing this <b>concept</b>. Critics of this page may be more <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristotelian.html" title="Aristotelian">Aristotelian</a> in outlook, but there is room on Wikipedia for articles of both types, and measuring up to one approach or the other is not grounds for deletion, merging, or blanking. Being overly concerned with minutiae and detail about guidelines is not helpful for Wikipedians, especially when combined with a tone that is perceived as condescending, even if it is not being used as a cloak for POV. <a href="../../../e/u/g/User%7EEugene_Banks_b53d.html" title="User:Eugene Banks">Eugene Banks</a> 18:05, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>To your second point: what is important, per <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>, is very much the "abstraction", in this case the neologism ("Friedman unit") in question, rather than the concept. To quote the guideline, "To support the use of (or an article about) a particular term we must cite reliable secondary sources such as books and papers <i>about</i> the term — not books and papers <i>that use</i> the term." (Emphasis in original.) So, yes, to your first point, sources that establish notability DO need to be ABOUT the topic of the article. That is, indeed, <strike>the whole point</strike>a major tenet of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroctotheface_7023.html" title="User:Croctotheface">Croctotheface</a> 18:16, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, I'm going to ask you to chilll out a little bit regarding the tone of some of your comments. I don't think it's really productive to accuse me of being a POV pusher or accusing me of moving the goalposts or anything of that nature. These type of comments, per <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>, are generally not considered productive for discussion and establishing consensus. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroctotheface_7023.html" title="User:Croctotheface">Croctotheface</a> 18:19, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for finding the full text of the article. This full article definitely confirms as a secondary source that the Friedman Unit is an accurate and correct term for describing the use of the phrase "The next six months" in the style of Thomas Friedman. As you can see, the article starts by presenting the term "the Friedman Unit" in the opening paragraph, explains how it applies to the use of the phrase "the next six months", and makes a special note that the word did not originate in the article itself. This is what a secondary source is supposed to do. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidhc_c2ac.html" title="User:Davidhc">Davidhc</a> 19:27, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, but the article is about Friedman and his procilvity to talk about "the next six months", not the term. The article MENTIONS the term, but it is not ABOUT the term itself. Basically, the Wikipedia article covers the term in far more detail than any other source. This should simply not happen. One sentence in E&amp;P, three sentences in HuffPo...that's just not enough for an encyclopedia article. I'm actually inclined to agree with you that "Freidman unit" is a meaningful phrase with descriptive power and so forth. However, that in itself does not merit a WP article. The term can be covered in <a href="../../../a/t/r/Atrios.html" title="Atrios">Atrios</a> and at Wiktionary to the same effect. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroctotheface_7023.html" title="User:Croctotheface">Croctotheface</a> 00:51, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The E&amp;P article is about the Friedman Unit, it talks about nothing but the Friedman Unit, in fact the article proves that the Friedman Unit was not a "one off" event because the main body of the article is on how Thomas Friedman continues to use the Friedman Unit. This article in combination with the other references given meet the criteria of "multiple non-trivial sources".

<p><b>This article is legitimate as determined by the wikipedia guidelines and so it shoudl be kept.</b> The "multiple non-trivial sources" given in this article prove that this article is a legitimate entry in Wikipedia. Wikipedia guidelines do a good job of making sure that articles are not hoaxes or inventions of their editors or made for the pure purpose of pushing neologisms that are not already widespread (by that I mean a neologism that is an invention of the editor). The Friedman Unit is a fact that exists outside of the context of this article, as the sources given in the article prove, and this article does an excellent job of presenting an encyclopedic summary of that fact to the general public.

The 'next six months' phenomenon in Friedman's columns is notable and supported by multiple non-trivial sources, dating from the original FAIR article. If editors are prepared to migrate discussion of the phenomenon to the Friedman entry (where it currently has an 'original research' tag) then discussion of the 'Friedman Unit' neologism can be migrated to the Atrios entry with an appropriate cross-reference. But I think the Friedman merge cannot be ignored, and has to occur at the same time, because the 'next six months' phenomenon is not limited to discussions by Atrios.

<dd>That makes no sense whatsoever. the elements of the article that should be merged into the Friedman article (on the repeated 'next six months') are ones that shouldn't be merged into the Atrios article, on basic relevance grounds. Hence my vote: the 'next six months' material is notable and verifiable for Friedman, and dumping it off in the Atrios article as a half-way house just shifts the issue without resolving it. If the neologism is notable enough to merge with the Atrios article, then the thing to which it refers needs to be in its proper place. (In short: if A coins term B to refer to what X says about Y, then the discussion of Y needs to be on X's page, not A's.) Merge to both, or keep for now. Holgate 01:30, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Please maintain a civil tone and refrain attacks like "that makes no sense whatsoever". If you insist, you can take out what doesn't belong in the Atrios article and place it in the Friedman article. The "six months" phenomenon can easily be summarized in a single sentence on Friedman's article, with a reference linking to the FAIR article. Beyond this, all the content is either original research or already merged. There is no need to keep this article around if you want to merge into Friedman's article. —&#160;<i><a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelw_29ad.html" title="User:Kelw">Kelw</a></i>&#160;<small>(<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelw_ef75.html" title="User talk:Kelw">talk</a>)</small> 02:18, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, you have pretty well defined the debate here. If the article was called "Six months," then it would be overwhelmingly well sourced. The point is that the reliable sources do NOT use the term "Friedman Unit." Politicians and pundits have used the "six month" expression for (lest I date myself) generations, about all kinds of situations. The article gives a definition of the term Friedman unit as a "six month period" but then exclusively provides examples from the Iraq war discussions - not one of which uses the term "Friedman unit" or the variations ("Friedman," "F.U."). <a href="../../../r/i/s/User%7ERisker_ce88.html" title="User:Risker">Risker</a> 13:39, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You make a good argument for looking to see if there are sufficient secondary sources to use for an an "Antecedents" section (cognates before "FU" was coined), while keeping in compliance with OR/synthesis guidelines. Since these may be more likely to appear in books, not digital form, it may be some time before these are unearthed. But this is no argument for deleting the article.</dd>
<dd>I think we've reached a degree of consensus here, Kelw: I've sketched out the 'six months' criticism on the Friedman article, providing mutual links between that section and the Atrios article. That's the space that this neologism should really occupy. The quotations are worth saving somewhere, though Demopedia/DKosopedia seems more appropriate. Holgate 18:10, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - While blogs might not be reliable sources in general, they are precisely what is needed to establish the usage of a neologism. If you take a walk and every third person you meet uses a particular neologism, it doesn't matter if the people you've met are experts on the subject the neologism is part of, or whether they are experts on usage, or whether they even properly understand the word or are using it correctly. What matters is that their very use of the word establishes the diffusion of the neologism into the general population, which is really the point. So, if a lot of different blogs are using "Friedman unit", then the word is in usage, whether or not the bloggers understand the first thing about Iraq or Thomas Friedman. <a href="../../../e/d/f/User%7EEdfitz_bd26.html" title="User:Edfitz">Ed Fitzgerald (unfutz)</a> 14:14, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<p><b>Comment</b>: Last night I went through the first 500 google-hits on the term "Friedman Unit." Out of that 500, there was exactly one link that constituted a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, and it is already in the article. Perhaps more crucially, there were also almost 100 mirrors of the Wikipedia article, and at least 50 more that said "Wikipedia defines...." And of course WP was #1 and #2 on the google-hit parade. In other words - Wikipedia's entry is directly or indirectly responsible for 150 out of 500 of the top google-hits on this term. It certainly looks to me that <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> is an issue here. <a href="../../../r/i/s/User%7ERisker_ce88.html" title="User:Risker">Risker</a> 23:43, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>An experiment</b>: This may seem like overkill, but I ran a quick test of my own because this is an issue that is important to ALL entries in wikipedia. I ran three variations of google searches for the Friedman Unit to see how it faired alone, with, and without wikipedia in the search criteria using the search terms:</p>
<p>1) "Friedman Unit" 2) "Friedman Unit" wikipedia 3) "Friedman Unit" -wikipedia</p>
<p>The results were as follows:</p>
<p><a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedman_Unit_c145.html" title="Friedman Unit">Friedman Unit</a> alone: 259,000 (Wikipedia entry was first hit) with: 587 without: 261,000</p>
<p>(NOTE: if you run Friedman Unit without the quotes you get over 1.5 million hits)</p>
<p>To get a random sample of wikipedia to compare it to, I hit the "random article" link five times and did the same test on the pages it gave me. The results were as follows:</p>
<p><a href="../../../t/h/o/Thottiyam.html" title="Thottiyam">Thottiyam</a> alone: 546 (wikipedia first hit) with wikipedia: 92 without wikipedia: 510</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_transports_of_heads_of_state.html" title="Air transports of heads of state">Air transports of heads of state</a> alone: 226 (wikipedia second hit) with: 154 without: 64</p>
<p><a href="../../../y/a/m/Yamaha_DX7_fc9d.html" title="Yamaha DX7">Yamaha DX7</a> alone: 127,000 (wikipedia 3rd hit) with: 963 without: 118,000</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_at_Work_0e28.html" title="Music at Work">Music at Work</a> alone: 77,900 (wikipedia 6th hit) with: 553 without: 73,100</p>
<p><a href="../../../e/n/f/Enfield_Town_F.C._851c.html" title="Enfield Town F.C.">Enfield Town F.C.</a> alone: 559 (wikipedia 3rd hit) with: 226 without: 508</p>
<p>As you can see, ALL the entries came up with wikipedia in the top 10 hits. Also, the Friedman Unit has by far the best ratio of with to without than any of the five random entries, which means that by the argument given above, we would have to delete ALL of these entries, and I am sure many more. The reason wikipedia shows up is not because of the popularity of any given article, but because of the popularity of wikipedia in general. When people want a source to link a topic in their web page, they link to wikipedia. All the copycat sites know this, and so they farm off the wikipedia entries to get traffic. Hence there is a big difference between a site that mirrors the wikipedia article and someone saying "as defined by wikipedia" in their web page. Making the argument that a wikipedia page is somehow pushing a neologism only applies if that term does not exist anywhere else but in wikipedia. The multiple non-trivial sources given in the article on the Friedman unit prove that the term is in wide use without the help of the article. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidhc_c2ac.html" title="User:Davidhc">Davidhc</a> 17:14, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As another editor already mentioned, counting Google hits is not research.

<dd>I'm sorry Croc if you got confused. If you scroll up a bit, then you will see the comment that I was responding to.

I didn't feel it was necessary to repeat that fact in order to refute the claims of neologism that I was responding to, but I guess it would have been sufficient. Still, when you read the comment I was responding to you will see that Risker in his google search gave further confirmation to the fact that one of the references listed in the article is in fact a "reliable source." <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidhc_c2ac.html" title="User:Davidhc">Davidhc</a> 00:56, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You're not actually responding to what I asked. I asked if you know of a reliable source of which the "Friedman Unit" is the SUBJECT. That is, not merely mentioned or used in the article, but article itself is ON the "Unit". Not on Friedman or his proclivity to set arbitrary dates in the future, but the actual neologism that we're talking about. It is my contention that I have yet to see a single reliable source that is ON the Friedman unit. I've seen a one sentence mention in a reliable source. That does not establish notability. Do you know of any reliable sources of which the "Friedman unit" is the subject? That is, if you asked the author of the piece what it is about, he or she would likely say, "well, this is an article about the Friedman unit"? <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroctotheface_7023.html" title="User:Croctotheface">Croctotheface</a> 01:46, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That strikes me as an overly stringent interpretation of 'reliable sourcing', and ignores the multiple non-trivial standard that has already been demonstrated. Nowhere do the guidelines on <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">notability</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATTRIBUTION_a85c.html" title="WP:ATTRIBUTION">attribution</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, etc. state or hint that an article must be the <b>sole</b> subject of a reliable source. Nor do guidelines say that these sources must be about e.g., the etymology, origins, history, definition, existence <i>qua</i> neologism, or usage of a term, that would misconstrue the guidelines. Much of Wikipedia would fail this test, and not just <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">crappy</a> articles. A source in which the concept is a theme or featured prominently is clearly sufficient. I respectfully disagree with your assessment that <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedman_unit.html" title="Friedman unit">Friedman unit</a> is not the subject of reliable sources as cited in the article, it's Talk page, and above. For example:
<ul>
<li>It <b>is</b> a significant subject of the <a href="../../../e/%26/p/E%26P_5eb5.html" title="E&amp;P">E&amp;P</a> article, as Davidhc enumerated above: "The E&amp;P article is about the Friedman Unit, [...] in fact the article proves that the Friedman Unit was not a 'one off' event because the main body of the article is on how Thomas Friedman continues to use the Friedman Unit." It would, of course, be very difficult to write an article on it and <b>not</b> "mention Friedman and his proclivity to set arbitrary dates in the future," as E&amp;P did, so of course those subjects are present <b>as well</b>.</li>
<li>The online magazine <a href="../../../h/u/f/Huffington_Post_7abe.html" title="Huffington Post">Huffington Post</a>, a reliable source (as documented above), deems the phrase "Friedman Unit" to be the <b>best</b> new phrase of 2006.</li>
<li>The phrase is a also significant subject of the <a href="../../../c/n/n/CNN_2435.html" title="CNN">CNN</a> interview; even if the exact phrase itself is not used, Kurtz is clearly asking Friedman about the concept.</li>
<li>An online column (not a blog) for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_American_Prospect_44d8.html" title="The American Prospect">The American Prospect</a> notes that "Friedman has become justly famous for the Friedman Unit -- a 6-month, endlessly renewable time period that will prove critical for Iraq."</li>
<li>As noted above, the guidelines' caution on use of blogs as a source is not absolute. And in this case (as discussed on the Talk page and here), there are good reasons why one might also consider blogs (such as DailyKos or the thousands of others that use the term) as "multiple non-trivial sources'. Namely, the concept FU contains within it a critique of traditional media (for a lack of critical reporting on the Iraq war early on), hence its widespread usage in informal circles as well as the reliable sources documented above.</li>
<li>While Google is not a reliable research source, on the other hand at some point in establishing the widespread usage of a term, quantity has it's own quality, and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=+%22friedman+unit" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=+%22friedman+unit" rel="nofollow">250,000 hits</a> for "Friedman unit" should not be ignored.</li>

<dd><b>Keep.</b> Yes, and as discussed above, the cited articles <b>are</b> about the term (as well as other subjects). "Some people" is an unrefutable charge. "as if... something like... 'topic mentioned at all in any reliable source'" -- <a href="../../../s/a/r/WP%7ESARCASM_0469.html" title="WP:SARCASM">sarcasm</a> is not constructive. Btw, the page on neologisms is simply an ongoing discussion of possible guidelines. There are four higher levels of policy and dozens of other guidelines. At the top, see for example the <a href="../../../f/i/v/Five_Pillars_7295.html" title="Five Pillars">Five Pillars</a> of Wikipedia. Below that, see the <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simplified_Ruleset_5baa.html" title="Simplified Ruleset">Simplified Ruleset</a> of 15 rules. Below even that, see the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_policies_92b2.html" title="Wikipedia:List of policies">Wikipedia:List of policies</a> with 42 policies. Where "neologism" fits is one section below even that, under "No Original Research," for which the main policy is: "Articles may not contain any unpublished theories, data, statements, concepts, arguments, or ideas." FU clearly fits this overarching policy. And within WP:OR, the emphasis is on attribution: the guidance is only against neologisms "without attributing the neologism to a reputable source." The roots of the Neologism page, which is one layer further down, stated: "Wikipedia doesn't accept <b>fan-made</b> neologisms unless they have realistic evidence of existence via search engine hits (e.g. Google)." This was strengthened to weed out editors who created a term on their own blog, then -- with <s>no</s> little other adoption of the term -- promoting it within Wikipedia. Although a few Google hits to random blogs set up by just anyone are no longer seen as a reputable source, FU goes <b>far</b> beyond this. BipDeBop 17:26, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ol>
<li>The neologism rule is in place to keep people from using Wikipedia to coin a term. In the case of the Friedman Unit, the term is already widely used without the help of this article. While the google test does not assure notability of a term, the many and varied hit results for the Friedman Unit show that it is widely used by millions of people. (User:Risker asked for a reliable source on the estimate of "millions." An appeal to logic: with 260,000 Google hits for FU, including a number of widely-read online magazines and blogs, it is reasonable to conjecture that on average each hit was read by at least 8 people, thus two million is a reasonable working estimate for purposes of discussion.)</li>
<li>Wikipedia guidelines do a good job of making sure that articles are not hoaxes or inventions of their editors or made for the pure purpose of pushing neologisms that are not already widespread (by that I mean a neologism that is an invention of the editor). The Friedman Unit is a fact that exists outside of the context of this article, as the sources given in the article prove, and this article does an excellent job of presenting an encyclopedic summary of that fact to the general public. (The E&amp;P article does not just "mention the Friedman Unit in one sentence and then talks about a different subject," as discussed elsewhere.)</li>
<li>What matters is the widespread online use of the word establishes the diffusion of the neologism into the general population, which is really the point. (The article goes on to provide far more than a mere dictionary definition.)</li>
<li>Making the argument that a wikipedia page is somehow pushing a neologism only applies if that term does not exist anywhere else but in wikipedia. The multiple non-trivial sources given in the article on the Friedman unit prove that the term is in wide use without the help of the article.</li>
<li>Please also note the the restrictions on neologisms are designed to prevent the creation of new terms through Wikipedia, not describing existing uses (from secondary sources). This article does not "define or introduce new terms or provide new definitions of existing terms," it simply reports on an existing neologism with widespread adoption. "Articles that use neologisms should be edited to ensure they conform with the core Wikipedia policy: Wikipedia:Attribution," which this article does. The primary source for the term was (it seems) Atrios. The secondary sources include the Editor &amp; Publisher article, and references in the journals listed in the article. This page is a tertiary article.</li>
<li>WP's VfD/AfD process has been horribly mangled, if not outright broken, for quite some time now, as people move beyond the entirely laudable goal of culling vanity <a href="../../../c/r/u/Cruft.html" title="Cruft">cruft</a> and spam to grind all of the sharp points off of articles at the edge of Wikipedia — precisely those articles where Wikipedia is most useful, IMHO, in that one can find plenty of good information sources for "Yugoslavia" or "Aaron Burr", but not so many good information sources on, say, Kazu Kibuishi's <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copper_%28comic%29.html" title="Copper (comic)">Copper</a>. I think that "Friedman Unit" is squarely within the ambit of acceptable articles for Wikipedia.</li>
<li>Trying to squelch a legitimate new term is as much an abuse of "avoid neologisms" policy as is trying to promote a not-yet-accepted term. (Perhaps someone should revise the neologism policy to reflect this. As Bryan pointed out, WP guidelines are in a state of flux, especially on WP:ATT, WP:RS, WP:OR, etc.)</li>
<li>While it is true that "other crap exists" is not a valid argument unto itself, it is also true that guidelines emerge up from the consensus of editing on other articles. In the context of all the arguments for (and against) this page, consider why is <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheese-eating_surrender_monkeys.html" title="Cheese-eating surrender monkeys">Cheese-eating surrender monkeys</a> an article if FU isn't? The "Cheese-eating" article even begins by stating that within a year or two of inception "the phrase began to fall into disuse." Why don't those who favor deleting FU also favor deleting "Cheese-eating surrender monkeys"? (I do not advocate this.) Here are just a few other hastily-gathered random examples of neologisms with articles in Wikipedia: <a href="../../../w/i/k/WikiWikiWeb_cff0.html" title="WikiWikiWeb">WikiWikiWeb</a>, <a href="../../../p/m/w/PmWiki_2e7c.html" title="PmWiki">PmWiki</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/c/CRC_1a4b.html" title="CRC">CRC</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delimiter.html" title="Delimiter">Delimiter</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/t/InterWiki_7237.html" title="InterWiki">InterWiki</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metacharacter.html" title="Metacharacter">Metacharacter</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/y/Spyce.html" title="Spyce">Spyce</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leet.html" title="Leet">Leet</a>, <a href="../../../l/3/3/L33t.html" title="L33t">l33t</a>, <a href="../../../n/0/0/N00bs.html" title="N00bs">n00bs</a>, <a href="../../../b/1/f/B1FF_2690.html" title="B1FF">B1FF</a>, <a href="../../../-/i/z/-izzle.html" title="-izzle">-izzle</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxen.html" title="Boxen">boxen</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warez.html" title="Warez">warez</a>, <a href="../../../s/f/v/SFV_3e79.html" title="SFV">SFV</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/w/Kewl.html" title="Kewl">kewl</a>, <a href="../../../c/d/i/CDisplay_d8d7.html" title="CDisplay">CDisplay</a>, <a href="../../../c/d/i/CDisplayEx_dfb6.html" title="CDisplayEx">CDisplayEx</a>, <a href="../../../z/i/p/Zipeg.html" title="Zipeg">Zipeg</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/j/ARJ_30e3.html" title="ARJ">ARJ</a>. If all these are allowed, then why not <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedman_unit.html" title="Friedman unit">Friedman unit</a>? Converely, if FU is deleted then all these and thousands of other neologisms must be as well. (We could invite their editors into this discussion, perhaps relocated onto NEO:Talk, but this would seem to be unnecessarily provoking controversy. However, if a strict interpretation of neologism guidelines were adopted here then it would have to be applied to all these other articles as well.) Unlike most of these examples, FU does in fact does have an article about it in reliable sources, including <a href="../../../e/%26/p/E%26P_5eb5.html" title="E&amp;P">E&amp;P</a>. Even if it did not, an encyclopedia should not discriminate against neologisms with a social, <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuidelines_for_controversial_articles_89b5.html" title="Wikipedia:Guidelines for controversial articles">controversial</a>, or political usage, while allowing neologisms relating to technology or the Internet.</li>

<p><b>Comment.</b> I'm no longer going to attempt to engage in the specifics of the debate here. If editors are going to insist that an article that mentions a term for one sentence is "about" the term, I don't really think that there's much hope for arriving at any kind of common ground. It seems to me that most of the arguments in favor of keeping amount to "it's important" or "I like it", which, obviously, are not the same as notability. I want to repeat, for probably the second or third time, that any and all relevant information about this term can be presented at <a href="../../../a/t/r/Atrios.html" title="Atrios">Atrios</a> and, potentially, <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Friedman_9ada.html" title="Thomas Friedman">Thomas Friedman</a>. The current page can become a redirect. Nothing of value will be lost in doing this: this is not an attempt to erase the term. It simply does not meet the standards required to have its own Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroctotheface_7023.html" title="User:Croctotheface">Croctotheface</a> 13:46, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>When I originally merged I used the following arguments. I consider them still to be valid and I still think the article should be <b>delete</b>d and a summary merged with <a href="../../../a/t/r/Atrios.html" title="Atrios">Atrios</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> does not apply solely to terms coined for or on Wikipedia:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Friedman Unit is <b>undoubtedly</b> a neologism. The source is recent and known. Secondary sources almost invariably use the same primary source, Duncan Black's weblog.</li>
<li>While the page makes note that such things must be referenced, <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> specifically mentions page intended to track the growth and adoption of neologisms as an example of infringing articles. it should be noted that <b>this is the primary purpose of this page</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../../s/y/n/WP%7ESYN_b7b5.html" title="WP:SYN">WP:SYN</a> discourages the collation of various unrelated sources to advance an original argument:</p>
<ul>
<li>Few if any of the "sources" listed in the main table have ever heard of the term "Friedman Unit", let along used it themselves. Using them as "references" for the <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedman_%28unit%29.html" title="Friedman (unit)">Friedman (unit)</a> article directly fails <a href="../../../s/y/n/WP%7ESYN_b7b5.html" title="WP:SYN">WP:SYN</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, and importantly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Practically all of this is taken from sources Black has linked himself. In essence, it's just a distillation of a bunch of Eschaton posts.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are far better places for such research than Wikipedia. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> Lexis-Nexis.</p>
<p>This really belongs in either <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_political_epithets.html" title="List of political epithets">list of political epithets</a> or in the <a href="../../../a/t/r/Atrios.html" title="Atrios">Atrios</a> article for these reasons. An expansive article on the term is unwarranted and really not greatly suitable for an encyclopedia.</p>

<p>Thank you Croctotheface, Risker, and Dhartung for changing your position from delete to keep with edits. If there is now a consensus to keep the article, then I think it is time to end the deletion debate and move back to the normal editing discussion on the article's talk page. If you would like to edit the article, however, please refrain from deleting large sections without reaching a consensus through the proper discussions. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidhc_c2ac.html" title="User:Davidhc">Davidhc</a> 17:13, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have most certainly NOT changed my position from <b>delete</b>, and you know perfectly well that is the case. Regardless of the merit of an article, I personally feel if I am going to to take a position (whether keep or delete) at an AfD, then I have accepted an obligation to try to improve the article. The fact that the three of us have all deleted the original research from the article, only to be reverted with tags such as "vandalism," makes a mockery of this process. I have retitled this section because the former title borders on <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">NPA</a>, and at minimum is beyond presumptuous. <a href="../../../r/i/s/User%7ERisker_ce88.html" title="User:Risker">Risker</a> 17:52, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I thought this was pretty bizarre as well. Croctotheface's last comment was a belief that the best result would be a merge and last edit was a removal of the contentious table. How this can be construed as a U-turn is beyond me. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThumperward_1d10.html" title="User:Thumperward">Chris Cunningham</a> 18:01, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it's clear at this point that there is no consensus to either delete or keep. With some improvements and judicious content decisions, this article should be a keep, especially in light of the multiple reliable sources cited as using the term. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Oaf_699c.html" title="User:Bill Oaf">Bill Oaf</a> 01:00, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Don't Take the law into your own hands</b> We have not heard back from Dhartung, but if you all are still strongly for deletion, then your efforts to erase large sections of the article currently under debate in the absence of any consensus over those sections, can only be interpreted as having the intent to override the AfD procedures. It is important to note that there was no "editing" involved, only "white blanking" whole sections of the article along with their external references. Once more, the table section that was deleted was not debated in these pages. Much of the debate centered on the references in the body of the text, not the table. If you have issues with the table, then I suggest that we end the deletion debate and move back to editing, or that you debate the contents of the table in this discussion, and keep pushing for deletion. However, if you want the article deleted, then you are going to have to either wait for a consensus, or wait for an administrator to weigh in, as specified in the discussion guidelines. You can not take the law into your own hands and start deleting the article at your own discretion while a debate is ongoing. This is not my opinion, this is simply following the guidelines of a discussion. I am going to restore the article so that it can be debated properly without censoring the very text that we are supposed to be debating. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidhc_c2ac.html" title="User:Davidhc">Davidhc</a> 20:50, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is common practice during AfD discussions to edit the article. In most cases, these edits serve to improve the article and often help the case of those seeking to keep. It seems that your declaration that by editing the article, I was somehow "changing my position from delete to keep" was an attempt to use this AfD discussion to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. Instead, I was making an edit based on the fact that I saw basically nobody, regardless of their history with the article or opinion on whether it should be kept or deleted, defending the inclusion of the table that I deleted. I also want to note that this is not a discussion over whether to delete certain bits of text in the article, but rather whether to delete the whole thing. If this discussion is closed as keep or no consensus, that would not be an endorsement of everything within the page. This case is a content dispute. Your leveling accusations of "vandalism" (in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Friedman_%28unit%29&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Friedman_%28unit%29&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">edit summaries</a> at the page), "blanking", and "censorship" do not add to the discourse here. Your assumptions of bad faith do not aid the goal of reaching a consensus about what is best for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroctotheface_7023.html" title="User:Croctotheface">Croctotheface</a> 21:16, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> (slight revision of my previous comment) as an attack page, and certainly without any redirects. This criticism could be merged as appropriate into the actual article pages on the various subjects (actually, it is there on all of them already). I am on good terms with some of the eds. who created this article or support it, and hope to remain so. But they made a mistake; the mistake impairs their good repute; and they would serve their cause best by agreeing to the deletion of this article. Whatever one might think of some of the hypotheses discussed, it would still not be right to use WP to express personal views--and certainly not in an article deliberately so oriented and so titled. This is the very model of a POV fork, of the most blatant kind. (Subtler POV forks use subtler titles). It illustrates perfectly the importance of NPOV. Renaming is possible, but something like "Hinduvtva pseudoscience controversy" would not help much. Many other subjects on and off WP have shown that the best way of refuting what one thinks nonsense is to let it be expressed freely. If one thinks it merely wrong, that's handled by balanced presentation. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 19:54, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<b>Keep</b> a) Google with [+Hindutva +pseudoscience] gets 566 hits: not all that many but certainly not none.</p>
<p>b) Nanda and Sokal both make a serious presentation of the mix of postmodernism, pseudoscience and religion that is being pressed into service, apparently with political aims. There does appear to be a real and current phenomeonon (and one that seems to discredit both science and genuine religious believers).</p>
<p>c) There also appear to be clear examples of heavy promotion of one or two Indian scientists on Wikipedia; and occasional claims for discoveries in mathematics that stretch credibility somewhat. For myself, I feel that outrageous claims are disrespectful towards the early mathematician, and possibly towards religious pioneers also.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>merge</b>. The term "pseudoscience" is associated with "Hindutva" in a number of scholarly works, including some cited in the article. I don't find any examples of the phrase "Hindutva pseudoscience"; but what's important is that a number of scholars have written about a phenomenon of ideologically/religiously motivated re-writing of Indian prehistory associated with the Hindutva movement. The WP reader might be better served, however, if this material was in <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindutva.html" title="Hindutva">Hindutva</a>; if not, this article should be a spin-off of <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindutva.html" title="Hindutva">Hindutva</a> in accordance with <a href="../../../s/u/m/WP%7ESUMMARY_66b7.html" title="WP:SUMMARY">WP:SUMMARY</a>. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 03:45, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

The collocation is a straightforward title, and it is nitpicking to allege that the "term" doesn't exist when ample evidence has been presented that Hindutva propaganda is classified as pseudoscience. This is a mere matter of choosing a concise title. An obsessively correct title would be <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudo-scientific_currents_in_Hindutva_propaganda_ee8b.html" title="Pseudo-scientific currents in Hindutva propaganda">pseudo-scientific currents in Hindutva propaganda</a>, and we can yet move things there, but without the bad faith attacks on the article as such, this wouldn't even be an issue. Of course the article takes a "pov" opposed to the pseudoscientific literature.

It is "cultural relativism" or "political correctness" gone terribly wrong to assume that Indian pseudoscience should be treated less rigorously because, after all, "it is cultural" (viz., because you think the poor Indians don't know any better: they do, but they have their cranks and madmen just like people do in the west). <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(𒁳)</a></small> 13:07, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It can probably be merged into <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prague.html" title="Prague">Prague</a>, although there currently isn't a section about the red light in that article.

<dd><i>P.S. - If the article is sufficiently expanded (looks like it'll need a helluva lot of work, though), it probably could stand on its own, with just a blue link in the Prague article.

<li>Weak <b>keep</b>. In fact it is not a red light district but a street (with some prostitutes around in the night but basically a normal street in the centre of Prague). Its official name is Perlová ulice (Pearl Street) but the name Perlovka is used as the shortened version colloquially. You can <a href="http://www.mapy.cz/?query=praha%20perlov%C3%A1&amp;portWidth=713&amp;portHeight=495&amp;zoom=16&amp;mapType=base&amp;centerX=133074208&amp;centerY=135938192#" class="external text" title="http://www.mapy.cz/?query=praha%20perlov%C3%A1&amp;portWidth=713&amp;portHeight=495&amp;zoom=16&amp;mapType=base&amp;centerX=133074208&amp;centerY=135938192#" rel="nofollow">see it on the map</a>.

<dd>Really? In all official sources, maps etc. I've ever seen, the street is cited as Perlová ulice, and the <a href="../../../t/i/t/WP%7ETITLE_d4b7.html" title="WP:TITLE">naming conventions</a> are clear. "Perlovka" is only Prague colloquialism (something like <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurf%C3%BCrstendamm.html" title="Kurfürstendamm">Kurfürstendamm</a> vs. Ku Damm in Berlin - we use the official name and Ku Damm is a redirect). - Regarding the notability, the street's history and architecture has been mentioned in many reliable sources, therefore I guess it can be regarded as notable enough to stay. I suspect that this anonymous editor have not seen the article because it mentions at least one notable building in the street.--<a href="../../../i/o/a/User%7EIoannes_Pragensis_cdfc.html" title="User:Ioannes Pragensis">Ioannes Pragensis</a> 17:16, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Yes, officially it is. <a href="http://www.plzenska.com/plzen/perlova-ulice/" class="external text" title="http://www.plzenska.com/plzen/perlova-ulice/" rel="nofollow">Perlová ulice in Plzeň</a> may claim the name as well. IMHO there should be an article about the monastery and possibly the modern house and these could give a brief info about the street. Keeping not so good article about NN street (as opposed to individual structures) may encourage people to generate dozens or hundreths of such stubs. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 08:20, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. A quick Google search reveals a number of news websites reporting the production of the film, and novels that have any distribution (or are adapted for film) meet notability requirements. Both the novel article and the article on the film need sources and references, but as I say a quick Google seems to indicate a number of (English-language) possibilities, which isn't bad for a book published in Russia. This AFD nomination should be speedy closed based on the fact that no one appears to have signed the nomination, which calls into question its intentions.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The link to the manual is nice, but it's self-referential and self-produced and doesn't establish notability.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> That's true, but bear in mind that <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is a guideline, not a policy, and I think we all know that this game <i>would</i> have been the subject of multiple non-trivial published references/reviews back in 1982, but not surprisingly VIC-20 magazines from that era are hard to find <i>on the Internet</i>. This is clearly a mass-market game (it was released in Australia as well as the UK and US), and the information in the article is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> at least. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 03:03, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. There are plenty of things which happened before the advent of the Internet which are well-referenced. The reason? They're truly notable, unlike the subject of this article. An aggressive marketing campaign with widespread distribution is not a criteria of notability. The difference between a policy and a guideline is that a guideline has room for "occasional exceptions" -- not classes of exceptions, which you're apparently prepared to allow -- and a policy doesn't. -- <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">Mikeblas</a> 03:32, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - a video game that achieves widespread release should generally have its own article, at least if it had any reviews in mainstream computer/video game magazines of that era. <tt><a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrotalus_horridus_5cc6.html" title="User:Crotalus horridus">Crotalus horridus</a> <small>(<a href="../../../c/r/o/User_talk%7ECrotalus_horridus_e0ed.html" title="User talk:Crotalus horridus">TALK</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crotalus_horridus_e95d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crotalus horridus">CONTRIBS</a>)</small></tt> 18:47, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose</b> - Made national news in US and Western Europe, you can find articles in CNN.com, she was discussed on <i><a href="../../../a/n/d/Anderson_Cooper_360%C2%B0_d3d1.html" title="Anderson Cooper 360°">Anderson Cooper 360°</a></i>, etc. Notability established as far as I am concerned. <a href="../../../h/e/k/User%7EHektor_6d63.html" title="User:Hektor">Hektor</a> 12:44, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Agree with Hektor on this. The subject of the article was the subject of news stories on two continents, many newspapers, at least one very notable magazine, television news shows, etc. Just because the other two women don't have articles isn't a reason to delete this one. Wikipedia isn't finished, we're still writing articles. To use that as an argument isn't logical. <span style="font-family:monospace;"><a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDismas_8600.html" title="User:Dismas">Dismas</a></span>|<a href="../../../d/i/s/User_talk%7EDismas_5419.html" title="User talk:Dismas"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 12:51, 26 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Furthermore, if you want to delete this article because the subject is only notable, according to you because of "the only thing that has ever really been subject of external attention", then please go ahead and put the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monica_Lewinsky_f914.html" title="Monica Lewinsky">Monica Lewinsky</a> article up for deletion. She's only notable for one event. Everything after that was as a direct consequence of that one session of oral sex. You can also nominate <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shawn_Hornbeck_acad.html" title="Shawn Hornbeck">Shawn Hornbeck</a> since the only thing that he's notable for is being abducted, sodomized, and then found. The fact is that these people made the (inter)national news and are therefore notable. I don't mean to sound like I'm ranting...

<li>Definately <b>Keep</b>. This "event" garnered international attention.

<li><b>Keep</b>: plenty of press about this, to me that satisfies notability. Someone doesn't have to have 'continuing notability' to be in Wikipedia; lots of people are famous or infamous for one single action.

<li><b>Keep</b>: I would be extremely interested in an explanation of how being on the cover of a major international magazine with a circulation of millions, being the subject of commentary nationwide and on the national newswires, and being forced to resign from the military under fire can in any way imaginable be described as a "minor incident in the subject's life." <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 18:05, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is a gargantuan (190 kb) set of tables for conjugating verbs in Bulgarian. We have many excellent articles on languages here, and they all contain similar tables. But those articles provide a mix of different things - historical analysis, phonology, grammar, etc. The problem here, is that it is almost all tables. Something like this is better suited for Wikibooks, or Wikiversity. I just do not see how this is appropriate for an encyclopedia. And it doesn't help that most of it is in Cyrillic, as the average English speaking Joe or Jane will just see a mass of gibberish.</p>
<p>Someone has put a ton of work into it, so I don't want to see it deleted altogether, but it really needs to be completely migrated off. If anyone sees anything else at all like this in other languages, feel free to apend this AfD. Ultimately, though, <b>Delete</b>, for the record. --Jeffrey O.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It may be that Bulgarian requires a much larger article than <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_conjugation.html" title="Latin conjugation">Latin conjugation</a> or <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_declension.html" title="Latin declension">Latin declension</a>, but we also have those articles, which are also heavy on material presented in tables. Neither the relative familiarity of Latin over Bulgarian, or the fact that Bulgarian is written in Cyrillic, are really very convincing arguments to delete this. I cheerfully agree that the article could use more analysis, which might lead to making some of the tables redundant, if they are generated by regular sound changes; but someone who knows more about Bulgarian should make those edits. (My old Americana contains several Latin tables, but no Bulgarian ones, but that's no excuse for <i>us</i> not having this. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 13:55, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Smerdis of Tlön. I don't know a great deal about Bulgarian but I do know it has an extremely complex verb system - therefore a long page is inevitable (this is a legitimate case of <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">ignore all rules</a> as far as article length goes). The Cyrillic argument doesn't hold water either (maybe you want a transliterated version alongside the original?). --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 14:28, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The length of the article is owed to the complexity of the matter. I think a transliteration will only unnecessarily blow up the article. Instead, an introduction in English would probably be helpful. --<a href="../../../g/f/l/User%7EGFlohr_d372.html" title="User:GFlohr">GFlohr</a> 18:25, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Conjugation is a complex and lengthy thing in several modern languages. I have two books whose sole purpose is to give tables of conjugations for <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_verbs.html" title="French verbs">French verbs</a>. The first has 90 tables. The second has 115. Our <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_conjugation.html" title="French conjugation">French conjugation</a> article is significantly less than comprehensive. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:08, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I do not speak Bulgarian but I believe it is of interest to keep this article. The size argument shouldn't be used as a reason for deletion. I have proposed an article split for the same reason, although it has not reach a consensus... <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisco_Valverde_0ec9.html" title="User:Francisco Valverde">Francisco Valverde</a> 14:26, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't know what additional analysis the article needs but I accept suggestions. I see that <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_conjugation.html" title="Spanish conjugation">Spanish conjugation</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_conjugation.html" title="German conjugation">German conjugation</a> have no additional notes (They have fewer tables but what can I say? Bulgarian definitely needs more), <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_conjugation.html" title="French conjugation">French conjugation</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portuguese_verb_conjugation.html" title="Portuguese verb conjugation">Portuguese verb conjugation</a> have very little and <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_conjugations.html" title="Latin conjugations">Latin conjugations</a> has a lot but it explains when to use the tenses - something I have done in <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgarian_verbs.html" title="Bulgarian verbs">Bulgarian verbs</a>. It is true that some of the tables are nearly identical. If it is better to write that the verb X has almost the same conjugation as the verb Y, but its Z form is different, I'll do it.</li>

<p>Here's how I explained the conjugation in the main article <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgarian_grammar.html" title="Bulgarian grammar">Bulgarian grammar</a> before I decided to make the article similar to the German and Spanish ones:</p>
<p><b>Present Tense</b></p>
<p>Verbs form the present tense according to their conjugation. They take the following personal endings:</p>
<table class="wikitable">
<tr>
<th colspan="5">Personal endings</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th rowspan="2">Person</th>
<th colspan="2">1st and 2nd
<p>conjugation</p>
</th>
<th colspan="2">3rd
<p>conjuation</p>
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Singular</th>
<th>Plural</th>
<th>Singular</th>
<th>Plural</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>1st</th>
<td>-а/я</td>
<td>-м</td>
<td>-м</td>
<td>-ме</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>2nd</th>
<td>-ш</td>
<td>-те</td>
<td>-ш</td>
<td>-те</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>3rd</th>
<td>-</td>
<td>-ат/ят</td>
<td>-</td>
<td>-т</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>These endings are placed directly after the form of the verb in third person singular (that is why it has no ending - it just ends in <b>e</b>, <b>и</b>, <b>а</b> or <b>я</b>), except for -<b>а</b>, -<b>я</b>, -<b>ат</b> and -<b>ят</b>. Before these endings are added, the final <b>е</b>/<b>и</b> is removed.</p>
<p>First conjugation verbs which in third person singular end in:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <a href="../../../v/o/w/Vowel.html" title="Vowel">vowel</a> + <b>е</b> or in -<b>пе</b> (also including <i>дремя</i>, <i>скубя</i> and their <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognate.html" title="Cognate">cognates</a>) take the endings -<b>я</b> and -<b>ят</b> (игр<b>ае</b> - игр<b>ая</b>/игр<b>аят</b>, къп<b>я</b>/къп<b>ят</b>, скубе - скуб<b>я</b>/скуб<b>ят</b>) - I type;</li>
<li>a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consonant.html" title="Consonant">consonant</a> (different from <b>п</b>) + <b>е</b> take the endings -<b>а</b> and -<b>ат</b> (изпле<b>те</b> - изпле<b>та</b>/изпле<b>тат</b> - II type;</li>
<li>-<b>чѐ</b> (notice that the final <a href="../../../s/y/l/Syllable.html" title="Syllable">syllable</a> is stressed) take the endings -<b>а</b> and -<b>ат</b> and in first person singular and third person plural they change the <b>ч</b> into <b>к</b> — ре<i><b>чѐ</b></i> - ре<b><i>к</i>а̀</b>/ре<b><i>к</i>а̀т</b> - III type;</li>
</ul>
<p>Second conjugation verbs that in third person singular end in:</p>
<ul>
<li>-<b>жи</b>, -<b>чи</b> or -<b>ши</b> take the endings -<b>а</b> and -<b>ат</b> (кръ<b>жи</b> - кръ<b>жа</b>/кръ<b>жат</b>, мъл<b>чи</b> - мъл<b>ча</b>/мъл<b>чат</b>, гре<b>ши</b> - гре<b>ша</b>/гре<b>шат</b>) - IV type;</li>
<li>anything else take the endings -<b>я</b> and -<b>ят</b> (види - вид<b>я</b>/вид<b>ят</b>) - V type</li>
</ul>
<p>VI type verbs are all the verbs or the third conjugation.</p>
<p><b>Past Imperfect Tense</b></p>
<p>In order to conjugate a verb in this tense, one has to know the verb's past imperfect basis, to which the following personal endings are added (they are the same for all conjugations):</p>
<table class="wikitable">
<tr>
<th colspan="3">Personal endings
<p>Past Imperfect Tense</p>
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th rowspan="2">Person</th>
<th colspan="2">Number</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Singular</th>
<th>Plural</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>First</th>
<td>-х</td>
<td>-хме</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Second</th>
<td>-ше</td>
<td>-хте</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Third</th>
<td>-ше</td>
<td>-ха</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The basis is formed from the determiner of the verb's conjugation (its third person singular form in the present simple tense). Here are the rules for forming the basis (there are also a very few irregular verbs):</p>
<ul>
<li>Verbs of the first and second conjugation:
<ul>
<li>the stress of the conjugation determiner falls on the last syllable (or the verb is monosyllabic) — these verbs change the final <b>е</b>/<b>и</b> into <b>я</b> (плета̀ - плет<b>ѐ</b> - плет<b>я̀</b>+<b>х</b>, твърдя̀ - твръд<b>ѝ</b> - твърд<b>я̀</b>+<b>х</b>, спя - сп<b>и</b> - сп<b>я</b>+<b>х</b>) - I type;</li>
<li>the stress of the conjutation determiner falls on the last syllable and the letter preceding the final <b>е</b>/<b>и</b> is <b>ж</b>, <b>ч</b> or <b>ш</b> — the final <b>е</b>/<b>и</b> changes into <b>а</b> (пека̀ - пе<b>чѐ</b> -пе<b>ча̀</b>+<b>х</b>, троша̀ - тро<b>шѝ</b> - тро<b>ша̀</b>+<b>х</b>) - II type;</li>
<li>the stress of the conjugation determiner doesn't fall on the last syllable - the final <b>e</b>/<b>и</b> changes into <b>e</b>, which means that the basis of some first conjugation verbs coincides with their determiner (игра̀я - игр<b>а̀е</b> - игр<b>а̀е</b>+<b>х</b>, ва̀рдя - в<b>а̀</b>рд<b>и</b> - ва̀рд<b>е</b>+<b>х</b>) - III type;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>verbs of the third conjugation - the basis always coincides with the conjugation determiner (казвам - казва - казва+<b>х</b>) - IV type.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Past aorist tense</b></p>
<p>Similarly, as in past imperfect tense, verbs have past aorist basis to which the following personal endings are added (they are the same for all conjugations):</p>
<table class="wikitable">
<tr>
<th colspan="3">Personal endings
<p>Past Aorist Tense</p>
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th rowspan="2">Person</th>
<th colspan="2">Number</th>

<tr>
<th>Singular</th>
<th>Plural</th>

<tr>
<th>First</th>
<td>-х</td>
<td>-хме</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Second</th>
<td>-</td>
<td>-хте</td>

<tr>
<th>Third</th>

<p>Rules for forming the basis:</p>
<ul>
<li>first conjugation verbs which in third person singular present tense end in:
<ul>
<li>-<b>те</b>, -<b>де</b>, -<b>се</b> or -<b>езе</b> (except <i>отида</i>, <i>ида</i>, <i>везя</i>, <i>бъда</i> and their <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognate.html" title="Cognate">cognates</a>) — these verbs change the final <b>е</b> into <b>о</b> (плета - пле<b>те</b> - пле<b>то</b>+<b>х</b>, дада - да<b>де</b> - да<b>до</b>+<b>х</b>, донеса - доне<b>се</b> - доне<b>со</b>+<b>х</b>, вляза - вл<b>езе</b> - вл<b>язо</b>+<b>х</b>), except in second and third person singular. These forms preserve the <b>е</b>. Nevertheless they still differ from the present forms in stress position - I type;</li>
<li>-<b>рече</b>, -<b>тече</b> or - <b>пече</b> — <b>че</b> changes into <b>ко</b> (река - ре<b>че</b> - ре<b>ко</b>+<b>х</b>, изтека - изте<b>че</b> - изте<b>ко</b>+х, опека - опе<b>че</b> - опе<b>ко</b>+<b>х</b>), except in second and third person singular. These forms preserve the <b>че</b>, but still differ in stress. - II type;</li>
<li>-<b>сече</b> or -<b>лече</b> — <b>ече</b> changes into <b>яко</b> (сека - с<b>ече</b> - с<b>яко</b>+<b>х</b>, облека - обл<b>ече</b> - обл<b>яко</b>+<b>х</b>) except in second and third person singular. These forms preserve the <b>ече</b>, but still differ in stress. - III type;</li>
<li>a consonant + <b>ре</b> — the final <b>е</b> changes into <b>я</b> (умра - у<b>мр<i>е</i></b> - у<b>мр<i>я</i></b>+<b>х</b>, спра - с<b>пр<i>е</i></b> - с<b>пр<i>я</i></b>+<b>х</b>) - IV type;</li>
<li>-<b>бе</b>, -<b>ве</b>, -<b>не</b>, -<b>пе</b>, -<b>оре</b> (including <i>веза</i>, <i>гриза</i> and their <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognate.html" title="Cognate">cognates</a>) — the final <b>е</b> changes into <b>а</b> (скубя - ску<b>бе</b> - ску<b>ба</b>+<b>х</b>, падна - пад<b>не</b> - пад<b>на</b>+<b>х</b>, ухапя - уха<b>пе</b> - уха<b>па</b>+<b>х</b>) - V type;</li>
<li>-<b>че</b> (different from II and III type) — <b>че</b> changes into <b>ка</b> (плача - пла<b>че</b> - пла<b>ка</b>+<b>х</b>, дъвча - дъв<b>че</b> - дъв<b>ка</b>+<b>х</b>) - VI type;</li>
<li>-<b>еже</b> (including verbs of the second conjugation ending in -<b>ежи</b>) — <b>еже</b> changes into <b>яза</b> (режа - р<b>еже</b> - р<b>яза</b>+<b>х</b>, бележа - бел<b>ежи</b> - бел<b>яза</b>+<b>х</b>) - VII type;</li>
<li>-<b>ъже</b>, -<b>рже</b> (except <i>вържа</i> and its <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognate.html" title="Cognate">cognates</a>) and -<b>риже</b> (except <i>харижа</i> and its <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognate.html" title="Cognate">cognates</a>) — <b>же</b> changes into <b>га</b> (лъжа - лъ<b>же</b> - лъ<b>га</b>+<b>х</b>, стържа - стър<b>же</b> - стър<b>га</b>+<b>х</b>, стрижа - стри<b>же</b> - стри<b>га</b>+<b>х</b>) - VIII type;</li>
<li>-<b>иже</b> (different from VIII type) and -<b>аже</b> (including <i>вържа</i>, <i>харижа</i> and their <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognate.html" title="Cognate">cognates</a>) — <b>же</b> changes into <b>за</b> (кажа - ка<b>же</b> - ка<b>за</b>+<b>х</b>, ближа - бли<b>же</b> - бли<b>за</b>+<b>х</b>) - IX type;</li>
<li>-<b>ше</b> — <b>ше</b> changes into <b>са</b> (пиша - пи<b>ше</b> - пи<b>са</b>+<b>х</b>, бърша - бър<b>ше</b> - бър<b>са</b>+<b>х</b>) - X type;</li>
<li>-<b>жее</b>, -<b>чее</b>, -<b>шее</b> — <b>ее</b> changes into <b>а</b> (възмъжея - възмъж<b>ее</b> - възмъж<b>а</b>+<b>х</b>, закопчея - закопч<b>ее</b> - закопч<b>а</b>+<b>х</b>, вършея - върш<b>ее</b> - върш<b>а</b>+<b>х</b>) - XI type;</li>

<li>-<b>ае</b> — these verbs are irregular, some of them change the <b>ае</b> into <b>а</b>, others change it into <b>ая</b> (желая - жел<b>ае</b> - жел<b>а</b>+<b>х</b>, омая - ом<b>ае</b> - ом<b>ая</b>+<b>х</b>) - XIII type;</li>
<li>-<b>ие</b> and -<b>уе</b> — the final <b>е</b> is left out (гния - гн<b>ие</b> - гн<b>и</b>+<b>х</b>, чуя - ч<b>уе</b> - ч<b>у</b>+<b>х</b>) - XIV type;</li>
<li>-<b>ере</b> — <b>ере</b> changes into <b>ра</b> (пера - п<b>ере</b> - п<b>ра</b>+<b>х</b>, разб<b>ере</b> - разб<b>ра</b>+<b>х</b>) - XV type;</li>
<li>-<b>ме</b> (except <i>дремя</i> and its <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognate.html" title="Cognate">cognates</a>) — <b>ме</b> is left out (взема - взе<b>ме</b> - взе+<b>х</b>, приема - прие<b>ме</b> - прие+<b>х</b>) - XVI type;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>second conjugation verbs: the basis of these verbs ends in <b>и</b>, <b>я</b> or <b>a</b> (only verbs that have <b>ж</b> or <b>ч</b> before the final <b>и</b> in third person singular present tense), but most of them are irregular because one can't be absolutely sure which of the three letters to use. Here are the rules:
<ul>
<li>verbs that in third person singualr present tense end in <b>ши</b> — the basis is the same as the form of the verbs in third person singular present tense (their conjugation determiner) (реша - реши - реши+<b>х</b>, довърша - довърши - довърши+<b>х</b>) - XVII type;</li>
<li>verbse whose stress doesn't fall on the last syllable (except <i>видя</i> and its <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognate.html" title="Cognate">cognates</a>) — the basis is the same as the conjugation determiner (рабо̀тя - рабо̀ти - рабòти+<b>х</b>, мѝсля - мѝсли - мѝсли+<b>х</b>) - XVIII type;</li>
<li>verbs whose stress falls on the last syllable and:
<ul>
<li>are <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transitive_verb.html" title="Transitive verb">transitive</a> — the basis coincides with the conjugation determiner but there are many exceptions (изгоря̀ - изгорѝ - изгорѝ+<b>х</b> - "to burn something", вманиача̀ - вманиачѝ - вманиачѝ+<b>х</b>, умножа̀ - умножѝ - умножѝ+<b>х</b>) - XIX type;</li>
<li>are <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intransitive_verb.html" title="Intransitive verb">intransitive</a> and:
<ul>
<li>don't have <b>ж</b> or <b>ч</b> before the final <b>и</b> in the conjugation determiner — the final <b>и</b> changes into <b>я</b> but there are many exceptions (изгоря̀ -изгор<b>ѝ</b> - изгор<b>я̀</b>+<b>х</b> - "to burn", излетя̀ - излетѝ -излет<b>я̀</b>+<b>х</b>, изкипя̀ - изкип<b>ѝ</b> - изкип<b>я̀</b>+<b>х</b>) - XX type;</li>
<li>have <b>ж</b> or <b>ч</b> before the final <b>и</b> in the conjugation determiner — the final <b>и</b> changes into <b>а</b> but there are also exceptions (мълча̀ - мълч<b>ѝ</b> - мълч<b>а̀</b>+<b>х</b>, лежа̀ - леж<b>ѝ</b> - леж<b>а̀</b>+<b>х</b>) - XXI type;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>verbs that in third person singular present tense end in <b>ои</b> (except <i>стоя</i> and its <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognate.html" title="Cognate">cognates</a>) — the basis coincides with the conjugation determiner (напоя - напои - напои+<b>х</b>, броя - брои - брои+<b>х</b>) - XXII type;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>third conjugation verbs — the basis always coincides with the conjugation determiner (ядосам - ядоса - ядоса+<b>х</b>) - XXIII type;</li>
</ul>
<p>I have deleted most of this because I saw that in the German and Spanish articles there are no such explanations. But I preserved a small part of it in the article <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgarian_verbs.html" title="Bulgarian verbs">Bulgarian verbs</a>.</p>
<p>Note that this does not include some important verb groups and the conjugation of the participles.</p>
<p>I, personally, find the above more confusing than just tables because for example the verb <b>играя</b> in the present tense is of type I, in the Past Imperfect of type III and in the Past Aorist of type XIII. If I had explained the conjugation of the participles, it would have been of some other type. In the tables it is just type 18.1. I wrote the tables using and correcting information (mostly dialectisms and wrong classification) from the <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bg:%D0%A3%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%87%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA:%D0%91%D1%8A%D0%BB%D0%B3%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8/%D0%A2%D0%B8%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5_%D0%B4%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%B8#.D0.93.D0.BB.D0.B0.D0.B3.D0.BE.D0.BB.D0.B8" class="extiw" title="wikt:bg:Уикиречник:Български/Типове_думи">Bulgarian wiktionary</a>. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EArath_c3ee.html" title="User:Arath">Arath</a> 15:20, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I deleted this information from <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Godfather_f51f.html" title="The Godfather">The Godfather</a></i> article for these exact reasons. Now it's been split off into a completely different page. The article contains non-notable information references that other media has made to the films. So basically any time anyone says "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse." or "Take the cannoli." it's detailed in this article. This information is trivial and unencyclopedic. Because it is essentially a trivia section in disguise, it violates <a href="../../../a/v/t/WP%7EAVTRIV_0d64.html" title="WP:AVTRIV">WP:AVTRIV</a>. I understand that it provides examples of the impact <i>The Godfather</i> has had on pop culture, which is why a few references should be given as an example within the main article (such as the frequent references within <i>The Sopranos</i>), however only as <i>examples</i> not the entire collage of every "that time that show had that guy who said that quote from The Godfather". <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Filmaker_d97f.html" title="User:The Filmaker">The Filmaker</a> 14:20, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I can help you there, I think. While there's no denying that some entries really are in the nature of "some character on some TV series said 'sleep with the fishes'", many more of them are illustrations of the proposition that "The Godfather" has so entered the public consciousness (at least in the West) that now several generations of popular culture consumers are expected to know and understand references to the film -- that's pretty significant, in terms of cultural history, and difficult to characterize or document without such material at hand as data. What makes it all appear "trivial" to some is that it's in list form, and hasn't been tied together with a prose summary that explains what it all means. We've got the trees, we just need someone to describe the forest. <a href="../../../e/d/f/User%7EEdfitz_bd26.html" title="User:Edfitz">Ed Fitzgerald (unfutz)</a> 04:51, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I created the page in question, <s>but I'm not sure I have a particularly good argument to make for keeping it in terms of violation of Wikipedia policy</s>. <i>(Please see below for arguments which clearly show that the nomination itself is a violation of Wikipedia policy, and that the policy cited to justify the nomination is not in order.)</i> The argument I have made for this material in the past (when it was part of the "Godfather" article from where I spun it off) is that the contents are valuable as data points in showing the length and breadth and quality of the impact of "The Godfather" on popular culture. My druthers would be for someone to take this material, take it out of list form, and spin it into a piece of prose which describes that impact, using some, but most certainly not all, of the listings as raw material. That's not something I have time to do at the moment, nor am I necessarily capable of doing it in any case. Should the page be deleted, I suppose that when I have some time I can make an attempt at it, but it would be a shame to lose the material in the meantime (I understand that it's always available by using the page history, but I mean lose access to it for the everyday user of Wikipedia). Unlike The Filmmaker, who, in our discussions about this material on "The Godfather," before he withdrew from editing the article, expressed the opinion that the material was completely lacking in value, to the extent that he wasn't interested in keeping any of it, I think the material has value, but that's a subjective judgement, I guess. I'm not totally certain what the intent of the stated policy is, but if it's to eliminate worthless information, it would be a shame to see it used to eliminate material of value. In any event, this is the first time I've participated in a discussion like this, so I'm not sure how I should label my vote. I would prefer to keep the article, but certainly understand that policy must be maintained, and if it's in violation, and the majority doesn't see any inherent value in the information, then deleting it would seem to be the thing to do. I would still find it a shame, though, as the subject is one well worth including, even if the execution is slipshod. <a href="../../../e/d/f/User%7EEdfitz_bd26.html" title="User:Edfitz">Ed Fitzgerald (unfutz)</a> 01:55, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../a/v/t/WP%7EAVTRIV_0d64.html" title="WP:AVTRIV">WP:AVTRIV</a> doesn't apply here as it's not a trivia list in an article, it's a separate list. I don't believe it's even entirely a list of trivia either (or even in the majority a list of trivia). Statements such as "not the entire collage of every "that time that show had that guy who said that quote from The Godfather" and "seeking to capture every mention of the films" are just inaccurate. It's obvious by reading the page that that's not what it is. The film HAS had a big impact on popular (western) culture and with some tidying up and more structure this article will be a good companion to the main articles on the Godfather saga <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 172.206.217.17 (<a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.206.217.17.html" title="User talk:172.206.217.17">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_172.206.217.17_47c2.html" title="Special:Contributions/172.206.217.17">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>Of course, that's a judgment call, relying on one's definition of what is and isn't "trivial" -- an adjective expressing a definite point of view, and a value judgment. For instance, a previous editor of the <i>Godfather</i> article, who did a complete overhaul, eliminated all the so-called trivia, but chose to leave in one item about <i>The Sopranos</i> which was no more or less interesting, and no more or less informative, that any of the other listings that had been deleted. It didn't illuminate anything in particular about the cinematic influence of <i>The Godfather</i>, and yet that editor thought it was valuable enough to preserve. I am of the opinion that a sufficient amount of the current <i>Godfather in popular culture</i> page is of enough interest and has enough informative value to be kept, and should, ideally, be reconceived and revamped rather than chucked out. <a href="../../../e/d/f/User%7EEdfitz_bd26.html" title="User:Edfitz">Ed Fitzgerald (unfutz)</a> 00:42, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I would like to say one other thing, as a fairly new participant in the Wikipedia project -- if Wikipedia is going to continue to attract people to contribute to it, it has to provide certain affordances which allow new editors to get their feet wet and start getting the feel for how the whole thing works. In my case, I started out with simple copy-editing, correcting spelling, punctuation and grammar, until I felt confident enough to try something more challenging. For many people, adding an item to a "trivia" page is going to be the first thing they do as a Wikipedia contributor, and a policy of blanket elimination of these pages seems to me to be somewhat shortsighted and limited by a traditional definition of what an "encyclopedia" is. Rather than eliminating them altogether, it would seem that isolating them in separate articles would be a better idea. It keeps the main articles from growing like topsy, and yet still provides an easy entry for new Wikipedians to grow from. <a href="../../../e/d/f/User%7EEdfitz_bd26.html" title="User:Edfitz">Ed Fitzgerald (unfutz)</a> 00:42, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, we should leave out whole articles that violate a number of Wikipedia policies for the benefit of new users. Look, I'm not against new users, I believe that we are in need of new concepts on how to keep our new users informed and allow them to grow. However, that cannot be one of them. We need to allow our new users to grow, but not at the expense of the project. At least not <i>that</i> much expense. I think what the matter of the issue is whether this information is trivial or not. As you just correctly stated, it's subjective and a judgment call. I believe that is why we have Afds. So that a number of users can come together and make their judgment calls as to whether this information is subjective. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Filmaker_d97f.html" title="User:The Filmaker">The Filmaker</a> 00:48, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ah! The <i><a href="../../../r/e/d/Reductio_ad_absurdum.html" title="Reductio ad absurdum">reductio ad absurdum</a></i>! — but in this case a rather weak application, I'd say. I believe if you look a little more closely, you'll note that my comment is addressed to the question of whether the policy is a wise one, given the circumstances that I posited -- my understanding was that Wikipedia was community-driven, so is it not allowed to express such a thought?. Certainly I'm concerned that perhaps the current proposal <i>might</i> not be in line with the intent of the policy -- I don't know, I haven't researched it, being somewhat more interested in editing and helping to make articles better than I am in administrative stuff (if I wanted to do that I'd've gone into politics or business) or in accumulating awards to post on my user page. And yes, certainly, discussions like this seek to arrive at a group consensus through the individual expressions of opinons, but it is also allowed, I assume, that people's opinions can be swayed, or at least in some manner influenced, but the use of various arguments -- and that, I think, is what I'm doing, trying my best to influence votes through discussion of ideas relevant to the subject. <a href="../../../e/d/f/User%7EEdfitz_bd26.html" title="User:Edfitz">Ed Fitzgerald (unfutz)</a> 01:17, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, speaking of related subjects, I do think some consideration should be given to the <b>motivation</b> behind The Filmmaker's nomination for deletion, considering that the Filmmaker and I have been disputing the style and structure of the article for many months now. It appears to me that this nomination (which I recognize is totally consistent with the arguments The Filmmaker made in those discussions) and the nomination of the main "Godfather" article for <a href="../../../c/i/n/Wikipedia%7ECinema_Collaboration_of_the_Week_006d.html" title="Wikipedia:Cinema Collaboration of the Week">Wikipedia:Cinema Collaboration of the Week</a> are, despite The Filmmaker's stated disinterest in working collabortively on the article, a continuation of that debate by other means, that having been unable to prevail via the discussion page, The Filmmaker has made moves which can, I think, be legitimately interpretated as both efforts to get back into the process by the backdoor (or at least dilute by influence on the article) and as a sort of harassement by official means. I know that doesn't speak to the legitimacy of the nomination here, but it really should be considered, I think. <a href="../../../e/d/f/User%7EEdfitz_bd26.html" title="User:Edfitz">Ed Fitzgerald (unfutz)</a> 04:32, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>You will notice that I have barely discussed anything with you up to this point. I pulled out of the discussion in the talk page because I simply have a lot of things going on at the moment and I don't have time to sit down ponder how I can articulate my thoughts to you on why you are wrong and I am right. However, I do have time to edit articles. That includes doing simple editing like nominating an article for Afd and Cinema Collaboration of the Week. I also realized that using these methods, are legitimate ways proving my theories to you. I've said before that this information should be deleted, entirely. You disagreed and fought me on it. Now I've brought you 7 editors who agree with me. I also nominated it for Cinema Collaboration because it will bring other users together. While they may not agree specifically with my beliefs. I believe, they will most likely disagree with yours. Finally, for the record, as of right now I do not plan on participating in the Cinema Collaboration if it selected. I merely support it. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Filmaker_d97f.html" title="User:The Filmaker">The Filmaker</a> 12:44, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ol>
<li>you had an argument about The Godfather article with Filmaker</li>
<li>that argument started when you objected to him deleting a section from The Godfather article that eventually became this article</li>
<li>you offered to collaborate on the Godfather article rather than conflict with Filmaker and he declined the collaboration</li>
<li>he instead decided on 23rd March (about The Godfather article) that "I am going to remove the article from my watchlist and forget about it for now" and "At this point, I'd prefer to simply finish Return of the Jedi" and that "I may come back to this article one day. However, it won't be one day soon".</li>
<li>Filmaker then put this article up for deletion 3 days later.</li>

<dd>In my opinion, essentially you're being bullied. I think this from Filmaker says it all - &gt; <i>"I also realized that using these methods, are legitimate ways proving my theories to you. I've said before that this information should be deleted, entirely. You disagreed and fought me on it. Now I've brought you 7 editors who agree with me"</i>. Basically I read that as -&gt; he doesn't agree with you, there <i>is</i> no compromise, he <i>will</i> delete your articles to prove he is right and you are wrong (not only on specifics but on a theory and a point of view) and he <i>will</i> bring his friends along to the fight to over rule you.

<li>Being new(ish), I can't speak to whether it's normal or abnormal behavior on Wikipedia, but after 22 years of being online in one form or another, it doesn't strike me as unusual behavior for <b>any</b> online community I've been involved with, bar none. (Maybe it's just me, but I don't believe so.) There's something about this form of communication, devoid of personal contact and the many visual and audible cues that provide a surprising amount of the information we use in communicating with each other, and lacking the possibility of physical confrontation or danger if we "act out" beyond normal limits, that encourages extreme responses, fixed positions and avoidance of compromise. <a href="../../../e/d/f/User%7EEdfitz_bd26.html" title="User:Edfitz">Ed Fitzgerald (unfutz)</a> 01:03, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

I declined your collaboration because I do not have time. I have time to edit, but not time to engage in such a deep discussion. I nominated this article for Afd and for Cinema Collaboration because I decided to let other users to decide. I am not editing the articles, I am not deleting the articles. I am merely asking people to help improve them. If they decide that this article should stay. Fine, maybe I was wrong. If they decide that your version of the article is better.

<li>I'm not sure what, exactly, you're responding to here. We had discussions about the <i>Godfather</i> article and failed to come to a compromise, and then when I offered my hand, you took your ball and went home -- or at least you <i>said</i> that was your intention. All of that is well within your rights, as is nominating an article for deletion -- but you do have to acknowledge that expressing disinterest in an article at one moment, and then turning around and going out of the way to upset the apple cart on the other is somewhat inconsistent. Not in your arguments -- I've already acknowledged that you're making the same argument here that you made at the time -- but in your stance towards being involved with how <i>The Godfather</i> article is shaped. I don't, for instance, see you nominating the myriad other film-related "popular culture" articles for deletion, just this particular one, which happens to be related to an article you threw up your hands about. I find that -- well, to be polite, <b>curious</b>. At best it might indicate a change of mind (but you've said here that you don't intend to get involved with editing the article if it's chosen as the collaboration of the week), and at worst it looks exactly as if you're using the nomination as a mechanism to strike back. Logically, it's possible that the article in question here can be wrong for Wikipedia <i>and</i> that your motivation for nominating it is somewhat less than pure, so I don't advance the question of motivations so much to counter your argument about the article, as to make the rest of the community (any of them interested) aware about the potential for abuse in this process. It may be that they might not wish to reward someone who uses the deletion process as a weapon of harrassment (if that's what it is) against another editor against whom they hold a grudge -- or they may not care. I suppose we'll see, at some point, although it's still vague to me who decides that a consensus has been reached. <a href="../../../e/d/f/User%7EEdfitz_bd26.html" title="User:Edfitz">Ed Fitzgerald (unfutz)</a> 04:49, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

I don't believe every single mention of a catchphrase from <i>The Godfather</i> is significant in itself. What I do continue to believe is that the material is valuable as an indication of the ongoing impact of the film on popular culture, and that it can be used as fodder for an interesting and informative article. <a href="../../../e/d/f/User%7EEdfitz_bd26.html" title="User:Edfitz">Ed Fitzgerald (unfutz)</a> 18:03, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>A few points. No one is arguing that <i>"every smallest mention of "leave the gun, take the cannoli" or what-have-you is somehow strengthening Wikipedia"</i>. If you claim that someone <i>is</i> arguing that then it's clear (to me at least) that you are putting words in the mouth of someone that has a different point of view than you in order to ridicule their argument. That's bad form. Also referring to something someone has spent some time and effort on as a "waste of space" is again bad form. A final point. I don't believe it's a given that movios are influential works of art. Some have hardly any influence at all and hardly anyone would consider them art. Only <b>some</b> movies are influential. I think most people would agree that this is one of the influential ones. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_172.206.217.17_47c2.html" title="Special:Contributions/172.206.217.17">172.206.217.17</a> (<a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.206.217.17.html" title="User talk:172.206.217.17">talk</a>) 21:27, 28 March 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

Also, did I say that all movies are influential? No, obviously. <i>The</i> movies refers to <i>The Godfather</i> series. I apologize if that wasn't clear. Now, if you're quite done, perhaps you can offer up an opinion on the article's status. <span style="font-family:verdana"><a href="../../../y/l/l/User%7EYllosubmarine_e632.html" title="User:Yllosubmarine">María</a>:</span> <small>(<a href="../../../y/l/l/User_talk%7EYllosubmarine_57e8.html" title="User talk:Yllosubmarine"><span style="color:green">habla</span></a> con<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yllosubmarine_42d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yllosubmarine"><span style="color:green">migo</span></a>)</small> 22:01, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>María, it's heartening to see that you believe it (may be<b>!</b>) bad form to refer to someone's work as a waste of space, but worrying to see that you think it may be better to refer to their work as a waste of time instead. Isn't that nearly the same bad form but with a (crude) twist? I <i>was</i> done (thank you for your interestingly phrased concern that I may not be though). As mentioned above, I've already offered a clear opinion (172.206.217.17). I have, however had a couple of additional thoughts after re-reading the Godfather articles, the discussion that caused the creation of this article and also this article. It occurs to me that this article is actually not "The Godfather films in popular culture", it's really more along the lines of "The Godfather in some forms of media - for example in films, in music, on TV". Popular culture is a lot broader than just those particular media. I wonder if the article could be a) reduced to something along the lines of "the impact of the Godfather on film", b) cleaned up to include attributable sources c) left as a separate article or (if that's not acceptable) reincluded into the original article as a section (on something along the lines of "the impact of the Godfather on film"). Just a few thoughts to kick about. Feel free to pick one of them, misrepresent it by radicalising it and then call it absurd when knocking them down.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>That's an interesting suggestion. Of course as an audio-visual work of art, it's not unusual that the primary impact of <i>The Godfather</i> would be on '<i>other</i> audio-visual forms, which is why there's a natural emphasis in the article on film and television. I do think there's more to be said about the film's impact on the popular conception of the Mafia and mobsters and how it's changed that, that could certainly be part of a broader article -- but the primary purpose of the page is to avoid larding down the main article with excessive examples of the film's impact, and provide a place where it can be dealt with in detail.</li>

<li>That's a fairly serious accusation and one that I certainly refute. I would defend myself but I'm unable to as unfortunately you've not substantiated it (which I definitely would if I were to accuse any one of the same thing). Instead I'll take it on good faith and try to tone it down, whilst at the same time requesting that you try and accurately represent points other people have made when disagreeing with them. Ed, it was just an observation that was aimed at a compromise really. I hear what you're saying in terms of not wanting to weigh down the Godfather article but you need to be practical. It looks to me like you've annoyed the wrong person and been ambushed. As a result you're going lose this article.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - per Krimpet and Filmaker. It's one thing to touch in culture impact in a prose section, it's a complete other to created an entire article that does nothing but list every instance of notation in popular culture, especially when you have no sources to back any of it up; for instance the "this scene from this film looks like this scene from The Godfather" is pure <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole"><b><span style="background:Maroon;color:Gold">&#160;BIGNOLE&#160;</span></b></a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBignole_3e96.html" title="User talk:Bignole">(Contact me)</a> 06:21, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>This nomination violates Wikpedia deletion policy</b> - I was looking over <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>, where it says "It is also inappropriate to request deletion because of an editorial dispute. Such disputes are not resolved by deleting the whole page; instead, use dispute resolution." That is the case here. The article in question was spun off from <i>The Godfather</i> <b>specifically</b> because The Filmmaker objected to it being there as a section and wanted to delete it entirely. (See his admission above in the nominating paragraph that <b>"I deleted this information from The Godfather article for these exact reasons."</b>) I wanted to keep it and have it restructured as I've described above -- however I was also aware that another objection was that the <i>Godfather</i> article was too long, hence my decision to spin off the material into the present article. (The relevant discussion between myself and The Filmmaker about the material in question took place in January and is at <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7EThe_Godfather_2e0a.html#Removal_and_restoration_of_the_.22references.22_section" title="Talk:The Godfather">Talk:The_Godfather#Removal_and_restoration_of_the_.22references.22_section</a>) That means that this nomination for deletion is <b>precisely</b> what the deletion policy forbids, a request for deletion resulting from an editorial dispute.

<dd>Lists of miscellaneous information can be useful for developing a new article, as it sets a low bar for novice contributors to add information without having to keep in mind article organization or presentation - just tack a new fact on to the list. However, as articles grow, these lists become increasingly disorganized and difficult to read. It is ideal to provide a logical grouping and ordering of facts that gives an integrated presentation providing context and smooth transitions. Furthermore, some items may add an unwanted distraction from the article, and the existence of a section for miscellaneous information may encourage the addition or re-addition of unwanted items.</dd>

<dd>It appears to me that these are <b>exactly</b> the arguments I've made: that trivia sections can provide entree for new users and that the current article needs to be reconceptualized, restructured and rendered into prose rather than deleted. The clear rationale behind the policy is not to eliminate so-called "trivia" sections, but to insure that they are adequately controlled. I can't argue with that, and I haven't attempted to do so. On the other hand, the use of this policy by The Filmmaker as a reason for deleting the article doesn't really seem to hold water: the policy most emphatically does <b>not</b> say "Thou shall not have trivia sections", it says that editors should <b>AVOID</b> them -- which is not the same thing at all. As has been pointed out by several editors, the importance of <b>The Godfather</b>, probably one of the most significant films of the second half of the 20th century, makes it something of an exception, a reason to do what should otherwise be avoided. In effect, I'm arguing that not only is The Filmmaker's nomination of this article for deletion a specific violation of Wikipedia policy, but <b>the policy he cites to justify deletion is not relevant, since it recognizes both the existence and usefulness of this kind of material</b>. <a href="../../../e/d/f/User%7EEdfitz_bd26.html" title="User:Edfitz">Ed Fitzgerald (unfutz)</a> 11:44, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Unfortunately, I have to leave soon, so I will only be able to reply to one issue until I get back. <b>This nomination DOES NOT violate Wikpedia deletion policy</b>. You cited this quote "It is also inappropriate to request deletion because of an editorial dispute. Such disputes are not resolved by deleting the whole page; instead, use dispute resolution." This quote is in reference to the situation in where I am not getting my way. There's a huge trivia section in the middle of the article, the synopsis is too long, and the article is completely formatted incorrectly in my eyes. You won't let me change. We dispute. I can't get my way, so I nominate the article for Afd on the grounds that I just stated. This is inappropriate because we do not resolve editorial disputes by simply deleting the whole page. You are to instead use dispute resolution. You (Edfitz) created a separate article all together that contained the same information. The dispute has changed. I still dispute that the information should be deleted. However, now the information centralized in one article. This is no longer a simple editorial dispute, is a dispute of the entire article. That is why I nominated it for Afd. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Filmaker_d97f.html" title="User:The Filmaker">The Filmaker</a> 14:16, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I have confidence that people can understand that a dispute about specific material when it is in article A is <b>exactly the same dispute</b> when <b>precisely the same material</b> is moved to article B, especially when it was in large part your comments about the length of the article A that provoked the material being spun off. The policy does not say "It is inappropriate to request deletion <b>of an article</b> because of an editorial dispute <b>about that article</b>," it is more general than that. It say <b>It is ... inappropriate to request deletion because of an editorial dispute.</b> There is absolutely no denying that we have been having an editorial dispute about this material that you want to be deleted.

<dd>The nomination of this article for deletion is obviously part of a previous editorial dispute but also I don't think <a href="../../../a/v/t/WP%7EAVTRIV_0d64.html" title="WP:AVTRIV">WP:AVTRIV</a> supports deleting this article. <b>This article for deletion is integrally tied into the conflict over The Godfather article</b>. Have a read of the editorial dispute on The Godfather page and read Filmaker's comments (far) above where he says he realized that it was legitimate to use this method (which I take to mean the method of deletion) to prove his theory to Ed (i.e. to prove he is wrong). In any case <b>I don't believe that <a href="../../../a/v/t/WP%7EAVTRIV_0d64.html" title="WP:AVTRIV">WP:AVTRIV</a> is actually grounds for deleting this article</b>, I've read through the discussion that framed <a href="../../../a/v/t/WP%7EAVTRIV_0d64.html" title="WP:AVTRIV">WP:AVTRIV</a> and the spirit of that discussion was that entire lists <i>should not be deleted</i> but should instead be incorporated. Even though <a href="../../../a/v/t/WP%7EAVTRIV_0d64.html" title="WP:AVTRIV">WP:AVTRIV</a> itself was only carried by a small majority, the overall majority of people who actually participated in the vote (i.e. both the yes and no's) <i>agreed that entire lists should not be deleted</i>. In addition, <a href="../../../a/v/t/WP%7EAVTRIV_0d64.html" title="WP:AVTRIV">WP:AVTRIV</a> simply doesn't say you can delete entire articles. Ed - I would personally recommend that you request a dispute resolution process as soon as possible, or at least do some reading on what your options are RE dispute resolution. Very shortly after you enquired about dispute resolution in the disagreement over the Godfather article, Filmaker stated he was no longer interested in that article, withdrew and a few days later came over here to request this article be deleted. If that's not a clear example of someone not getting their own way and instead using a deletion policy I don't know what is. Also, if you need someone to help improve this article I will happily collaborate with you. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_172.206.217.17_47c2.html" title="Special:Contributions/172.206.217.17">172.206.217.17</a> (<a href="../../../1/7/2/User_talk%7E172.206.217.17.html" title="User talk:172.206.217.17">talk</a>) 16:34, 29 March 2007 (UTC).</small>

<dd>Thanks, that would be great. One reason I haven't started on it yet (I only created the page less than a week ago) is that I've been daunted by the size of the project, since I think a necessary first step would be to firm up as many of the worthwhile entries as possible with citations (using IMDB, episode guides and so on) so that they can't be attacked as being "original research" (although clearly if they <b><i>are</i></b> "original research" by Wikipedia's definition, they must be a degenerate form of it, since they're all primarily simple observational reports: I see X and I report X; why that should be considered "original research" whereas listening to, say, a director's commentary on a DVD and writing down what's been said (or even reading a book and characterizing the author's opinions) <b><i>isn't</i></b> goes beyond my ability to comprehend).</dd>

<dd>For clarity, I'm personally not insinuating anything. In my opinion insinuation is a fairly disingenuous method of argument. I'm literally, blatantly and flat out saying that that Filmaker nominated this article to get his way and the reason I'm saying that is because he's flat out stated what his motives are already above (unless I'm misreading his statements). Note that by "getting his own way" I mean deleting a list that he doesn't believe should be present in an article and then requesting the removal of that list when it is moved to it's own article. It's totally commendable that he is honest about his motives and is prepared to stand behind his actions and opinions. I understand why the motivations behind the deletion can be regarded as irrelevant, but in this case it's completely relevant in my opinion. If one of the problems with this article is that it has unattributed claims then why not put a sticker on it like <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dune_in_popular_culture.html" title="Dune in popular culture">Dune in popular culture</a>, so it can be improved? If it doesn't adequately cite it's references then why not put a sticker on it like <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman_in_popular_culture.html" title="Superman in popular culture">Superman in popular culture</a> or <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulp_Fiction_in_Popular_Culture_3c59.html" title="Pulp Fiction in Popular Culture">Pulp Fiction in Popular Culture</a>? If it doesn't have enough information in it why not put a sticker on it like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lion_King_in_popular_culture_e765.html" title="The Lion King in popular culture">The Lion King in popular culture</a>? There are valid routes to improve an article you don't like. In this case they haven't been used and it's obvious (maybe just to me) that the reason they haven't been used is related to the original editorial conflict. I think that the article can be improved and I'll happily help with improving it.

<dd><i>Arkyan:</i> I don't think your argument makes an awful lot of sense. The Filmmaker has said that he wants this material deleted -- that's our dispute -- and when I moved it to this new article, instead of engaging in a normal editing process, or working with me collaboratively as I suggested, he took the step of making this nomination as an alternate means of getting rid of it, as he admits in the nomination itself. Suppose, for instance, that I was to merge the material back to where it was, in the <i>Godfather</i> article, the nomination for deletion would effectively be moot (since there would be no content in the article) but the <b>dispute</b> would still exist, and that's because the dispute is not about the <b><i>article</i></b> <i>per se</i>, but about the <b><i>material</i></b> wherever is should happen to reside. Your interpretation of the policy is unduly legalistic, it seems to me, and totally ignores the spirit of the rule. <a href="../../../e/d/f/User%7EEdfitz_bd26.html" title="User:Edfitz">Ed Fitzgerald (unfutz)</a> 21:11, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The point of the "rule" is that if X is a section of article Y, disagreements over whether X should be kept or deleted are not suitable to AfD discussions. However, if X is moved in to its own article, and there is a disagreement over whether X should be kept or deleted, then AfD is the place to do it.

<dd>Let's analyze that real quick. This began as an editorial dispute between the two of you over this content as it existed in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Godfather_f51f.html" title="The Godfather">The Godfather</a>. It looks like you both participated in lengthy debate on the article's talk section, which is the appropriate first step in an editorial dispute. It is evident that a resolution was not found and the debate ended in a "stalemate". Some time passed between the termination of that debate and the creation of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Godfather_films_in_popular_culture_2f2d.html" title="The Godfather films in popular culture">The Godfather films in popular culture</a>. Seems that you disengaged from the dispute, which is the proper second step in the resolution process. Good. The fact that it was nominated for deletion is clear evidence that, unfortunately, cooling down was not sufficient to end the dispute. The final step in the resolution process then becomes seeking a consensus from the Wikipedia community.</dd>

<dd>Here is the fundamental problem with your assertion that taking this to AfD is in violation of the spirit of the process. What is the <i>fundamental</i> nature of your dispute? Correct me if I am wrong but it appears to be "Either this material belongs or it does not". Since you have been unable to come to an answer between the two of you, consensus from the community must be reached. So the consensus will either be "Yes, this material belongs" or "No, this material does not belong". Since in this case "material" is equivalent to "the article" (the entire article is the material in question) you're asking for a consensus on whether "This article belongs" or "This article does not belong", and <i>that</i> is the fundamental purpose of AfD debates. So I pose a question - if AfD is not the correct place to find a consensus, then where is? <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan"><b><font color="#0000FF">A</font><font color="#1818EF">r</font><font color="#3030DF">k</font><font color="#4848CF">y</font><font color="#6060BF">a</font><font color="#7878AF">n</font></b></a> • <a href="../../../a/r/k/User_talk%7EArkyan_109e.html" title="User talk:Arkyan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 22:18, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

To get a broad understanding of the spirit Ed is referring to I had a read of the article on <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirit_of_the_law.html" title="Spirit of the law">Spirit of the law</a>, which seems to convey what (I think) he's referring to.

<dd>Arkyan, I don't think that analysis is an entirely accurate portrayal of events. I don't want to just say that without backing it up so I've detailed why I don't think it isn't below</dd>
<dd>It's not evident that the debate at The Godfather article ended in a stalemate. It ended with Filmaker withdrawing from the debate. This is the last entry from Filmaker</dd>
<dd><i>Alright, I given it some thought and I've decided to decline. I am going to remove the article from my watchlist and forget about it for now. It is not because I believe you are right and it is not because I am giving up. However, because of recent developments (especially in the last few days) in real life, I don't have the time nor the energy to argue or patiently and maturely discuss how the article should be formatted. At this point, I'd prefer to simply finish Return of the Jedi. I may come back to this article one day. However, it won't be one day soon. In other words, do what you want. I understand that your edits are in good faith, however misconceived they may be. The Filmaker 03:12, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</i></dd>
<dd>Also, some time didn't pass between the termination of that debate and the creation of this article The creation of this article is <i>02:14, 23 March 2007 (The Godfather films in popular culture)</i>. Filmakers withdrawal from The Godfather debate was an <b>hour later</b>, <i>(03:12, 23 March)</i>. It takes a while to create a new article, especially for someone fairly new to the experience so Ed must have been working on this article prior to creating it so that hour may be longer. In any case it's a fact that the article was created <b>before</b> Filmaker withdrew from the discussion</dd>
<dd>It doesn't seem that Ed disengaged from the dispute. It's clear from the logs that Filmaker did.</dd>
<dd>The fact that it was nominated for deletion doesn't only indicate that cooling down wasn't sufficient to end the debate, it indicates that deleting an article is being used in an editorial dispute.</dd>
<dd>I would disagree with the assertion that "Either this material belongs or it does not" is the fundemental nature of the dispute. After reading the original discussion I think it's more complex.</dd>
<dd>In answer to your question "if AfD is not the correct place to find a consensus, then where is?" you really only have to read <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConcensus_f3bb.html" title="Wikipedia:Concensus">Wikipedia:Concensus</a> which definitely doesn't say that consensus is reached by AfD. I would literally have to quote the entire article to point out the other places that concensus is reached so I'll just (respectfully) recommend that you (re)read the entire article 172.206.217.17 23:27, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>I'm fairly certain that The Filmaker plans to revamp that section be converting it to prose and including the most notable with citations.

My guess is that, since it somehow has to be included, it'll be in the form of an expanded Star Wars Episode IV: A_New_Hope#Cinematic_influence, but with a general "influence" heading. However, most of the cultural impact information may belong on a general article about the trilogy, like with Star Wars. — Deckiller 06:23, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</b></dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>Actually, in all honesty, no I don't plan on revamping the section. All of the notable information on the "references/reception/influence" side of the film is already present in the "Impact" section (which is already akin to the "Cinematic influence" section from A New Hope article). Which is why I deleted the "References" section outright. Because it does not benefit the article at all. Ed has repeatedly claimed that my editing is butcher-like. Yet he does not seem to have a better method for me to go about it. The "References" section needed to go. So I got rid of it. That may be POV, but he has also yet to provide a suitable reasoning as too why I am incorrect. The Filmaker 06:45, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>

</dd>
<dd>And sure enough when The Filmmaker had finished his rewrite of the article, which got posted during a couple of days when I was inactive on Wikipedia (by <b><i>you</i></b> incidentally, and not by The Filmmaker -- I asked you about that and you assured me that for some reason it was standard procedure for a third party to post a rewritten article like that, which I didn't quite understand) he had indeed deleted the entirety of the material in question, except for one solitary mention of <i>The Sopranos</i>. That turned out to be not very relevant by itself, and hardly illuminating about the influence and impact of <i>The Godfather</i>, rather, it was kept in, apparently, because you had advised that <b><i>something</i></b> should be said on the subject.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, so back then you were telling me a version of what I've been saying here, that the article should be converted to prose, weeded out, etc., while now you're telling me that it's all garbage and I should abandon ship. That's a pretty drastic turn around. Why the inconsistency?</dd>
<dd>By the way, I'm not such a huge fan of <i>The Godfather</i> that I'm jonesing for a place to dive deep deep down into fan-stuff. I think it's a great movie, and an important one, and that it has had a significant impact on our culture, and that influence should be a part of the coverage of the movie on Wikipedia. I've outlined my ideas for how the current article might be converted (they're the same as when I explained them to you and The Filmmaker back then), which would provide the coverage you (at least back at the time) seem to think was necessary. Who knows, it's possible that when the work is all down, the article will be compact enough that it can be merged back into the main article, but in the meantime it seems a but like throwing the baby out with the bathwater to delete the article, especially considering that <b><i>A) The nomination itself is a violation of Wikpedia deletion policy as an attempt to settle an editing dispute using the deletion process, and B) The policy that being put forth as the rationale for deletion doesn't say what it has been purported to say.</i></b> It doesn't say that "trivia" sections are <i>verboten</i> and must be deleted on sight, it suggests that they have value and should be handled with care. I hardly call slashing with an axe a careful way to go about dealing with the question of what to do with this material. <a href="../../../e/d/f/User%7EEdfitz_bd26.html" title="User:Edfitz">Ed Fitzgerald (unfutz)</a> 02:29, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>My opinion on popular culture changed significantly when I returned to article writing about a month and a half ago.

<dl>
<dd>Yes, becuase they are not articles as much as trivia lists. If a new precedent can be formed that turns trivia lists into a paragraph or two of sourced, general information, that might be different. For example, the article <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bushism.html" title="Bushism">Bushism</a> could be considered "Bush in popular culture", but it is not made up entirely of lists (although that list of other examples is probably unnecessary). — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">er</a></b> 03:17, 30 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>OK, so what is the Wikipedia policy that justifies the wholesale deletion of any and every "popular culture" article? Because it's sure as heck not <a href="../../../a/v/t/WP%7EAVTRIV_0d64.html" title="WP:AVTRIV">WP:AVTRIV</a>, which says in part (emphasis added):
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Avoid organizing articles as lists of isolated facts regarding the topic. [...]</dd>
<dd><u>Rationale</u></dd>
<dd><b><i>Lists of miscellaneous information can be useful for developing a new article</i></b>, as it sets a low bar for novice contributors to add information without having to keep in mind article organization or presentation - just tack a new fact on to the list. However, as articles grow, these lists become increasingly disorganized and difficult to read. It is ideal to provide a logical grouping and ordering of facts that gives an integrated presentation providing context and smooth transitions. [...]</dd>
<dd><u>Guidance</u></dd>
<dd><b><i>Whenever you see a "trivia section", take a look at each fact and consider how you might integrate it into the larger text</i></b>, whether by inserting it into a section, adding a new section, or creating a more targeted list of closely-related items, such as Cameos or Continuity errors. Creating subsections to group items in the list may be helpful in the search for an ideal presentation. Integrating these facts may require additional research to establish further context, locate suitable references to cite, or identify relationships with other facts. [...] Once a trivia section is empty, it should be removed, but where such a section is re-added with new content, the integration process should begin again.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>So, clearly, the policy does <b>not</b> say that "trivia" should be deleted, it says almost exactly what I've been saying here: clean it up, prosify it, get citations, weed out the truly uninteresting and uninformative -- that's what I've said a number of times here, and back on the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Talk%7EThe_Godfather_2e0a.html" title="Talk:The Godfather">Talk:The Godfather</a> page that I hoped and intended for this material.</dd>
<dd>There's really absolutely nothing in here that justifies deleting trivia sections. The policy expects "trivia" sections to exist, it see value in them, and recognizes that they have to be managed. It's definite not "Go thou and delete trivia" it's more "Trivia needs to be managed, so when it gets out of hand, manage it, and in the meantime it's good to avoid them when possible." That's <b>hardly</b> the same thing.</dd>
<dd>So, where is the justification? What policy are you citing as your operational guideline, that tells you that trivia must go, no matter its value. <a href="../../../e/d/f/User%7EEdfitz_bd26.html" title="User:Edfitz">Ed Fitzgerald (unfutz)</a> 03:59, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Deckiller, do you think it would be better to try to improve the article (or label it as needing improvement so other people, for example the editor, were clear it needed improving) to give it a chance to form that precedent or do you think it would be better to recommend it for deletion because (in part) you were having a disagreement with the editor that created it? 172.206.217.17 04:03, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alright, I am not going to argue the point of this nomination violation deletion policy. The simple fact is this: This material does not belong and it should be deleted. This has been explained to you by multiple editors, including myself. Second, <a href="../../../a/v/t/WP%7EAVTRIV_0d64.html" title="WP:AVTRIV">WP:AVTRIV</a> does state that trivia sections should not be deleted without regard to content. They are speaking of valuable content. This content is not (neither is any other "in pop culture" article). The best form to state the film's culture impact is the method stated by Deckiller above. This is completely off course. Third, you have accused me of harassment. What can I say? I deny it. All of my edits are in good faith. I care about <i>The Godfather</i> article. I would not have come to it if I didn't. As such I would like to bring up the article's quality. However, I can not bring up the quality, because of your disputing me. The only way to resolve is to derive the article from consensus. Hence, the Afd and the Cinema Collaboration. What I just stated for you is not harassment. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Filmaker_d97f.html" title="User:The Filmaker">The Filmaker</a> 04:03, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>So it appears to me that this has become another version of our previous discussions: I try my darndest to explain my position, I provide opportunities for compromise, I allow for the possibility that I might be wrong, I open the door for various possible contingencies -- and you never budge, you never admit to error, you never acknowledge in the smallest way the merest potential for you to be wrong, you never take a single step towards compromise, you never do any single thing at any time to promote a dialogue or offer the tiniest bit of movement in your position.</dd>
<dd>It seems to me that "consensus" isn't about stating a position, digging in your heels, and counting votes, it's about openness, the ability and desire to give and take and learn and change and grow, and I don't see that in any respect in this conversation, nor did I in our two previous ones.</dd>
<dd>Here's my idea of consensus. In Imperial Germany in 1896, Admiral Tirpitz has to draft a bill which will provide for Germany for the first time to have a fleet of battleships:
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>[Tirpitz] brought to [his home in] the Black Forest a team of comrades and specialists from all parts of the navy, modelling it on Nelson's "Band of Brothers". Discussions were open and freewheeling; Tirpitz threw out ideas and then sat back, primus inter pares [first among equals], to listen. No idea was sacred: "Every word of the draft Bill was altered probaby a dozen times in our discussions [...]," he said. Utlimately, "we almost always came to a mutual decision."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>That can't happen between us, I'm afraid, because it takes two to tango, and we're one short. <a href="../../../e/d/f/User%7EEdfitz_bd26.html" title="User:Edfitz">Ed Fitzgerald (unfutz)</a> 04:56, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<ul>
<li>Let's look at the policy of <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">attribution</a>, which obviously holds more weight than an MoS guideline.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>It is unsourced. Per <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>: "All material in Wikipedia must be attributable to a reliable, published source", "Wikipedia:Attribution is one of Wikipedia's core content policies. Together with Wikipedia:Neutral point of view, the two determine the type and quality of material that is acceptable in articles; that is, content on Wikipedia must be attributable and written from a neutral point of view.", "Original research refers to material that is not attributable to a reliable, published source. This includes unpublished facts, arguments, ideas, statements, and neologisms; and any <b>unpublished analysis or synthesis of published material that appears to advance a position</b>. Material added to articles must be <b>directly and explicitly supported by the cited sources</b>". Again, there are no sources in this list.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Issues with original research. Material counts as original research if it:</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>introduces a <b>theory</b>, method of solution, or any other original idea;</li>
<li>defines or introduces new terms (neologisms), or provides new definitions of existing terms;</li>
<li><b>introduces an argument without citing a reliable source who has made that argument in relation to the topic of the article</b>; or</li>
<li>introduces an analysis, synthesis, explanation or interpretation of published facts, opinions, or arguments that advances a point that cannot be attributed to a reliable source who has published the material in relation to the topic of the article.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>(Usually, this is less strict with plot summaries, but this is not a plot summary we're dealing with)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Examples:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"In Pokémon Fire Red and Leaf Green at Nugget Bridge, a Team Rocket member "makes an offer" that the player "can't refuse." How do we know it's a reference to the Godfather, especially with the English-Japanese translation issues?</li>
<li>"The assault on Corleone's life is imitated in a nightmare Hugh Grant has in the movie Mickey Blue Eyes." How do we know? Again, have movie critics or people cited this as a direct imitation? Are there quotes in the movie saying the nightmare reminded the characters of the Godfather?</li>
<li>"In the film Natural Born Killers, the insane warden (played by Tommy Lee Jones) is named McCluskey." again, have outside sources named this an obvious comparison?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>We have to be very careful with the way we present information like this. Saying things are homages and whatnot is not our job unless another source says so (a few cases hare and there are fine, as long as they are obvious. if the entire article is like this, then there's a problem.) For example, a site analyzing Godfather in popular culture will be good for Wikipedia to source in a sentence stating that the films have an obvious reference to popular culture. If we just cut and paste references from that site, it's redundant and excessive. On the other hand, if we just list all the times we can remember seeing a godfather reference, it's borderline original research, a policy violation (not a mere guideline violation). There are the reasons why practically every single trivia list has been deleted before. Plot summaries are usually the only thing that doesn't need to be attributed to a source outside the original work.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>And now, for <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"Article information cannot possibly be attributed to reliable sources" (a lot of this information is not-so-obvious comparisons, which are not referenced by critics and reliable sources as being homages or allusions)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>From <a href="../../../a/v/t/WP%7EAVTRIV_0d64.html" title="WP:AVTRIV">WP:AVTRIV</a>:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"Keep in mind, however, that "trivia" content is <b>not exempt from our rules and style guidelines</b>.

</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Again, a paragraph of popular influence can probably be kept and integrated into the influence section of the main article; however, it will be so far removed from this that it won't be a merge; thus, edit history does not need to be preserved. I'm sure you can find reliable secondary sources that give a few key (not minor) examples of the Godfather in popular culture. Key as in a major influence, not mere one-liner throwbacks (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> an <i>indiscriminate</i> collection of information). However, the most concrete of those will probably only lead to a single paragraph of information (as aforementioned), or to a single source that should just be referenced or linked to from the main page to avoid redundancy and copyright violation (again, as aforementioned). — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">er</a></b> 05:04, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Good of you to decide in advance that a paragraph is all that's needed. Here's what I think is a better idea, rather than starting from what we want to write and going out to look for something to support that, why don't we instead take all these great <b>data</b> we have, work through it, eliminate the truly trivial or uninteresting, look for citations for as much of it as we can, and then <b>examine what's left and see what it has to say about the impact of <i>The Godfather</i> on popular culture? Maybe it's my limited background in science, but that seems a better strategy than deciding in advance what's going to be the final result.</b></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>As for the "reliable source" thing, I have to admit that this is something that seriously confounds me about the Wikipedia culture. Let's say I've just read an authoritative book on widget making in France, and I think the subject should be covered in Wikipedia. So what do I do? Well, I can't simply take gross chunks of the book out and post them, that would be a copyright violation. And yet here is this authoritative source. So I find the relevant parts of the book, I synopsis the author's (the <b>authority's</b>) conclusions, and I basically rephrase them without, hopefully, distorting them. Now, I find another book on the same subject, with a slightly different take on the subject, so I do the same thing with that book, I select, synopsize, I rewrite the ideas and then I put them together with ideas of the other authority. I put in all the citations, and there we are. As far as I can figure, this complex series of actions: reading, considering, selecting, prioritizing, synopsizing and rewriting -- not considered original research. In fact, it's the essence of what a good article wants to have.</dd>
<dd>On the other hand, if I look at a TV program, and write down what just happened, a straightforward and simple action, <b><i>that's</i></b> original research, and not allowed.</dd>
<dd>You'll excuse me, but that simply makes no sense. TV shows, films, CDs and so on are artificats that exist, they're self-authenticating, and self-authoritative. If anyone wants to follow up on what somebody posted about the Infamous Cannolli Incident in Brian de Palma's "Dead Dog on my Trousers", you don't need a critic to tell you that it happened <b><i>the source is the film itself</i></b>. Just as if I want to check up on those authorities on French widget making, I go to the source, the book that's been cited, if I want to check theInfamous Cannolli Incident, I go to the source, I check the DVD or VHS of the film. The critic or analyst as a middle man is totally and complete unnecessary, because what the editor is contributing is not in any rational world "research", it's simply observation and reporting.</dd>
<dd>Well, clearly anyone steeped in WikiDogma isn't going to buy this argument, so I'm really making it to sorto of amuse myself at the absurdity of some of the precepts that hold sway in this place. <a href="../../../e/d/f/User%7EEdfitz_bd26.html" title="User:Edfitz">Ed Fitzgerald (unfutz)</a> 05:39, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><i>Deckiller</i>, from what I understand, step 1 when you come across an article that is not attributed is not to request it be deleted. Instead, step 1 is to request that it be attributed. For me there is no getting away from that. In this case step 1 has been to request it be deleted and it's clear (in my mind) that the request to have it deleted is due to the previous conflict. The (good) examples you have given make it absolutely clear that the article needs to be improved (including having parts deleted). Step 1 when you come across an article that needs improving is not to request it be deleted. Instead, step 1 is to request it be improved (or start a dialogue to get it improved). <b>I suggest a compromise</b>. Give the article some time (choose your own timescale) to be attributed and improved, both of which are actions that should have been allowed and encouraged in the first place. <i>Ed</i>, I also (with the best intentions) suggest some deep, calming breaths.172.206.217.17 06:17, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The point is not necessarily the original research aspect (which I may have overemphasized to prove a point) or the fact that it lacks attribution as a whole, it's the fact that all that's being attributed to (or can be attributed to) is the work itself, and articles that merely cite the work itself can not stand on their own (this is basically an extrapolation of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> plot summaries). By attributing secondary sources as well, one is showing that the topic is notable for inclusion because experts and fans cite these comparisons. Wikipedia should be a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertiary_source.html" title="Tertiary source">tertiary source</a>. Again, the point is not that all material attributed to the work itself is original research, it's that if it relies exclusively on the works, then it might not be notable for inclusion. From <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>: "...to have an attributable article, a topic should be notable enough that the information about it will have been researched, checked, and evaluated through publication in independent reliable sources." Also, "topic can fail to satisfy the criteria because there are insufficient published works from reliable sources that are independent of the subject [in relation to the subject at hand; what is reliable in one topic, like a video game, may not be in another]. Without such sources, a proper encyclopedia article cannot be built at all. Such articles are usually nominated for deletion, via one of the Wikipedia deletion processes." Again, certain subtopics within an article, like plot summaries, obviously don't apply here. However, if at least a portion of this article does not adhere to these notability criteria, then the article's inclusion on Wikipedia is often questioned. And that is the case with "in popular culture" articles.</p>
<p>Let's put it in another perspective. An article just describing a character's plot role in a video game violates <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and will most likely lead to deletion or merge unless or until work is done. However, if that article is enhanced to include sections on how the character was designed (using, say, interviews and editorial columns on gaming sites), merchandise the character has spawned (action figures, etc), and how the character was received by gaming critics, then it can stand on its own as an encyclopedia article. Again, that can not be said about this list of times a line from the Godfather has been mentioned. Pillar one of the <a href="../../../f/i/v/Wikipedia%7EFive_pillars_e0d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Five pillars">five pillars</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/c/WP%7EENC_e8ee.html" title="WP:ENC">WP:ENC</a> help stress the purpose of Wikipedia as not involving collections like this. The reason many people are voting delete here is becuase we've been here many times in the past, and those situations have almost always resulted in deletion because nobody mentioned ways to turn it into a full article. Also, dogma is not formed by consensus; Wikipedia policy is. And because Wikipedia policy is built by consensus, that consensus can be changed. Just look at <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_Poll_410f.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution/Poll">Wikipedia:Attribution/Poll</a> for an example. — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">er</a></b> 06:26, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Would you really characterize 9 "delete" opinions (including the nominator) as "many", versus 2 to keep (including the page's originator, and the other one anonymous)? That's an real question, not a rhetorical one -- I have no idea how these debates go and whether this amount of turnout is a lot or a little.</dd>
<dd>In any event, I've made my arguments, I rather doubt I'm going to have anything new or interesting to say on this subject, but we'll see. The <b>compromise</b> suggested by my anonymous supporter would certainly work for me. It happens that in the real world I'm between projects for a few weeks, which means I might well have time to run through the article and start culling the herd a bit, maybe even organizing it a little tighter. (I still find the prospect of starting the research to find citations daunting.) I wouldn't object to some of the tags that have been suggested as well (although I'm not a big fan of tags in general -- I think they tend to litter up the place). I'm not an absolutist (anymore), I'm a pragmatist, and I'd rather half a loaf than no gravy for the mashed potatoes. <a href="../../../e/d/f/User%7EEdfitz_bd26.html" title="User:Edfitz">Ed Fitzgerald (unfutz)</a> 06:54, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, it is undeniable that The Godfather series of films have had a profound impact in popular culture, and many films reference to it. There is no other film that has influenced other films, or tv shows than this one, so listing some would create an incomplete list and listing them all in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Godfather_f51f.html" title="The Godfather">The Godfather</a> article would make the page to big in kBytes.

<li>In terms of popularity, I can't deny that the film had a profound impact. However, in the way of cinematic influence I would think that the <i>Star Wars</i> films have had much more impact than <i>The Godfather</i> (that's not a judgment of quality, that's in terms of impact). You have yet to explain exactly <i>why</i> we need a list of every little reference made to <i>The Godfather</i>.

Instead, this subject should be noted in useful prose on the film's main article how and why the Godfather films have made such an impact on popular culture. This list is extraneous detail that does not provide any actual understanding of the impact.

<li>It would be interesting to know how many of the contributors here who have advised a deletion do so for broadly philosophical reasons - i.e. a belief that all "trivia" should be excised - and how many do so based on the specific content of the article in question. Clearly, the content can be restructured and reconceived (along the lines that I've indicated several times above), to bring it more in line with Wikipedia's ideals. This new framework will, inherently, also provide more substantiveness and reduce the perception of the material as "trivial", but I wonder if that would make any difference to those ideologically opposed to the material? <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Fitzgerald_498b.html" title="User:Ed Fitzgerald">Ed Fitzgerald</a> 19:53, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The nominator didn't bring it up, but if anyone doubts notability, the Waldorf system itself is shown to be notable in the main article <a href="../../../w/a/l/Waldorf_education.html" title="Waldorf education">Waldorf education</a> (see the second paragraph and the quotes in Footnotes 9 and 11). Since it's notable, expanding and seems to be at least somewhat influential, it seems to me it would be good to keep a list that can help people find out more about it, especially in their own corner of the world. Knowing even the name of a particular school would help in Internet searches or off-line research. We should be helping people with a serious interest in a serious subject, which is another way of saying that if ever a list was encyclopedic, it's this one. The question over whether to delete the list is separate from whether or not the schools on it are themselves notable. If some consensus of editors thinks creating Waldorf school articles should be discouraged, they can decide to remove the redlinks. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 19:47, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - Waldorf educations contain an encyclopaedic subset of schools, and I don't see why there shouldn't be a list of them in an encyclopaedia. The list is poorly structured and undeveloped at the moment, but if you browse through it you will see there is the basis for a valid list of articles. That red links encourage blue links is true, but it is wrong to think that the creation of articles is inherently bad - each article linked from the list should be considered on its merits.

See <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories%2C_lists%2C_and_series_boxes_edc0.html" title="Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and series boxes">Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and series boxes</a> for a rather clear explanation of the synergistic interaction of lists and categories; they are not mutually exclusive. As usual, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is being used as an excuse to mean "anything I have arbitrarily decided does not belong on Wikipedia, but won't offer a valid reason". The concern that red links "may encourage people to make non-notable school articles" is just as ludicrous as the fear that they might lead to mixed dancing. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 04:33, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I believe the concern about the red links being changed into individual, non-notable school articles is worthwhile. Calling it ludicrous without giving arguments why you think it's ludicrous doesn't help any. <a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGuroadrunner_7eb9.html" title="User:Guroadrunner">Guroadrunner</a> 13:56, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply:</b> Sorry for not elaborating in further detail why the existence of red links as a reason for deletion of an article is "ludicrous". Lists are a perfectly valid option to use to describe a group of items in Wikipedia. As described in detail at <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories%2C_lists%2C_and_series_boxes_edc0.html" title="Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and series boxes">Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and series boxes</a>, one of the specific advantages of using lists is that <b>"Lists can include items for which there are yet no articles (red links)."</b> While you have a dreadful fear of non-notable articles being created, I see no valid reason to use your concern as an excuse for deletion, nor have you provided any examples of a genuine problem to demonstrate that your fears are justified. The red links might just as well be the impetus to create well-crafted articles about the many notable Waldorf Schools, to join the more than two dozen such articles already in existence. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 03:39, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

The category will serve to group the articles that currently exist.

<li><b>Delete but create category</b> such as Category:Waldorf and Steiner Schools- Waldorf and Steiner schools do exist; I do not supprt them or the philospohy behind them, but that is irrelevant. The article on <a href="../../../e/l/m/Elmfield_Rudolf_Steiner_School_9758.html" title="Elmfield Rudolf Steiner School">Elmfield Rudolf Steiner School</a> states that there are 780 schools worldwide. This is much too much for a list. Anyway lists of this kind are not a useful part of WP: an external link to an organisation's own website (which will be maintained by them) is much better. However, some such schools have articles, and should be linked by means of a category. I think that creating a category is reserved to Admins. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeterkingiron_03d3.html" title="User:Peterkingiron">Peterkingiron</a> 13:50, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> Dear Slavlin, and Andrew: With "nurture networks" we (10 professionals in the field of development cooperation) intended to assemble our well based knowledge and experience on building, maintaining and e-facilitating online networks - with close connections to the fields of e-moderation (referring to leading international experts), to communties of practice, online communication tools (and to other already described key issues by wikipedia). It was definitely not our intention to maintain a workspace, to advertise something or to nurture group activities. Online collaboration has a powerful future - and it was our intention to assemble, to link and compile the already existing experiences and facts in a better way. Wikipedia - an encyclopedia - seemed us above all to be one of the best instruments to "construct new knowledge". But you are right, we do not have enough experience in "wikifying" - and all the requested procedures to pass your quality control system. I apologise too that one of us was removing your note about deletion. For us <i>deleting everything</i> would be the logical consequence, we've understood already. Is there any possibility to get guidance by one of you to make it - and to overcome the most important obstacles so that the content can remain here? Otherwise we would only like to ask you to give some days more that we can save all the linked content properly - before you delete it. Thanks a lot in advance and kind regards from the Alps, <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulie_nadja_5cf2.html" title="User:Julie nadja">Julie nadja</a> 18:44, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I would suggest that, from what I can tell about what you have now, that this could definately be a good item for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikibooks.html" title="Wikibooks">Wikibooks</a> or <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikiversity.html" title="Wikiversity">Wikiversity</a>. These 2 sites are good resources for building guides or training programs which you intend to be freely avalible and retain no copyright over. Rather than delete this and start over, you could follow the process to have it <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transwiki.html" title="Transwiki">Transwikied</a> which would allow you to move the content over to the other spaces in full. There might even be a project going on in one of those which could use this. I would change my vote to <b>Delete and Transwiki</b> if that is what you would like to do.</dd>
<dd>As another note, when you are adding a comment, you can place : in front of the paragraph with an extra one for each indent. That will give you the indentions which let you see follow a good train of discussion. Also, it is a good idea on a voting page to put '''Comment''' at the front of your message, as I did for you above, if you aren't voting. <a href="../../../s/l/a/User%7ESlavlin_78b5.html" title="User:Slavlin">Slavlin</a> 21:05, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The page for "Shakir husain" seems to be a vanity entry on Wikipedia. There are no references or links, and no evidence to support any of the claims is offered. Whilst google produces a number of links to 'Shakir Husain', who may or may not be the person represented on the current entry for that name, this article is currently unencyclopaedic and as such I am suggesting that it be considered for deletion. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_globetrotter_9893.html" title="User:The globetrotter">The globetrotter</a> 15:44, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Someone has made individual articles for each episode of season 1 for the television show <a href="../../../8/_/s/8_Simple_Rules_97af.html" title="8 Simple Rules">8 Simple Rules</a>. However, the information contained in each is a duplicate of information already found at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_8_Simple_Rules_episodes_b97a.html" title="List of 8 Simple Rules episodes">List of 8 Simple Rules episodes</a>. For example, the same information at <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wall_of_Shame_%288_Simple_Rules_episode%29_0787.html" title="Wall of Shame (8 Simple Rules episode)">Wall of Shame (8 Simple Rules episode)</a> is also inside the aforementioned list (see the listing for the second episode).</p>
<p>I am proposing that all of the individual articles are deleted because the information is already neatly found on the list of episodes. I will handle the individual AFDs (or prods&#160;?) for all if a "delete" consensus is reached. -- <a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGuroadrunner_7eb9.html" title="User:Guroadrunner">Guroadrunner</a> 15:52, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Project complete</b> - I have gone ahead and redirected all of the season 1 articles to their main home.

<li>The nominator failed to submit a reason for deletion, but I will. This is apparently a proposed television series which has not yet been picked up by a television network. As such, it should be considered non-notable until either it receives significant public attention from independent sources, or gets selected for broadcast, in which case it will probably receive significant public attention from independent sources. The article is self-contradictory about whether the program is still in development or has been abandoned, but in any event we can wait until later to create this article, if indeed this series will ever merit an encyclopedia article of its own. <b>Delete</b>. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 02:23, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

The thing could use some more context and/or be transformed into Arnold_Schwarzenegger's bodybuilding career but I don't really see how this can be considered indiscriminate information. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 22:36, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>But notability of what exactly? The competitions? Obviously, <a href="../../../m/r/_/Mr_Olympia_7aab.html" title="Mr Olympia">Mr Olympia</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universe_Championships_befe.html" title="Universe Championships">Mr Universe</a> are certainly very very notable. Don't know about Mr Europe but I'd give it the benefit of the doubt. Schwarzie himself is of course notable and his bodybuilding was a significant part of his life.

<dd>The article asserts that Schwarzenegger's mere participation in the events makes the events notable. The asserted notability is the intersection of the event and the person. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 12:08, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The events themselves are undoubtedly notable. The article lists those events in which Schwarzenegger, one of the most successful bodybuilders of his time, took part. What could be wrong with that? <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 12:19, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hmmm... Is <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Schwarzenegger_filmography_7e2e.html" title="Arnold Schwarzenegger filmography">Arnold Schwarzenegger filmography</a> a similarly meaningless intersection?

<dd>Well of course the existence of one article has no bearing on the existence of another, so the question is invalid on its face. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 14:13, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hardly. In this case, the parallel is too obvious to ignore. Before invoking <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS</a> to avoid answering the question, you should give it a moment's thought. The reason why we have <a href="../../../f/i/l/Category%7EFilmographies_5bd8.html" title="Category:Filmographies">a lot of filmographies</a> is that these are usually interesting, verifiable, sourceable content which is too bulky to include in main articles. It seems like a decent solution then to create a separate subarticle and I still fail to see why this reasoning does not apply here. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 14:48, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Excuse me, but you're the one who's suggesting that the filmography article is justification for the bodybuilding article. You're the one implicating <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS</a>, not me. The filmography stands or falls on its own and the bodybuilding article stands or falls on its own. I've offered my reasons for why I believe this article should be deleted. The intersection of "bodybuilding competition" and "featuring A.S." is not notable. If you disagree, that's fine. But if your only response to that is to point at the filmography article then that shows a pretty weak case for keeping. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 16:26, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Arbitrary unindent. Ok then, perhaps you can explain what "non-notable intersection" means. The fact is that the bodybuilding career of Schwarzenegger is something that has been written about extensively, in multiple reliable third-party sources. Would you be so adamant to delete this article if it was called "Bodybuilding career of Arnold Schwarzenegger" (which is really what this page is meant to be)? If so, then a simple move will do. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 16:44, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Although the article is clearly not crystalballing, it is well sourced and does not claim to state what will happen during the eighth gen, i believe that there has not been enough improvement since the last time it was deleted, which can be found <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_History_of_video_game_consoles_%28eighth_generation%29_2_cdf4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/History of video game consoles (eighth generation) 2">here</a>. <a href="../../../j/2E/l/User%7EJ.L.Main_6c6b.html" title="User:J.L.Main">J.L.Main</a> 19:29, 26 March 2007 (UTC)PLEASE DO NOT ACCUSE THIS ARTICLE OF CONTAINING PURE SPECULATION WITHOUT GIVING AT LEAST ONE EXAMPLE. As the person who wrote the article i would like to make the request that should the page be deleted it is protected from recreation so that no one else will take me work and create the article again.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> For all my reasons on the previous nomination. Also, every delete point on the 2nd nomination is still valid - the article hasn't changed at all. The name is still inappropriate (History is something which has passed, whereas we wont see this generation until some several years). Far too many things can change in what we currently have many years until we can at least expect concrete information as to whether these consoles are going to be developed, and who by. Maybe in a year or so time, we can review what information there is, and if decided there is enough solid concrete information, then under a name other than referring to it as it's history. Given this is the 3rd nomination, I would advise protection of the page until at least a year or until we have a suitable quantity of verifyable information that will mean it can't be classified as pure speculative. <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBungle44_50ba.html" title="User:Bungle44">Bungle44</a> 19:48, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> i said we should keep the last one and so it would be wrong of me to change my mind simply because i wasn't the one who created the article. The information in this is well sourced and it isn't crystal balling as it makes no claims as to what will happen. the article only says what the current plans are for the eighth generation, not what will happen. it is a fact that Shigeru Miyamoto mentioned at E3 2006 that the successor to the Wii would include high-definition capabilities and almost every other piece of information in this article is like it. it only says what the companies or representatives of the companies have said they are doing with the eighth gen. the article is not claiming that the wii 2 will be HD capable, the article is saying that Miyamoto said that it will. This is obviously an important enough artical to be included, it is not crystal balling and it isn't too early by wikipedia standards all of these; <a href="../../../2/0/1/2018_Winter_Olympics_bd0d.html" title="2018 Winter Olympics">2018 Winter Olympics</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/2/2024_Summer_Olympics_68c5.html" title="2024 Summer Olympics">2024 Summer Olympics</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/6/2066.html" title="2066">2066</a>, <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocalypse.html" title="Apocalypse">Apocalypse</a>, <a href="../../../y/e/a/Year_10%2C000_problem.html" title="Year 10,000 problem">Year 10,000 problem</a>, <a href="../../../y/e/a/Year_2038_problem.html" title="Year 2038 problem">Year 2038 problem</a>, will happen close to the end of the eighth generation are a long time after it is over. <a href="../../../j/2E/l/User%7EJ.L.Main_6c6b.html" title="User:J.L.Main">J.L.Main</a> 20:40, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not the one speculating on the pippin 2, i have sources who are doing that and there is evidence to support the claim. in concern to the names i give, your just looking for excuses to accuse the article of containing "pure speculation" anyone who was unbiased would admit that the article is saying they are commonly referred to by those names and that i'm not claiming any of them will actually have one of those names. However, i will stick something in so that people like you won't get confused. as for the PS4, the fact that it will exist has nothing to do with what it will be able to do. There is no information in the PS4 section about the PS4's abilities, the section is only about when it will be released using what Sony execs have said. none of your examples hold any water. <a href="../../../j/2E/l/User%7EJ.L.Main_6c6b.html" title="User:J.L.Main">J.L.Main</a> 18:08, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I haven't once claimed it is pure speculation; I merely pointed out some things which are to an extent speculating what will/will not happen. With this kind of article, no matter how many "sources" or "references" you have, chances are they wont be correct when the time comes. Just because a website thinks something, you are saying that is good enough to include it to backup points in an encyclopedia? If this was being professionally written, do you really think an article like this would base heavily and reliantly upon sources which likely wont even be correct when the time draws closer? Sources mean practically "nothing" with this article. As I said in the previous nomination, not even console makers know what will happen, so how can anyone/anywhere else?</dd>
<dd>Also, why are you voting to keep, yet YOU were the nominator this 3rd time around? It seems you obviously think it doesn't deserve wikipedia space as well, does it not? You either think it should be here, or you think it shouldn't; clearly, you don't seem to know which side of your bread your butter is on. <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBungle44_50ba.html" title="User:Bungle44">Bungle44</a> 18:34, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>But don't you see, the article isn't trying to say what will happen if five years. The article is about what the companies have said will happen and what other people think will happen. Its not about what the eighth gen will be, its about what the current, present tense, plans are for the generation and what is happening right now that concerns the eighth generation. if i filled the article with speculation as to what the systems of the eighth gen would be like than it would be crystal balling and even i wouldn't want the article to remain. I would like to apologize if you were offended by anything i said. I was tired but i'm a little better now. the reason i nominated the article wasn't because i thought it should be deleted but because i thought it needed to be put before my fellow wikipedians. It had already been deleted twice before and i didn't think that any one person had the right to recreate it with the consent of those who had it deleted before. <a href="../../../j/2E/l/User%7EJ.L.Main_6c6b.html" title="User:J.L.Main">J.L.Main</a> 16:51, 28 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Regardless of what the companies are saying now, not even themselves can guarantee it will be correct. Sure, they release info of their own plans, which can quite easily change as time goes by, and hence any information entered into Wikipedia could then need to be changed closer towards the time (which I guess will still be a few years yet). Information which isn't correct now will be no use to anyone when we're at this generation, and no use to anyone reading who wants to find out about it (as there is no real concrete information available, by anyone). I also stated in the previous nomination in December about the name (History of..); again, confusing readers who aren't very well knowledged in this field. The fact is, an encyclopedia is meant to inform and provide meaningful information to it's readers, particularly wikipedia, which wont be the case with this article until at least another few years. Given it's prior 2 deletions and current support for deletion pretty much supports any claim that it is very much too early. It was too early 3 months ago, and that still stands today. <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBungle44_50ba.html" title="User:Bungle44">Bungle44</a> 17:21, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm starting to get impatient with you. THE ARTICLE ISN'T ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH THE EIGHTH GENERATION!!!!! it is about what is happening with the eighth generation. happening, as in right now. the article should be named "History of" because thats what it is, it is the history of what has been suggested or announced or speculated about the eighth generation. the fact that we don't "know" what will happen is irrelevant because thats not what the article is about, it is about what has happened and what is happening in concern to the eighth gen. <a href="../../../j/2E/l/User%7EJ.L.Main_6c6b.html" title="User:J.L.Main">J.L.Main</a> 19:05, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Calm down! I was simply saying I don't think it is suitable for Wikipedia.. "yet". This is a debate, not an arguement, and I am merely debating my opinions (alas I am also not the only one to share these opionions). I understand what you're saying with regards to my comments on the History naming, but for something that hasn't even begun yet, it really can only be regarded as its history when it does. Wikipedia has a very specific purpose, and the content it provides need to ensure that is complies with this purpose. This information may be very useful on your average fan site, but you're forgetting we're talking about an encyclopedia. Information in an encyclopedia isn't published knowing that it could easily change many several amount of times before it is even likely a solid piece of information will standup. Yes, there are many articles related to documenting "current events", but this is not even yet close to becoming classified as such. I understand your fustration to an extent, and my apologies if I have been a factor of that, but try and keep it peaceful! <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBungle44_50ba.html" title="User:Bungle44">Bungle44</a> 19:43, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>did you know that many WWII books actually start with WWI and sometimes before? The authors of the books want there readers to not only understand what happened during the war but why it started, what lead up to what was Europe like right before it began. the story of your life doesn't start with your birth, it starts when your conceived, if not before. the same holds true with the eighth generation. i would say that its history actually started about six months ago if not a year ago since that is probably when people who will be working on these systems started to think about them.</dd>
<dd>i'm not forgetting that we are talking about an encyclopedia. but i think your forgetting about one of the things that makes wikipedia so special, that it can be changed. if someday something in the article ceases to be note worthy it can be removed.</dd>
<dd>and i'm not frustrated, i'm a little annoyed that i can't seem to make any headway with you, but i'm not frustrated. i was the one who instigated this, remember?&#160;:)<a href="../../../j/2E/l/User%7EJ.L.Main_6c6b.html" title="User:J.L.Main">J.L.Main</a> 02:41, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strongest Keep</b> The article is well sourced and there is no doubt that there will be an eight generation. So long as sourced articles keep referring to the next generation, the article is valid. The same applies to to the Olympic and Superbowl articles, even if these events were canceled there would still be an article on why the events were canceled. Remember notability isn't subjective, if articles in the popular press are speculating, it is now sourced information. The same goes for the next presidential election. Crystalballing by Wikipedia editors is not acceptable, but the same by Business Week and other publications is. If I guess who the next Superbowl halftime act will be it is crystalballing, but if Rolling Stone does it, its sourced and acceptable. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Arthur_Norton_%281958-_%29_421a.html" title="User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )">Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )</a> 05:55, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Firstly, it isn't "your" article; any article in Wikipedia is under the <a href="../../../g/p/l/GPL_a75a.html" title="GPL">GPL</a> and isn't owned by any particular individual. Secondly, with regards to the 7th generation article, I don't think Wikipedia was a big then as it is now, and I doubt many people were around like now to hold debates like this on a topic of this nature. I think comparing to articles made quite some time ago and questioning the way Wikipedia operated then isn't the best method of supporting what is happening now. <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBungle44_50ba.html" title="User:Bungle44">Bungle44</a> 17:27, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - This article needs some <i>serious</i> cleanup if it is to remain. While I'm not automatically opposed to an article on such a topic this early, the factual information is not attributable to the sources well enough (despite the fact that the sources are plentifully cited); original research suffuses the entire article, padding and stitching these largely disparate and isolated factoids together.</li>
<li>For instance: the article itself states, "At this time no official word has been released concerning these speculations and even if Apple does create a Pippin 2 it may not be for the Eighth Generation." This seems to be unattributable speculation, couched in weasel words. Has there been any directly attributable statement that this Apple console will continue in the Pippin line? (I would think that Apple would try and distance itself from the Pippin brand, and any negative associations with the original Pippin.) Has there been any directly attributable statement that it could be part of the same new generation as the presumed 720, PS4, and Wii successor? If not, it doesn't belong at all, and its mere mention in the "eighth generation" article is in itself original research, implying something that is not explicitly supported by the sources.</li>
<li>While statements have been made about potential new consoles, almost nothing notable has been referenced about an "eighth generation" directly (which relates somewhat my disagreement with the naming conventions for the game console history articles in general, which isn't appropriate for discussion here), nor about how or if these new consoles relate to one another in <i>any</i> generation. A Wikipedia article need to be an <i>encyclopedic</i> resource, and not merely a collection of forward-looking statements on <i>individual devices</i> accompanied with original inferences of a supposed next round in the great "console wars". This is why this situation should be considered distinct from that of articles on upcoming Olympic and Superbowl events. I am leaning toward a recommendation to delete, but am open to be convinced otherwise. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDancter_895c.html" title="User:Dancter">Dancter</a> 21:19, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>i won't say there is no OR, but i doubt there are any articles with none and i would like to mention that i didn't think the article was ready so i didn't create the page, someone copied it from my user page without my permission. since it was just an article on my userpage i wasn't being too careful to avoid original research. also, i've never considered statements of omission to be OR. i guess i can see how admitting that there is no proof the pippin 2 will be an eighth gen console is OR, but i think your pushing it a little. i don't see what you mean by "weasel words" but feel free to rewrite it if you think you can do better. in reference to my calling the console the "pippin 2," when there is no way to tell what a consoles successor will be called the simplest thing to do is stick a 2 on the predecessor's name. when the article for the wii was first created it was called the gamecube2. same idea, the article isn't say it will be called the pippin 2, its just something to refer to it as until Apple gives us something better to call it. i stuck it in with the eighth gen because there is nowhere better to put it. if you don't think it belongs in the article we can transfer it to the talk page and debate it there. if you think there is anything good in this article than please vote to keep it and them simply improve it. isn't that why your on wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/2E/l/User%7EJ.L.Main_6c6b.html" title="User:J.L.Main">J.L.Main</a> 03:03, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(At this point they are the only company to announce that they will be involved in the eighth generation.) this is a statement of fact, so far only Sony has officially stated that they will make an eighth gen console. where is the speculation in that?</dd>
<dd>(Nevertheless, no information or theories have yet surfaced concerning what Sony will do with the PS4;) this is a statement of omission. it is just saying that we have no idea what the PS4 will be capable of. again, you could classify it as OR but i think that would be rather legalistic.</dd>
<dd>(however, they have stated that it will be released after 2010.

<dd>(At this time no official word has been released concerning these speculations and even if Apple does create a Pippin 2 it may not be for the Eighth Generation.") the section on the apple pippin2 being in the eighth gen article would seem to imply that it will be an eighth gen system. this is just saying that we don't know that for certain. its a statement of omission, not speculation.</dd>
<dd>Lankybugger says, "There's hardly a confirmed fact to be found here." thats because there are almost no confirmed facts to be found on the net. information by the rules of wikipedia doesn't need to be confirmed, it just needs to be relevant and sited.<a href="../../../j/2E/l/User%7EJ.L.Main_6c6b.html" title="User:J.L.Main">J.L.Main</a> 16:40, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It doesn't matter what people are referring to the next consoles as. Until we get a development name or a released name, we can't call them anything. It'd be Microsoft's next console, Sony's next console, and Nintendo's next console. It's pretty much assumed that all the companies are going to be involved in the next generation, so that statement is pretty much filler, as is the statement that no information has been released about the PS4.</dd>
<dd>Wild speculation from one source does NOT count as a verified, reliable source. In fact, if you check the the rules on attribution, speculation by media must be clearly be labeled as such. Likewise the PS4 information is just speculation from Sony. It's not confirmed until Sony begins work on the PS4.</dd>
<dd>All in all, if you were to remove all the information which isn't confirmed or an official source, you'd have two sentences about the "upcoming" PS4. Everything else is patent speculation or a statement of omission (which is essentially worthless).

<dd>That would be a valid point "if" there was/is any legit and non-speculative valid information available to amend the article with, which could be denied as being purely something which is either writer speculation or fan site/console developer speculation. The main arguement in the last AfD was that there wasn't enough information yet available to hold this kind of article "at that moment in time", and I personally feel that still stands, otherwise you may have amended it with said sources to backup your points about its retainment. Those that vote delete isn't because they don't believe this kind of article should exist, but that it should not exist yet whilst it is too early. Sorry for intruding on your little debate here, but if you amend the article JLMain, with official, verifyable and non-speculative sources that will stand indefinately (e.g: this is console X confirmed by developer X and is in production now, here is the official press release..", then you should act quickly. If you can't provide a similar source or one that people cannot argue against, then how can this article be improved in the near future? <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBungle44_50ba.html" title="User:Bungle44">Bungle44</a> 07:21, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>REvert to much earlier version</b> This article needs to a <b>revert</b> to a version of 12 February or earlier. It then contained some genuine statements about the Islamic view of Christianity. This is a significant subject, but it was a stub and unsourced. Then some one deleted all unsourced content leaving effectively nothing. I note that one of those who has done a lot of work on it describes himself as an atheist, ans as taking a stong interst in Islam and anti-semitism. This almost looks like vandalism; a poor article has been harmed, rather than improved. This may be the result of competitive editing <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_comparative_religion.html" title="Islamic comparative religion">Islamic comparative religion</a> may have suffered a similar fate: I have not investigated.

<p>This is an artist whose work (such as it is, there is not much) is mainly self-published. There are no significant external sources in the article. According to the subject (who has edited the article) he has yet to release a single full-length album. Keep arguments at last AfD look suspiciously like WP:IHEARDOFHIM, I see no evidence that this artist meets the primary notability criterion. Even Alkivar, who has seen him perform, advocated deletion. --<b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 22:27, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Clarifications</b>: I am the subject of the article, and will thus try to stay out of this debate. Four points need clarification, in case they are not immediately obvious: (1) the Minerals release is an album by wikipedia standards. See the <a href="../../../p/r/h/Talk%7EPrhizzm_853c.html" title="Talk:Prhizzm">Talk:Prhizzm</a> page. (2) Alkivar may not be neutral in this particular debate because he and I recently fought extensively over his ill-conceived attempt to delete the <a href="../../../z/a/n/Zanta.html" title="Zanta">Zanta</a> article. (3) Seeing or not seeing someone perform is not relevant to assertions of notability on wikipedia. (4) I did not create the article and thus implied assertions of <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVanity_6666.html" title="WP:Vanity">WP:Vanity</a> are weak at best. There, now I will try to stay out of the debate.&#160;:) Thanks. <a href="../../../b/f/d/User_talk%7EBFD1_8921.html" title="User talk:BFD1"><font color="#0099FF">BFD1</font></a> 13:58, 27 March 2007 (UTC) One final clarification: I am not sure what JzG meant about my work being mainly self-published, because of the releases listed on the wikipedia page (which is more or less complete), only one release is self-published. I find JzG's remark in this context rather curious. <a href="../../../b/f/d/User_talk%7EBFD1_8921.html" title="User talk:BFD1"><font color="#0099FF">BFD1</font></a> 20:54, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>What???</b> I am disturbed that this article is up for deletion. By the standards proferred above, if wikipedia was around in 1886, a page on [Vincent Van Gogh] would have to be deleted, since he was an unknown painter and had only sold a handful of paintings when he wasn't bouncing in and out of mental institutions. I don't think wikipedia is in the business of determining who is and isn't a significant artist. The point is that it is an open process that permits far greater access to and range of information. I was listening to <a href="http://www.somafm.com" class="external text" title="http://www.somafm.com" rel="nofollow">somfm</a> today, when they played a song by prhizzm. I liked it enough to google the name and found this page. I am sure that as time goes on, prhizzm will release more work, and the wiki page for prhizzm will grow, and that is as it should be, since wikipedia is here TO GROW. Any inaccuracies in the page can be adjusted: that's why this is a communal effort - so the accuracy of a page can be sharpened by group activity. If this page is deleted, I will file a formal complaint. <a href="../../../h/w/a/User%7EHwarwick_3f0f.html" title="User:Hwarwick">Hwarwick</a> 30 Mar 2007

<p>Here we have a scientist who dissents from the mainstream view of gravitaiton and dark matter - a relativity dissident. There is precisely one external source, which discusses him along with other dissidents. There are no cited independent sources of which he is primary subject. He seems to be mildly popular with certain pseudoscience proponents and fringe bloggers, but that is about it. The subject seems to be one of the few who is well-informed on the subject, and has resorted to editing himself as user:Supergenius66. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 22:43, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I understand that you're kidding about the POV junk bin pages, but the above discussion is irrelevant to notability. The discussion is not about whether this guy impacts science nor is it a judgment on the correctness of his research. The discussion is whether the man is notable. For his bizarre brand of science he gets a fair amount of press in verifiable sources, as demonstrated above. There is certainly room for discussion about whether these sources are relevant or whether the sources reflect sufficient depth of coverage for notability but you can't toss the guy out just because he's a nutjob.

<p>This article is a good example of crystal balling. Purely just a schedule as of now, and can't be expanded much more. How about we wait until a lot later for this? I don't see why people are in such a rush to make 2008 (and even 2009) articles. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 22:48, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> This is actually the second AfD nomination for this school. The first came last summer as part of a mass deletion of about a dozen articles, and the result was "keep" It was stated then that some project was underway to create articles for schools in the same area. Obviously that didn't work out and it's been a stub for the past nine months or so. I did run across an interesting essay in that deletion debate. The essay goes into arguments both for and against deleting school articles, and its very articulate. I wish I'd seen it earlier.

<p>Reluctant nomination - this page has been a one-line content free stub for <s>two</s> three years. I don't see how it could be expanded, other than by turning it into a long indiscriminate list, since each story would presumably have its own entry. However, there's not a single folktale actually listed that I can find, and given the time elapsed, it seems unlikely that anyone's planning on adding any. Besides, even if it were kept it would probably be better as Chinese folktales, since that's the phrase actually used in the text. <font face="Trebuchet MS">- <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIridescenti_57e9.html" title="User:Iridescenti"><font color="orangered"><b>Irides</b></font><font color="darkviolet"><b>centi</b></font></a> <a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIridescenti_7b38.html" title="User talk:Iridescenti"><small><font color="chocolate"><i>(talk to me!)</i></font></small></a></font> 23:49, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is an article that needs expanding, not deleting. The subject could be developed into a useful article, such as <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_folklore.html" title="Japanese folklore">Japanese folklore</a> or <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_folklore.html" title="French folklore">French folklore</a>. <a href="../../../g/o/r/User%7EGorgeous_Ferns_e177.html" title="User:Gorgeous Ferns">Gorgeous Ferns</a> 00:16, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. However, I do see some problems:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>One I would have to ask what is the difference between folklore and folktale?</li>
<li>Secondly, how can people that know about the Chinese folklores are behind the Great firewall of China?.</li>
<li>What consitute as Chinese: for example, some folklore books include Taiwanese folklores, while some are published in Taiwan (but talks about everything before communism china) and some books even talked about mongolian story (such as the origin of horsehead violin)w hich can be problematic under current political climate.</li>
<li>When it explains the origin of some chinese custom, which should it be go to? For example, the chinese lunar festival, about the lady in the moon: should it be as its own folklore, or should it be under chinese lunar festival? There are many folklores in china that is used to explain origins, such as the "lamp riddle", and some are "unverifable history", such as the adventure of the Emperor of Chou... or even the creation of Chou.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>In anycase, there are many chinese folklores, but it can be made into a category instead. For example, the folklore that explain the origin of chinese new year; How the world is born, and how the goddess repair the sky is an example; the origin of chinese zodiac is also good ones. One example is the "Myth and Legends of China" published by Reader's Digest Asia (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 962-258-069-6</a>).

<dd>Most Russian sources are associated with Azeri, if it talks about Azeri-related topics obviously, the references added to the article are POV and inappropriate, you should help expand the article instead of going around in other articles and reverting, just a tip since alot of Azeri related articles need expansion especially off Armenian related articles. Are those Russian sources reliable? if you state them provide a explanation since its a requirement if your seeking to expand the article, which most users would do when a "important" article is on Afd. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtaxiad_296b.html" title="User:Artaxiad">Artaxiad</a> 01:38, 29 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The burden of proof is on your side, Artaxiad, it is up to you to prove that those 100% Russian sources, which generally favor the Armenian side, are somehow biased, POV, pro-Azerbaijani. And what can be pro-Azeri in mentioning some basic facts about Salatyn Askerova? By doing this you seem to subconsciously admit that you try to delete pages, articles, references that have anything good or positive about Azerbaijan and its people, even if they are about a killed young woman journalist, who left a son to grow without a mother. --<a href="../../../a/d/i/User%7EAdilBaguirov_a9ce.html" title="User:AdilBaguirov">adil</a> 05:50, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Has anyone looked at the "articles" for the other years? They are <i>lists</i> of every album, artist birth and death date for each year. Of course, it's a very selective sample, since a comprehensive list would be astronomically large. It's pretty much an IMDB of music. While I appreciate that they put a lot of work into this, perhaps the editors of this project ought to be encouraged to transfer it out of Wikipedia. It should suffice for an encyclopedia to have a timeline of music history without having a page for every year. <a href="../../../d/j/c/User%7EDjcastel_4413.html" title="User:Djcastel">Djcastel</a> 17:06, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
