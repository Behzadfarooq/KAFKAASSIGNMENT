<p>I placed a PROD tag on this article, as it doesn't appear to be a particularly important radio show. The article's original creator disagrees with the PROD, so I'm bringing the issue here to generate some discussion one way or the other. <a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoyous%21_8a6f.html" title="User:Joyous!">Joyous!</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/y/User_talk%7EJoyous%21_ed0e.html" title="User talk:Joyous!">Talk</a> 19:50, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I could go on for a while, but I'll stop it there. Those are the kind of articles I saw that led me to beleive that mine would be appropriate.

<li><b>Keep</b> College radio shows should be allowed to have pages on here if other radio shows can have them. Winthrop University is not a big school, but it is certainly NOT a D-list university. Since WINR and several other college radio stations are streaming, people might want to find out about some of the shows they can hear online.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> The entry has no academic merit and it was made solely for the purpose of marketing, to increase his web site's Google PR, and to drive traffic to his website. See the author's own admission of this at <a href="http://www.v7n.com/forums/forum-lobby/41885-utter-stupidity-wikipedia-people.html" class="external free" title="http://www.v7n.com/forums/forum-lobby/41885-utter-stupidity-wikipedia-people.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.v7n.com/forums/forum-lobby/41885-utter-stupidity-wikipedia-people.html</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I'll give you that one, to an extent. I got the idea from people talking about spamming wikipedia. But I did notice all the show pages that I mentioned earlier before I made the page. There is a very inconsistant policy regarding which radio show pages get to stay and which are deleted. A very large chunk of the radio show pages hold no academic value, and many are simply advertising for a show. The only difference is that I admited to this fact somewhere. Without that post, there would be no evidence to show that was my intent, which it wasn't 100%. So if nothing else, please use this as an example of the inconsistant editing of Wikipedia. There are tons of pages that hold no academic value and are put up simply for advertising. Please take care of them as well. In addition, the same three people who are supporting the deletion of the A &amp; J Show are the first three people who supported the deletion of this page. The AFD tag was not put on this page until I showed it to Joyous and asked why that page was appropriate and mine was not.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> and <b>Salt</b>. Wikipedia is not for attracting notability; it's also not UScollegecruft.wikipedia.org. This fails the 20-year test and, again, brings up questions of systemic bias: why have enormous articles on every tiny little insignificant part of <i>American</i> life when we don't even have significant articles on major cities in Latin America and Africa? <a href="../../../c/o/l/Col%C3%B3n%2C_Panama_9266.html" title="Colón, Panama">Colón, Panama</a>, for instance, has an article half the length of this one, and it has a population of almost a quarter of a million people. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 16:44, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Then maybe someone should go make that article more informative. It's not my fault that I wrote more. I only looked at what was deemed appropriate based on the radio show pages. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheichibun_3c80.html" title="User:Theichibun">Theichibun</a> 16:47, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Bay State Rock, Berkeley Groksand <a href="../../../e/c/o/EcoTalk_6a23.html" title="EcoTalk">EcoTalk</a> still exist with no talk of deletion.

<dd>We usually try to judge an article on its own merits in these discussions. If you don't believe the articles you've mentioned are notable enough to be included in Wikipedia, you are free to nominate them for deletion, also. <a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoyous%21_8a6f.html" title="User:Joyous!">Joyous!</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/y/User_talk%7EJoyous%21_ed0e.html" title="User talk:Joyous!">Talk</a> 23:11, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I wasn't aware of that policy. I thought only administrators and other select people could do that. And I still say that this articleis relevant and notable based on the fact that other radio shows are allowed to have a page. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheichibun_3c80.html" title="User:Theichibun">Theichibun</a> 01:15, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
