Re: notability, I have found quite a few pages that deal with items within the media (shows, etc) and works towards completing the comprehensiveness of an encyclopedia that is not limiting by "page count". This is consistent with Wikipedia projects that look to have all state legislators in Wikipedia more for comprehensiveness than for notability. Re: primary sources, almost all of the information has been either on the air, on the hosts blogs, on the station's website or on the show's website, thus, Wikipedia is not the original source.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Sorry, I seldom reply to stuff like this, but I felt the need in this case. You can see the writing on the wall, can you? And you can argue about the shortcomings of Wikipedia, and your perceived lack of guidance. How about using that energy to provide the information you've been directed to time and time again. Reference published market share charts. How about licensing documentation? You think it's notable in St. Cloud, does anyone else? Has that been established? Covered in referential media? If you feel strongly about this, then stop pointing at us and do something about it. <a href="../../../c/m/a/User%7ECMacMillan_ef05.html" title="User:CMacMillan">CMacMillan</a> 19:03, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> per CMacMillan, the best thing you can do here find some <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> that have covered this show and provide them here. Also, nobody is arguing that the article on the station should be deleted, just the show and associated biographical articles. There is pretty strong precedent that verifiable radio stations/TV stations should get an article... just not their staff and individual shows.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:08, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> Is the standard of source actually "Reference published market share charts" or "licensing documentation"? Please point me in the direction for free charts of those nature, CMacMillan, because the only ones I know of require subcription.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I see. Books aren't either, but they're referenced regularly. Let me help, then. Your station is one of 38 in your market. You are tied for 14th out of the 35 measured stations with an AQH share of 2.4, down from a Fall '05 measurement of 3.1 when you tied for 12th (Arbitron, Spring '06). Your show was not rated.

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> I have been aware of the concerns (mostly relating to conflicts of interest) in the GUIDELINES regarding "Vanity". The truth is that I started a while ago by adding the KNSI page. Considering that most of the media in St Cloud, MN is absent I followed the model of similar format stations in Minneapolis and started to write articles about the St Cloud live shows. First was the top rated show and then our show. For some reason Dan Ochsners was deleted but this one was not. I have since been building on it in as much of a NPOV as I could. And, you have to admit that had I not said so elsewhere you would have had difficulty realizing that the articles were originated by the subject. Which leads me to the following:
<blockquote>
<p>If you have published elsewhere on a subject, we welcome you to contribute to articles on the subject for Wikipedia. However, every Wikipedia article is expected to cover its subject in a neutral, fair, and comprehensive way in order to advance knowledge of the subject as a whole.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:AUTO" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:AUTO" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>
Can you honestly say that this is not "neutral, fair, and comprehensive"? Is it or is it not advancing knowledge of the subject?</li>
</ul>
<p>Verifiability...Everything in the articles has been on the air, on the station's website, on the personal blogs or on the show's websites. I take it from the myopic prism used to push to delete everything regarding this station's shows and hosts that this is not sufficient for 'verifiability'...however as of yet noone has offered anything as a response. In other words, there is no guidance whatsoever from the veteran editors...just a 'delete, we're right, no exception' mentality.</p>
<p>When I have a question about ANYTHING I check Wikipedia first. I have never come up empty...except when dealing with matters within St Cloud. While the policy of "notability" and "verifiable" are very good standards, there seems to be a conflict with that in some of the projects I have seen on Wikipedia (e.g. requesting pages for all state legislators, articles completing timelines). These projects imply a desire of comprehensiveness to some degree. Those things said, these articles seem to fall into line with the comprehensive drive of other projects. Verifiability? Yes, difficult. So, to me, it seems the question here calls for a balance between Verfiability and/or Notability vs Comprehensive and leading resource. And one more point to the idea of Comprehensive Resource: many other Wikias also imply a similar drive...things like Lyrics library, etc. Notability? Come live in St Cloud and see if KNSI and their local talent are not notable? What is comforting in Wikipedia (as a resource) is that it seems practicaly anything of public knowledge is able to be found. The fact that a common person within a certain field WOULD likely search for a topic, in my interpretation of notability, is the driving philosophy behind 'notability'. If I am wrong, then I ask for Rulings that demonstrate this error of interpretation.<a href="../../../m/n/y/User%7EMnyakko_2c09.html" title="User:Mnyakko">tony garcia</a> 02:04, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> second <i>Keep</i> opinion by same editor stricken. Please only state <i>Keep</i> or <i>Delete</i> once a discussion. It is bad wiki-etiquette to do otherwise. Per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>, information has to be verifiable from a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> to appear on Wikipedia; i.e. it has to be possible that it can be vetted for accuracy. Something that happens "on air" on a radio show is not going to pass <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> unless there is a transcript, archived program, etc that is readily available for people to verify. Blogs are generally considered by many editors to not be a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> because they are self-published and usually have no external checks on accuracy. A station's website may be seen as a reliable source, or may not because it is a primary source and may not be neutral. Personally I opined delete because I don't see any evidence of greater notability. It has nothing to do with the size of the station or the size of St. Cloud... I live in a much bigger city and I would readily opine delete for any local radio programming in my city (including the shows I listen to frequently) unless it could be demonstrated that multiple, verifiable, external sources exist and have been devoted to the show (newspapers, nationally circulated magazines, coverage by non-local news organizations on television or the web). I just don't see that here.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 16:24, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> as non-notable and unverified. All information comes from the station's own website, the program, and the producers' blogs, which are primary sources and therefore not useful (per Wikipedia policy) in establishing either notability or verifiability. It has to come from somewhere else, from a trustworthy source (e.g. not a blogger) who is not related to the program. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic">Charlene.fic</a> 12:24, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Why would a blogger not be a cretable source according to Wiki, yet a creditable source according to CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, and other news orginizations on multiple ocassions? Wiki's deffition of blogger includes this statement: The impact of this story gave greater credibility to blogs as a medium of news dissemination. Though often seen as partisan gossips, bloggers sometimes lead the way in bringing key information to public light, with mainstream media having to follow their lead. More often, however, news blogs tend to react to material already published by the mainstream media. Would it not stand to reason that Blogs can be used as trustworthy sources?<a href="../../../z/e/e/User%7EZeeboid_0e8f.html" title="User:Zeeboid">Pete Arnold</a> 17:34, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I can't comment on CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, etc. as I don't work for any of those companies. They have their own views on blogging... and besides, they are news media. Wikipedia is not, it is an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html#Self-published_sources_as_secondary_sources" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources#Self-published sources as secondary sources</a> guideline is pretty clear when it states "...personal websites, blogs, and other self-published or vanity publications should not be used as secondary sources." They simply are not a reliable source. blogs might be on the bleeding edge of information dissemination, but Wikipedia is a reactive media, not a proactive media. It is an encyclopedia, not a news site; the purpose is not to "disseminate news". If a blog is the primary or only source for information, it can't be seen as a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. If a blog is simply reprinting what has been said elsewhere, then Wikipedia should be using the source feeding the blog (provided it is a reliable source of course) and not the blog. Blogs generally have huge verifiability &amp; POV problems.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:54, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The Ambiguous nature of Wiki's rules not only allows editors to make judgement calls, but allows preferencial treatment of some articles, and exclusion of others based on editorial opinion. If rules are going to be cited as criteria to be meet inorder to be allouable in Wiki, then Ambiguous or not, of something meets those criteria, it would be expected to be kept. Race to the Right meets the notability guidelines by having 1. A large fan base and 2. name recoginition. The entires on the contributiers to Race to the Right (Tony Garcia and Pete Arnold) show what makes Race to the Right what it is. <a href="../../../z/e/e/User%7EZeeboid_0e8f.html" title="User:Zeeboid">Pete Arnold</a> 20:24, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't think it has been demonstrated that the radio show has a large fan base or name recognition. All you've provided is the contention that the personal blog of the show's host gets 360 or so hits a week, which isn't <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> to begin with, and doesn't establish the fan base of the radio show. Name recognition has also not been established. Where is the evidence of that? Finally, even if notability is verifiably proven for the show, Tony Garcia &amp; Pete Arnold are not notable by association. They both need to meet the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guidelines or a very copelling reason needs to be given to ignore the guidelines in this case. This has not been done at this point.

<p>Hi. My name is Derek, and I listen to this show in ocasionally St. Cloud. I think Isotope sounds like he realy wants this gone even though Race to the right is on the air and does have an audience. I am also insulted by the thought of St. cloud being a small town.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. Yes, as difficult as this may be to understand, basic Wikipedia policies apply to this show as well, and there are still no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> in the article as of right now. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 20:47, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, lots of noise but still no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. Add some and we'll talk. <a href="../../../v/e/c/User%7EVectro_bf83.html" title="User:Vectro">Vectro</a> 04:15, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
