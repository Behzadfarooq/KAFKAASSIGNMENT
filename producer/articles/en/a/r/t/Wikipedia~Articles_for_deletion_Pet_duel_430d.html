<dd>I was indeed being civil, but I don't take kindly to being accused of lying. Slander is hardly a civil gesture is it, my good friend? This did indeed make the press, which is where my information for the article came. I have the articles from the local papers on the event, including adverts and entry forms. There were also three articles from the naitonal press, including a piece in Hampshire BBC news. I'm fairly certain you'll find no external sources for the Holocaust, but would you deny that occured?</dd>

<dd>The hampshire chronicle featured a monthly update on the debate, from 1994-1996. BBC Hampshire News covered the event on 6th March 1996. Local papers such as The Gazette, Mail &amp; Star and the South of England Lawn Bowls Society newsleter covered the events in greater detail. I am happy to distribute scans of any of the articles, if not all! I think we should get off the debate on wether this occured, and instead refer back to the reason that this article is placed on this list; is it notable. This is a debate I would welcome, rather than a cowardly attack on my character. Thank you.</dd>

<dd>Never once have I attacked your character, I merely SUGGESTED that perhaps this is a hoax. Honestly, an event like this would have SOME press, even 10 years after the fact. 287 pets dying in a staged fight is pretty significant <b>if it can be proven true.</b> What we need is verification of this, which if you can supply, would help in making your case. We do not have to prove it is fake, YOU have to prove it is true. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWildthing61476_ea8a.html" title="User:Wildthing61476">Wildthing61476</a> 19:52, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<b>DO NOT DELETE</b> You are all fools, the internet is the not the source of all the world's information, 'i did a search on google and nothing came up, it must be fake!'. I am willing to give a first hand account of the both Pet Duel II and III.

<p>I wished to join the wikipedia community, and have recieved nothing but scorn. I wished to write a good article, and could not work out what to write about, until my dad's scrapbook reminded me of the silly competition that got out of hand in our pub. For your information, I used to live there, and despite my good friends efforts to the contrary, it is still open. <a href="http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/19/19971/Anchor_Inn/Lower_Froyle" class="external free" title="http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/19/19971/Anchor_Inn/Lower_Froyle" rel="nofollow">http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/19/19971/Anchor_Inn/Lower_Froyle</a> I would also like to know when commenting and participating actively in a public debate meant that anything that came out of your mouth is lies? What has me commenting about a seperate article got to do with my article? Is this because I disagreed with your point of view? To parody myself perhaps this reminds us all of a famous nation in the 1930s. I have the proof by the way, but as I am new I have yet to 1. Upload, 2. Reference. I was hoping with some sort of help in doing this, rather than damnation. Do I need to scan in the paper cuttings? Upload the photographs? Help would be nice, as I believe this is a very entertaining part of Hampshire's local history, and one that people should be aware of, as it shows how a small silly event can get out of hand. Much like National Socialism.</p>

<p>Oh for gods sake PLEASE PLEASE do some research! Why comment on an article you know NOTHING about? Hampshire is a county! Let me put it in layman's terms.

<li><b>Comment</b>Hampshire is not a town I’m afraid, my ‘wikifriend’, it is a county a large area, originally the domain of a count or earl. Counties include many towns, cities, villages and hamlets, and many inns, many of them with the same name</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> At the time of these supposed events, I lived around 30 miles from Lower Froyle. I still live in the county. So I'm local enough to know that this is complete and utter bullshit. To put it into context, around the same time there were a spate of attacks on horses in the area, and speculation was published in the local and national press that a "horse ripper" was responsible. Googling "horse ripper" + Hampshire pulls up quite a few relevant results. The fact that google can't find ANYTHING about this event tells me it's crap, regardless of my personal knowledge. And of course I can always phone the Hampshire Chronicle tomorrow and I'm 100% certain they will know nothing about a "monthly update on the debate, from 1994-1996". You're wasting everybody's time with this stupidity, GO AWAY. <a href="../../../d/j/b/User%7EDjbrianuk_0376.html" title="User:Djbrianuk">exolon</a> 21:19, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

Right, with all due respect, will you please read what I write. I have said do your research in respect to knowing what Hampshire is, or in your case, what it certainly is not. Secondly, I stated QUITE CLEARLY, that I am but a humble beginner, and I extended a warm handshake to you, my friend and subject in the Great Imperial Colonies, and asked for assistance. I have the sources, and I wish to put them on. As stated before, I do not know how. I am asking for assistance with this. You cannot find reference for this anywhere, as a someone said, that is because many things live outside of Google. I for instance, cannot be found on Google, but I most certainly exsist. Faith too, is absent on Google, and yet I know many who have found that. Thank you in advance, and Godspeed.</p>
<p>The LORD will demonstrate his holy power before the eyes of all the nations. The ends of the earth will see the salvation of our God." - Isaiah 52:10</p>
<p>Is swearing at me and telling me to go away really in the spirit of wikipedia? I have offered the proof, I am not lying! I merely wished to make a contribution. Thank you for your help, rather than saying, please come forth with the sources, this is how you put them into the article, you use deplorable language and insults. I think I may just go away, this is certainly not a very nice community.</p>
<ul>
<li>Look, just post the scans and we'll beleive you. Most major press sources are extensively indexed by google and signifigant coverage should be detected via a google search. It is possible that some how this story slipped through, but you need to show us that by posting scans (or links) to the articles in question. Otherwise, <b>delete</b>.

I would also like to point out that i would quite happily 'upwikiload' my sources regarding Waspard (my favourite condiment). Its funny you say that your not on Google either, the same thing happened to me, maybe google needs to cite more sources, or we might have to take google out of the 'wikifunclub'.

<p>I wish people would read what is written before comment. I wish to post the sources, so that all of the morons who live life by the judge before trial philosophy can apologise to me.

The Pet Duel debate seems to have become quite quiet now that some assistance has been requested. Perhaps the 'wikicommunity' allows it's pupils only to baldly critisize people contibutions, rather than offer assistance or even constructive critisism. Many thanks P. Longhurst</p>
