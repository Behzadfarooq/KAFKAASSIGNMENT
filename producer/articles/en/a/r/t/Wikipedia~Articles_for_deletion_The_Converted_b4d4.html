<p>AMG hasn't heard of these guys and Googling the band's name combined with the styles of music the play, the state, and their home city in various combinations didn't turn up any worthwhile hits that I could find. They've put out one EP, and appear to be strictly a local band. They're about to put out a CD, which is good for them, but they don't seem to be anywhere near meeting the guidelines set forth in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a> yet. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 03:00, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The Converted have played in more locations than the local towns they are from, they have played and are somewhat known in Philadelphia. The reason they don't appear on Google is most likely because they haven't submitted their site to Google yet. I mean, they're a punk band that is starting out, they aren't going to be all over Google or have a .com site yet. -- Necron99</li>

<li>Necron, Wikipedia likes their articles to be verifiable. So they may have played in a lot of places, but if no reliable sources documented this, we can't prove it which is a basic requirement especially when it comes to articles on people and bands. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 12:21, 16 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Furthermore, just having played in a lot of places isn't enough, as the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a> guidelines illustrate. I can think of plenty of situations where an article about a band might be entirely appropriate even if they don't meet that criteria, but I don't think this is one of those cases. (And Necron99, you don't actually have to submit anything to Google; if it's being talked about in the net, Google's pretty good at finding it. If The Converted don't show up on Google, it's pretty much a sure thing that they aren't getting a lot of attention on the net. That alone is not the deciding factor, but it's certainly an indication that they aren't exactly turning the Maryland music scene upside down.) -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 20:50, 16 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Dude,</b> hey Cap', what's your beef? i mean you haven't attacked my band SKP's wiki, and we totally suck. i mean we don't even have any songs recorded with all of our members playing on them. The Converted is a much more verifiable band then mine. we have a song that is nine minutes of me breaking my guitar strings with a serrated knife. go ahead and google that one. if you're gonna bash on The Converted, at least do tha common courtesy of destroying all tha other Kent bands' Wikis as well. <b>--tha 1 who Trevs</b> 10:33, 18 October 2005 (EST)</li>

<li><b>Chillax</b> alright dudes, just 'cause you haven't heard of them, dosn't mean they're not a verifiable, and awesome, band. I mean, c'mon, have you heard of everything that exists, ever? I mean, what? Just 'cause you can't find it on Godoogle means it dosn't exist? Does google hold all knowlege, ever, in history? No. There are things that exist in this crazy thing called 'Lyfe' that google has never heard of. Know why? 'Cause they just made thier leap to the interweb hoping to find a welcoming audience to increase thier fanbase on an interesting site known as 'wikipedia'. What do they find? Disbelief. Persecution. <i>Libel</i>, I might add. to quote the good cap'n: <b>"they don't seem to be anywhere near meeting the guidelines set forth in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a> yet."</b> Well, this is simply not true. To quote the article he was so quick to name, but obviously hasn't read, rule number 6 reads thusly: <b>"Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city (or both, as in British hip hop)..."</b> Well, I, as a resident of Chestertown, Maryland, I would like to say for all of us that The Converted is the most prominant representative of Ska/Punk/Crust Punk/Death Metal of Chestertown, Maryland. Thus, according to the rules of Wikipedia, laid down by the most venerable whoever, The Converted's page is in fact, allowable on this site. <b>--Converted Fan 198</b></li>

<li>I used to live in Chestertown and The Converted really are what some peoples lives revolve around. Whenever there is a show announced with The Converted the kids in the town have something to look forward to in life. Being that the town is full of rich, old conservatives who dont really allow the local bands to play, being them shutting down the local venues and replacing them with offices. Another reason that one might not find info on The Converted "turning the scene upsidedown" is because the local paper probably doesnt write shit on them, probably because its run by the same rich old people. And I agree with Converted Fan 198 in that Google really doesnt know all. Google can really only cover so much. -TheRussianZombie</li>
