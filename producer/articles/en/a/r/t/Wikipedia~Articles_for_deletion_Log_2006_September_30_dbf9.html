<dd><b>Comment</b>. I really see absolutely no prescient value in Wikipedia serving as a repository for obscure and entirely irrelevant sports results. Let's be entirely clear about this. This is a college sports team. Wikipedia is not a sports almanac, particularly for non-professional sports, whether we like it or not. <a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphachimp_1adb.html" title="User:Alphachimp"><font color="OrangeRed">alpha</font><font color="black"><b>Chimp</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../a/l/p/User_talk%7EAlphachimp_9b9e.html" title="User talk:Alphachimp">(talk)</a></sup> 18:46, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b>. While I don't argue that you and I may not see any value in this, that doesn't mean that <i>everybody</i> concurs. Let's say that a player from that team becomes a professional, and someone has the inclination to research the player's background. Or perhaps that school will win a playoff of some sort, making the information relevant. I think suggesting that information that could be in a sports almanac <i>defines</i> Wikipedia as such by its inclusion, is a bit of a longshot. <a href="../../../k/n/i/User%7EKnicholls_421e.html" title="User:Knicholls">Kevin</a> 20:17, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Since most of the delete votes were made before October 2, it is very likely that the editors were voting on a radically different version article and might not have voted delete if they had read the current article instead. If the new article is worthy of deletion, it can be re-nominated and we can get a consensus to delete based upon the new article.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Also note that the original nominator has withdrawn his nomination of the article for deletion.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'd just like to point out that the original page nominated for deletion was Lords Reform - what is more democratic , which was moved. <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lords_Reform_a79b.html" title="Lords Reform">Lords Reform</a> was not the article nominated. <a href="../../../e/a/o/User%7EEaolson_5608.html" title="User:Eaolson">eaolson</a> 17:39, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Same argument applies to the subpages that were added to the nomination. It's very possible that some of the subpages will need to be deleted but, since the whole framework has been reworked, it's better to leave them in place for a short while and then let us revisit each subpage once the dust has settled. The major issue here is that the main article <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lords_Reform_a79b.html" title="Lords Reform">Lords Reform</a> is gettting long and hard to read. Some subpages will need to be created but it's not clear at the moment which ones should go.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The primary author is still learning the ways of Wikipedia and is being mentored by a few Wikipedians including myself. He admits that the initial article was "crap" but I think you will agree that the current article is worthy of retention and simply needs improvement. I think this could be developed into an FA candidate eventually.</dd>

<p><a href="../../../i/s/l/User%7EIslaySolomon_7ae5.html" title="User:IslaySolomon">IslaySolomon</a> asserts that the subject of reforming the House of Lords is adequately covered by discussing the actual reforms. Perhaps the most telling argument against this is that xe neglects to even mention the 1911 reform, possibly the most important reform to the House to date, and the cause of a flurry of published works on this subject in the early 20th century.

<li>I am sick and tired of the hypocracy on Wikipedia. Of course an article about reform of the House of Lords is going to contain opinions and original research because the whole reform process consists of a series of debates about opinions. These pages have not been on a day and I was up to 3am yesterday working to get them into some sort of order before you vultures started picking at the carcass. Where is the tolerance that Wikipedia tells everyone about?</li>
</ul>
<p>Having set out a template, I was just about to start going through the 1000 different responses to the consultations. I have complained in the past that there is no means (as far as I am aware) to create a trial version and invite comments.</p>
<p>The issue of Lords reform is incredibly complex and given the huge number of views it simply is not possible to explain the issue in one page. I know even less about Wikipedia except its pretended policy of "welcoming everyone" which it does not.</p>
<p><i><b>How can some of you be serious. 1000 different people spent days, if not weeks putting together their consultation responses, hundreds of MPs over decades if not centuries have put in huge amounts of time, it is one of the highest profile issues in the UK, and all you can say is "delete it". I'd have some respect for what you said if one of you had actually offered to help make the article more acceptable.</b></i>Mike Haseler</p>

An encyclopedia is a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertiary_source.html" title="Tertiary source">tertiary source</a> and should collect the opinions and research of others (with references) into a comprehensive whole. Also, "tolerance" does not mean we sit back and let you do whatever you want. If you want us to establish a compromise position with you, then you shall have to engage us in debate.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Well, if you don't join the community, you can't expect to find out about these things. Being productive on the Wikipedia is about more than producing a lot of material - engaging with the other editors, particularly over controvertial articles, is incredibly important. Acting as though the Wikipedia "Edit This Page" button is a videogame and your goal is to get <i>your</i> version of the article in place is not effective. You should be spending a considerable proportion of your time debating the direction of articles on Talk pages and User Talk pages. <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESockatume_ba19.html" title="User:Sockatume">Sockatume</a> 14:18, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>.This is not a controversal article, as far as I'm aware there have only been three contributors and none of them have disagreed. You are making a controversy where there is none. And I take great exception to your comment: <b>using "Edit This Page" button is a videogame.</b> In fact I haven't a clue what you are talking about! I will restate my position. The Lords is one of the oldest institutions in the World. Reform of the Lords is one of the highest profile issues for the UK government. I apologise that I am not an expert at Wikipedia, indeed, I would love people more informed than me to add to the page, but if this subject can't be included in the encylopedia section of Wiki, then what is the point of it?

<dd><b>Comment</b> As an article which is providing informaton on the process of reform; a reform that is largely dictated by the opinions of those involved, it is inevitable that much of it will be reporting of opinions. I have had the dubious pleasure of reading many of the contributions and talking to quite a few MPs and Lords involved, I am will try to provide information on the range of opinions. I am trying to represent these as fairly and neutrally as possible (although regretably I've had to copy and paste some stuff to at least get a start) so for the meanwhilst, some of it is quite obviously my own opinion of the situation, but unless there is something there to edit, how can others make their contribution and so arrive at a mutually agreed consenus?</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. <i>And I take great exception to your comment: <b>using "Edit This Page" button is a videogame.</b> In fact I haven't a clue what you are talking about!</i> That's surprising considering I elaborated upon the point in the following sentence. To reiterate: at this stage you aren't making an effort to react to our criticisms (it doesn't read like an encyclopedia article, for example) beyond the blanket statement that this is an important issue. It is important when facing a conflict of opinion on the Wikipedia that you sit down and discuss it thoroughly with the other editors. Judging from your previous comments (the sense of being "jumped on" when starting a new article, and the "me against he world" tone you've taken here), this is something you were unaware of.</dd>

<dd>We agree that it's an important issue, hence the concensus to keep the central article. However the issue is not presented in a thoroughly referenced, encyclopedic manner.

<p>Topic worthy of an article As someone who worked on this article some time ago, I can only say that I tried to include a neutral summary of some of the history and the issues involved in reform. I certainly referred to the Parliament Act 1911. As I was providing background for an article which I take to be mostly about the attempts of the Blair government to reform the House of Lords, I did not go into a lot of detail anout the history but I tried to be reasonably comprehensive. I think that the constitutional crisis leading up to the Parliament Act 1911 is an important historical topic but not central to the contemporary issues.</p>
<p>When I looked at Haseler's work on the main Lords Reform article yesterday I was impressed by it. I did not see the problems described in the comments above.</p>
<p>In summary I think the issue of Lords reform is an important topic in current British politics. There ought to be an article about it, setting out enough history for the non specialist to grasp what is being argued about. The options for reform which have been proposed should be summarised.</p>
<p>I suggest rather than just sweeping away all that has been done before (good, bad or indifferent as it may be), it would be helpful if those who object point to the specific passages they consider to infringe the policies on Neutral POV, lack of sourcing and original research etc. These points can then be examined in detail and if the complaint is found justified the existing text can be corrected so it does comply with applicable policies. I am willing to assist with such an effort. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGary_J_5e89.html" title="User:Gary J">Gary J</a> 23:50, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see some of the historical information about pre-1977 reforms I inserted originally, has been moved from the main article since I saw it yesterday. It is fair to say that is not in itself a complete treatment of the history, nor is it sourced. It was designed to be a section of a larger whole not an independent article. I presume Haseler was going to get around to expanding it later, but perhaps it will assist the community if I do some work on it, to see if something can be produced which is acceptable. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGary_J_5e89.html" title="User:Gary J">Gary J</a> 00:09, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>"In democracy the people are supreme and the politicians are there to serve the people. By voting for politicians we pick the House of Commons on merit and by its nature this makes it literally undermocratic. An upper chamber does not need to have a mandate to govern, and therefore selection by lot is the best way to make it democratic." This is POV. The <i>best</i> way?

<li><b>Comment</b> - Lords reform is a perfectly sensible topic to write about, and there is plenty of third party comment to use as sources without delving into <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, but this seems to be a rather ambitious programme! It may be easier to try to write one article at a time, and split off sections into subarticles when they get long enough. I think the current content in the sub-articles should be merged into the parent article, and perhaps <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reform_of_the_House_of_Lords_d83c.html" title="Reform of the House of Lords">Reform of the House of Lords</a> would be a better title.

<li><b>DELETE</b>. The lords reform article is a mess, it's not written in a wikipedia-like tone or manual of style or guide to layout or well, it's basically a whole jumble of mess that looks like someone vandalized. Also per IslaySolomon, Opabinia regalis, Sandstein and physicq210 It's DEFINITE DELETE!!! I found the article after stumbling onto three empty articles when stub sorting: Lords Reform - Proposals; Lords Reform - Aims; Lords Reform - Roles which was emptied by <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordsReform_12df.html" title="User:LordsReform">User:LordsReform</a>. I don't know if it constitutes as blanking or vandalism since it was (after digging around) I suppose was for a rewrite of the Lords reform series. But it is unwikipedia-like to leave articles like that with improper redirect. Which I think the three articles doesn't even worthy the redirect. (per redirect policy) Also, I would like to rais the issue of User talk:LordsReform's purpose of moving the article onto his/her userpage as it is an irregular wikipedia practice. Also, could someone cleanup this afd? Feureau 22:58, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>It is NOT irregular Wikipedia practice to move an article to User space. In fact, the action <b>Userfy</b> is a recommendation that shows up from time to time in AFD debates. In this case, the author <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">User:Haseler</a> was advised to move articles that were "not ready for primetime" to User space. So, he created a separate user account <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordsReform_12df.html" title="User:LordsReform">User:LordsReform</a> and moved the articles there. The creation of a separate user account for this purpose is not ideal. It would have been better to move the articles to subpages of <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">User:Haseler</a> but Haseler, being a new Wikipedian, misinterpreted the suggestion. He is working on a new article in <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordsReform_New_9bde.html" title="User:LordsReform/New">User:LordsReform/New</a> which he has created as a sandbox. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 22:52, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. <i><a href="../../../r/o/m/Romance_of_the_Three_Kingdoms_5ea0.html" title="Romance of the Three Kingdoms">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</a></i> is significant, as are its characters. Wutugu is not one of the primary characters, certainly, but he is mentioned in far more than passing. Analogy arguments are weak in AFD, of course, but we have articles for characters of similar depth from Shakespeare <i>et al</i>, so I consider <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">WP:BIAS</a> to give this the final nudge toward survival. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 05:31, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Changing my nomination for deletion. Seems there is a lot of knowledge here from these people about this character. Maybe some of you could edit the page so the next reader doesn't do the same thing I did and try to delete it because it did not say anything notable about the character? or impact on plot:) --MPW 16:42, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article is content from other articles about Hispanic religions, mixed with such editorial opinion as "several Protestant denominations (particularly Evangelical ones) have vigorously proselytized in Hispanic communities."

I find it hard to comprehend why would redundancy serve as a reason for keeping an article. How come you consider that such odd justifications for keeping the hispanic politics article should apply here?

<li><b>Keep</b>: Given the number of confirmations and what will almost certainly be a media frenzy, there's no reason to think that this won't go beyond Mark Foley.

<li><b>Keep</b> you have freaking got to be kidding me, AFD'ing this. There's probably not a paper on the planet that isn't covering this.

<li>The problem now is that there is way too insufficient material for a separate article; the two external links can be added to the suthor's article. I do not believe in splintering information across a series of small articles; it is inefficient both for the editors and readers. Articles should grow organically then split when required. In the case of this book it should only be split out from the author's article when the material on it starts to overbalance the host article. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 02:03, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>PLEASE Delete List of Famous Kammas, Rajus and Brahmins</b> These articles actually list famous people in each caste among people of Indian (Asian) origin who speak Telugu... Think a list which lists famous Telugu people makes sense rather then break them down by CASTE which means nothing outside that state... Not really informational and given the nature of Wikipedia can be manipulated to include anyone deemed important by a reader...

<li><b>Famous Telugu Brahmins should not be deleted</b> When one can have a article listing the names of all nobel laureates, names of presidents of united states of america, etc etc... why cant one have a article which lists the names of all famous telugu brahmins, who have excelled in their respective fields, in my opinion wikipedia should include all such articles which are informatory(though the information may be useful only for few people), this article might be a valuble resource for some one who is keen about knowing more about his community and people who made the community proud.

<li><b>Neutral</b> at this point but bordering on a Weak Delete. I would be curious as to the views of our Indian Wikipedians on this one. Looking at these lists, I don't recognize any of the names but that is just a reflection of my own systematic bias. The few names with Wiki-links are generally informative and the benefit of a list is that encourage articles to be created for other members of the list. At the same time, the concept of a "Famous [caste members]" seems daunting and unmanagable. While there is obviously not a comparison to a US caste, but I can't really imagine seeing an article like Famous Middle-Class Americians or Famous Rednecks on Wikipedia either. I am also concern with the lack of sources for all the articles to verify what makes them "famous". <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 06:51, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Do Not Delete</b> - Maybe the article just needs to be updated? I know that it's owned by a company out of New Zealand called Zeacom, that's been around for more than a decade - they're in like 20 countries. I'm using it and it's very much a reliable product/company... regarding reliable sources, they were just in the New Zealand Herald last Monday. Not sure who these people are who are bashing the article - perhaps they could do some research and update the article?! I'm new to wikis but starting to contribute on subjects that are close to me.

<p><b>Do Not Delete</b> - Yes, I posted this article and I don't think it should be deleted. Zeacom (whole owner of Youmail) is absolutely a notable firm - in existence 11 years, with 2000 business running this software and more than 60,000 end users in 21 countries, offices in Irvine California, Atlanta Georgia, Auckland New Zealand, Sydney and Melbourne Australia and Brighton, UK. If I've made a mistake of some sort in my posting, please help me correct it but please don't delete it. This is NOT an advertisement, nor is it intended to be. It is merely a statement of fact. And if I do say so, when reading there is no use of persuasiveness or selling at all. There isn't even a reference to the site! Thank you for your time. Sincerely, Brickley.</p>
<p><b>Delete</b> Reads like an advertisement, no quotes from reliable sources, lacks notability. I think this qualifies for speedy delete under WP:CSD G11.

Starcraft units, albums by a particular artist, etc. - would YOU want to nominate every character in non-notable arbitrary webcomic for deletion separately?).

<li><b>Comment</b>: Per badlydrawnjeff's comments below, I'd like to make clear that I am asserting all of the articles below also fail notability on their own terms, above and beyond the walled garden/spamvertisement problem. (I will provide details for any individual article upon request.) This is the entire problem of why walled gardens are bad for Wikipedia: It allows people to mistakenly fall into circular reasoning traps when it comes to AfDs (e.g. "Keep Candice E. Jackson, she's notable!" "For what?" "For writing <i>Their Lives</i>!" "But why is <i>Their Lives</i> notable?" Because it was written by Candice E. Jackson, and she's got an article!"). (Please note I'm not accusing badlydrawnjeff of circular reasoning; I consider his vote 100% legit. It was just his comments that led me to think I didn't make a clear enough nominating statement.) --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 16:17, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's fine, and I want to assert that I didn't think your comments were directed at me before I read your last note. I do think many (most?) of these meet our standards, but <i>some</i> do not. Just like I wouldn't want to see the obvious ones (<i>These Lives</i>, <i>Help! Mom!</i>) deleted because some of the minor ones might not meet it, the minor ones shouldn't just be kept because of the high notability of two of them. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:30, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

None of them should be marked for deletion, and neither should the Review.

<li><b>Keep all</b>. The publisher is notable both for its books and for the fact it is the publisher of <a href="../../../w/o/r/WorldNetDaily_c1c3.html" title="WorldNetDaily">WND Books</a>; it is therefore a significant company in an important part of the publishing industry. The books themselves are notable titles about important social and political issues, and they have all been highly visible in the media and the marketplace. The indvidual Wiki articles are extensively referenced using multiple independent media sources -- including the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Publishers Weekly, NewsMax, US News &amp; World Report, Forbes, Washington Post, etc. If highly visible books about controversial topics do not belong on Wikipedia, it raises the disconcerting question as to whether we need to start deleting Wiki entries for books like <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_%26_King_bdc4.html" title="King &amp; King">King &amp; King</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rainbow_Fish_ddca.html" title="Rainbow Fish">Rainbow Fish</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/w/Bush%27s_Brain%7E_How_Karl_Rove_Made_George_W._Bush_Presidential_2844.html" title="Bush's Brain: How Karl Rove Made George W.

<li><b>Comment</b>: 1) One look at my user page should be enough evidence that political motivations had nothing to do with my nominations. I nominated them because they're a <a href="../../../w/a/l/WP%7EWALL_5398.html" title="WP:WALL">Walled garden</a> of <a href="../../../v/s/c/WP%7EVSCA_4f2d.html" title="WP:VSCA">vanispamcruft</a>. 2) At least half of the "extensive references" in these articles were added by - surprise! - <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurkey2020_76fa.html" title="User:Turkey2020">Turkey2020</a> in the last 48 hours, after my nomination <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Turkey2020" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Turkey2020" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, and most of the rest, which were unpersuasive, were added by him earlier because, well: 3) Turkey2020 is an <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">SPA</a>. Except for his very first edit - a keep vote on a long-settled AfD - he has never made a single edit to Wikipedia that isn't to one of the articles that are the subject of this AfD. 4) His "deleting X means we must also delete Y" argument is, of course, fallacious and is listed as a classic "argument to avoid" at <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html#What_about_article_x.3F" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT/"What about article X?"</a>. 5) I will <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">AGF</a> and simply note that his comment about WND Books is misleading; the publisher has signed some sort of deal to take over that imprint in 2007, but as for now it's part of another company. And WND Books doesn't even have its own article, just a paragraph inside <a href="../../../w/o/r/WorldNetDaily_c1c3.html" title="WorldNetDaily">WorldNetDaily</a>. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 22:44, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: 1) Aaron seems to imply that entries he nominates for deletion shouldn't have references or additional information added in an attempt to improve them. 2) When it is pointed out that the articles he wants to delete have long lists of sources (including the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Publishers Weekly, NewsMax, US News &amp; World Report, Forbes, Washington Post, etc. etc.) which contradict his non-notable claim, Aaron does not defend his original hypothesis but instead dismissively uses "extensive references" in quotes as if that means the references can therefore be ignored. 3) Aaron calls into question the credibility of who makes edits but not the edits themselves. 4) Aaron ignores valid attempts at benchmarking other articles. 5) Aaron claims my point about WND Books is "misleading" for some reason because the books do not hit store shelves for a couple of months; such reasoning is convoluted, and the fact that the publisher won the contract <i>ipso facto</i> further contradicts Aaron's claim of non-notability. Conclusion: None of the points Aaron makes demonstrate the claim on non-notability; this claim is contradicted by numerous verifiable references to independent media sources. --<a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurkey2020_76fa.html" title="User:Turkey2020">Turkey2020</a> 00:02, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Other than one point, I will let Turkey2020's actions, edit record and statements speak for themselves: The generally accepted standard for good faith editing of articles in AfD is to simply make the edits and then come to the AfD and post a note to the effect of, "I've made an attempt to improve this article/these articles, and I'd appreciate it if you'd take a look at them now and see if they're any better before making a vote. Thanks." (Or, alternatively, to do the reverse: Post that you intend to edit and then carry out those edits and come back to let the AfD participants know that you're done.) Instead, T2020 made the edits quietly and then came in here to post a "keep all" vote using his comments to imply that all the articles were <i>already</i> in the state they're in now (not that his changes have done anything to address the concerns I raised in the nomination; IMHO some of them have been made worse), and that my nom was thus making fraudulent claims. Are those the actions of a good faith editor? You make the call. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 00:40, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article is about an insignificant military person known to outer world only through the crime he commited. Not a single encyclopaedia, military journal, mainstream media, military institution, or historian ever expressed any interest in him. The article is written along with the ruling nationalist agenda aimed to relativize the crime he commited.</p>
<p>All his military 'achievemnts' are recognized by the people who were directly responsible for the crimes against civilians (Janko Bobetko, Franjo Tudjman). Actually, this man (Norac) is uneducated and primitive person - a hero of the people who are at the same mental hevel as him. I hardly could imagine any interest of an avereage educated reader of Wikipedia - in that man.</p>
<p>All together - following the same reason - we could have entries about a bunch of people praised for the crime they commited in the Burundi, Iraq, or Afganistan wars.

As it mentioned before, if we allow this article here the integrity and credibility of Wikipedia will be gravely compromised. <i>High-ranked</i> by the men who are war criminals too--<a href="../../../v/e/l/User%7EVelebit_bf61.html" title="User:Velebit">Velebit</a> 00:53, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> It is funny thing to even read this article. Telling people about <i>youngest ever colonel of Croatian Army</i> and not telling the fact that the Croatian president Tudjman - and his superior in some way - was a man despised by the world leaders (nobody attended his funeral) and considered as a war criminal too - is a fraud! It is fraud not to tell that Norac's superior and commander-in-chief Janko Bobetko was an indicted war criminal who avoided the ICTY dying before getting chance to be handed over to the ICTY. To put it differently - what is the real value of this rapid advancement of a half-literete man in the ranks of some army??? It is fraud to say that he was <i>duke of Sinjska alka</i> and not to tell that the Zagreb diplomatic corps publicly annonced their disgust by the fact that this (Norac) man was honoured that way and refused to participate in this commemorative and solemn event. I am asking all those writing <b>Keep</b> why they did it so?

<li><b>Keep</b> - the nomination for deletion is weak, and I believe in bad faith. Just because his notability is for war crimes doesn't make it any less of a topic for an encyclopedia. "<i>All together - following the same reason - we could have entries about a bunch of people praised for the crime they commited in the Burundi, Iraq, or Afganistan wars. Credibility and dignity of Wikipedia shall be ultimately protected.</i>" Then following the nominator's logic, we should delete William Calley, Stalin, Hitler, Pol Pot, etc. because each is an "<i>uneducated and primitive person - a hero of the people who are at the same mental hevel as him.</i>" In Calley's case, that is absolutely the only thing he is notable for. Thanks for your concern about keeping the dignity of wikipedia at its oh-so-lofty levels, as I'm sure that is your primary concern, but the disingenuous edit/deletion wars between various Balkan region ethnic groups, Turks and Armenians, Indians and Pakistanis, Arabs and Israelis, Republicans and Democrats, pro-Iraq War people and anti-Iraq War people, and Mets fans and Yankees fans are really wearing thin.

<p>This neologism doesn't qualify for inclusion in Wikipedia, because <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> says that "To support the use of (or an article about) a particular term we must cite reliable secondary sources such as books and papers about the term — not books and papers that use the term." While I can find sources (for example in Lexis-Nexis) that use the term, I can find no sources that discuss the term as <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> requires. The article itself cites no sources that are about the term, except a quote from Rush himself. And when the only source that discusses a neologism is the popularizer of that neologism, as in this case, then--by analogy with our other notability guidelines such as <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> which demand sources <i>independent</i> of the subject of the article--I think the neologism should fail <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>, until sources independent of the popularizer deem the term notable enough to discuss it.</p>
<p>(Note: A while back I myself, as an anon using IP's beginning with 152, added my own mundane observations about this term to this article. I realize now that those contributions constitute <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, and trivial OR at that.

<dd>To me an EP is a short album in the same way a 50 or 30 minute film is a short film - same thing just less of it. That's my interpretation of it, and I'm not saying that you're wrong but by the same token I still stand by my own opinion. There seems to be a very fine line in this case between keep and delete, I'd rather give this one a go and look at it again in 6 months to see if citations and news of a new album appear, than consign it to deletion with a stack of NN bands who aren't even signed. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 16:15, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>: I guess the fact that respectable blogs like Techcrunch or DownloadSquad (of Weblogsinc group) have blogged about Pixrat speaks about its notability and so have the multiple bloggers, with authority, from various countries who have written about Pixrat.

<li>A company that started trading two days ago is bound to be non-notable, especially if you're not in the country of operation. However, if Nakedbus (lousy name, but that's irrelevant) is following the pattern of Megabus in the UK it is doing something of note, if it succeeds.

<p>I created this article earlier today and it was at once speedied and shoveled into the incinerator without discussion.

OK, so perhaps it is not notable to some because it (as far as I know) has never played in America. This theater company exists and is NOT a hoax. I have no connection with the company, so the page is not ad-spam.

<dd>You're skirting Don Paul's many accomplishments in many other areas long before 9/11 ever happened. Don't try to pretend that the AfD isn't being built around the notion of discrediting well established icons that have made their mark long before the internet arose. Don is a legend in running circles, just ask veteran editors Mark Winitz, over at <i>California Track and Running News</i>, or <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Cooper_%28journalist%29_ee5c.html" title="Bob Cooper (journalist)">Bob Cooper</a>, at <i><a href="../../../r/u/n/Runner%27s_World_b34f.html" title="Runner's World">Runner's World</a></i>. His extensive work on behalf of charitable groups is likewise quite noteworthy, from San Francisco to New Orleans. He is quite well known in the San Francisco Bay Area music scene, and his poetry earned him a prestigious <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stegner_Fellowship_3ea2.html" title="Stegner Fellowship">Stegner Fellowship</a> at <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_University_8e23.html" title="Stanford University">Stanford University</a>, the youngest ever to receive the award.<a href="http://www.sfcall.com/issues%202002/10.7.02/paul_10_7_02.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sfcall.com/issues%202002/10.7.02/paul_10_7_02.htm" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> Simply as a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polymath.html" title="Polymath">polymath</a> he deserves an article, or for any of the many disciplines he has mastered, such as when he went under the US and World record in the <a href="http://www.lehigh.edu/~dmd1/metyrs" class="external text" title="http://www.lehigh.edu/~dmd1/metyrs" rel="nofollow">50 kilometer ultramarathon</a>, which (in contradiction to a comment below) was certainly covered in the mainstream New York media between 1980 and 1982 (including the <i>NY Times</i>). It certainly has been mentioned plenty of times in the media, usually every time Don produced another stunning performance, right up until his recent retirement from running. This AfD is way over the top. (added cites 10/4/06) <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 04:24, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Look, it isn't an accusation to state as a fact that most of the criticism heaped on Don Paul's noteworthiness (already piled below) has been built around attempts at discreditation of his work (i.e., in the <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_Truth_Movement_a967.html" title="9/11 Truth Movement">9/11 Truth Movement</a>). A minor exception below is the claim that Don Paul doesn't even meet noteworthiness standards for athletes, and that is just plain silly. Maybe you should <a href="http://www.caltrack.com/features/donpaulinterviewMarApr06.html" class="external text" title="http://www.caltrack.com/features/donpaulinterviewMarApr06.html" rel="nofollow">read the article by Winitz</a> that is already linked in the external links section, "Paul--a notable competitor on the national and California racing scenes for two-and-a-half decades--recently retired from racing."

<dd>Ok, so you now have enough sources to maybe justify an article about him as an athlete with maybe a tiny note about his 9/11 related stuff. However, a single source doesn't make him notable as an athlete either. From <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>- "Sportspeople/athletes/competitors who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport such as swimming, or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports or other competitive activites that are themselves considered notable, including college sports in the United States. Articles about first team squad members who have not made a first team appearance may also be appropriate, but only if the individual is at a club of sufficient stature that most members of its squad are worthy of articles. Third party verification from a reliable source outside of publications by sponsors of the sport or activity should be provided to demonstrate that the subject is widely recognized as performing at the highest level." and he seems to maybe meet that criterion. So you have enough to write an article about him as an athlete and note the other stuff. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 05:41, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

Whitewashing is whitewashing by any other name. Citations can be found all day, all over the place (outside the discredited walled garden aka the corporate media), concerning Don Paul's notability, that issue is just another red herring.

<li><b>strong keep</b>: This AfD appears to be yet another distracting attempt at sustaining the scorched Earth campaign to cleanse the Wiki of any and all rational accounts of WTC issues. Don Paul is quite noteworthy as both an athlete and as a scholar, much less for his involvement in the <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_Truth_Movement_a967.html" title="9/11 Truth Movement">9/11 Truth Movement</a>. It is getting to the point where the campaign to purge <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rational.html" title="Rational">rationality</a> from the Wiki's 9/11 articles needs to be addressed at a broader level, as the ongoing scorched Earth tactics being used have long since passed the threshold of <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alfred_E._Neuman_e24f.html" title="Alfred E. Neuman">mere annoyance</a>. Instead of an intelligent discourse on what really happened, this campaign seems designed to ensure that discussion, much less editing, never gets past the most essential basics of events surrounding 9/11. There is nothing too hard about understanding that aluminum sheathed jets floating into heavily reinforced giant skyscrapers represent the equivalent of a nerf football impacting a brick wall. WTC 7 collapsed in its footprint without even the distraction of that red herring. Of course, without that, there is not one credible excuse being put forth to excuse the collapse of the building, aside from the entirely unrebutted <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controlled_demolition.html" title="Controlled demolition">controlled demolition</a> explanation, which Don Paul has inconveniently helped place dead center in the controversies surrounding 9/11. For that alone, his bio should stand, his athletic and artistic achievements notwithstanding. It is obvious that the omission commission was stacked with panelists burdened by serious <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conflict_of_interest.html" title="Conflict of interest">conflict of interest</a> problems, but that doesn't seem to deter those engaged in the efforts to suppress rationality from the discussion here at the Wiki, who instead chirp 'conspiracy theory', until <a href="../../../d/y/s/Dysphonia.html" title="Dysphonia">hoarse</a>, at the drop of a hat. But even more amazing is the way that the suppression of debate has kept other basic facts from being recognized as the facts essential for <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socratic_method.html" title="Socratic method">rational discourse</a>. The official 9/11 omission commission insinuation that mere carbon chain fuels, which are quite combustible at temperatures <i><a href="../../../f/a/h/Fahrenheit_451.html" title="Fahrenheit 451">in the mid 400s</a></i> (and unstable by their very nature), could even have begun to come close to the quadruple digit temperatures, necessary to melt the structural steel <a href="../../../a/l/l/Alloy.html" title="Alloy">alloys</a> of the WTC buildings, is a total farce. The scorched Earth campaign to suppress the ideas set forth by Don Paul, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Hoffman_a00e.html" title="Jim Hoffman">Jim Hoffman</a>, et al, is little more than the product of a sad campaign to empty the Wiki of rational content that would provide insights into the <a href="../../../f/a/h/Fahrenheit_9_11_5431.html" title="Fahrenheit 9/11">actual reality of 9/11</a>. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 19:25, 30 September 2006 (UTC) <small>— <b>Note to closing admin</b>: <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> (<a href="../../../o/m/b/User_talk%7EOmbudsman_43fa.html" title="User talk:Ombudsman">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ombudsman_192c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ombudsman">contribs</a>) is the creator of the article that is the subject of this AfD.</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm about to apply a personal test. I don't know how it will turn out. The issue here is not what happened on 9/11, but whether Don Paul is notable. I'm going to do a search of The New York Times and see whether it has ever mentioned him. If it has, in the context of his being a well-known 9/11 theorist, I'll vote <i>keep.</i> This is not to suggest that everyone ever named in The New York Times merits an article, nor that mention in the New York Times should be a requirement, but it's a good barometer of national notability, and in the case of 9/11 theories a New York paper would <i>certainly</i> be expected to cover anything remotely relevant. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 21:43, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> Search for "Don Paul" in The New York Times from 1/1/2000 to 9/29/3006 produces nine hits, none to this Don Paul. Seven are to the motion picture "The Road to El Dorado" and visual effects director <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0666802/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0666802/" rel="nofollow">Don Paul</a>, surely someone else. September 9, 2002: "Frankie Albert, a Pioneering Quarterback, Is Dead at 82," mentions "Don Paul, a Los Angeles Rams linebacker who was among the many defenders frustrated by Albert's deception, likened him to Fran Tarkenton." Not the same person. January 8, 2000: "Tom Fears, N.F.L. End and Coach, Dies at 77" mentions "As a former teammate, Don Paul, told The Los Angeles Times..." This is also likely the Rams linebacker. I can't believe that an important 9/11 theorist would not have been mentioned at all by <i>The New York Times,</i> if only in passing. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 21:51, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

Once the movement has been notable, it is up to the movement itself to define what is notable. Sex is notable, people in the sex-industry use the disgusting term Rusty trombone, hence, it is notable.

<dd>Striver, google testing is not as useful for web-related topics, and no, movements do not get to define what is notable within them by itself. (Again, if you want to AfD various sex stuff, go ahead) as for Darth Sidius, he was mentioned in multiple NYT articles including one a while back that discussed political symbolism of the character. Not an especially convincing example (if you wanted to get rid of stuff from the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_Expanded_Universe_9ad4.html" title="Star Wars Expanded Universe">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a> you might have a point- again AfD it if you feel that way). <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 16:37, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You are being ridiculous. Obviously not every group should be treated the same way. Math or science are reputable areas already with wide coverage and thus can to a large extent self-determine notability (note that even then for articles like the one in question- people- they have some difficulty with just that- see <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>) this is less the case for fringe topics and regardless of what you think of the 9/11 truth movement, they are a fringe and thus their community does not get automatically to decide notability- to put it another way, for something to be notable in a barely notable fringe it needs to be noticed by someone outside the fringe whereas if somethgin is from a mroe or less mainstream area of study it is reasonable to look for notability within that area. As to your comment about <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> it would only be a point violation if you were doing it to prove a point as such. If you a) genuinely think that these articles shouldn't be here, you are more than entitled to nominate them for AfD. Finally, please note that many of the 9/11 conspiracy related articls have stayed on Wiki and have survived deletion or not even been nominated. Some of them meet <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and some do not. In this case, there is less than compelling evidence that Don Paul does. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 18:05, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Don't Delete</b>. I personally work on this show, and it is one of the highest rated shows in our state. Yes, it is a high school show, but its production quality is higher than most shows on television. I volunteer my services there, along with many other people who have worked for larger production companies. I worked on shows such as, Northern Exposure, and adaptaion of The Fugitive for television. With an entry on wikipedia, letting other students and high schools know about such a widely recieved and popular show in Washington, could inspire them to create their versions of the basic show idea. And who could argue against giving kids some immortality, some national recognition for something, that in my professional opinion, is as good as or even better than most shows on TV today in production quality, writing quality, and acting.-<a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPrefonberry_0c79.html" title="User:Prefonberry">Prefonberry</a> 7:20 3 October 2006

<p>Sorry, I didn't realize there were such strict parameters for an artist's inclusion - that he has to be signed to a label (don't you think that's kind of silly? There are lots of highly-respected artists who only perform live and release their own cds and merit a spot on here). I'm afraid I don't know the name of the radio station he got airplay on because I never asked him.

<li>Okay, now I've <i>read</i> the article throughoutly and peeked at the history. My pondered conclusion is that it basically reads as "okay, let's start an article about this funny phrase I've read often." Other people go "Hmm, it <i>may</i> have something to do with this thing and that thing. And it <i>may</i> have started there. And here's some variations I've heard." While I'm probably the laxest end what comes to demanding sources for anything, and I'm not in favour of deleting articles solely for being "unverifiable", but I think this is a bad way of starting an article and only leads to sourceless speculation. Right now, there's basically no way to vounch this phrase is used widely, or even what its orgins were. That's the problem. It's no use listing what "may" be the source if all you can do is state "may", "may", "may"! What I think happened is this: People started, for some reason, imitate the Lyttle Lytton winner's phrase, cause it's funny. Then someone started an article: "Oh, said by one gamer to another", one says. "Probably originated in Counterstrike or Starcraft", says another. Or is it other way? <i>We don't know</i>. There's no research, even journalistic one, done exploring that thing! Please, let's not base articles entirely on conjecture (and quite obviously pulled-out-of-your-hat conjecture at that). And sorry for going on tangent like this. I don't try to offend anyone. I'm just saying this is not how articles are made. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 16:26, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>To the contrary, the article meets the proposed <a href="../../../c/%26/e/WP%7EC%26E_0633.html" title="WP:C&amp;E">WP:C&amp;E</a> standards for candidates and elections. I dispute the allegation that the article "reads like a campaign flyer." Its tone and word usage is neutral; it merely states facts: her background, experience, where she lives, and her endorsements, which, again, meets <a href="../../../c/%26/e/WP%7EC%26E_0633.html" title="WP:C&amp;E">WP:C&amp;E</a>. It reads more like a voter information guide than anything else. If anyone finds that a particular word or phrase in the article, as it is written now, indicates bias, please cite those words or phrases.

The proposition states: "articles on elections should be written before articles on individual candidates. Only if and when there is enough independent, verifiable information to write a non-stub article on a candidate should one be written." This isn't an article on the election (because that's not notable either), the information is not independent (as the sole source of the article is her campaign website), and it's barely verifiable as per the comment below given the lack of much info by Lexis-Nexis. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 21:28, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

This local election is noteworthy because it is an election for the legislative body of a major city; this is on par with an election for mayor. There are articles on Wikipedia on the local elections for similar legislative bodies of cities like <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portland%2C_Oregon_and_Metro_election%2C_2006_9845.html" title="Portland, Oregon and Metro election, 2006">Portland, Oregon</a>. Likewise, there is an article on the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Board_of_Supervisors_1e3b.html" title="San Francisco Board of Supervisors">San Francisco Board of Supervisors</a> and with the exception of two members, articles on each member of that the Board.

<li><b>Comment</b>:These improvements lessen the problem but since <a href="../../../c/%26/e/WP%7EC%26E_0633.html" title="WP:C&amp;E">WP:C&amp;E</a> is still only a proposition at this point, I will not rescend my AfD nomination, allowing the community and administrator to decide the article's ultimate fate. While your assertion of notability due to seated members having notability is compelling, Wikipedia article creation/edits should not be used to make a point. Also, simply because others are doing it doesn't make it acceptable policy either (and those articles may end up finding their own way to the AfD pages). One reason why candidate pages are more difficult to consider as notable/worthy is to consider the fact that <b>anyone</b> can become a candidate (barring technicalities for signing up). That's hardly notable, but winning the election is certainly notable (and thus why seated officials might have a page but candidates running against them might not). I hope that addresses some of your concerns for why this page may still go (although the election page looks very good and may stay). <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 17:38, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Campaign ad disguised as an article (Look! It even has a list of endorsements!) for a local politician who doesn't appear to well-known even locally. If and when she gets elected and does something notorious (and being on the SF Board of Supervisors gives plenty of scope for that), she can get an article, but she's not even close to rating one now. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 06:43, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>:This article states facts about the candidate. Again, anyone who claims that this article is an ad in disguise or is in any way biased, please point out the words or phrases that give that appearance. Endorsements are verifiable facts and should not be deemed promotional content. Endorsements typically appear in nonpartisan voter guides, and they can further <i>or</i> hinder a candidate's success. An endorsement from an organization with which a voter disagrees, for example, is a reason for that voter <i>not</i> to vote for a candidate. Inclusion of endorsements conforms with the <a href="../../../c/%26/e/WP%7EC%26E_0633.html" title="WP:C&amp;E">WP:C&amp;E</a> proposition. Although running for local public office does not confer notability by itself, when combined with a growing body of independent, verifiable information -- and yes, endorsements are a part of that -- notability emerges. And that's consistent with the <a href="../../../c/%26/e/WP%7EC%26E_0633.html" title="WP:C&amp;E">WP:C&amp;E</a> proposition. Further, a Google search of this candidate yields about 12,600 results, and given that this particular name combination is not all that common, it's likely that most of these results refer to her. To say that a local political candidate can only attain notability <i>after</i> winning the election is just as inaccurate as saying that simply running for local public office confers notability. --<a href="../../../w/a/t/User%7EWaterthedog_0768.html" title="User:Waterthedog">Waterthedog</a> 18:59, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I just finished going through the Survivor category and found over 20 that I think aren't notable enough, and will AFD. Basically, I think if they're not a winner, and have not done anything outside of the show major, then they're not notable. Also, compare it to the Amazing Race. Only one or two people has their own article a season. That's 1-2 out of 22. Survivor is usually 15-16 out of 16.</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The obsession among some wikipedians with deleting reality contestant biography articles en masse is both disturbing and truly puzzling. These shows are watched by millions of people, and their casts are known by their first names by millions, at least for a few months. Instead of deleting reality contestant articles, I would argue that an effort should be made to improve them and even add them for some contestants who SHOULD have pages and don't. Several participants on <a href="../../../a/l/l/Survivor%7E_All-Stars_7bd9.html" title="Survivor: All-Stars">Survivor: All-Stars</a>, for example, do not have pages, and all of them should. Kathy Vavrick-O'Brien, who finished third in her season and became wildly popular, is a prime example. For those of you who are seemingly obsessed with removing reality articles, I would suggest that you find something more worthwhile to worry about. Just because YOU don't think that somebody is notable doesn't make them non-notable. I would argue that reality contestants are notable simply for the fact that so many millions of people can refer to them by their first names. I would suggest that the trend to delete reality articles and refer to "Survivor hype" reflects more than a hint of bias against this form of entertainment. Thus, such deletions are by definition non-NPOV. MahlerFan 14:18, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. It seems that the band is on the borderline of being notable, but it's a terrible article. The text we have now is not even usable as a stub. Delete now, but resubmit if someone can do a proper article. Because of the current quality, as the last reviewer says, little would be lost if it is deleted. We do expect to see some *evidence* of notability in the article itself, not just in the assertion of a reviewer.

<p>3. The article is not notable. There are no independent reliable sources cited to show that this is a topic worthy of inclusion.</p>
<p>Rebuttal: Essentially, “we experience this primary force, this primary movement of existence, this primary act of creation, as the emotion we call love…When we use the term love here, we’re speaking of <b>unconditional love</b> (Kaufman, 2002).” This is a quote from Dr. Nikolai Kozyrev the first one to prepose a rudimentary philosophy of unconditonal love. The reference for this quote is: Kaufman, Steven (2002). "Unified Reality Theory: The Evolution of Existence into Experience". Milwaukee, WI: Destiny Toad Press. ppg 185,311... an independent and reliable source.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Dr. <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikolai_Kozyrev_aae4.html" title="Nikolai Kozyrev">Nikolai Kozyrev</a> is listed on WikiPedia as an accepted article. In that article, the author states: "His (Dr. Kozyrev's) nearly unified theory and aspects thereof, such as the durational/physical aspects of time itself and cause-effect systems, <b>have never been experimentally disproven to this day</b>. <i>The awesome implications of his work</i>..."</p>
<p>Within Wikipedia, itself, Dr. Kozyrev is listed and accepted as scientist whose works have "awesome implications" and whose identifications "have never been experimentally disproven". Such as source is both reliable and independent... and he was the first to assert a philosophy of unconditonal love.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Again, this misses the point. The article lists <i>no</i> third parties that even discuss the oneluv site or philosophy. An incidental use of the same term by Kaufman simply does not count. <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanno_733d.html" title="User:Banno">Banno</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>He uses the term "unconditional love", not "the philosophy of unconditional love." And he is by no means the first to describe such a concept, which has been <a href="../../../a/g/a/Agape.html" title="Agape">part of Christian philosophy</a> for centuries. What you would have to show (as I said on the article talk page) is that this article describes a philosophical school, the ideas and adherents of which have been recognized by someone other than yourself <i>as a school</i>. <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> 23:32, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Again, the name of the article is "philosophy of unconditional love" NOT OneLuv Philosophy... a highly reputable scientist stating that existence exists as unconditional love is both philosophical and significant... i.e. <i><b>metaphysics: the origin and nature of existence.</b></i></li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, the fact that the concept has been a part of Christian philosophy for centuries is more proof toward the fact that it is a viable, acceptable school of thought. Jpmorris2006 23:54, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I will repeat the criticism: there are no <b>independent reliable sources</b> cited to show that this is a topic worthy of inclusion. Especially damming in this regard is the complete absence of links to the key resource, the one love web site. <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanno_733d.html" title="User:Banno">Banno</a> 09:50, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Furthermore, much of the article contains links to other articles within WikiPedia, itself.</p>
<dl>

</ul>
<p>Thus, the grounds for deletion of this article are ungrounded and unsubstantiated.</p>
<p>It appears the editors of Wikipedia are dishonestly allowing their own personal beliefs to influence the content of Wikipedia as evidenced by the sarcastic remarks of one voter:</p>
<p>"<b>Delete</b> <i><b>that is the message the universe cries out to me</b></i> (as per WP:WEB and because it's OR) --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 23:08, 30 September 2006 (UTC)"...</p>
<p>And, further evidenced by the condescending remarks of another editor:</p>
<p>"...But I will continue to object to linking this page from the main Philosophy article, which is about the academic discipline and <i><b>not new age stuff such as this</b></i>. Banno 21:53, 27 September 2006 (UTC)"</p>
<p>Because such editors do not understand and/or agree with the assertions properly expressed in the article, they seem to be attempting to dismiss it as "unacceptable for Wikipedia". Yet, as shown above, the grounds for which they've made such claims are baseless. The article has and does operate within the guidelines expressed by those editors, themselves.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Anyone who has passed philosophy 101 would be able to drive a bus through the holes in the metaphysics presented in this article. Take it to any of the serious philosophy forums and see what they say. <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanno_733d.html" title="User:Banno">Banno</a> 11:27, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yet, continued attempts to delete the article have been made. Thus, it is quite clear that because the article conflicts with the editors' personal beliefs, they are attempting to dishonestly remove it and its value from Wikipedia to satisfy their own personal cravings for "rigteousness" and pseudo self-esteems.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, as an admin I might have deleted it as patent nonsense, and I doubt anyone would have noticed. Instead I will let it go through the due process; and ignore the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html#AfD_etiquette" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">personal attack</a> implicit in your comment. <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanno_733d.html" title="User:Banno">Banno</a> 11:27, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>However, such dishonest editors are not without redemption. Upon seeing and understanding the full scope of facts as presented here, each editor has the ability to undo his/her dishonesties and choose an honest path. Upon seeing the full scope of facts, each editor has the inherent right to change his/her vote to reflect a <b>Neutral Point of View</b>... NOT one's own skewed personal beliefs or views.</p>

<dd>First off - calling other editors liars is not really the best way to try and get people to change their mind. Secondly while some of the sources quoted in that article are good (leaving aside the crank websites), the synthesis of them presented within that article is OR by a non-notable figure on a non-notable website. Can you point towards an article or a book that reviews or discusses the theory (NOT the sources but the emerging theory) as presented on that webpage? --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 21:00, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Let's see... on the philosophy page, you as editors do your best to present the concept of "philosophy" to people who want to know more. While, you're not perfect... you do your best. You're not notable, nor do you own any notable sites on philosophy (if you do, by chance, it means nothing to wikipedia... that's not the point of it)</li>

<p>I do my best to try to present the philosophy of unconditional love to people who want to learn more. I'm no perfect, but I do my best. I'm NOT notable nor do I own a notable website about it. But, I don't have to be... I'm an editor NOT a source.Jpmorris2006 23:54, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Finally, I've read over the edits that the author of OneLuv Philosophy made to the page. They don't try to pump HIS philosophy. They simple clarify the philosophy of unconditional love... two different things! Jpmorris2006 23:54, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> The references on the oneluv website and in the article do not adequately support either the ideas in the article or the claim that the 'philosophy of unconditional love' is an established theory.

It is not!! Any claims to the contrary are preposterously misleading and false!! You cannot simply write an article and say "the philosophy of doodoo" is that branch of philosophy which studies the multifarious aspects of human waste, the form, the color, the criteria of individuation (where does the crap end and where does it begin).

<dd>Ok, all in all, here's the situation. There are basically two <b>relevent</b> references here. One is to the webpage of someone named Jaye. It is not a book, an article in a serious journal, a magazine....It is just a webpage with his original research on it. Umm....my 14-year-old niece is working on a similar project. The other is to another webpage which does not really discuss "philosophy of unconditional love", but some related theories about some mysterious energy and the ether that permeates the universe. If this article stays, then I will create a blog this afternoon and post some original ideas about counterfactual hate and the origins of time and will request an article on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacatosias_a9d0.html" title="User:Lacatosias">Francesco Franco</a> 10:50, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Such attacks (riddled with misspellings and grammatical errors) make no point and serve no purpose... and only point out the childish nature of such editors. Furthermore, with such editors as the "experts" of Wikipedia, "we might as well drop any pretence of developing a serious encyclopedia".</p>
<p>Aristotle identified that the most important "cause" of any existent is its final cause -- its purpose. What is the final cause of such editors? What purpose do they serve?

<p>Keep---As the author states, this is in the beginning stages of development...the beginning of the study of "Philosophy of Unconditional Love." Every conclusion has a beginning idea, that leads to a hypothosis, which is in turned studied and either proven true or not true. As stated previously on this page, some studies have been noted back to early Christian philosopy and more recently by the authors cited by Jaye. In all of the comments on this page about why to delete this there are not any legitimate reasons. It seems as if those opposed to this article do not understand the definition of philosophy and what it means to think outside the box to research an unfamiliar area. I have read all of the information on this website and on the author's website and I feel that is well researched. This is not a self-promoting article and the author is not try to gain anything personal on this website. This article needs to remain on the website and should not be discriminated against because it is a touchy subject. Looking forward to more from this author...JKalea</p>

However, the main problem with this article currently is that it lacks content and it would be impossible to expand this article further (unless the number of players involved in both these clubs increases tremendously in the future).

<p>Granted, you make several good points.</p>
<p>Ted is neither a household name nor remotely as popular as other internet memes, like Chuck Norris, Mr. T, or David Hasselhoff. However, I first submit his YouTube channel <a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=TedJesusChristGod" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=TedJesusChristGod" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> as evidence upon his behalf, and additionally argue erroneously and irreverently that if I myself had 587 actual returns on Google, I would feel like an internet meme.</p>
<p>Additionally, and more likely to be of any persuasion, I admit that my little article on Ted is in no way authoritive or complete. However, I do think Ted holds just as much weight as the Longniddry railway station and its article<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longniddry_railway_station" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longniddry_railway_station" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>. Yet, Longriddry railway station receives a stub alert and invites Wikipedians to improve it and make it better, while mine is, after epochs of hard keyboard labor and toil, proposed for deletion in under two minutes. And I know how important Neomphalida are, and why they deserve their own Wikipedian article, I'm just proposing that maybe, since Ted is (probably) just as famous - if not more so - as Neomphalida <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neomphalida" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neomphalida" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> are, that he be allowed to remain. Believe me, if I had any information which I could use to flesh out Longniddry railway station's article, I would hasten to add it, but alas I do not. Instead, I am merely trying to add yet another article on a person who can be, on some not insignificant level, considered a "religious (potentially weirdo cultist schizophrenic?) figure".</p>
<p>I know, it's that eternal argument about Wikipedian censorship, but I'm willing to argue that Ted Jesus Christ GOD is just as worthy of a short Wikipedian article of approximately 10kb in size as anyone else already listed on Wikipedia's article of people who have claimed to be Jesus Christ (which I did not add, may I add)<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_who_claim_to_be_Jesus_Christ" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_who_claim_to_be_Jesus_Christ" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe it's time for Ted to finally have his own 15kb article? He's listed on several already. I for one consider him to be just as valuable to Wikipedia as Matayoshi Jesus <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matayoshi_Jesus" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matayoshi_Jesus" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>.</p>
<p>I'm just thankful that my article on Australian Green Tree Ants is still going strong.</p>

<dd>I thought that it was okay to use self-published sources as long as its in conjunction with an article on the same person. Such as Ted's website for a Wikipedian article on Ted.</dd>

<dd>Material from self-published sources, whether published online or as a book or pamphlet, may be used as sources of information about themselves in articles about themselves, so long as there is no reasonable doubt about who wrote it, and where the material is one of the following:</dd>
</dl>

<dd>relevant to the person's notability, or, if the material is self-published by a group or organisation, relevant to the notability of that group or organisation or not contentious, such as basic biographical information.

<dd><b>About self-published articles as sources:</b> Please take it in context. <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> goes on to say:</dd>
<dd>it should also be:

<li><b>not unduly self-serving or self-aggrandizing</b>;</li>
<li>about the subject only, and does not involve claims about third parties, or about events not directly related to the subject;</li>
<li>subject to verification by other sources.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Self-published material should always be reported as the POV of the publisher, and <b>not as general fact</b>, until such time as there is independent corroboration of that material. The reputation of the self-publisher is a guide to whether the material rises to the level of notability at all.</dd>
<dd><b>In general, if a self-published source is reliable, then other reliable sources will cite it, until then, it should be avoided.</b></dd>

To quote the article:
<blockquote>
<p>The title Earl of Lerwick" was created in 1987 in the Peerage of Scotland for Martin Lotherey. He purchased the name purely as a symbol of his wealth, the title has no significance in royal circles and does not give the beholder the honour of parading their coats of arms for the parading monarch At the moment, the Earlship is held by George, Earl of Lerwick, originating in the central belt of Scotland, and was renewed on 25/09/2006.<br />
George, First Earl of Lerwick, claimed the title recently after aquiring it in internet auction, and although he has the considerable authority of using the name therin with credit card, bank statements, and all other identification it cannot be used to buy property and has no royal significance.</p>
</blockquote>
I believe this is a hoax, but even if it is not, it certainly fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> so far as either "Earl" is concerned. Whichever is the case, "Earl of Lerwick" produces zero ghits and zero gbooks hits and thus the article is not <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 00:10, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>This <b>keep</b> closure was endorsed by deletion review because the 4th nomination was very recent. The closer was a non-admin with a conflict of interest, however, so his accusation of bad faith is stricken. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 15:03, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Does not follow encyclopedic format</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>: Please let this nomination stand. Bad faith? I dont think so because the last two were too quickly deleted and we did not have a good count because of it. It was said most people at first keep, and later people who see this page delete. I think the page was too quickly deleted before people really read the arguements. If you don't agree fine, but thats what I see happend.</li>
</ul>
<p>My reason for delete is that Gore III is not a public figure, and is only on here because of his arrests or his accident. He has never been mentioned on the news otherwise, and will never be heard from again unless he gets arrested again. He would not be in a 'real' encyclopedia.
