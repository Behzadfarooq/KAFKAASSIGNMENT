<li>Nonnotable. Abram Kamensky was Molotov's supervisor during early years of revolution. He charted the Soviet Republics. He funded the red army. Later he was demoted to somewhat lower posts by Stalin, because of having briefly joined the Trotskyst opposition. Finally he was beaten to death while imprisoned by Stalin's chief of the KGB, Lavrenty Beria. This is an important piece of history.
<ul>
<li>There were millions of bolsheviks who were each other's supervisors. Molotov was young sometime and over time had several stacks of supervisors hardly making all them notable for this reason. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 17:41, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Vanity. That is slander, and goes against the "assume good intent" Wikipedia policy. Unprovable, since the subject of the article is notable. I believe that this accusation is motivated by personal bias.
<ul>
<li>Vanity is a shorthand term in wikipedia VfD to describe articles that dwell upon a person or company withouit establishing notability. Personal bias: I am dealing with thousands of editors here. I have no time to develop personal bias to them and you are not that distinctive (of course you may call the latter phrase "bias"; I can live with this). <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 17:41, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Original research. The article is based on some old Soviet newspaper article. You can't call it research since it is written by a descendant.

<li>You still refuse to read wikipedia recommended wikipedia policies, <a href="../../../o/r/i/Wikipedia%7EOriginal_research_757d.html" title="Wikipedia:Original research">Wikipedia:original research</a> in this case. I have no reasons to believe that you remember well the contents of this "some old" article.

<li>The fact that I am a descendant is irrelevant. Each contributor writes about things that are meaningful to them. What is relevant that it is valuable information.
<ul>
<li>The fact is relevant: it gives at least minimal credibility: a descendant is supposed to know his parents, but on the other hand his problem is bias. "valuable information": once again, please read wikipedia policies: valuable information must be verifiable. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 17:38, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am a new user. My other contributions, Intelligent (the Russian noun), category Soviet Intelligentsia were deleted. While I consider all my contributions to be of high quality and relevance, I don't see why would I want to continue contributing to Wikipedia after everything I come up with is blocked. This is a violation of Wikipedia policy against discouraging new users.</li>
<li>I was unaware of how things are run on this resource that the public opinion is rigged. I should have known better having some experience with internet communities. But apperantly I got a different impression from Wikipedia's promotional slogans. I though this is more of an information buffet, not virtual socialism. If you vote to delete this article, please do me a favor and delete my other article <a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleksander_Kamensky_36eb.html" title="Aleksander Kamensky">Aleksander Kamensky</a>, and my Wikipedia account.

<li>If I thought <a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleksander_Kamensky_36eb.html" title="Aleksander Kamensky">Aleksander Kamensky</a> was nonnotable, we would be voting on it long time ago. Don't take this personal and try to address the criticism instead.

<p><b>Conditional keep:</b> If he is notable, it doesn't come across in the article — just one of countless (unfortunate) casualties. However, the additional information from the author, below, does seem notable. Assuming it's factual, the author should add it to the article. Just a suggestion, but I'd change the tone of the article away from reading like a family history piece and make it read more like a neutral observation — avoiding judgmental descriptions like "heroic" and "slaughtered." Maybe more about the man and what he did and less emphasis on his less-notable decendants. — <a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMaylett_1b3a.html" title="User:Maylett">Cory Maylett</a> 17:58, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Comment: I agree, and I was planning to add some more information later. I just created the article, and <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> was on it within <b>seconds</b>, before I even had the chance to make a few edits. I believe that the purpose of an encyclopedia is not only to inform but also to entertain. That's why my writing style is not dry. It has nothing to do with vanity. The facts sink in better when they are presented as a narrative.</li>

<li><b>Conditional Keep</b>. I don't see a strong case for notability as of yet, and right now much of the article is not verifiable... but it's existed for a matter of hours here. I've found vague reference to Abram Kemensky (with a date of death in '38 not '37 shown in the article... but surely the same person) crawling the web. I'm going to say this article should stay for now; give the author a chance to make a case for it's inclusion. If in say 60 days there is not a greater assertion of notability, then perhaps bring it back for AfD.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:39, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: the reference you found is probably the entry in the summary Russian Jewish Encyclopedia cited above. There are apparantly some mistakes. For example Aleksander Kamensky is referred to as Artist, while he was an Art Critic. When data gets transmitted from Russia, much is lost in careless translation.</li>

He was also involved in the founding of the short-lived Donetsko-Krivorogian Soviet Republic. So he was indeed an "old Bolshevik", possibly modestly notable in the very early days of the Russian Revolution, though somewhat obscure by the time of his arrest and death. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 21:20, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Is there any guarantee we are speaking about the same person? What you've found does not match the article. That is the whole problem and reason for VfD: the <b>article</b> is not <b>verifiable</b>. While the scraps over the net (I've seen all this myself, I know google, thanks) do not make into a reasonable article. Not to say a rank and file Bolshevik bureaucrat even found on net is hardly notable. 22:39, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am OK with waiting extra 60 days per Isotope (although I don't remember anything like this for other vanity pages), but something says me it will not help. The only person who could be really interested in doing this decided to go berserk instead of convincing us by providing solid info. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 22:44, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
