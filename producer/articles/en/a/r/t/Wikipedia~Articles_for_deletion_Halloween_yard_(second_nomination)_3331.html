<li>I have no access to the original text. All I can say is that it is substantially similar, and similarly lacking in anything notable. Since it was the author who speedied it I think I am right that it has to come to AfD, but am happy to be corrected. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 16:47, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Actually this is now getting complex. The author has overwritten the article with another article substantially different in nature, <b>removing the AfD banner</b>. Please see the edit history. I have reinstated the banner but feel that I need to leave this to an experienced admin to sort out. Thus I will only take further part in this AfD on request of an admin in case an edit or revert war should start.

<dd>User Fiddle Faddle, i restored to the article version which has been newly created, based on the previous articles. <b>I considered it as vandalism to shorten the article this far</b>. Please see article history. Your deletion nomination refers to the wrong discussion. Guess this is obvious. <a href="../../../y/y/-/User%7EYy-bo_c77b.html" title="User:Yy-bo">User:Yy-bo</a> 17:04, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>, there is nothing called a "Halloween yard." Some people decorate their yards on Halloween, (and how they do so is adequately covered at <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halloween.html" title="Halloween">Halloween</a>) but we don't have an article called Christmas living room for the same reason we shouldn't have one here. That reason is that the concept of a yard during Halloween is not considered seperate enough from the general concept of <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halloween.html" title="Halloween">Halloween</a> in the same way that, say, a <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_O%27Lantern_b598.html" title="Jack O'Lantern">Jack O'Lantern</a> is. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 17:26, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"Not considered separate enough" by who? Actually, we do have quite a strong precedent for this, with articles such as <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_stocking.html" title="Christmas stocking">Christmas stocking</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_card.html" title="Christmas card">Christmas card</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmastime_greetings.html" title="Christmastime greetings">Christmastime greetings</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/s/Wassailing.html" title="Wassailing">Wassailing</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mistletoe.html" title="Mistletoe">Mistletoe</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_cookies.html" title="Christmas cookies">Christmas cookies</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_cake.html" title="Christmas cake">Christmas cake</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_ham.html" title="Christmas ham">Christmas ham</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_pudding.html" title="Christmas pudding">Christmas pudding</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_cracker.html" title="Christmas cracker">Christmas cracker</a>, <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twelve-dish_Christmas_Eve_supper_25c3.html" title="Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper">Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_dinner.html" title="Christmas dinner">Christmas dinner</a>, <a href="../../../y/u/l/Yule_log.html" title="Yule log">Yule log</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secret_Santa_e2a2.html" title="Secret Santa">Secret Santa</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Claus_parade_3147.html" title="Santa Claus parade">Santa Claus parade</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_village.html" title="Christmas village">Christmas village</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_carol.html" title="Christmas carol">Christmas carol</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_ornament.html" title="Christmas ornament">Christmas ornament</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_tree.html" title="Christmas tree">Christmas tree</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_lights.html" title="Christmas lights">Christmas lights</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas_pickle.html" title="Christmas pickle">Christmas pickle</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nativity_scene.html" title="Nativity scene">Nativity scene</a>, and American Christmas traditions, just to name a few. (Yes, there are <i>many</i> more.) I don't see anyone rushing to merge these articles into <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a>.

<dd>Since that phrase is something you just contrived for the sake of argument, there's no analogy. "Halloween yard" is a well known phenomena (gets <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22halloween+yard%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22halloween+yard%22" rel="nofollow">34,300 Google hits</a>.

<dd>The analogy is pretty obvious: Holiday + AreaThatIsDecorated is not a valid topic for an article. The decorations themselves are valid topics, but this is not. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 19:12, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> per wikipediatrix. It a legitimate topic, and the article is definitely expandable. There's a whole industry dedicated to making Halloween decorations to put on your lawn.
