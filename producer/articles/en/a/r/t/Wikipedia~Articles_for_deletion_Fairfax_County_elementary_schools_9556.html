<li><b>Split</b> Basically the same text is already on the Fairfax County schools page. This page was created as a result of an AFD discussion on many of the elementary schools. They all had their own pages, they were listed for AFD as non-notable, and this was the supposedly better result. The middle schools of Fairfax also had AFD discussions regarding their notability; however the outcomes were keep and no consensus. On the elementary schools, I am all for them having their own articles. <a href="../../../k/e/e/User%7EKeepOnTruckin_39c2.html" title="User:KeepOnTruckin">KeepOnTruckin</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../k/e/e/User_talk%7EKeepOnTruckin_49f9.html" title="User talk:KeepOnTruckin">Complain to me</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_KeepOnTruckin_722b.html" title="Special:Contributions/KeepOnTruckin">my work here</a></sup></small> 03:57, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> The Fairfax Public Schools article is one of the better school district articles we have, and coverage of that county's many schools is extremely good. I get the strong impression from all the work done there that this list is the beginning of a more detailed article on elementary schools in the district and that individual school articles may be calved off from this glacier as information about them is added (the opposite also applies: if you have a bad elementary school article, this would be the place to merge it with, since Fairfax Public Schools has too many schools for one article to fit descriptions of all of them).</p>
<p>Given the effort demonstrated in so many other Fairfax Public Schools articles, if an editor tells us this is the beginning of an article where more and more information on elementary schools will be supplied, let's step aside and let it happen. It's hard to believe that some reader is going to search out this particular subject and then be disappointed by what appears on the screen, so there's no harm in us waiting. But I won't vote "Keep" unless someone can give us a good idea of what is planned for this article.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 15:18, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

This is just a list of schools that would be better located on the district's website.

<li><b>Delete</b> this. There is no reason at all to upmerge this any further, do not do that. I support creating articles for the school provided they establish notability though. This is at best a non-notable list.--<a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardman_4d38.html" title="User:Wizardman"><span style="color:#0D0;background:#006">Wizardman</span></a> 02:25, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Typically, articles on individual elementary schools are not usually considered notable, despite some continuing objections. Since they aren't notable by themselves, this is the practical solution. I note the discussion, where some want this article deleted because there should be no articles on them at all, and some that it should be deleted because each of the schools should have an article. This is the reasonable compromise, and it would be unfortunate if it were to be deleted for opposing incompatible reasons. The article should, and probably will, be expanded beyond a mere list. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 03:48, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
