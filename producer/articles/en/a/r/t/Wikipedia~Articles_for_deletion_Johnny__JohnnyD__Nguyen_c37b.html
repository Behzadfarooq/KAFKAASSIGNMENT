<p>Apparently non-notable, only sources are his own corporate websites, YouTube or myspace, and half of the links are dead. No google hits for "Johnny 'johnnyD' Nguyen" and googling for simply "Johnny Nguyen" leads to many people and myspace profiles. Also a probably COI with rather spammy language. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 07:39, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Additional information: IMDB filmography states no roles in several of the notable movies listed, including The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 07:42, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You obviously have something against the guy just because he has accomplished so much more than you in your pitiful lifespan. All of the sources can be verified. Look at the Kelly Hu and Grace Park videos on the credits--they've just been uploaded. He is listed as producer in the end credits. Also, as for Fast and Furious 3, he is a tea hair in the movie. Look at the screenshot I posted. He's right there next to one of the leads. How dare you say otherwise. IMDB is going to update the page soon, because info was recently submitted for Johnny to be in the listing, credited or uncredited.</p>
<p><br />
His OWN corporate websites? Are you smoking crack? There is only one corporate website we made and it's a myspace. All the others were created by third party people we're associated with... Parc Landon, Thirteen Minutes, Rival Entertainment... contact them all. I dare you. By all means, I invite you to ask and verify Johnny's authenticity. Half the links are dead? Name which ones and I'll fix it. Oh, you can't? Probably because you're lying then. And ask all those people on myspace profiles if they know Johnny and they'll tell you he's a genuine guy that they love to work with.</p>
<p>Don't be jealous--you're just a hater. All his affiliations can be verified by simply calling the places and seeing if he works there. He works very hard for what he has attained, including teaching children sing in a choir, for church services every sunday. So know your info before you start speaking blasphemy. In fact, if you keep at it, I'll make sure of it that our lawyers hear of this slander and defamation of character.

<li><i><s>Comment</s>Autobiography and self-promotion are not the routes to having an encyclopaedia article. The published works must be someone else writing about the person. (See Wikipedia:Autobiography for the verifiability and neutrality problems that affect material where the subject of the article itself is the source of the material.) The barometer of notability is whether people independent of the subject itself have actually considered the subject notable enough that they have written and published non-trivial works that focus upon it.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>It is notable. He did not write this himself--it is not self promotion. I am writing about him, because his achievements are note-worthy. Jujube, you're just another hater. Pathetic rebuttal? DO YOUR RESEARCH. Make some calls around, instead of sitting at your computer all day, doing nothing but insulting other people. Make calls to Universal--ask if Johnny was in the cast of Fast and the Furious 3.</p>
<p>Ouro, insufficently sourced? I linked everything. Your claim is just a inefficiently backed up statement. It's fallacy at its best. Make a phone call or two and see if I'm lying. Call Rival Entertainment and ask if Johnny works there. Call Parc Landon. Call Thirteen Minutes magazine. If you people can't do that, how can you people call yourself researchers on Wikipedia? It's just disheartening when you the world is reduced to people who can't even do research outside of the "INTERNET" to finagle their sources. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.136.82.207 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.136.82.207.html" title="User talk:24.136.82.207">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.136.82.207_a944.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.136.82.207">contribs</a>) 13:38, 22 January 2007.</small></p>

<dd>24.136.82.207 - Firstly, you should sign your comments by typing "~~~~" (without the quotes) at the end. Second - you're only looking at one part of the policy - in full, the statement is that:</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.
<ul>
<li>This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, magazine articles, books, scholarly papers, and television documentaries <b>except</b> for the following:
<ul>
<li>Media reprints of the person's autobiography or self-promotional works.</li>
<li>Works carrying merely trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that just mention the person in passing, telephone directory listings, or simple records of births and deaths.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>The dispute is not whether the subject of the article actually exists, or has actually held the positions and done the things claimed. Even if the article content is entirely true, the subject still appears to fail the main criterion of notability - namely <b>multiple, <i>non-trivial</i></b>, <b>independent</b> published works. Most of the published works I found were of the "reprint" or "trivial coverage" variety (as noted in the above criteria). Are there newspaper articles (not promotional leaflets, but say an interview in USA Today or even a local daily newspaper) that you can link to? --<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a><a href="../../../i/n/k/User_talk%7EInkypaws_d8f4.html" title="User talk:Inkypaws"><sup>T</sup></a> 21:00, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comments to the above</b> If sources can be found, I agree completely that this should be kept, but a cursory examination found literally nothing, no google hits for the exact title and many irrelevant ones for the simple name, in addition, I doubt some of those roles were his at all, they do not appear on the IMDB filmography.</dd>
<dd>To the first poster: Remember that importance and notability are not the same things. People can be very important, to a few or to many people, without having notability or enough verifiable sources to be encyclopedic material. If you can assert notability with reliable third-party sources providing a context and asserting how the subject is notable per the guidelines <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Wikipedia notability</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">Biographies</a> then I will happily withdraw the nomination and help improve the article, but nothing I've seen to this point or been able to find on my own asserts that importance. In order for information to be verifiable per the guideline <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> the information must be accessible. Having wikizens making phone calls would be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Original research</a>, we need sources we can all access. Also, and I hesitate to mention, but some of your statements could be construed as <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> or <a href="../../../l/e/g/WP%7ELEGAL_8608.html" title="WP:LEGAL">legal threats</a> I welcome your input, and I don't want to see it discounted because of your choice of words. As to the dead links, all of the links from 13 Minutes under "producer credits" lead to "stream cannot be found." <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 22:07, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> The filmography has large movies - and no evidence he was in any of them. Checking the biggest three movies on the list, he does not show up in the IMDB listings for Dodgeball, the Hot Chick or Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. In fact, for someone apparently with so many appearances, he has no page at all on IMDB. Google does not reveal any evidence that he was in these movies. Frankly, I believe that entire section is a hoax designed to invent notability for an article that is designed to promote a nn individual. This is spam masquerading as an article. Even if he was notable, this article would have to be blown up, disenfected, and rewritten from scratch. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 04:12, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Tony Fox, I've taken down his filmography section because that seemed to be of major dispute. But as you can see, he was in the Fast and the Furious 3. I even posted a screenshot from the film with him and the film's leading star. What else more do you want? But anyways, I took the filmography down so no more disputes can arise from all this.</p>
<p>Wintermut3, sorry about all the choice words--it's just that I spent a long time writing that article on Johnny and everything was true, so when you got on my case, I went off. As for the dead link, click on them again, and as you can see to the right, if you click Kelly Hu and Grace Park, that will lead to their interviews. As well, Johnny's name is listed in the end credits as PRODUCER.</p>
<p>Ohconfucious, that is a different Johnny Nguyen. He's primarily an actor that one of my friends has worked with. This is JohnnyD that we're referring to. 24.136.82.207 21:54, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
