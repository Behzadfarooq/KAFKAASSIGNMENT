<p>I disagree with the accusations that the article "Wolftime" as well as the article "Silhouettes" fail WP:CORP. I view them rather as descriptions of the endeavors of entrepreneurial teenage filmmakers, including the mentioned Kevin Walker. I also view it as irrelevant the the official website is hosted by GeoCities, since the company still has a domain name registered on the WHOIS database. Thus, I do not believe the mentioned articles should be subject to deletion. Keep in mind that Wolftime is an independent company, and likely doesn't make a profit. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Kevinw91 (<a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevinw91_e3d1.html" title="User talk:Kevinw91">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kevinw91_b94f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kevinw91">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>I would like to mention that Wolftime has made three films, has won two awards in esteemed film festivals with three nominations. The score for their latest film was written by a professional film composer who has made collaborations with such names as Bill Clinton, Sophia Loren, and Antonio Banderas (see beintus.com). Wolftime Films is a legitimate company, and the article is in no way intended to be a sales pitch or a marketing ploy, since the organization does not make a profit. I view it as inadvertent prejudice that the company is marked as illegitimate based on the appearance and Google rankings of their site.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Kevinw91 (<a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevinw91_e3d1.html" title="User talk:Kevinw91">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kevinw91_b94f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kevinw91">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Delete</b> The company and film are not "illegitimate", merely non-notable. Seriously, these are films that only a tiny number of people will ever see or even hear of. The fact that a web search doesn't find any of them outside wofltime's geocities page says that pretty much no one has even taken notice of them, and that they, and their awards, are <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>. Wikipedia does not exist to help encourage or publicize unknown entrepreneurs, teenage or otherwise. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 01:25, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Wolftime site receives over 60 hits daily as recorded by both Yahoo! statistics and Google Analytics statistics, and the site has been viewn by users from around the world. The films have been watched an appreciated by hundreds, who access the site via the domain wolftime.com. I cannot comprehend why one would take so much time and effort to try to remove a legitimate article from Wikipedia. There is nothing abusive or market-driven in the article, and I believe the users pursuing the deletion should respect this independent production company.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Kevinw91 (<a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevinw91_e3d1.html" title="User talk:Kevinw91">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kevinw91_b94f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kevinw91">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>May I request the cause of your pressing concerns for the deletion of the Wolftime-related articles? Perhaps some compromise can be made.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Kevinw91 (<a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevinw91_e3d1.html" title="User talk:Kevinw91">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kevinw91_b94f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kevinw91">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>According to the Wikipedia guidelines: "The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself. This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations..." Considering the vast audience of Wolftime Films, I believe it complies with the Wikipedia requirements for notability.</p>
<p>The films have been published outside of Wolftime.com in numerous notable film festivals.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Kevinw91 (<a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevinw91_e3d1.html" title="User talk:Kevinw91">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kevinw91_b94f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kevinw91">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>I do feel that this whole debate is harsh an illogical. Would somebody please explain why these users are so adamantly concerned with this matter. The inclusion of the articles would not harm anybody (except perhaps the users who care so much about deleting them). Wolftime films has been viewed by public audiences, included in a number of publications regarding film festivals the movies have appeared in, including city government publications.

<p>Let's end this debate, keep the Wolftime article, and as a compromise delete the Silhouettes article.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> It is not just your company. There are thousands of aspiring filmmakers trying to gain some exposure by listing their short films here. Films which may have been screened at a festival or two, but have hardly been reviewed anywhere, written up anywhere, noticed anywhere. Most have received more notice than your films, which seem to have received none at all. Wikipedia does not exist to promote unknown people or enterprises, but to document those which have already become notable. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 02:01, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>By the way, the claim by Kinu that the article violates WP:VANITY is ad hominim, a court term proving that "an argument is an attack again against the person." I am afraid to say that the user does not have credibility in the debate, considering this serious violation of argumentative ethics. Kevinw91 02:01, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I'll leave it to the other editors to determine whether it is too much of a stretch to suggest that User:Kevinw91 is the same "Kevin Walker" named in the article. --<font face="Book Antiqua"><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu"><font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu"><font color="red"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 02:04, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Yes, my name is Kevin Walker (I apologize if it seemed that I was trying to hide that). Nice to meet you. Allow me to again reiterate that this is not an unknown company, nor an unknown film. They have received a great deal of attention by hundreds of people. Perhaps I can get you to see the latest one, "Silhouettes?" Kevinw91</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. You've spent enough time trying to do that in the article itself. By the way, someone saying the company or film fails <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a> isn't an <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> attack. S/he's not calling you vain, s/he's referring to a policy (that s/he didn't write) which happens to bear that name. What's the argumentative ethics term for being really disingenuous again? - <a href="../../../w/_/g/User%7EW_guice_dd47.html" title="User:W guice">W guice</a> 02:19, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact is that s/he cited a Wikipedia requirement against vanity. Thus, s/he is citing the article I wrote as vain. Kevinw91</p>
<p>I would like to draw attention to one of my previous comments supporting Wolftime as a legitimate company enjoyed by the public and, just like the other filmmakers you mentioned, has been featured in "one or more film festivals": Wolftime has made three films, has won two awards in esteemed film festivals with three nominations. The score for their latest film was written by a professional film composer who has made collaborations with such names as Bill Clinton, Sophia Loren, and Antonio Banderas (see beintus.com). Kevinw91</p>
<p>Let me mention as well that the article was not trying to market "Silhouettes." W guice, "You've spent enough time trying to do that in the article itself." That is certainly an ad hominim, sarcastic attack. Kevinw91</p>
<p>I am arguing for the inclusion of the articles because it is my life ambition. You are arguing for their deletion because you feel contempt against my company. Can you please expain why. Kevinw91</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Even if we were to set notability totally aside (which we won't), the #1 ironclad rule here is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a> from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">Reliable Sources</a>. That one's non-negotiable. We have here an article written by you, about your company, and the only source is a website created by you. No other source is available to verify that these films have been shown anywhere. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 02:32, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I assure you the world will be the same place if you let this go. I urge you to spend time on more important matters (matters I would be attending to if it weren't for this debate). Keep in mind that any profit that Wolftime makes goes to charity. By the way: <a href="http://berkeleyvideofilmfest.org/" class="external free" title="http://berkeleyvideofilmfest.org/" rel="nofollow">http://berkeleyvideofilmfest.org/</a> search the page for "Teen Planet." I'll look for more verifiable links. Kevinw91</p>
<p>That picture is of me and my co-director receiving an award in front of hundreds of people in a UC Berkeley auditorium for the screening of "Teen Planet," a Wolftime film. Though it's not a great picture of me (lol). Kevinw91</p>
<p>Oh, I'm sorry, was that last comment a violation of WP:VANITY? Kevinw91</p>
<p>Here is a link for you to view "Silhouettes." I hope you enjoy it. I apologize for taking two and a half hours of your time, but I just want you to take this company seriously. <a href="http://www.geocities.com/wolftimefilms/media/films/silhouettes/silhouettes_medium.mov" class="external free" title="http://www.geocities.com/wolftimefilms/media/films/silhouettes/silhouettes_medium.mov" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/wolftimefilms/media/films/silhouettes/silhouettes_medium.mov</a> Kevinw91</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Taking you seriously is not the issue. Wikipedia does not exist to promote unknown ventures. Period. The result of this AfD was never in doubt from the moment it was posted.

<p>You can't be serious! I have given you a link to verify the company. I have even offered a compromise. Can we please close this discussion, I have a lot to do regarding this film. It has an estimated site circulation of 220 people in the next three days surrounding the film's premiere. Kevinw91</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the purpose of Wikipedia is to have lots of articles detailing practically everything in the world. This includes independent production companies, and in my case, a legitimate, verified company. Would you please give me your phone number if you wish to debate this in person. Kevinw91</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Nothing further (such as a link to a encyclopedia policy or notability guideline) can be suggested that has not already been mentioned at least once herein.

<p>How am I to verify that the films have been mentioned in print? What I am dealing with is bureaucracy. Unfortunately, I have lost a great deal of respect for the Wikipedia system because of this. Again, if you truly care so much about removing an insignificant article about Wolftime Films, please give me your number so we can talk in person, otherwise we will be here all night. Kevinw91</p>

<li>No we won't. I have other things to do tonight, and I'll repeat: continuing this discussion will make no difference. We have policies. You don't like them. That's it. Best of luck. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a></li>

<li><b>Different Tack</b> Have you been in a newspaper or magazine article, or is your film on imdb, or something that would imply that anyone other than you knows anything about this? You don't know if you have or not? Whenever I'm in the paper, my Mom cuts out the article and sends it to me, and so do 15 other people. Lots of times, the publisher will let you know if you have a mention. If you don't know whether you've been covered, than you probably haven't. Did these festivals have materials or webpages or anything like that? The problem isn't that you're writing about yourself; the problem is that only you have been writing about yourself. If you do, then you'll probably be fine. If not, then your company probably isn't ready to be included yet. rather than talking about <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> or the badly named <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVanity_6666.html" title="WP:Vanity">WP:Vanity</a> policy, we probably should be talking about the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifyability</a> argument. How can people find the more complete resources to back up this article? If they wanted to learn more about you, where would they go, other then to your own web page? <a href="../../../g/u/m/User%7EGumbyProf_552c.html" title="User:GumbyProf">GumbyProf: "I'm about ideas, but I'm not always about good ideas."</a> 05:06, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally a user that has productive comments. I know what you mean about the "being in the paper" thing. I received lots of cut-outs when my films have been mentioned in print. Go to <a href="http://berkeleyvideofilmfest.org/" class="external free" title="http://berkeleyvideofilmfest.org/" rel="nofollow">http://berkeleyvideofilmfest.org/</a> search the page for "teen planet." The image is of my co-director and I accepting an award in front of a large audience for the screening of a Wolftime film. Visit this site: <a href="http://dicff.org/pages/12/index.htm" class="external free" title="http://dicff.org/pages/12/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://dicff.org/pages/12/index.htm</a> and click the schedule link. Search the page for "the kid who talked too much" and you will find information about the screening. The PDF on the page links to a schedule that inludes the two screenings of "The Kid Who Talked too Much." The film is pending on the IMDb. The other proof I have is on paper, and therefore I cannot convey it online.</p>

<p>I object to the last comment. No, just kidding. But I honestly don't see why so many people care about getting rid of something that doesn't affect them personally. I know this sounds a little "live and let live" but can't you guys just let it go? I'll fight it all the way through to its deletion. Nonetheless, I'm sure minds will change once more information has been certified on IMDb proving that this company is far more than Kinu and others realize. Just give it a chance, and yeah, live and let live. There are far more important things going on that we should all make an issue about. If anything, this debate is just driving a lot of traffic to wolftime.com, which wasn't the intention in the first place, despite above claims. This is trivial. You are not saving the world or making it a better place by opting to delete an article that myself and many others truly care about. Consider that. I'm leaving the discussion. Kevinw91</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> The last comment was by far the most constructive of them all. Wolftime is going through a major growth period at this time. I will currently agree with the deletion of both articles since Wolftime is presently non-notable. However, I may write up the article again about halfway through the year after film festival season has started and more material verifies the company as worthy of recognition on Wikipedia. I apologize for any trouble I may have caused, and invite you to view the newly released "Silhouettes" <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUF3iJinIG0" class="external text" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUF3iJinIG0" rel="nofollow">here</a> so you can at least get an idea of the work my company does.

<p>I'm sorry, I did not intend to enter the conversation again, but when a comment comes up that is blatantly ad hominim and inappropriate, I have no choice but to defend myself and my ambition. The comment left by My Alt Account was clearly wrong. If every user has the mentality of this individual, it is very apparent that they do not understand my defense of the article in the first place. The comment has prompted me to change my beliefs to again argue for the inclusion of the Wolftime article. I hope that the final administrator who reads this discussion views it on a deeper level and understands that my efforts are not a folly. The discussion moved from an argument against the inclusion of an article to attacks against my company and myself. I didn't want to cause any more trouble, but the last comment was far from constructive, and has unfortunately prompted me to change my position. By the way, "Teen Planet," "The Kid Who Talked too Much," and "Silhouettes" were not school projects. Again, <i>I apologize for taking your time</i>. Kevinw91 22:54, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Objection</b> That last comment, which accuses 'X' of an ad hominim (sic. hominem) attack is a clear ad hominem attack and must be struck from the record.
