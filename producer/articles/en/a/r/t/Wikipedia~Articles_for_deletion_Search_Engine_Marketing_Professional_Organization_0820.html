<dd><b>Comment</b>: Just for clarification's sake, I'm not sure what you mean by "All google hits seem to be produced by the organization itself as part of a campaign to inflate the number of google hits." When I look at the results of a search in Google for the organization, I see 360,000 results for a search of the organization's name (SEMPO), the vast majority appear to be from sites that are not affiliated with SEMPO. It sounds like you are saying that the organization is responsible for many, if not most of those. But I don't think that they are. Maybe I am misunderstanding what you are saying.<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Slawski_cc0b.html" title="User:Bill Slawski">Bill Slawski</a> 03:33, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There seems to be some controversy within the wikipedia on the notability deletion policy. I created the entry for the Search Engine Marketing Professional Organization and added to it once. Rather than others building upon the entry, I'm seeling threats to delete it. I am not a member of the organization, but I'm growing a little disgusted by deletion policy based upon notibility. Would you care to define the notibility policy for me in the context of this organization? Have you even bothered to research the topic, or is there a bias in your approach here? I couldn't care less about the amount of Google hits the organization receives, but I had an interest in trying to help improve the wikipedia. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts. Thanks. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Slawski_cc0b.html" title="User:Bill Slawski">Bill Slawski</a> 04:49, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You've included <a href="../../../s/e/a/Search_Engine_Marketing_Professional_Organization_4fb1.html" title="Search Engine Marketing Professional Organization">SEMPO</a> in this discussion for deletion, too. Is there personal bias in this action to delete? Would you delete the SEO article, too? I'm asking because I've been trying to add to that article in a positive manner, and from what I've seen here, it may just be a wasted effort.<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Slawski_cc0b.html" title="User:Bill Slawski">Bill Slawski</a> 05:06, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I've no idea what you're talking about. This the AfD entry for the SEMPO article, as you can see by the title above. In any case, if you want this article to stay you should point out the reason that the company is deserving of an article in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> spells out the notability stuff around corporations pretty well. As is often said: the Wikipedia does not and can not have an article on every single thing under the sun (I've been using the example of the nonexistant Consumed Crustacean's Left Foot article), hence the notability deletions. You just need to prove why the company is notable, using non-primary (unaffiliated) sources. -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">Talk</a> | 05:11, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The confusion is due to the fact that someone added an additional organization and wikipedia entry to this one (Organization of Search Engine Optimization Professionals), discussing both as if they were the same organization. The discussions regarding each should probably be bifurcated - they are not related organizations.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Also, the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> notability requirements don't seem like a very good fit for non profits. You're unlikely to find a nonprofit on the Forbes or Fortune 500, nor product or service reviews for an industry trade group, and stock market indices don't exist for non stock corporations. Perhaps a better measuring stick for a nonprofit, consumer and industry educational group is whether or not the information they share is widely cited. The list of external resouces I created below is only a small listing of many of the places where SEMPO's information has been disseminated by non-affiliated organizations. Hopefully the New York Times, the Chicago Tribune, Business Week, Red Herring, and the others I listed are non trivial enough. This seems to fit the first requirement of the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> notability requirements <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Slawski_cc0b.html" title="User:Bill Slawski">Bill Slawski</a> 06:17, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Your sources are misleading. The first article I clicked, for example, the CNN article (Google: Biting the Hand that Feeds It?) not only failed to establish SEMPO's notability, but also consisted only of the president of SEMPO talking about a notable company. Additionally, note that <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> requires the company itself to be the subject of the multiple nontrivial publications, not that the publications contain material quoted from said company. <a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a> 13:22, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Response to Comment</b>: It's not my intent to mislead, and I don't believe those resources are misleading. CNN wouldn't choose a non-notable organization as a subject matter expert in instances like that, nor would the New York Times, the New York Post, Business Week, the Register, Red Herring, and so on. The surveys that SEMPO has released over the past couple of years have been covered as newsworthy material from notable sources, on topics such as click fraud, online advertising spending, and developing trends in online use and advertising. A number of the sources I listed above include information about those.</dd>

<dd>They are a nonprofit, and a large part of what they do involves the creation and dissemination of information like that, and in providing a voice for people active in internet advertising. It's the equivalent of being a member of the Fortune 500 for an organization like them to be included in places like CNN, speaking on topics like that. I am not a member of SEMPO, and I likely won't become one. I have no bias, and if you decide to delete this article, it's more your loss than mine. Cheers.</dd>

<dd>Two thirds of the criteria for the three pronged test for notability under <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> are not appropriate, and do not apply to a nonprofit organization.

<dd>Let me also add that I bothered to try to do some research, and provide some sources that may be deemed trivial or non trivial instead of just making a statement that there were no independently verifiable sources.

<dd>One sad fact about this process of pointing to printed resources that are available on the web is that those resources often have gated walls where material is hidden behind subscription based archives. So, for instance, I didn't look at the full text of the article from the New York Times, nor did I include a couple of other articles from Business Week or other resources where one would have to pay to access that information. Perhaps this comment is more appropriate as a comment on the notability requirements at <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, but it's still a valid criticism here, too.<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Slawski_cc0b.html" title="User:Bill Slawski">Bill Slawski</a> 14:38, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As indicated by my comment below, I am "on the fence." Are there any independent articles which have SEMPO as its subject instead of "on background"? You mention the <i>New York Times</i> and the <i>Business Week</i>, but if there such an article in those (or <i>Washington Post</i>, etc.), the name of the organization would appear in the summary. Find one or more of these and it's very likely that I wouldn't be the only one convinced that the article should stay. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 16:30, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep</b>:I did an extensive post for SEMPO (Search Engine Marketing Professional Organization) over 2 months ago - which was subsequently removed. It was about the history and impact the organization has made in the timely world of search advertising (ie Google and Yahoo and MSN PPC). This non-profit organization has helped make marketers understand that the world of <a href="../../../s/e/a/Search_engine_marketing.html" title="Search engine marketing">search engine marketing</a> a visible and viable method of advertising. The term SEMPO has entered into the lexicon for 'what Google sells'. It is a classic non-profit industry or trade (if you will) association that deserves an entry into Wikipedia. The research conducted by the organization alone is reason for entry.</p>

<p>Even if the entry is just a pointer to the industry it represents, that would be valuable. The original extensive entry was deleted and now lost in the 'deletion land' thus depriving wikipedia of this important knowledge. Sad that we have come to this.</p>
<p>Other industry organizations have a presence in Wikipedia and this should be no exception: [Direct marketing association], [Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers], etc.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm not sure enough on this subject to vote a "keep", but the fact that SEMPO's studies are being picked up by various independent news websites (and IIRC one made it through Slashdot and the like) does seem to indicate some notability under WP:CORP. They weren't merely press releases either. -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">Talk</a> | 17:36, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
