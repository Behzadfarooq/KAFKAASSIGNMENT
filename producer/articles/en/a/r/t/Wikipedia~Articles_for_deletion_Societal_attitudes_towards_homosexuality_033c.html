<p>"Delete for Propaganda/Advocacy" <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_franklin_89f1.html" title="User:Lou franklin">Lou franklin</a> 04:39, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The "Societal attitudes towards homosexuality" article should be removed.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT</a> has a list of "what Wikipedia is not". The page says that "Wikipedia is not a soapbox" and asks that we leave "opinions on current affairs" out of Wikipedia. It says that Wikipedia articles should not be "propaganda or advocacy". Wikipedia says that all articles must be written from a neutral point of view. This article is clearly in violation of all of those standards.</p>
<p>As an encyclopedia, Wikipedia is a place for facts - not editorials. Does this statement belong in an encyclopedia: "In most developed countries, same-sex relationships are accepted"? Is that a fact that belongs in an encyclopedia or is that propaganda/advocacy?</p>
<p>How about this statement: "In some cultures influenced by anti-gay religious dogma, homosexuality is still considered unnatural". Is the reason that some cultures consider homosexuality unnatural really because they are "influenced by anti-gay religious dogma"? Is that fact or an opinion?</p>
<p>How about this "fact": "Violence against homosexuals remains common". Since no definition of "common" was given, is that a factual statement or is it spin?</p>
<p>The article references the "LGBT civil rights movement". But "civil rights" are personal rights guaranteed and protected by the Constitution, e.g., freedom of speech, press. Are homosexual rights spelled out in the Constitution? Then can there really be a "LGBT civil rights movement"? Or was that term crafted to associate gay rights with the rights of racial minorities?</p>
<p>Consider this statement: "Studies by Dr. Carole Jenny, Dr. A.W. Richard Sipe, and others have not found evidence that homosexuals are more likely to molest childen than heterosexuals." I am unclear of how that relates to the topic of "Societal attitudes towards homosexuality" in the first place. Is the purpose of this article to discuss what the "Societal attitudes towards homosexuality" ARE, or to discuss what they SHOULD BE? In any case, the link that the author provided says that "no large-scale national research has been done" and admits that the information is from "small studies".</p>
<p>We can debate whether "homosexuals are more likely to molest childen than heterosexuals" until the cows come home. Links can be found that make the case for either side of that argument, so it is fertile territory for revert wars. The statement is not from a neutral point of view and is off-topic anyway.</p>
<p>The article is fundamentally biased from start to finish and should be removed.</p>

What you have here is a small yet vocal militant group using Wikipedia to get their agenda out.</p>
<p>Wikipedia was a cool idea, but people won't continue to use it once they discover overtly biased articles like this one. (Did you know that "many religious establishments" accord homosexuals "special status as possessing enhanced spiritual abilities"?)</p>
<p>The public is growing more skeptical already. <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2005-11-29-wikipedia-edit_x.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2005-11-29-wikipedia-edit_x.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2005-11-29-wikipedia-edit_x.htm</a></p>
<p>The process of correcting articles is fundamentally flawed because not only don't many "editors" attempt to be impartial and objective, but the very reason they are here is to push their agenda. Somebody made the comment that "the proper response to an article with biased content is to rewrite it, not to delete the article". Yet when I made corrections they were simply overridden. The net effect is that the article cannot be corrected and it cannot be removed.</p>
<p>No encyclopedia in the country would print the propaganda contained in this article. Ultimately, the public will stop using Wikipedia because the authors are allowed to disregard facts and promote their agendas. And, no, deleting this article would not be "homophobia running rampant"; it would be fairness running rampant.</p>

<dd>So you are nominating it for deletion because your version keeps getting edited? That merely reinforces my impression that this was a bad faith nomination from the gitgo. <a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndomion_ea7e.html" title="User:Endomion">Ruby</a> 13:41, 11 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's my experience that small yet vocal militant groups tend to show up on AfD when their articles get tagged. So far though, all we've got is you. While I can understand your perspective, I'm unconvinced. Systemic bias is argued both ways with some regularity, and frankly, I doubt this article is going to be the death of Wikipedia.</dd>

<dd>Lou, your most recent edit was to mutilate a paragraph which cited a peer reviewed scientific study which showed that homosexuals are <i>less</i> likely to molest children, and before it add a statement that homosexuals are <i>more</i> likely to molest children, and a link to a strongly POV opinion / political action site with an unscientific, un-peer-reviewed opinion web page arguing the latter.</dd>

<dd>The link to your so-called "peer reviewed scientific study" was actually a USA Today article that openly admits that "no large-scale national research has been done" and describes the studies you cited as "small". That USA Today article also mentions a study that concluded "that gay men are three times more likely than heterosexuals to have sex with minors". That was mentioned in the very same article, yet that study mysteriously never made it to the text of the Wikipedia article. I am at a loss to understand how my link was "evidence of bad faith and POV editing" while yours was not.</dd>

<dd>Whether "homosexuals are more likely to molest children than heterosexuals" is moot since it doesn't relate to the topic, and there are no conclusive studies anyway. I can modify the article and site literally hundreds of links that take one position. Then you can site a hundred links with the opposing opinion. Your sites will be no more valid than mine. But is that really necessary? Since it has absolutely no bearing on the topic of "societal attitudes towards homosexuality" in the first place, it shouldn't be a matter of debate. It should be removed.</dd>

You know that saying "all mainstream Western health and mental health professional organizations have concluded this therapy is ineffective" is not a true statement.

<dd>I also removed this text: "the association of child sexual abuse and pedophilia with homosexuality is considered by many to be a form of homophobia and prejudice, and has been studied as a form of moral panic based on a neurotic repressed discourse of child sexuality". Exactly what type of counterpoint could one give to such biased drivel? You might as well surround that sentence with the words "warning: this is propaganda". It shouldn't have had to be removed because it shouldn't have been there in the first place.</dd>

<dd>This text was also removed: "damage from natural disasters in the modern United States is not correlated well with homosexual population, but it does correlate with Protestantism". There is no way to correct that by "posting counterpoints". It is pure hogwash. The article is rubbish and is filled with disinformation from start to finish. It is beyond repair and should be removed. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_franklin_89f1.html" title="User:Lou franklin">Lou franklin</a> 02:39, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe it is a fairly accurate description of the events. The definition of homosexuality was not incorrect simply because it discussed adult orientation rather than restricting the definition to the gender of sexual partners. To claim that male pedophiles who molest boys are homosexual is misleading whether or not it is technically true that their actions are homogenital in nature. The information you added was not correct. It was a grossly misleading statement using, as its only source, a site that based its conclusions on disingenuous distortions of statistics. Rather than add that some (your source) disagree with the distinction between same-gender molestation and adult sexual relations, you deleted everything about the distinction and simply added "Homosexuals are, per capita, more likely to be child molesters" or something very much to that effect. The question to ask is, "Does being sexually and romantically attracted to adults of one's own gender make one more likely to molest children." The logic you present works backwards from same-gender molestation to paint adult sexuality with the same brush saying, in effect, that there is no difference between an adult male being attracted to another adult male and an adult male being attracted to a male child. Would you equate an adult male being attracted to an adult female to an adult male being attracted to a female child since the gender is the same?</dd>

<dd>But let's talk about this "consensus". In looking at the user pages of the people who voted to keep the article, I see things like "This user is interested in LGBT issues" (on several user pages), "LGBT Wikipedians", "This user supports equal rights for queer people" (multiple times), "I am... Gay... A recovered Catholic... A liberal democrat", "This user identifies as gay", "This user is a sheep herder on Brokeback Mountain".</dd>

<dd>Or, consensus members are heterosexual, married for over 14 years, and disgusted and repulsed by the implication that only gays or lesbians would be interested in neutral points of view in GLBT Wikipedia articles. That was a despicable accusation to make, Mr Franklin, in addition to being incorrect. You should be ashamed of yourself. Not to mention, it's at least a borderline personal attack, which will get you blocked from editing Wikipedia. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 09:14, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Society does have attitudes towards homosexuality. These attitudes are studied, debated, surveyed and documented. So this article describes a legitimate topic and is clearly not an AfD candidate. The information in the article does appear to indicate societal support of homosexuality, but this simply reflects reality. There is a clear, documented trend in society of advancing support for homosexuality. Wikipedia does not address the right-ness or wrong-ness of such things. The nom obviously does not support homosexuality, but if the nom disagrees that such support is advancing, he is should offer well-referenced evidence to the contrary. (Good luck on that one.) -<a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaiwen1_85fe.html" title="User:Kaiwen1">Gavin</a> 03:55, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The Wikipedia article says that "38% of the general public think that 'homosexual behavior' is wrong". But take a look at the information in the link cited. The percent of the general public who agree that homosexual behavior is morally wrong is broken down this way:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Completely Agree: 38%</dd>
<dd>Somewhat Agree: 13%</dd>

<dd>Completely Disagree: 26%</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So it isn't accurate to say that "38% of the general public think that 'homosexual behavior' is wrong". The correct percentage is 51% (38% + 13%).</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep.</b> Lou franklin, I recognize your concerns, but I agree with other editors -- you can't simply remove statements that you dislike when they are supported by empirical evidence. Furthermore, it seems that you nominated this article for deletion simply out of frustration that your edits were not accepted -- if it doesn't agree with <i>your</i> viewpoint, it must be "spin" and doesn't belong on an encyclopedia. This is vindictive, and does not contribute to a harmonious, constructive community. Please recognize that other viewpoints exist, and other people's opinions are just as valid as yours. I truly hope that a consensus can be reached with the article. I strongly disagree with your apparent views on homosexuality, but I do think that those views are, for better or for worse, a part of societal attitudes toward homosexuality and should be represented in the article <i>alongside</i> other views. <a href="../../../h/b/a/User%7EHbackman_f74f.html" title="User:Hbackman">Hbackman</a> 05:40, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
