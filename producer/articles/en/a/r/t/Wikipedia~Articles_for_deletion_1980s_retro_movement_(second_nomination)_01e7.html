<p>This article was first nominated for deletion in June, and the AfD was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1980s_retro_movement_052a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/1980s retro movement">closed as a "keep but cleanup"</a>. However, in the three months since, not only has it not been cleaned up, it's gotten much worse (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=1980s_retro_movement&amp;diff=78184101&amp;oldid=61949663" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=1980s_retro_movement&amp;diff=78184101&amp;oldid=61949663" rel="nofollow">see diff</a>). Basically, the article is a gigantic <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> violation; there is no inherent evidence that society is in the midst of any "1980s retro movement" whatsoever, nor does the article even attempt to assert this as a fact. (There's been a cite tag on the first sentence of the article since the end of the first AfD; we're still waiting for that cite.) Most of the single-line "events" listed in the article are uncited, and many of them strain credulity past the breaking point (<a href="../../../d/e/s/Desperate_Housewives_828f.html" title="Desperate Housewives">Desperate Housewives</a> is reminiscent of <a href="../../../d/y/n/Dynasty_%28TV_series%29_bd31.html" title="Dynasty (TV series)">Dynasty</a>? In what ways? Because they're both an hour long and both are/were on <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a>? Are you kidding me?) In addition, the entire article is America-centric, without admitting it. And on top of everything else, the article has a name that almost nobody will come to Wikipedia and search for in the first place. As this AfD is certain to get a number of blind "keep" votes from those with a strong personal interest in the page's survival, I strongly urge the closing admin to examine the article itself and the discussion here; please don't just count votes on this one. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 18:37, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: sorry for my previous statements Aaron...however if u charge this for Original research then why aren't the <b>trivia</b> sections on pages of television or movie articles up for deletion, they seem like Original Research. Or what about the <b>2006 in fiction</b> section on the 2006 year article, aren't they original research. That is all I have to say. This is not a personal attack! All of the things on this article have had the creditablity of being aired on television or a movie, just like a TV show's trivia or a year in fiction section.

<li><b>Move</b> to List of 1980s nostalgia in popular culture or <b>keep</b>. This article is really a list, ad doesn't seem like a particularly bad idea for one either. Nom is right that the list doesn't prove there is a "movement" or anything, and with the current title there are OR issues, but as a list, it just needs some basic editing. I volunteer to edit the list down to very clear examples if it is kept (whether or not it is moved). <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 19:41, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Unverifiable matter of opinion and, in a way, original research. I think it would be pretty easy to compile a list of things that make it look like there's currently a "retro movement" for any decade. Really, how can there not be a 70s retro movement <i>now</i>, what with the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Dolls_3326.html" title="New York Dolls">New York Dolls</a> having recently released a new album and <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Simon_8aab.html" title="Paul Simon">Paul Simon</a> out on the road plugging his new work (or would that be the current 60s retro movement?). <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 19:45, 29 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Follow up</i>: As embarrassed as I am to admit that I was "reading" the <i>Vancouver Province</i>, today they printed an article about Audrey Hepburn and how there's a big trend these days with fashion and pop culture emulating her (including the current GAP ad campaign built up around her). As a part of that, the article quoted someone in the local fashion industry as saying that Audrey's big right now because there is a big 50s revival going on. It just brings home the point that it's pretty easy to say that there's a particular pop-culture movement on at any time. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 23:16, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but just barely. I personally believe 80s retro is a definite trend, and a quick Google search for "1980s retro" suggests I'm not alone in that perception. As those proposing deletion have (rightly) pointed to the lack of citations, I will mention that one of the sources turned up by that brief search included a BBC News article<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4745635.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4745635.stm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. It would obviously be preferable to have citations to some scholarly sources. It seems entirely correct however to suggest that the current "article" is really a list, and if kept it needs to be either massively overhauled or moved to an alternative title, with a number of the examples either cited or deleted. --<a href="../../../o/b/j/User%7EObjectiveBrit_38b3.html" title="User:ObjectiveBrit">Matthew Humphreys</a> 20:07, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>'<i>Weak Delete</i>. My position is similar to that on the deletion of the 1970s retro movement, there could probably be a good article on this topic, but this isn't the one. Some verifiable prose on the movement in general coupled with a <i>shorter</i> list of examples and a category for other examples would go a long way toward improving this. But, per the nomination, if no one has cleaned it up since the last AfD, why would they do so now? So, unless someone comes forward and either <i>greatly</i> improves this article or volunteers to do so in a reasonable amount of time, I think Wikipedia will be better off without it. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool3_2ec0.html" title="User:Cool3">Cool3</a> 18:39, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
