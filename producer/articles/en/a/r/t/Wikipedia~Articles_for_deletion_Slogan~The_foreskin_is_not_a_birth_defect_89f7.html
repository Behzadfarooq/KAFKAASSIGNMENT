<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>.</p>
<p>I count 29 clear delete votes, 10 clear keep votes (4 of which are discounted as extremely new users who may be sockpuppets), 1 clear keep-as-redirect vote and 3 abstain or ambiguous votes. Note that even if the ambiguous votes are considered as keeps and even if the new users are counted, the vote still reaches a concensus to delete.</p>
<p>Note 2: Based on the general tenor of the comments, the community concensus is that there is not sufficient notability for this slogan to be discussed <i>in a separate article</i>. It may well be appropriate to discuss it in the context of some other article. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 03:29, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Some people, the edithistory tells the tale, keep stubifying the article in what appears to be an attempt to make it look like a nonnotable stub which should go. of course that is just my opinion. Still, incase the current version is a mere stub, I want people coming from that stub hither to vote for its deletion to see the full article, so that they should have a more rounded view. I therefore place the full version of the article here -- <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalabio_fa80.html" title="User:Walabio">Ŭalabio</a> 16:03, 2005 Feb 5 (UTC) &#160;:</li>

<blockquote>
<hr />
<p>The slogan "the foreskin is not a birth defect" asserts the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genital_integrity.html" title="Genital integrity">genital integrity</a> position that male genitals of a <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_being.html" title="Human being">human being</a> are designed properly and do not usually require <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genital_modification_and_mutilation.html" title="Genital modification and mutilation">genital modification and mutilation</a> or <a href="../../../m/a/l/Male_circumcision.html" title="Male circumcision">male circumcision</a> of the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreskin.html" title="Foreskin">foreskin</a> of a newborn.</p>
<p>The slogan casts the debate of infant circumcision in terms of personal rights of the man and the rights of him to retain his healthy, living tissues. It implies that the decision about whether to undergo plastic surgery or amputations should be made by the man involved, and should be protected by the United States Constitution under rights to life, liberty, and property, and under the principle of <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equal_Protection_ad51.html" title="Equal Protection">Equal Protection</a>.</p>
<p>The chief argument against this position, as asserted by <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumcision_advocacy.html" title="Circumcision advocacy">circumcision advocates</a>, maintains that the choice may be made by doctors or parents to perform genital alterations they might desire or consider healthy. Moreover, for those who consider foreskin to be a birth defect, all reasonable effort ought to be made to sever the organ to make the child match his father.</p>

<li>Has it occurred to you that that makes no sense? "This can't go unless those go, because they're the same." But if they're the same and this can't go before them, isn't the reverse (They can't go before this) also true? And then doesn't that make your point just silly?

<li><i>Ac</i>tually, if you'll reread my comment it makes <i>perfect</i> sense. For clarification, I mean that this article should not be deleted because of its POV title, or because of the fact that one doesn't believe slogans should be included in wikipedia as separate articles. I'd like to add to this list of reasons why one <b>shouldn't</b> vote delete, the fact that one disagres with the slogan. However, regardless, I've changed my mind on the notability of this slogan (I didn't see most of the google hits were mirrors), and have decided that it <i>is</i> a <b>Delete</b> candidate. I still believe the validity of all slogans and the category should be put on trial, however. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequencefree_fa0e.html" title="User:Consequencefree"><font color="#3399FF">ÅrÐ£nT</font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsequencefree_ce75.html" title="User talk:Consequencefree"><font color="#33CCFF">†</font></a></sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Consequencefree_273b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Consequencefree"><font color="#33CCCC"><sub>∈</sub></font></a> 08:50, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Calm down, please. I don't need extra emphasis to see your point. I don't know why you're talking about disagreeing with the slogan, because that had nothing to do with my point. I don't really care about the slogan. I voted delete because I don't believe slogans should be separate articles; that's why I said to merge. (Perhaps you missed that, it's an understandable mistake.) I do care about the fact that your delete rationale was illogical. However, considering that you've re-voted, this point and this argument are moot. It would be pointless to continue, so let's just end this now. <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPremeditated_Chaos_675b.html" title="User:Premeditated Chaos"><font color="#FF00FF">P</font></a><a href="../../../p/r/e/User_talk%7EPremeditated_Chaos_7524.html" title="User talk:Premeditated Chaos"><font color="#FF33FF">M</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Premeditated_Chaos_3dcc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Premeditated Chaos"><font color="#FF66FF">C</font></a> 19:06, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm calm. I just like using extra emphasis =) Talking about disagreeing with the slogan was on a completely unrelated train of thought, sorry I should have been more clear. I wasn't disputing your delete vote, only defending my rationale, which was, as you can see through my clarification above, perfectly rational. Whether slogans should be included as separate articles should have its own policy discussion since there are already so many of them. <i>Edit: them is referring to the slogans.

I just wish that the circumcision-advocates would stop advocating universal circumcision of all of the babies. If someone at the age of majority wants to undergo medically unnecessary procedures, that is fine with me, but one should not medically unnecessarily modify children on whims.

<li>Dan, non-notability is a very common reason to list an article on VfD (see 90% of the articles listed). Notability is often provided by Google hits, unless it can be shown to be notable otherwise. As for the existance of other, less notable slogans, unless they've previously been listen on VfD and have been kept (i.e. unless there is precedent), it really isn't an argument. I personally would be for merging this and others to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_political_slogans.html" title="List of political slogans">List of political slogans</a>, i.e. with short explanations under each, but the others would have to be brought here and argued case-by-case. — <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_b405.html" title="User:Asbestos">Asbestos</a> | <a href="../../../a/s/b/User_talk%7EAsbestos_af4a.html" title="User talk:Asbestos">Talk</a> 23:30, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Asbestos, I like your idea.

There just no space in Wikipedia, right? But actually, for this slogan, non-notability is not the absolute strongest argument, given that bumper stickers and T-shirts have been available. But if we want to set precedent here, what the heck? Anything under 940 hits should go then, right? <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanP_08a0.html" title="User:DanP">DanP</a> 00:10, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>You should feel free to list those articles here. But there are no hard cut-off lines for Google hits. 1) Different standards of notability are used for atomic physicists than contemporary political slogans. 2) If you can cite other evidence, such as sales numbers of the bumper stickers, then that would be evidence for notability. 3) As there appear to be less than about 50 real hits from Google, this one really some other evidence of notability, because nobody's seeing any on the web. — <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_b405.html" title="User:Asbestos">Asbestos</a> | <a href="../../../a/s/b/User_talk%7EAsbestos_af4a.html" title="User talk:Asbestos">Talk</a> 11:23, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

If a political slogan is very notable, we might have an article about who came up with it, what occasioned its invention, how it was propagated, how it became notable, and some examples of situations where it was used. Few slogans are notable enough for that kind of treatment and most of them merit no more than a sentence or two in the relevant articles about the political issue or movement.

<li>From the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion" rel="nofollow">VfD ettiquette</a>: <i>Votes by suspected sock puppets or votes which do not seem to reflect the opinion of Wikipedians may be ignored. In particular, votes from anonymous persons and accounts that did not exist prior to a nomination are typically ignored on strong suspicions of sock puppeteering or being cast by biased outsiders unfamiliar with our policies. If you are the primary author or otherwise have a vested interest in the article, say so openly, clearly base your vote on the deletion policy, and vote only once, like everyone else.</i> My reading of that is that primary authors and those with a vested interest <b>must</b> be special cases, otherwise why the need to declare it? - <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 22:02, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I know the policy and suggested changing it before. The problem is that that admins only <i>typically</i> ignore new voters. This leads to both sides asking for friends to help <i>(robert Brookes came here from a call from circumcision-advocates and I had to make a reciprical call to intactivists).</i> I and I hope the other side are not proud of that. I would like the policy absolute. I hope that the policy will be applied here. But this is not about that.</li>
<li>I do not like being singled out. I anm sure that you probably feel the same way. When it comes to counting, policy only really supports separating potential sokpuppets. The summary should read thus:</li>

<p>I propose that, upon deletion of this article, a new precendent be entered into the record. Apparently, the angry rhetoric from the 'delete' side of this debate deems it important enough to vote on personal whim (some are saying notability is contested, but apparently there is plenty of recognition of the slogan too). Leaving policy justification out of the equation is simply anti-Wikipedia. Therefore, because the attack on this article is unprecedented, I propose adding to <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Precedents_e2a3.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Precedents">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Precedents</a> the following entry:</p>
<p><i><b>Are articles on slogans with fewer than 1000 Google hits permissible? - No, slogans need at least 1000 Google hits</b></i></p>
<p>If this precedent existed beforehand, we wouldn't have needed this vote because deletion would be justified. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanP_08a0.html" title="User:DanP">DanP</a> 14:39, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You must have a different definition than I, or maybe just picked the wrong Latin word. While I am sorry for upsetting you, we can respect each other and be critical of the arguments at the same time. Criticising words is not the same as criticising a person. I have linked to a documented precedent, and asked for yours. Let me get this straight: you claim deletion is right because the precedent is that 90% of articles are deleted on a basis of unspecified precedent, and this article is one of those, therefore it is one of those. Correct me if I read you wrong, but does that sound like non-circular reasoning to you? <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanP_08a0.html" title="User:DanP">DanP</a> 18:57, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not upset, and that accusation again is <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominum.html" title="Ad hominum">ad hominum</a>. Rather than trying to characterize the statements of others as emotional states (e.g. "angry", "upset"), or making suppositions about their reasons for voting (e.g. "voting on a whim"), or using pejoratives to describe them (e.g. "pro-mutilation"), or using pejoratives to describe their comments (e.g. "trolling"), please deal with the content of their statements. You have linked to no "precedent", as each article is evaluated on its own merits. There is no standard rule about slogans, nor is there a standard creteria for their deletion. However, there are other standards that are frequently invoked and used for deletion in general; non-notability is a primary one. Also, please note that invoking a <a href="../../../t/w/o/Two_wrongs_make_a_right_%28fallacy%29.html" title="Two wrongs make a right (fallacy)">two wrongs make a right</a> argument is a logical fallacy. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 19:12, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That you were upset was only my opinion. I am sorry if I incorrectly assumed that -- it's not an insult. <a href="../../../p/r/e/Precedent.html" title="Precedent">Precedent</a> is inherently based on the assumption that the past can be interpreted in the present. It is "two wrongs" or "two rights", not random behavior. Your reason for deletion was "POV, stated elsewhere, almost no Google hits". So in your words, 940 is "almost" zero, I have "indifference to the outcome", new users are "distressing", and some users are "apologists". Other than (maybe) the last sarcastic term of yours, I am perfectly aware that even these are not truly <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominum.html" title="Ad hominum">ad hominum</a>. They do not attack the person, and neither did I, so I find your accusation unsubstantiated. But you should direct this to my user talk page, instead of here. In any case, the section <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Precedents_e2a3.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Precedents">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Precedents</a> specifically permits slogans. No other deletion-supportive policy or precedent has been stated except notability, so that is why I'm proposing we set precedent at 1000 Google hits. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanP_08a0.html" title="User:DanP">DanP</a> 19:55, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I described no editors as "distressing" <s>or "apologists". I have not even used the word "apologist"</s>, and I described a "delete" editor as an "apologist" in jest, obviously. Please read my comments more carefully. Regarding your "almost 940 hits", as you know already, that is actually fewer than 50 unique hits. That is not notable in my opinion, and in the opinion of many other voters here and elsewhere. Google searches are often used as a means of ascertaining notability on VfDs and elsewhere. Policy creep is a bad idea, but if I were proposing one, it would be more on the lines of "any VfD'd article that gets the support of more than 5 editors who make their first edit on the VfD should be automatically deleted." <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:23, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>This isn't you?<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVotes_for_deletion%2FSlogan%3AThe_foreskin_is_not_a_birth_defect&amp;diff=9923363&amp;oldid=9923306" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVotes_for_deletion%2FSlogan%3AThe_foreskin_is_not_a_birth_defect&amp;diff=9923363&amp;oldid=9923306" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> In the past, we've always counted TOTAL hits -- it doesn't even display your stated number. Policy creep indeed! I'm, of course, accepting of any notability decision -- it's the stated rationale that seems elusive and worthy of study. The articles <a href="../../../a/_/w/Slogan%7EA_woman%27s_right_to_choose_4766.html" title="Slogan:A woman's right to choose">Slogan:A woman's right to choose</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/m/Slogan%7EHuman_life_begins_at_conception_cbd7.html" title="Slogan:Human life begins at conception">Slogan:Human life begins at conception</a> have the desired hit-count. So why are you complaining about my proposal? <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanP_08a0.html" title="User:DanP">DanP</a> 20:40, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I don't recall only counting TOTAL hits at all; in fact, the Google results are often examined for source and uniqueness, and particularly whether or not they reflect independent sources, or merely Wikipedia and its many mirrors. As for your other arguments, please read my previous comments; it's not about those articles. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:46, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Google doesn't even display the number you want to substitute. I never proposed a change to hit-counting in Wikipedia, did you? The existing precedents all use the total, not your method. The only arguments you've made are for 1) deletion without need for giving rationale, and 2) adding a precedent to count new users instead of Google-hits (call it a meta-precedent). Either way, neither of your arguments would ever inform Wikipedia users what is considered notable for a given article. Many precedents do precisely that, saving us all a great deal of frustration knowing the articles won't get trashed. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanP_08a0.html" title="User:DanP">DanP</a> 22:37, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Huh? What number do I want to "substitute"? Nor have I made any arguments for a new precedents or methods. The slogan is non-notable, amongst other things, because it gets very few unique Google hits. That about sums it up. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 03:15, 6 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Existing precedents use total page hits. My perception is that you're using some other number. In any case, there is a broader discussion on slogans at <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html#Inclusion_of_Slogans_as_Separate_Articles" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)#Inclusion of Slogans as Separate Articles</a>.
