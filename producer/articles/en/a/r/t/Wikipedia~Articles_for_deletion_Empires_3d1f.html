<li><b>Strong Delete</b> I am returning to revise my vote from "Delete" to "strong delete" after being canvassed by <a href="../../../n/u/k/User%7ENuka5_f7a6.html" title="User:Nuka5">Nuka5</a> (on my talk page: see <a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html#.27Empires.27_Wiki.2C_Which_you_have_opted_for_deletion" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">'Empires' Wiki, Which you have opted for deletion</a>).<br />
Nuka5 says that "what we do not need now is for our Player Manual to be deleted" (which breaches <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>, item 4).

I have checked the article again, and it seem clear to me that the article is structured like a manual, rather than as a guide to the game's significance and history.<br />
As pointed out elsewhere in this AFD, there are plenty of free wikis available if the gaming community wants to use a wiki to develop their manual, but wikipedia is not the place to do it.<br />
I think that this is a useful opportunity for us to stress to gamers that we do mean what we say in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>: if you try to use wikipedia as a repository for your manual, the article will be deleted.

<dd><i>Comment'</i>: A huge amount of material which belongs in a manual was removed a few hours after I wrote the above: see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Empires&amp;diff=83937423&amp;oldid=83936421" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Empires&amp;diff=83937423&amp;oldid=83936421" rel="nofollow">diff of edits by Mlittle 22:49, 26 October 2006</a>, and the artucle is now much further from being a manual. However, it still contains neither an assertion of notability not evidence of notability, and we have repeated statements here from the game's fans that the purpose of the wikiedia entry on the game is to attract more users. I believe them. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 03:48, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Regardless if it was created to "attract more users", that's not the point now. The article is on Wikipedia, and could use a cleanup, but all in all it breaches no policy.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Please remind yourself Kinslayer, that this is a discussion about the notability of the Empires article, not a discussion on the conduct of Empires players. Your comment <i>"Blame yourselves Empire players, you and your conduct brought this turn-around on yourselves through your thoughtless actions."</i> reflects poorly, I feel, on your ability to focus on the actual discussion.

<p><b>Comment</b> Appears to hold some sort of grudge against the game and it's fanbase as noted by his preference of deletion of article instead of improving and as can be derived from where one, The Kinslayer, irrelevantly states: "Blame yourselves Empire players, you and your conduct brought this turn-around on yourselves through your thoughtless actions."Deepowered</p>

<li><b>Reply</b> - Not true at all. The more of the people who comment on this AfD, the more you make it look like it's been created for advertising, garnering more fans (social networking) and as a game guide (WP:NOT). So by thoughtless I mean 'Due to your inability to actually understand any of Wikis policies, you are digging the article an even bigger hole to climb out of.'

<li><b>Keep</b> - It has been featured in the german magazine PC Action (June issue), receiving their "Super Mod" award. It was featured in GameStar magazine (issue No. 07/06) and was placed on their cover disc. It has received two "Mod of the Week" awards from Planethalflife.com, once in March and the other in July.

<dd><b>Warning undeclared COI</b> in a comment below at <i>01:06, 30 October 2006</i>, Krenzo also acknowledges being a developer of the game.

<dd>Is this some sort of witchhunt? The information provided by Krenzo is all verifiable from different sources and does not make the subject seem better then it is and his points made here are still valid.

<li><b>Comment</b>: That's a remarkably narrow reading of COI.

<li><b>Reply</b> Regardless of how narrow the interpretation is, krenzo's argument is valid whether or not there is a conflict of interest.

<li><b>Keep</b> Although somewhat lacking in information relating to the actual gameplay of this mod, the point of a wiki is for anyone to edit and add to the article so that the relevant information is displayed. To delete this article instead of improving it is nothing short of a failure of the wiki system. As far as notability goes, I can only add to krenzo's entry that it has also been mentioned in a few weekly steam news updates. - Deepowered

Empires has a game guide already, and a wiki to support players who wish to learn more. This page does not need to be deleted, it needs to be refocused to explain what the game is, and it's roots. For this reason, and the game's recent accomplishments, deletion is the wrong policy. <a href="../../../m/l/i/User%7EMLittle_be80.html" title="User:MLittle">M Little</a> 03:45, 26 October 2006 (UTC) MLittle

As you can see, Wickethewok nor anyone else has proposed any problems this article needs to correct in the discussion page before it was nominated for deletion. As for questions about my credibility, if you checked the discussion or history of this article, I've contributed to it before and did not create a new account solely to post here.

The news-stands are stashed with mags on gaming, and there apears to be a lot of online coverage too: in that field, I would expect that a notable game would have at least dozens of articles, preferably hundreds or even thousands of readily-accessible coverage. The fact that we have had so much discussion in this AFD but only two references is, to my mind, rather overwhelming proof that whatever its intrinsic merits, 'Empires' is a long, long way from notability. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 20:15, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Please bear in mind that the subject is not a retail product (it's freely downloadable user created content as opposed to a $50 professional developed and published game) and a feature (be it half a page in a foreign magazine) is a very big thing. I feel the footprint should be regarded in proper scale. Reviews and features are fairly uncommon for mods save for the few niche sites that are available. L3TUC3 05:30, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I know this won't be accepted, but i'd like to say that if the article is cleaned up (the article rewritten to a small description and a link to the Empires wiki added), that it should be a lot better than it is now. It's obvious that somebody wrote it without knowing much about the mod (the release date is listed as july 1, 2006, instead of march 3, 2006), and that this may even be vandalism. Just because this is my first edit also doesn't mean i'm a meatpuppet, i just want justice to be served properly.

<li><b>Comment</b> - This is the first post (made by Krenzo) taken from the Empires forum wikipedia thread in it's entirety: <b>Our article on Wikipedia has been nominated for deletion. I'd like it if everyone could go over to the discussion area for the article (via the tab at the top of the article), and voice their opinion on whether it should remain or deleted. <i>It is an important issue as we get a decent amount of traffic from people who discover the article.</i></b> I think it speaks for itself (especially the last sentence.) <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 19:01, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I think you're right. People want more information about Empires, and they reasonably assume Wikipedia would have some sort of information on it. Krenzo asked people to voice their opinions, not blindly support the article, not indiscriminately flame. I do not see a problem with a Wikipedia article directing interested individuals to places where they can get more information. For the reason you pointed out, that much of the interest gets funneled through here, I can't help but agree that this article is a keep.<a href="../../../m/l/i/User%7EMLittle_be80.html" title="User:MLittle">MLittle</a> 20:26, 26 October 2006 (UTC)MLittle</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It doesn't matter weather its a game or not, wikipedia is a encyclopedia the wikipedia article on encyclopedia's actually states that "An encyclopedia, encyclopaedia or (traditionally) encyclopædia, is a comprehensive written compendium that contains information on all branches of knowledge or a particular branch of knowledge." All this is, is just a record of the history and a rundown of the game and how it works. Which in turn is a part of a particular branch of knowledge. I fail to see how it doesn't belong here. Wikipedia IS an enyclopedia yes but this is a useful article FOR a particular branch of knowledge, I don't know about you but gaming is a particular branch of knowledge last time I checked, or at least a sub branch under technology.

<li><b>Quote</b> Nuka5 says that "what we do not need now is for our Player Manual to be deleted" (which breaches WP:NOT Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information, item 4). Nuka5 also says "we are still developing a fan base" (which possibly breaches WP:NOT a social networking site). I have checked the article again, and it seem clear to me that the article is structured like a manual, rather than as a guide to the game's significance and history.<br />
As pointed out elsewhere in this AFD, there are plenty of free wikis available if the gaming community wants to use a wiki to develop their manual, but wikipedia is not the place to do it. I think that this is a useful opportunity for us to stress to gamers that we do mean what we say in WP:NOT: if you try to use wikipedia as a repository for your manual, the article will be deleted. Good luck with the game development, folks, but wikipdia is the wrong place for it. -BrownHairedGirl (talk) • (contribs) 14:52, 26 October 2006 (UTC)<b><br /></b></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I am noticing that, and this is not meant to belittle anyone, despite the large numbers of people claiming that the article does not meet WP:XY, there is very little solid argument that it does not. Claims in favor of the article mention references and other evidence as support. Claims against seem to be just that. Here is a characteristic response: "This is not a notable game, it is not a notable service, it is not an encyclopedic article, and is violates WP:RS amongst others." This is an acceptable claim, but the poster does not offer evidence in proof. If the question of the articles remaining on wikipedia is to be answered "on the merits of the arguments," then I feel that, despite the number of heads mentioning a certain claim, there is no solid argument behind them. The only solid argument used supporting its deletion, as far as I can tell, is in reference to mentions of the article as a game guide- which noone is claiming that it is- and the concerns of BrownHairedGirl on the subject's notability. --<a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalconXVI_dbe9.html" title="User:FalconXVI">FalconXVI</a></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I would like to mention that I have gone through the article... twice... in order to put strike throughs where I have been quoted as saying "Please do not delete our game guide". This is not because i did not say it, but because i believed at the time that this was to try and delete the Empires own wiki, and not just the Wikipedia Page on empires. I also included this note to try and clear that up: nuka5 has edited to cross out this quote as he realises that it was made entirely wrongly, about the Empires own Wiki, not the Empires Wiki Page.<br />
Why twice? because someone... who i deeply suspect is an admin trying to win their arguement, went back and deleted the changes i had made, meaning that it looked again like i had meant the comment.

<li><b>Another Comment</b> I am still waiting for argument, and evidence, supporting the "delete" position. After having read through WP:NOT again, I am still hard pressed to see how the article violates anything there: The article is not a definition; it is neither origional research, nor opinion, nor discussion; it is neither propoganda, nor self-promotion, nor advertisement (or, at the least, no more so than is necessarily associated with presence on wikipedia); it is not a collection of links; it is neither a personal webpage, nor file storage area, nor dating service; it is not a directory; and it is not an FAQ, guide, or instruction manual. As for the other objection, notability is an inherently subjective requirement which I expect will be evaluated based on the references already mentioned, by whoever posesses the final say in this matter. --<a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalconXVI_dbe9.html" title="User:FalconXVI">FalconXVI</a> 17:01, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Falcon, since this discussion started, the article has been edited to make it less of an instruction manual, and to fix some of its other flaws. Howver, the lengthy discussion above contains lots of evidence of how this game modification is non-notable, and that is not a inherently subjective test: the game's fans can find only two mentions of it in the specialist press, only one of which is in English, and that one is rather short. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 17:13, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Reply</b> Arguments based on WP:RS, WP:V, and WP:NOT have been refuted. If you wish, post some solid argument against the refutations. On those issues evidence has been provided, and the burden of proof is then on you to show that those arguments are invalid. Unless, of course, you are so sure of your position that it does not bear argument. As far as WP:NN, numerous references from outside of the Empires mod community have been posted. Are they outside of the Half Life 2 community in general, or the video game community in general? Possibly not but then, they don't need to be. If they did, then, as I already mentioned, nothing would be notable enough to be included, as it would not be notable outside of where it was notable.</dd>

As it stands, this mod is just not well known outside of the modding community the way <i><a href="../../../c/o/u/Counter-Strike_03ae.html" title="Counter-Strike">Counter-Strike</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Orchestra_%28game_mod%29_06cc.html" title="Red Orchestra (game mod)">Red Orchestra</a></i> are.

<dd>I point your attention to another Half-Life 2 modification <a href="../../../d/y/s/Dystopia_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Dystopia (computer game)">Dystopia_(computer_game)</a>, which by your definition does not deserve its own Wikipedia article. Just like Empires, Dystopia is a mod rather than a stand-alone game, and does not have the "worldwide presence" of commercial titles you cited. P.S. By the way, the "download count" on the Dystopia article is a total number of <i>all</i> relared files including game updates and media such as trailers. Should we use similar criteria, the total number of downloads of Empired mod would be doubled. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChahk42_5369.html" title="User:Chahk42">Chahk42</a> 21:20, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, selective pointing out of things. You forgot to mention that Dystopia WON an award at the Independant Games Festival recently (as opposed to a mere nomination.) Being nominated in a batch of 30-odd other mods isn't notable, but beating the lot of them to the award IS. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The Kinslayer</a> 09:21, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Ah, selective pointing out of things. You forgot to mention that Dystopia was first nominated for deletion (the first time, not the second time around), on solely the issue of notability. I'd like to point out that at the time [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dystopia_%28computer_game%29&amp;oldid=34263838|1.7.06" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dystopia_%28computer_game%29&amp;oldid=34263838|1.7.06" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>] there was no mention of third party awards, nor of magazines, nor of player statistics. When the AFD was resolved there was still no mention of third party awards, nor magazines, nor player statistics. In the AFD itself there is no mention of third party awards, nor concrete magazine references, nor concrete player statistics. The result of this first Dystopia AFD was <b>Keep</b>. (As the second Dystopia afd addressed questions of verifiability, it is irrelevant for the notability argument.) It seems that it would be irrational for an article with similar notability status to be deleted. <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalconXVI_dbe9.html" title="User:FalconXVI">FalconXVI</a> 05:41, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Now, had he posted information saying something along the lines of "OMG TIHS MOD AER TEH LEET j00 AER NO CAN PLAY ANY OHTER," I could see her point. However, he posted changes relating to the history of the mod, and adding footnotes concerning relevant sources of information. Who would know better the achievements of a child than a proud father? Who would be better to categorize the trophies on the wall than the creator of the mod himself?

<li>Is there ANY chance that we can keep this discussion concerning deletion about the article itself, or is one of the main criterion for being an admin on Wikipedia an inability to keep personal issues outside logical debates?

<li>On another occasion, <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> goes out on a limb and says, "One is a half-page story, and the other in German."

<ul>
<li>Yes. This is an English-language encylopedia. If a subject is mostly notable in Germany, that may make it less relevant to an englishlanguage encyclopedia. If thev game mod is reaalaly notable, why is there is so little covergae in the English-language press? --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</sup> 15:24, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Indeed, I don't know of any German documentation for the mod. It may exist, but if it doesn't then an article in a German-language magazine is actually worth a HELL of a lot more than one in an English-language magazine. I doubt most mods get that kind of coverage. But I'm not done yet! I've still got a few quotes to go through! I would bother to post some of <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Kinslayer_077b.html" title="User:The Kinslayer">The_Kinslayer</a>'s comments relating to <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChahk42_5369.html" title="User:Chahk42">Chahk42</a>, but <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChahk42_5369.html" title="User:Chahk42">Chahk42</a> closed the argument nicely with the statement, "Personal squabbles have no place on Wikipedia." But let's keep on the positive notes, with <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalconXVI_dbe9.html" title="User:FalconXVI">FalconXVI</a>'s successful ability to read the obvious red box at the top of the deletion page! "'deletion decisions are made on the merits of the arguments, not by counting heads (or socks).' Forgive me for thinking that this applied to all, rather than simply those who regularly edit wikipedia." Reason voices itself! Indeed, as you go further down the page, we hit a plague of comments concerning "is the only contribution by such-and-such." Are those in power blind to their own rules? Are words of wisdom spoken by a newcomer less important than words of wisdom spoken by your best friend? Words of wisdom are words of wisdom, regardless of who speaks them. --<a href="../../../n/i/a/User%7ENiarbeht_8b6e.html" title="User:Niarbeht">Niarbeht</a> 07:52, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

Here we have canvassing, sockpuppetry, meatpuppetry, an undeclared COI: the AFD rules are very pertinent here.

<ul>
<li>Brownhairedgirl? meatpuppetry and sockpuppetry would influence this decision in any way. so far all new users have posted valid comments that add to the discussion. What is your POINT by continuing to mention sockpuppets and meatpuppets? what have ANY of the new members done (with the exception of me, whose incorrections I've done my best to rectify) that is not a problem. Furthermore, COI is only a problem when it's in an article. there's no problem in a group of people defending themselves.</li>

Now, can we keep this discussion about the relevancy of hundreds of thousands of accountable program downloads, unaccountable (yet undoubtedly numerous) downloads through torrent, magazine articles, and website mentions?--<a href="../../../n/i/a/User%7ENiarbeht_8b6e.html" title="User:Niarbeht">Niarbeht</a> 07:52, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I am here just to further my thoughts on this absolutely ridiculous AFD, I share these sentiments with <a href="#hahnchen" title="">Falcon</a> and seriously believe that this AFD should be rerun. This page is full of worthless comments that belong to the talk page, just above this comment is an attack on the "validity of much of the content on Wikipedia". Yes, you've had some magazine mentions, but look at the <a href="http://storefront.steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=stats" class="external text" title="http://storefront.steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=stats" rel="nofollow">stats</a>, it's <i>NOT</i> a popular mod, less players/servers than <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Sven_Co-op_1f92.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sven Co-op">Sven Co-op</a> and less player minutes than <a href="../../../b/r/a/BrainBread_2d29.html" title="BrainBread">BrainBread</a>, which probably should have been deleted anyway. How Empires, can in its current state even begin to compete on notability compared to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Front_Line_Force_cc4b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Front Line Force">Front Line Force</a> is beyond me. I would have voted keep, had the press mentions turned into player numbers, but this has not happened. Verified download counts are meaningless, if we went by them pretty much every single player half-life map would smash all notability rules. On a positive note, I commend <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChahk42_5369.html" title="User:Chahk42">User:Chahk42</a>'s improvements to the article, and even given the incredible ill will the Empires community has generated here, it's why I didn't vote to delete. Please re-run this AFD. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 16:00, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> This mod doesn't exists as long as Sven Co-op or BrainBread, it's doing better than those when compared to the player numbers and player minutes. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolokiller_9e35.html" title="User:Solokiller">Solokiller</a> 16:47, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - Only when you look at the stats, you'll find that they don't.
