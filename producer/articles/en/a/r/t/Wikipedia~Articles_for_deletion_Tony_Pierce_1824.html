Anyway, he's been interviewed once by G4tv and I was unable to find any other claim of notability.

<li><b>Keep</b> Obviously I'm biased in this discussion since I am Tony Pierce, and maybe nowadays running a blog is no big deal, but in August 2001 when I started the busblog there weren't 54 million blogs going. Anyways, I was on G4TV not for my blog, but for the "blook" that I wrote called "How To Blog" which won an award at SXSW. I've also been interviewed in the New York Times for being addicted to the web (<a href="http://community.livejournal.com/blog_sociology/78243.html" class="external free" title="http://community.livejournal.com/blog_sociology/78243.html" rel="nofollow">http://community.livejournal.com/blog_sociology/78243.html</a>), written about in the Washington Post (<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A47633-2004Oct20.html" class="external free" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A47633-2004Oct20.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A47633-2004Oct20.html</a>), and named in the LA Times (<a href="http://www.craigslist.org/about/press/LAwideweb.html" class="external free" title="http://www.craigslist.org/about/press/LAwideweb.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.craigslist.org/about/press/LAwideweb.html</a>) as the most entertaining blog in LA. True my personal blog busblog.com (<a href="http://busblog.com" class="external free" title="http://busblog.com" rel="nofollow">http://busblog.com</a>) lately isn't what it used to be, but that's because I now blog for a living as Editor of LAist (<a href="http://www.laist.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.laist.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.laist.com/</a>), but everyone has made a career and a living out of blogging these days, right? In 2002 I coined the word blook (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blook" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blook" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blook</a>) which is turning parts of your blog into a book, a word that is dorky, true, but was up for Word of the Year this year by the Oxford Dictionary (<a href="http://blog.tomevslin.com/2006/10/blook_is_a_runn.html" class="external free" title="http://blog.tomevslin.com/2006/10/blook_is_a_runn.html" rel="nofollow">http://blog.tomevslin.com/2006/10/blook_is_a_runn.html</a>). Again, achievements I'm sure you've all reached. I'd have cleaned up this wikipedia entry on myself but as you can see from this note I'm not so skilled with your interface. I guess that's why I still use Blogger.com, speaking of which I was sitting next to Ev the night he announced that Google had just bought Blogger (<a href="http://www.tonypierce.com/blog/2003/02/only-guy-who-had-better-day-than-me.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.tonypierce.com/blog/2003/02/only-guy-who-had-better-day-than-me.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tonypierce.com/blog/2003/02/only-guy-who-had-better-day-than-me.htm</a>) just like Amanduhh's mom? She looked alot like Xeni Jardin. And I was one of just 20 bloggers given free trips to Amsterdam by the Dutch government this year and put up in 5 star hotels to blog about the city (<a href="http://www.bloggersinamsterdam.com/blog/" class="external free" title="http://www.bloggersinamsterdam.com/blog/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bloggersinamsterdam.com/blog/</a>), and and and... but blogging is irrelevant to you guys so whatevs. And yeah I realize I don't get the amount of hits of some of the bloggers in the Technorati Top 100 but personal sites that state right up front that "nothing in here is true" dont really stand a chance of popularity unless youre a whorish hot chick or a political partisan and yet still somehow I am in the Technorati Top 500 (currently i'm #428) (<a href="http://www.technorati.com/search/www.tonypierce.com" class="external free" title="http://www.technorati.com/search/www.tonypierce.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.technorati.com/search/www.tonypierce.com</a>). I agree lots of bloggers can claim that they "belong" here, but how many have achieved these things while being more popular than 99.999% of the rest? Maybe the kids just liked my photo essays (<a href="http://www.tonypierce.com/photoessays.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.tonypierce.com/photoessays.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tonypierce.com/photoessays.htm</a>)? Regardless of what you choose to do, there's no doubt that I was one of the early leaders of blogging, and definitely one of the more influential ones, and now a professional one. Therefore I believe that my entry should stay. But if it goes, that's ok. I did well without Wikipedia, I will live without it. Plus people know where to find me since Google has me listed right below the Tony Awards and Tony Hawk when you simply type "tony" into Google (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=tony" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=tony" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?q=tony</a>). Thankfully they're not blog-haters&#160;:) Now that I read some of your snarks, it seems like the problem here is in the entry not being very good, not the subject. However, if I had written this entry then you would have tried to bust me for self-promotion. So there's the rub. TP 23:23, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Although it needs a total rewrite preferably by someone who doesn't know him as the current page definitely sounds more like a bio on a personal website and spends too much time focusing on the non-notable aspects of his life which probably contributes to much of this discussion.

<li><b>Comment</b> - This campaign against blogs reminds me a LOT of when rap music first became popular back in the 80s. Many people campaigned against the very notion of calling rap “music.” They hated seeing rap embraced and legitimized as a new form of “music” within popular culture. Of course, against millions of rap listeners, their efforts were futile…much like this frustrated effort against blogs is. With numerous blogs having hundreds of thousands of daily readers, the blog is—like it or not—a common and accepted media format. - Barneyg 21:49, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b> - care to explain that sentiment in detail? Wikipedia is full of extensive pages on all kinds of obscure historical and contemporary figures, who's notability exists solely within their professional field. I'm concerned that this "War on Blogs" campaign is not effectively targeting vanity pages. I'm familiar with Tony from his activities with Laist, and he appears to have had a role of significance in the larger blogging community. I'll admit I'm just shy of a weak keep on this one, but IMHO, he's not necessarily worthy of a speedy delete. I'd rather see an intelligent effort at a more Wikipedia-ish reduction and re-write and evaluate the worthiness of the article from there. It doesn't appear to me that there was any serious effort to bring this article in line before becoming an AFD - why not? <a href="../../../g/l/o/User%7EGlowimperial_dfe0.html" title="User:Glowimperial">Glowimperial</a> 16:48, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

Could there be less of a welcome mat put out to potential contributors? I also have trouble seeing Tony's post as a "cry for help". He just posted about the situation.

He is a very prolific blogger (whether one agrees with blogging as notable or not, Tony's contributions to the medium are not insignificant) and has held high-profile jobs in online communities like Buzznet and LAist.

It continues, "This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, magazine articles..." etc. Pierce meets that criterion. A quick search of the Dow Jones/Reuters Factiva service shows Pierce has been the subject of articles from the <i>New York Times</i> (27 May 2004) (followed by an echo to the <i>Times</i>-owned <i>Int'l Herald Tribune</i> on 29 May); Reuters (10 July 2004); <i>Straits Times</i> (Singapore) (5 March 2006); <i>Reforma</i> (Mexico City) (2 April 2006); <i>EL PAIS</i> (Madrid) (20 April 2006); <i>Los Angeles Times</i> (16 October 2003, 27 Feb 2003, 12 July 2004, others); <i>Le Monde</i> (25 June 2005); and others. The search string was (Tony Pierce AND blog), and the variety of citation shows that some regard "just blogging" to be sufficient for notability, if one is widely enough known for it (just as one could become widely known for such synonyms "writing a diary", "writing a journal", "writing essays", etc.).

It should be noted that there appear to be an extraordinary number of suspicious votes (<a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>); it should also be noted that there is a concentrated effort to delete all blogging-related articles, without regard for notability or for following Wikipedia's guidelines. —<a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#333333">bbats</font></b></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><b><font color="#008000">e</font></b></a><a href="../../../b/b/a/User%7EBbatsell_88ca.html" title="User:Bbatsell"><b><font color="#333333">ll</font></b></a> <a href="../../../b/b/a/User_talk%7EBbatsell_7978.html" title="User talk:Bbatsell"><font color="#C46100" size="1">¿?</font></a> 02:22, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - pathetic self-promotion. If he wants a page, he should create a USERPAGE just like the rest of us. Loser. Techfan 02:24, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Most of the related links are back to his own blog. I am a blogger, but we all tend to have rather large egos, and if this was notable then we would have a flood of vanity entries. <a href="../../../n/o/n/User%7ENonforma_2271.html" title="User:Nonforma">Nonforma</a> 02:28, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> - notice, every one of those 'google news links' goes to another personal blog. --timecop 02:45, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Worthless, non-notable. He has a blog and nothing else- the content of this article is 100% redundant with his personal site. It's immaterial that there were a couple of newspaper articles that asked the interchangeable blogger of the moment what he thought about blogs. Wikipedia isn't a directory of people who have ever had their name mentioned in the newspaper.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Blogging is quickly becoming more and more accepted in terms of mainstream media, and if he is considered by the media to be one of the "forefathers" to modern blogging, and has been quoted, cited, interviewed, or otherwise been exposed by modern media as such, that's verification for me. Wikipedia isn't a directory of people who have ever had their name mentioned in the newspaper - true, but he's had his mentioned in places other than the newspaper, multiple times.<a href="../../../t/o/0/User%7ETo0n_3f13.html" title="User:To0n">To0n</a> 02:47, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> - Yes, he is also mentioned in blogs and the wikipedia article itself. Those sources are obviously inadequate. And the newspaper articles that people keep saying are "about him" aren't about him at all- they are about blogging and happen to mention him as an example. Ask yourself the question: Would this article have been substantially the same if they had chosen virtually any other blogger? If yes, then the article wasn't about him.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Quite notable. He is a well known journalist on the web, Don't delete because of a campaign against Bloggers. I'm glad it's now on <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digg.html" title="Digg">Digg</a>. I don't think people should just vote here, but I do think that all digg users who are editors of wikipedia should have this brought to their respective attentions as to contribute their opinions. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexbrewer_e09d.html" title="User:Alexbrewer">Alexbrewer</a> 02:53, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Someone (69.105.108.232) changed three Keep votes to Delete votes.

<li><b>Comment</b> I think pages like this ought to be editable only by those who wrote their portions of the page. This is inviting trouble if you ask me. Hey, lets hold the next presidential election on Wikipedia this way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Ignoring the fact that this person is a notable author, I strongly disapprove of groups trying to remove articles from Wikipedia because of their personal dislike of the article, or the individual featured. If this is allowed, it will be the end of Wikipedia.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is an actual notable person doing real things in the real world. Keep. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKing-of-no-pants_0cc6.html" title="User:King-of-no-pants">King-of-no-pants</a> 03:25, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Regardless of whether or not Tony Pierce *was* notable, the fact that there are now two large groups promoting agendas within Wikipedia over this article (one side anti-blogging and the other pro-blogging) has in fact made the article itself noteworthy. Removing it at this point will smack of censorship. <a href="../../../a/l/v/User%7EAlvonruff_646b.html" title="User:Alvonruff">Alvonruff</a> 03:26, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The fact that people disagree about whether a person is noteworthy doesn't make it per se noteworthy- that logic is preposterous. If the pro/anti-blogging issue is noteworthy, then give that issue its own page. And this isn't a pro/anti blogging issue anyway- it is a pro/anti trivia issue. And censorship requires a state actor, to call this "censorship" is simply histrionics.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../j/o/r/Talk%7EJordanhill_railway_station_0382.html#One_Millionth_Article" title="Talk:Jordanhill railway station">Jordanjill railway station</a> is Wikipedia's one millionth article and yet that fact isn't mentioned in the article, itself.

<li><b>Delete</b> This guy's exploits are just that; an exploit of a new syntax of referring to reverse-chronologically posted content. He simply takes shit and makes sculptures. But it's still boring, non-notable shit. --<a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysol_1b5f.html" title="User:Lysol">lesalle</a> 03:32, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Opinions on the work product of the subject of this encyclopedic article are entirely irrelevant.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I love to delete pages that are worthless (i've been a member for almost a year and I have made several contributions), but Tony Pierce is clearly notable and this page should not be deleted. He qualifies under all of the following: The person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field.; Widely recognized entertainment personalities and opinion makers&#160;; and Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagdela_ea2a.html" title="User:Magdela">Magdela</a> 03:44, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
