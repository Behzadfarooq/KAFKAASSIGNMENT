It would be messy and inaccurate to have a merged article in that category. Gammon has a distinct mission in its service to its denomination and as an historically-black institution and a distinct identity, all of which argues in favor of keeping a separate article on Gammon. This AfD started with the argument that Gammon might be a diploma mill. When it was demonstrated that Gammon <b>isn't</b> a diploma mill, it might have been best to have withdrawn the AfD. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 03:14, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>Comment'</i>. Diploma mills can still be notable. There isn't a criteria for deltion based on this. I commented on content forking. I see no reason to fork out this content. In fact, the parent article has much more information comparatively than the main article. The article does not say why it is notable, and shouldn't have been forked out, per guidelines. That is why it should be deleted, not because of the diploma mill claim.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 03:35, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This appears to be a legitimate seminary, founded in 1980. Searching on 'Whitefield Theological Seminary' on Google brings up a number of pages of references, many of them listings on the CVs of faculty at other seminaries. This does not seem to be a diploma mill, and neither is it an accredited college - it is a Christian seminary, for training ministers and religious workers. We have articles on high schools and elementary schools, why not on seminaries? --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 05:56, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Please supply sources for notability. Wikipedia <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> does not keep articles based on what "appears to be a legitimate". How many students attend? Is this bigger than a high school? Can you compare it to a high school? Does it have classrooms? Is it ran out of an apartment? Do the teachers have accredited degrees? How many teachers are there? Why isn't it accredited? Source for claiming its not a diploma mill? Etc etc. Without such issues to be judged with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> independent from the place itself such as article will be about what it isn't (accredited) and what the group claims to be.

<dd>I apologize for the length of the following; you asked for some verifiable information. I think most of the following is too trivial to include in the article, but it all contributes to my sense that this is a legitimate institution, in existence for some years. First: looking at the catalog (<a href="http://www.whitefield.edu/catalog.php" class="external text" title="http://www.whitefield.edu/catalog.php" rel="nofollow">catalog download</a>) this is in fact a "distance learning" sort of thing - they send lecture tapes out to students, who work with a mentor agreed on with the seminary. It doesn't appear to be that large - their administrative bulliten <a href="http://www.whitefield.edu/downloads/Administrative%20Bulletin.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.whitefield.edu/downloads/Administrative%20Bulletin.pdf" rel="nofollow">lists</a> something around 100 graduates.

<dd>Sorry, I fail to understand how lists of people of an unaccredited online "college" have to do with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Can you show this is notable? Or why we should care that "faculty" at other unaccredited schools have online degrees from Whitefield.</dd>
<dd>If you have sources to show notability or WP:V please add them to the article, and I'll withdraw this nomination.<a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 00:12, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, I think this shows is that this is not a diploma mill; these look like pretty respectable people, I don't think they would all be claiming phony degrees. Second, although the school doesn't have many graduates, it appears to be fairly important within its little Reformed community - 2 of the editors of the Christian Observer (out of about 20) have degrees from this school, and lots of faculty at other seminaries.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Another point I think should be understood here: you are constantly pointing out that the school is unaccredited. The school IS accredited, by the only organization that it cares about, namely the Reformed Presbyterian Church, which recognizes it as a valid training school for pastors (from the catalog). The school states clearly in the same catalog that it does not have secular accreditation and that credits taken there may be invalid elsewhere. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 05:25, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have noticed that <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> has a habit of nominating for deletion pages relating to religious institutions. Some of these articles have needed deletion, and I have voted to delete them. On some of them, it seems like he has not 'done his homework' in advance, and has nominated pages that ended up being kept. Sometimes, also, he can be quite, er, <i>robust</i> in his defence of his nominations. I would advise people to look closely at pages that <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> nominates for deletion, and to not be intimidated by his responses. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 06:02, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I nominate unnotable unaccredited schools: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_International_School_of_Management_%28ISM%29_d93c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/International School of Management (ISM)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/International School of Management (ISM)</a> and unnotable diploma mills: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_%C3%89cole_sup%C3%A9rieure_Robert_de_Sorbon_a813.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/École supérieure Robert de Sorbon">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/École supérieure Robert de Sorbon</a>/ <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_St._Clements_University_8c53.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/St. Clements University">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/St. Clements University</a>. There is a larger collection of these religious institutions that fail <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> than places that are diploma mills, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_St._Clements_University_8c53.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/St. Clements University">example</a>, that lack <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.

<dd>I got a better idea. Why not give sources that PROVE this is notable instead of trying to attack me. If you can show its notable, I'll withdraw the afd. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 07:19, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I apologize if my comment seemed like a personal attack. I have been semi-away from Wikipedia for a little while, and the last time I encountered AFDs from you was about a month ago, when you were trying to get rid of 3 professors at Dallas Baptist Theological Seminary - <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Jim_Underwood_4be6.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jim Underwood">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jim Underwood</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Darrell_Bock_a6b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Darrell Bock">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Darrell Bock</a>, and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_John_D._Hannah_4fd8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/John D. Hannah">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/John D. Hannah</a> - two bestselling authors and a well-known historian of theology, all 3 of which survived AFD (Hannah just barely.) Certainly, everyone who nominates articles for deletion has their failures - I have myself - but I thought this was a notable enough pattern to mention. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 17:02, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Most of these pages are not ads, IMO. Rather, I think the editors who created those pages were trying to make pages analagous to what already exists for firearms, such as <a href="../../../h/e/c/Heckler_%26_Koch_G36_48d5.html" title="Heckler &amp; Koch G36">Heckler &amp; Koch G36</a> and <a href="../../../m/4/_/M4_Carbine_8da6.html" title="M4 Carbine">M4 Carbine</a>.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The heel toe is a very mainstream dance. If you want numbers than look at google search results; everyone has heard of the crip walk and the harlem shake and if you do a search for 'crip walk dance' and harlem shake dance' there are 100,000 and 400,000 results respectively for each, while when searching for 'heel toe dance' 2.2 million results are found. Anyone who knows anything about hip hop dancing knows this move, hince it being listed on the hip hop dance wikipedia page before this heel toe page was written.</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> -- I think this article was originally posted by a campaign worker, given the original tenor and illustrations.

<p>This character appears to be a very minor fictional character if anything (google gives 548 hits). Unless its going to be merged with a larger list, I don't see how this is anywhere near notable enough to include into wikipedia. I appreciate that there are some people who edit wikipedia who are very fond of the digimon series... but that doesn't change its relevance, and it should follow the guidelines of all fiction here: minor characters don't get their own page. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonk_of_the_highest_order_d058.html" title="User:Monk of the highest order">Monk of the highest order</a> 03:01, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> While the coining of "Strivercruft" is not something I agree with, I can sympathize with the frustration that caused it to come about. With no disrespect meant to Striver, and casting no aspersions about his good faith, he has inflated the number of 9/11 conspiracy theory articles to an unmanageable level in an effort to gather support behind a wikiproject dedicated to the 9/11 "Truth Movement." So while it should be noted that there is an agenda behind nominating a great many of these articles for deletion, there is not neccessarily anything <i>sinister</i> or even wrong about said agenda. The agenda is simply keeping the granularity of Wikipedia on certain subjects in line with the notability of said subjects.--<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosicrucian_a63e.html" title="User:Rosicrucian">Rosicrucian</a> 16:06, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> a journalist for an online news service like taz or Telepolis is bound to get a lot of ghits, not that the presence or absence of google hits speaks to notability. Checking on Google News, there appear to be very few reports about Bröckers as opposed to those written by him. Writing lots of stuff is not a sign of notability, being written about is.

<p>Most of the assertions in this article are not verifiable. Or at least there has been no response to requests for sources of the claims made within the article. Ryter is described as <i>an acclaimed American erotic photographer</i>; erotic (and particularly, as here, homoerotic) photography isn't an area of which I am knowledgable, but I do know that <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Mapplethorpe_62c0.html" title="Robert Mapplethorpe">Robert Mapplethorpe</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/t/Ruth_Bernhard_d61e.html" title="Ruth Bernhard">Ruth Bernhard</a> and others genuinely have received acclaim for this, and I expect that any "acclaimed" practitioner will have had solo exhibitions and/or substantial, critically reviewed publications. No evidence is presented for either of these, yet the article makes for Ryter's work such large claims as that it "addresses such themes as male sexual identity, religious concepts of guilt, self-exploitation and the intrigue of violent images", which suggests a lot more than the run of the mill. The article does come with seven (horribly formatted) external links; I dutifully clicked all of them and found no evidence that Ryter does anything other than churn out what seems to be very humdrum beefcake and gay porn. I have summarized the findings here under the perhaps unfortunate title "So what's notable about Ryter?"; I'd emphasize here that the reason why I'm proposing that the article should be deleted is not that the subject is not notable (I'm not qualified to judge the relative notability of those in the beefcake and gay porn industries) but instead the <b>lack of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a></b> and also the way this article -- the entire substance of which has been provided by editors who have contributed nothing that isn't Ryter-related -- reads like a piece of <b><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="WP:NOT">advertising</a></b>. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 04:08, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - The relevant passage of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> reads <i>Painters, sculptors, architects, engineers, and other professionals whose work is widely recognized (for better or worse) and who are likely to become a part of the enduring historical record of that field</i>. I can find no evidence that Ryter is widely recognized now or is likely to become so in the future. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 04:11, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as per nomination. The article makes two assertions of notability. First is that Ryter has received worldwide acclaim, yet no support is given, nor can I independently verify this claim. The second is his association with Richard Avedon. Again, no verification is given. In addition, many, many people associated with Avedon in his long career and that fact doesn't make one notable in the absence of personal work. To paraphrase Sen. Bentsen, Ryter is no Avedon. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveHopson_68d6.html" title="User:SteveHopson">SteveHopson</a> 04:19, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Noting the post below this one, he does indeed appear to go by Bill rather than William. However, I pretty carefully studied the first 60 of the 181 unique hits I found using this new Google search <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22bill+christison%22+9/11+-wikipedia+-answer.com+-%22National+Family+Farm%22+-%22Missouri+Rural+Crisis+Center%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=190&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22bill+christison%22+9/11+-wikipedia+-answer.com+-%22National+Family+Farm%22+-%22Missouri+Rural+Crisis+Center%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=190&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[38]</a> which eliminates a few false positives and puts 9/11 into the search (hard to imagine many articles about this gentleman which wouldn't also have that term). I found nothing I would think of as a reliable source that implied notability. The only thing I did find was that he was an interviewee in a film (<a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm1591463/" class="external text" title="http://imdb.com/name/nm1591463/" rel="nofollow">imdb profile</a>) on the 9/11 conspiracies. I also searched a number of newspaper archives and found nothing but a mention of him as appearing in the foregoing film in the New York Times (<a href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?_r=1&amp;res=9D05E4DD1F3FF933A1575BC0A9629C8B63&amp;oref=slogin" class="external autonumber" title="http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?_r=1&amp;res=9D05E4DD1F3FF933A1575BC0A9629C8B63&amp;oref=slogin" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>).

<dd>How does this meet WP:BIO? The only basis I can see that we can try to fit him in is: <i>The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works.</i> He's not the primary subject of the film, nor of counterpunch nor of anything else cited. What we find is a walled garden of 9/11 conspiracy sources citing him, but when we get to reliable sources, we find almost nothing and what there is, is peripheral. I Simply don't think he meets the criteria.--<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 02:46, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, if you click on page ten or so you'll see that Google omits search results after a certain number (last time I checked it was 206, now its 400-something) - if you display those results you'll see that there are pages and pages of counterpunch articles where Chrisiston is not mentioned but an article of his is linked to in the sidebar. For example if he published an article on January 1, every article after that will link to his until there are enough to push him off the sidebar. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 12:23, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> -- if you are relying on the strength of the VIPS article to support inclusion here, that's a poor choice, as the VIPS article is poorly sourced itself (blogs like Commondreams for example). Conspiracy-theory articles are fine, so long as they rely upon mainstream reliable sources and summarize those sources and not the wild fantasies of CT'ers who come to Wikipedia to promote grand illusions of controlled-demolition-the-Jews-did-it-and-10,000-federal-employees-colluded-with-Haliburton-Peak-Oil-Cheney-is-a-Reptillian-Humanoid-LaRouchian-fantasy ideas are slapped together here on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorton_devonshire_9599.html" title="User:Morton devonshire">Morton devonshire</a> 00:06, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Agreed, VIPS is a bad article, but the organization is certainly quite notable, it has been cited in numerous print newspaper accounts, and of course its members have testified before Congress. Again it's not just VIPS for this particular article, however, it's the CIA's own website, as well as over 77,000 google hits. I totally agree with you about people promoting their own bizarre conspiracy theories through wikipedia, but that is not what we have here.

And what's wrong with an author making a diagram to illustrate his article? That's a <i>good thing</i> not a <i>bad thing</i>. I also disagree the article is impossible to work on -- it looks to me like standard wiki math markup, easy enough for anyone famliar with Wikipedia math or physics pages to work on. The article is a bit arcane, but I can easily imagine situations where someone might turn to Wikipedia to find the math equations behind blurriness as they contemplate a photo setup of some kind. Agreeing with <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffConrad_2432.html" title="User:JeffConrad">JeffConrad</a> I don't think the article should be merged into the <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circle_of_confusion.html" title="Circle of confusion">Circle of confusion</a> because it would take up too much space proportionally if combined into that article. I think the article is basically OK as is. -- <a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETechnopilgrim_d7d3.html" title="User:Technopilgrim">technopilgrim</a> 22:33, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Jacobson has several formulae with that factor. That's not the problem. The form and notation and presentation of the derivation here is tortured. It's even hard to follow and check to see if it's correct. It uses <span class="texhtml"><i>s</i> + Δ<i>s</i></span> for the distance at which the camera is focused, which is an approach I don't recall seeing before, and B for the circle of confusion diameter, even though it claims to use modern notation. It omits steps when it claims not to. The article is just a pile of equations without clear explanation or relationships between them. The drawing is strange, unlike any I've seen in an optics text. It could all be fixed with enough effort, but why? Is there any value in having such an article? If the presentation is clear, and the result is in a usable form, and it's clear when the approximations are good, it might be. It would of course be best to have an answer without the approximations first, but if you read Jacobson you'll see that's unlikely, since one the paramter needed to make it exact, the pupil magnification, is not even included. And unless there's a reference showing such a method, it is be definition original research. I've tried to start on a rewrite; got a drawing made; but there's nothing I can do but throw out what's there and start over, and I just don't see the point of that much work to fix something that has no real purpose. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDicklyon_1405.html" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> 02:51, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Fancruft, listcruft. Wikipedia isn't the place for articles on lists of comics. A similar page like this was for Fantastic 4, and got deleted. Spider-Man is very popular, but simply doesn't need this. A link on the Spider-Man page can easily be the solution to this. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 04:19, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>, this is a list of titles, not a list of appearances, and is an index to sub-articles on the various titles and major storylines, some of which are quite significant; it contributes to the all-important out-of-universe perspective; it precludes the necessity of incorporating much of this information into the Spider-Man article. It is virtually impossible to explain that Spider-Man has had multiple simultaneous series in any other way. Only Batman, Superman, and the X-Men are comparable in that sense. (I'm slightly baffled as to why the FF page was deleted, though I assume it didn't have the sub-articles--which are really the key issue.) <font style="font-family:Courier New;">--<a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelenKMarks_0689.html" title="User:HelenKMarks"><font style="font-size:12pt;">HKMarks</font></a><a href="../../../h/e/l/User_talk%7EHelenKMarks_89b5.html" title="User talk:HelenKMarks"><font style="position:relative;top:-5pt; font-size:6pt;">TALK</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HelenKMarks_4a8a.html" title="Special:Contributions/HelenKMarks"><font style="position:relative; font-size:6pt;left:-1em;">CONTRIBS</font></a></font> 04:53, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> while I believe the majority of this article is in fact a fine bibliography, the lower section "significant storylines" is not. Significant is inherently subjective for this sort of article and begs the title of listcruft as article creep from fans inevitably expands it. I'd say the article should be kept, but maintained only as a list of published works for reference, not fan opinion of what stories are good or not. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 12:13, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>It's not that they have a licensing agreement with Microsoft; it's that they collaborated with Microsoft to create a licensing agreement, which now bears their name and is apparently in widespread use. I haven't thoroughly researched this group, but preliminary research suggests that it's probably fairly influential. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 05:57, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> looks to me like someone had a go at him (with the controversy section being the main part of the first edit), then some of his followers must have looked him up and written good things about him.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I knew this nomination was going happen! I Agree with <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHworth</a>, but we should not remove "ALL". I have done some pretty dandy work on the Ontario Laws. I know for a fact their are some good sources hidden in the laws that where essentially dumped here! I personnaly try to reference the laws with news articles. For example I have a news article laminated on my wall with the new laws and my picture. (I made 3rd page in the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa_Sun_8ffd.html" title="Ottawa Sun">Ottawa Sun</a>). So we should comb through the information and remove, probably, most of the laws that where essentially just dumped into here. However we should try to keep from losing these IMPORTANT references; which unfortunatelly wasn't properly cited. (One reason I've been a little despaired) I'm actually debating if this is a bad faith nomination to only incite someone to clean up the article in a hurry. If so, I think that is bad. --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CyclePat</a> 01:03, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>No it is not a bad faith nomination. It's a terrible, terrible, terrible Wikipedia article. As I've stated to you and others in the past, the articles on here need to be ABOUT the laws, not the actual laws themselves. Our general practice is to talk about a law and then provide a link to the full text of the law at the bottom of the page. It's not to include extensive extracts of the law itself. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">(meow)</a></sup> 08:27, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>NO! absolutely not. This shouldn't be merged. <i>Electric Bicycle laws</i> is a large section of <i>electric bicycles</i> wich ironically is a subdivision of "motorized bicycles." As you may have noticed "Electric bicycle laws" article is big. It would be illogical at this point to try and merge all this information into electric bicycles (which is huge as is). I was actually thinking we could split the US, Canada and other countries to have their own article. Frankly I don't appreciate having this discussion here. I can see what you are trying to do. I appreciate the fact that this article needs to be cleaned but deleting sourced information is totally contrary to keeping a well balanced <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a> article.

<p>Does not appear to meet WP:CORP. From discussion page appears to contribute some services to Wikipedia Foundation, but no assertion of notability in this regard and given we have been deleting articles on Foundation board members I doubt that is enough reason to have this article.

<dd>Looked at the link, seems rather yelly and uncompelling to me, like most stuff on that site. Let's judge Schwartz Communications on its own merits as an article. I don't see any evidence of nepotism, just an article which as we scale up and our policies on certain things evolve and formalize, is now clearly nonencyclopedic. Incidentally, thanks to <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">User:Uncle G</a> for attempting to improve the article since my nomination, but it doesn't change my vote -- I feel the "controversy" dug up and added is itself quite nonnotable (the sort of thing which is unsurprising for any PR firm) and does not make the article subject notable. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp_7670.html" title="User:Martinp">Martinp</a> 11:00, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Actually, it's a good nomination. The nominator noted that the article had no sources, tried to find some for xyrself, and came up empty handed. No sources cited, and no sources to be found, is a good argument that an article is <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">unverifiable</a>, which is one of the primary reasons that we delete things, per our <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>.

<li><b>reply</b> Well, I'm not really much of a wrestling fan, but the fact that the article is poorly written does NOT automatically make the subject not notable. It makes the article a <i>stub</i> that needs expansion, but for all I know, the subject MAY be notable. The subject of professional wrestling <i><b>is</b></i> notable, so widely-known participants thereof are by extension notable. That's why I suggested bringing it to the attention of the WikiProject.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I've always considered internet forums as a whole non-notable unless they have a very specific reason to be notable. For example, SomethingAwful is notable, as are 4chan and 2chan. MMORPG official forums are generally not notable enough to have their existance described in an article--if anything, they should have a section in the main game's article, or not at all. I play <a href="../../../e/v/e/EVE_Online_f4f6.html" title="EVE Online">EVE Online</a>, and our forum has over a hundred thousand active members and over 3.5 million posts, but even I don't think it deserves its own article, or even a section in the main article. There's nothing encyclopedic about your average internet game forum. — <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari"><span style="background-color:#DDDDFF; font-weight:bold"><font color="#0000FF">Da</font><font color="#0000CC">rk</font> <font color="#000099">Sh</font><font color="#000066">ik</font><font color="#000033">ar</font><font color="#000000">i</font></span></a> <font color="#000088"><sup><a href="../../../d/a/r/User_talk%7EDark_Shikari_d292.html" title="User talk:Dark Shikari"><i>talk</i></a></sup><b>/</b><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dark_Shikari_f6a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dark Shikari"><i>contribs</i></a></sub></font> 14:04, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I've played both WoW and <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Heroes_1cf2.html" title="City of Heroes">City of Heroes</a>, and compared to the CoH official forums, the WoW forums are quite unhelpful and vexatious. This has nothing to do with their notability, of course. But it isn't really surprising or informative to learn that WoW, like most other major MMORPGs, has an official forum. A link to the forums in the main <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_of_Warcraft_d385.html" title="World of Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> article seems enough. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 14:28, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> While the article appears to be pretty well organized and written, as above it has no external, independent references cited. The information is probably accurate, but there are no references of independent sources actually talking about these forums, such as a reliable news article or established gaming reviewer talking about the forums, how they're structured, and what makes them actually interesting and different from similar forums. In other words, the article is probably almost entirely original research about a set of forums that isn't really different from official forums for other popular games. Unless there is something that makes these forums stand out, and there are independent sources to verify it, the article should be deleted. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 20:12, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> the prod reason (although initially disputed) seems to sum it up: "this article seems mainly to consist musing on what Vision of Britain mean by the term. it doesn't appear anywhere else and would seem to be a neologism." <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 12:06, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> At Talk:Titular_county it was explained that this is a neologism that seems not to have meaning outside the 'Vision of Britain' database. There is no incentive to bend the Wikipedia rules to add this to the world as a useful term, because it isn't useful. Some UK counties have a confusing way of referring to themselves, but this doesn't solve the problem.

<li>Hi! I've been with Wikipedia for over a year now and contribute primarily to Nigeria-related articles (also occasional XfD discussions). I normally feel very strongly about keeping Nigeria-related articles that show up here, mostly because we really do suffer from a lack of them. However, I think that this article should be <b>deleted</b> for several reasons, not the least of which is that <a href="http://www.nigerianyellowpages.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.nigerianyellowpages.com/" rel="nofollow">this site has been axed by its host and no longer exists</a>. Beyond that, the site itself (not the Wikipedia article) has always been very spammy and not particularly useful. If people want to write more articles about Nigeria, that's wonderful, but this isn't a good place to start. We have very few <a href="../../../n/o/l/Nollywood.html" title="Nollywood">Nollywood</a>-related articles, Nigerian popular music is brutally underrepresented, and our articles on Nigerian politicians are frequently out of date and no longer accurate. But I can't see what this or any article on nigerianyellowpages.com (or even <a href="http://yellowpages.com.ng/" class="external text" title="http://yellowpages.com.ng/" rel="nofollow">yellowpages.com.ng</a> which isn't a lot better) could possible add to the encyclopedia that would be of value. <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgot_f9f1.html" title="User:Ergot">ergot</a> 16:22, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Hello, I cannot see the site being axe. I can sense some Wikipedian being a competitor to NigerianYellowPages.com especially the last commentator mentioning a competiting yellowpages called <a href="http://yellowpages.com.ng" class="external free" title="http://yellowpages.com.ng" rel="nofollow">http://yellowpages.com.ng</a> .

<li>I actually expected Ergot to confirm some comment regarding online content of Nigerian newspapers and whether the cites references are truly news event since he has been writing on Nigerian article, he should have provided some insight rather than offering a competiting yellow pages site.....something is hidden here. truly Afriwedd 08:46, 13 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Afriwedd, please <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. If people are looking for a hidden agenda, they might equally imagine that some people who have contributed to this discussion have a commercial interest in keeping the Wikipedia article as an additional free high-profile web presence for the company, and for <a href="../../../s/e/o/SEO_d889.html" title="SEO">SEO</a> purposes. Of course, I couldn't possibly believe such a thing myself: I am merely pointing out to you where your argument of "something hidden", taken to its logical conclusion, leads. Let's assume that no-one has an axe to grind. My reading of Ergot's argument is that he disinterestedly believes the company is not notable, and that the article adds nothing to Wikipedia. I say to you again, <i>please</i> read the nomination: the problem with the article is <i>not</i> that it is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>, the problem is that it is not verifiably <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> per <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. --RobertG ♬ <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobertG_9f35.html" title="User talk:RobertG">talk</a> 11:13, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To be clear, I have absolutely no reason to doubt that the newspaper cuttings quoted are genuine, and I am sorry if I have given any other impression. I reiterate a point that I have made here frequently: there is no doubt that Nigerian Yellow Pages is a Nigerian company offering a business directory of considerable utility, with an internet presence. If the thoughtful and balanced comment above is anything to go by, the company is clearly a good one to do business with. I wish the company every success. I am purely asking the Wikipedia community whether the subject of the article meets the notability criteria, which are clearly laid out at <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>.</dd>
<dd>I would be distressed if this discussion reflected badly on your business. That is the very last thing I want.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Great contribution from NigerianYellowPages. I also wish your company the very best.

<dd>I thought the article on Europages was nominated for deletion, and that was removed, and Nigerian Yellow Pages still suggested for deletion. I've raised this before, that we do not have a balanced judgement here.....since I've been using Wikipedia, Europages has never been up for deletion, only when someone raised the issue, then people thought of it for deletion. Again...numbers of people who are here day-in day-out with their comments, never mentioned of Europages as not in line with Wikipedia policy, but bent on making several comments on Nigerian Yellow Pages. I've been condemed for my remark before now.....and my very reason of not becoming a member...becos I do not like unbiased comments. With or without this article, someone already suggested we westerners will not be deprived of information we need, but I can assume we can get it from Europages. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 134.146.0.12 (<a href="../../../1/3/4/User_talk%7E134.146.0.12.html" title="User talk:134.146.0.12">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_134.146.0.12_747e.html" title="Special:Contributions/134.146.0.12">contribs</a>) 15 October 2006 17:16 (UTC)</small>

<li><b>Comment.</b> Most of these newspapers have websites with online archives. I don't have time to go through all the refs right now, but I did pull up the first one, which is given as "ThisDay Newspaper, Page 26. November 3, 2005". <a href="http://www.thisdayonline.com/news.php?archive=2005-11-03" class="external text" title="http://www.thisdayonline.com/news.php?archive=2005-11-03" rel="nofollow">Here is ThisDay from November 3, 2005</a>. I didn't read all the articles, but NigerianYellowPages is certainly not mentioned in any of the headlines, nor do any of the articles have headlines that suggest that they might be about this website. I doubt that any coverage therein would be nontrivial, but I would appreciate it if someone with more time than I have could take a look. Additionally, that "AboutUs.org featured site" link is pointing at someone's wiki, which would almost certainly not be considered a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgot_f9f1.html" title="User:Ergot">ergot</a> 14:35, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment.</b> Aboutus featuring NigerianYellowPages.com among the many millions of site could have been a good credit and recognition of the work done by this company. At least, NigerianYellowPages.com do not owned or control the decision for its site to be featured. What interest me to comment is what I found on the wiki site at <a href="http://www.aboutus.org/NigerianYellowPages.com" class="external free" title="http://www.aboutus.org/NigerianYellowPages.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.aboutus.org/NigerianYellowPages.com</a> i.e <b>The place to go if you're looking for a business in Nigeria.</b></li>
<li><b>Keep.</b>There is considerable evidence that is should be kept. Someone in this trend mentioned being a Nigerian, and that he saw the newspapers articles. I need to ask where Egot comes from if he is knowledgable about Nigeria society itself. I can also confirm that not all article in a day (eidtion) newspaper are made available on the web. The major headlines are posted, and that very newspaper has hundreds of other articles. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 86.62.6.162 (<a href="../../../8/6/2E/User_talk%7E86.62.6.162.html" title="User talk:86.62.6.162">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.62.6.162_fcbf.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.62.6.162">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Reply.</b>It is a pity such words came from you. How on earth would someone see a yellow pages with considerable innovation and progress as irrelevant. If it is irrelevant, how come Celtel that just came into the country recognised the need to put their link on its website so that all Nigerians can have access to business directory at their finger tips?

<li><b>Keep</b> This article definitely qualifies, in my opinion. With my short time on wikipedia, I've seen lots of articles with only references to books e.tc whose presence are not web-based. e.g <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigeria.html" title="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>. If those references are doubted, people would have commented on them, same with Nigerian Yellow Pages - becos many Nigerians themselves would have raise a comment. Only Egot who is familiar with Nigeria articles, but making a reference to another competitor without any need for it - which makes someone thought of him being the competitor itself. Let us not be biased in making judgement. TylerOH 16:21, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, If anything all candidates for upcoming elections should have entries where possible for use by voters. Just because they're highly localized entries, does not mean they aren't meaningful to a portion of Wikidepia's readership. This is especially true for the Ottawa Election as of Oct 11th, now that the financing on O-Train is dependent on ratification by the soon-to-be-newly elected council. Removal of non-winning candidates can be scheduled for after the election.Besides, I find it odd that only candidates for this highly contested ward are being marked for deletion so close to the election date. At least be consistent.user:Dogboots --</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I've looked through them (by the way, you can link to articles using [[article name]]). Many of them are notable for reasons other than these current elections -- for example, several held other elected positions, such as Mayor, Councillor, or LAO member, one was an olympic athlete, and so on. (In fact, some of the articles don't mention these current elections at all.) The others, I'm sure, will shortly be nominated for deletion now that they have been conveniently listed.

<dd>Biocchi is a former Olympic athlete. Haydon is a former mayor. Perruzza and Parker are former MPPs. Perks is notable as an environmentalist. Dominelli, Kennedy and Sewell are former city councillors attempting a <i>return</i> to council; that they're not <i>current</i> incumbents doesn't make them non-notable. Vaughan is a notable television journalist. Newman is a former provincial party leader. And Ainslie <i>is</i> an incumbent; that he was appointed to replace another councillor rather than being elected in 2003 does not make him any less an incumbent. And Thomas has stood as a major party candidate in a <i>federal</i> election — the notability of federal election candidates is a bit contested on Wikipedia, but the absolute minimum he's entitled to per Wikipedia precedent is to be merged into <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Democratic_Party_candidates%2C_2004_Canadian_federal_election_1aba.html" title="New Democratic Party candidates, 2004 Canadian federal election">New Democratic Party candidates, 2004 Canadian federal election</a>.

<li>Despite my smackdown of the "she's just as notable as <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Sewell_a1e2.html" title="John Sewell">John Sewell</a>" argument above, I'm actually indecisive about this; she <i>is</i> at least moderately well-known in political circles, particularly through her former prominence in the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Federation_of_Students_409e.html" title="Canadian Federation of Students">Canadian Federation of Students</a>. <i>I</i> knew who she was a <i>decade</i> ago, and I'm <i>not</i> all that well-connected politically. Whether she's notable <i>enough</i> for Wikipedia at this point, I'm not sure, but she <i>does</i> have <i>some</i> notability. And, for that matter, the election is exactly one month away — since they're in a ward whose incumbent did not stand for reelection, Smallman or one of the other two Kitchissippi candidates currently under AFD will be entitled to come <i>back</i> in just a few weeks. (The AFD machine has <i>already</i> taken on bios of Ottawa city councillors and determined that Ottawa <i>is</i> one of those cities large and notable enough that its municipal council can be considered notable; the precedent on AFD isn't that municipal politicians are <i>never</i> notable, but that it depends on variables like the size of the city.) So all in all, she's near my personal dividing line; I'm just not sure which side of it she's on. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 18:41, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Article Creator Comment</b> <i>if you want to skim thru, read the points in bold.</i> Hmm.. As the editor who split this article, I don't think I should have a say in the final decision to avoid conflict of interest. So, let me just give you the reasons of my actions. First, I stumbled upon this article when looking for info on <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_of_superman.html" title="Death of superman">death of superman</a>. I like comic books, but am not a collector or an afficionado. (but perhaps I'm going there). When I found <a href="../../../a/v/e/Avengers_%28comics%29.html" title="Avengers (comics)">Avengers (comics)</a> article I felt it was getting <a href="../../../s/i/z/WP%7ESIZE_929b.html" title="WP:SIZE">WP:SIZE</a>, especially the <a href="../../../a/v/e/Avengers_%28comics%29.html#History" title="Avengers (comics)">Avengers (comics)#History</a> and <a href="../../../a/v/e/Avengers_%28comics%29.html#Alternate_Avengers" title="Avengers (comics)">Avengers (comics)#Alternate Avengers</a> section. Which I think should be merged into one section and moved split into another article on the History of Avengers (comics) but I'm not knowledgable enough on the subject to execute a good move. The next that IMHO should be split is <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Avengers_issues_338f.html" title="List of Avengers issues">List of Avengers issues</a> which lists avenger issues. The AfD notice <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamdav86_f6fc.html" title="User:Jamdav86">Jamdav86</a> left on my talk led me to the AfD which led to <a href="../../../c/m/c/WT%7ECMC_d7a5.html" title="WT:CMC">WT:CMC</a> After browsing thru the <a href="../../../c/m/c/WT%7ECMC_d7a5.html" title="WT:CMC">WT:CMC</a>, I couldn't find POV talks relating to the issues, just the bibliography notability debate. Which made me realize that there is a bibliography page on the avengers, <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bibliography_of_Avengers_titles_ce94.html" title="Bibliography of Avengers titles">here</a>. Which in turn would mean that this is actually a duplicate article. <b>So, I think it should rather be merged into that existing article, or if bibliography is deemed non notable, then the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bibliography_of_Avengers_titles_ce94.html" title="Bibliography of Avengers titles">bibliography</a> article should be merged into the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Avengers_issues_338f.html" title="List of Avengers issues">list</a> instead.</b> Whichever the concensus leads to. I'd be bold and do that right now if it isn't because of AfD. On, the POV issue raised in this AfD. My search on the <a href="../../../c/m/c/WP%7ECMC_eb00.html" title="WP:CMC">WP:CMC</a> yield no talk on POV pertaining the content of the article. It's maybe buried in the archive. I dunno. But again, IMHO, POV issues should be solved with a <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a> instead of an AfD and therefore, <b>this nomination should be refused and the article should be kept with the merge point considered.</b> Feureau 16:52, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, in this case (as in some others) I believe it would relate to <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a> as it is more an issue of bias against certain issues instead of their notability. If it was a true List of <i>Avengers</i> issues, it would contain all issues of <i>Avengers</i> and the notability criteria would apply to the list as a whole, however that some/many issues are not included shows a bias against them, which is POV. --<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsyphics_cd27.html" title="User:Psyphics">Newt</a><a href="../../../p/s/y/User_talk%7EPsyphics_6867.html" title="User talk:Psyphics"><small><sub>Ψ</sub></small></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Psyphics_3fc1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Psyphics"><small><sub>Φ</sub></small></a> 16:45, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Content issues are not deletion criteria, as they can easily be rectified. The concept of the list itself is not unworthy of keeping, and definitely shouldn't be merged back into <a href="../../../a/v/e/Avengers_%28comics%29.html" title="Avengers (comics)">Avengers (comics)</a>.

<li><b>KEEP</b> James Dicks is very well known. He claims to be a best selling author, produces 12 hours of radio programming a day, claims to be the "world's leading expert in forex trading." There are 17,300 hits when googling for "James Dicks" and all the hits on the first several pages appear to refer to this guy. The article has several links including a Fox TV news report, a feature <a href="../../../h/o/u/Houston_Press_a5dd.html" title="Houston Press">Houston Press</a> (alternative) newspaper article, a financial website "Stupid Investment of the Week." And there are several rip-off reports. There is no question that the guy is notable. The article was originally put up as a puff advertising piece, and now that I've corrected it and made it NPOV, he wants to delete it. The previous vote was to <b>KEEP</b> after the corrections were made.<a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmallbones_ca2c.html" title="User:Smallbones">Smallbones</a> 19:25, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per Smtusa. There are numerous false claims in this article and unless it can be proven that the aligations are true, they don't belong in Wikipedia. The whole article seems like it is trying to prove his guilt, when in fact he has never been convicted of these accusations. "He is reportedly the nephew of Charles Givens...." Where is the proof. Anyone can make statements like this and it seems this article is completely bias and draws conclusions without facts. Writing in such a manner is liable. FYI, it is not James Dicks who wants this article deleted (although I am sure he does), but me, for the sake of keeping Wikipedia free from bias opinions against those you don't like. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.193.232.253 (<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User_talk%7E66.193.232.253.html" title="User talk:66.193.232.253">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.193.232.253_5b26.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.193.232.253">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Yeah, it probably is complete bullocks, but it does seem to be part of certain belief systems.

It also shows up in similar context in Frazer's <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Golden_Bough_77a3.html" title="The Golden Bough">The Golden Bough</a>.

<li><b>Keep and disambiguate</b>. It's incorrect to say that all the sources are "weird religious blogs and websites." Sources include an article from the New York Times, an article from <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metroactive.html" title="Metroactive">Metroactive</a>, <a href="http://www.conelrad.com/media/atomicmusic/sh_boom.php?platter=22" class="external text" title="http://www.conelrad.com/media/atomicmusic/sh_boom.php?platter=22" rel="nofollow">this audio recording</a> from the 1960s, and an article featuring the subject in <i>Virtue Magazine</i>. I think this concept is ludicrous, but it's something that exists and is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>. On top of these sources, I've actually heard a conservative pastor use the phrase on more than one occasion (of course, that's original research, but it does help to demonstrate that the idea exists). Additionally, one of the sources references another published source from <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Jones_University_ab2f.html" title="Bob Jones University">Bob Jones University</a>, though I don't have the actual source.

<li><b>Delete</b> as I am the nominator. Also, an article from the 60s, an article in "Virtue Magazine", and something published by Bob Jones University (not exactly the most credible of publishing houses) do not give a term currency. The google test is pretty conclusive; and even when the term is found in use through google, it is pretty much just a racist slur with no consistent semantic use or definition (other than as "black people" music). It's consistently used to refer to a video game, a style of music, and even a movie... but not what this article claims. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThemindset_22b6.html" title="User:Themindset">Themindset</a> 18:38, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>, more accurately, we're dealing with a newspaper article from the 1990s, an audio recording from the 1960s, a 2006 article on the subject in a magazine, a 1980s New York Times article, and a BJU publication (which, by the way, is <i>certainly</i> a reliable source for what fundamentalist Christians think, wouldn't you say?). On top of those sources, we have the use of the term on the religious blogs and websites. While these websites and blogs are likely unreliable sources generally, they are certainly evidence that the term is used <i>exactly</i> as the article describes. If the problem is that this term can refer to multiple subjects, disambiguation, not deletion, is required. · <b><a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#707070">j e r s y k o</font></a></b> <i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#465945" size="1">talk</font></a></i> · 18:42, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and Expand</b> This AFD is a classic example of common wrong-headed deletionist practices. If something doesn't pass the google test, or isn't something with which the typical North American wikipedian isn't familiar with, then it's put up for deletion. Oppositon to rock music was an extremely important part of American fundemantalist Protestantism for decades, and in terms of cultural history, this opposition, and the terminology it engendered is important. I would prefer to see an entire article on this kind of opposition to Rock music, and the ways in which it was amalgamized with Communism and everything else fundamentalist Protestants didn't like. And there's a lot of material out on these topics, but alas, a lot of it is in academic libraries and not in Google. So keep and mark for expansion. --<a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZantastik_9813.html" title="User:Zantastik"><font color="black">Zantastik</font></a> <a href="../../../z/a/n/User_talk%7EZantastik_58c9.html" title="User talk:Zantastik"><font color="darkgreen" size="1">talk</font></a> 20:38, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I am an inclusionist, important thing to note since I nominated this article. This is a term that is not in currency, therefore not fit for an article. Perhaps the use of the term can be contained in an article like North American fundemantalist Protestant opposition to rock music or North American fundemantalist Protestant opposition to stuff in general they didn't like, or something of the sort. And, more to the point, to me Jungle beat means <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drum_and_bass.html" title="Drum and bass">Drum and bass</a> and is the more accurate meaning of the term. If someone comes on to wikipedia to look up Jungle beats and jungle music and the first line they see is "A jungle beat or jungle music is a beat or musical style that is inherently evil, immoral, and/or sensual"... well, that's a disservice to both the reader and to wikipedia as an encyclopedic resource.

<li><b>Comment</b>, how about a little <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a>? Everything in the article is supported by the sources mentioned at the bottom of the article (and you miscounted, the source is linked 3 times in the article text, along with two others). Your unsupported assertion that people are searching Wikipedia for drum and bass if they type in "jungle beat" (actually, isn't that <a href="../../../j/u/n/Jungle_music.html" title="Jungle music">Jungle music</a>?? and wasn't Starblind saying it meant a video game? so which of the three is it?) is a dubious ground for <i>deletion</i> when the article is verifiable. It is certainly evidence that this needs to be a disambiguation page, as there are clearly three or four subjects that could fall under the term "jungle beat".

<dd>The first source is ANUS itself - not a third party. The second is GNAA - not reliable. The third documents its Alexa ranking, which only verifies that the website exists but not much else. The fourth is a directory which, reliable or not, would again only verify that the site exists. The fifth is the site itself. That leaves a lack of reliable third party sources establishing anything notable or verifying most of the content within the article. GassyGuy 07:33, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>In contrast to you I think it is more reference than one can expect for a site about heavy metal. If you look at the other sites in the google link I posted above, you will notice that the important ones have Wikipedia entries, too (Encyclopedia Metallum, BNR Metal). Mainstream reference is even rarer for those sites. It is in the nature of a subgenre that is not well presented in mainstream publications, but this alone doesn't make ANUS non-notable.

<li>If all the references can do is confirm that the site exists, then it leaves little too no verifiable content <i>about</i> the website for the article. Per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, you cannot have articles without verifiable content. Per <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, you cannot just use the site itself to write about it. If heavy metal websites do not get mainstream coverage, then they shouldn't get Wikipedia articles. Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia - it documents things which meet the guidelines; it does not need to acknowledge the presence of everything under the sun, and especially not everything on the Internet.

<li>I see a problem in your skewed standards. Those other sites are not nominated for deletion, because they don't offend as ANUS does. Although there are clearly <i>more</i> external references for ANUS than for, say, Enclopdia Metallum, ANUS is nominated for deletion. In consequence it appears that this article is focused on and nominated for deletion because of its content, and not because of notability issues. I myself leave the ANUS doctrine aside, judge by the various references on the article page alone and come to the conclusion that ANUS is noteworthy. n.b. I don't call for the deletion of other heavy metal articles, this is just to show the hypocrisy of this debate. Best Regards, Aor 11:35, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If what you say is true, then I would likely express a similar opinion at an AfD for Encyclopedia Metallum. I have not had a chance to look at that article. However, your argument is specious. I have told you what my problem with the ANUS article are. Others cite similar claims. It is really a matter of addressing them. If other websites have similar problems meeting <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, they should be nom'ed for deletion, but the existence of other articles that should be deleted is not a reason to keep this one.

<ul>
<li>Of what use are guidelines that are enforced only, or more strictly, on articles with offending/dissident content? That is not in any way an encyclopedic approach, and I can only reiterate my conclusion which springs from such behaviour: that something else than the denied encyclopedic adequacy of the topic motivates those who nominate the article for deletion. As a result, articles like ANUS get singled out while others, which, by your standards should have long been deleted (if you abode by those standards), remain. In the end, this hilarious debate is pointless. Those who want the article removed because they have personal objections, which of course aren't sufficient reason for deletion, are not honest and do not aim for consensus.

<li>First off, any argument based upon some supposed equality between ANUS and Encyclopedia Metallum is flawed right from the start. ANUS has a current Alexa rank of 66,041, while EM's is only 4,781... more than ten times better than ANUS. (Yes, I know Alexa isn't everything, but it's the quickest way to compare two websites, and these two aren't even in the same ballpark). Believe it or not, this is an argument we've heard countless times before, in misguided support of everything from high-school athletes to video game ROM hacks to people's pet cats. In fact, we hear it so much that there's even a couple of essays written specifically as a rebuttal to this argument.

<dd>The Clarin article doesn't say anything about ANUS except confirmation that it exists and is somehow associated with metal - that's not non-trivial coverage. The Launch one is also not non-trivial; it's more about the Slayer incident than ANUS, who is simply mentioned in passing as being associated with it. The Houston one is the strongest of the three, but it's not being featured in a real article, it's part of a "best of" special feature. That's borderline; it may or may not count as non-trivial coverage by a reliable source, but I hardly see that as strong evidence of notability any more than a paragraph in any other special interest (e.g., the tech section) area of a paper would qualify most sites.

<p><b>Strong delete</b> It seems that the sickeningly egalitarian rules on this let's-pretend 'encyclopedia' deem it permissible to have articles like "List of props appearing in episode 432 of The Simpsons" but regard articles about subcultural phenomena, especially when the philosophies espoused by such subcultures go against the grain of placid Hindu-cattle conformity which this 'encyclopedia' promotes, to be a waste of precious server space. The irony of this is that the fool who nominated this article for deletion clearly doesn't even understand the first thing about what he read in the article. He claims that this is vanity. The thing is, Yomangani, vanity is a distinctly <b>un</b>-nihilistic trait. There is no reason for a nihilist to be vain, because it is placing value upon something that is transitory and fleeting. It seems to be thing at Wikipedia, though, that ignorance, political correctness, pseudoscientific twaffle and Judeo-Christian moral systems are regarded as sacrosanct, while logic, beauty and intellectualism are condemned as not being important enough for inclusion.</p>
<p>Iconoclast, so anything can be included in this pretty 'encyclopedia' except for 'fascistic neopagan ideology'? Let me tell you something, fool. Nihilism implies <b>atheism</b>, not neopaganism. Neopaganism is a pointless romantic revisionist historical creation which, while having aesthetic appeal to some, is far removed from any critically tenable conception of the world. You're ignorant, Iconoclast, but we agree on one thing. The world is indeed deteriorating. But the world is not deteriorating because of black metal. It is deteriorating because people are terrified of the truth, and would rather exist in a novocainesque facade of shopping malls, designer clothing, plastic music and trendy stupidity. The fact that there are some people who would rather have no part of that existence is mortally offensive to these herd-grazers, and that is why they want to delete this article. But this 'encyclopedia' is also helping the world to destroy itself. Knowledge is not for everyone. It is not democratic. Knowledge is an aristocracy. A fool cannot savour the existential fullness granted by reading the works of Nietzsche, or playing with the abstractions of higher mathematics. They content themselves here by editing articles on the local highway and their favourite television show. Pseudoscience is promoted here at the same level as real science. Religion is privileged above art.</p>
<p>That being said, there is no real reason why this article should be here. Its presence merely indicates perceived importance on the part of those who are not fit to judge. Nonetheless, it would illustrate just how fucking hypocritical the ostensive egalitarian nature of this 'encyclopedia' is, if the article were to be deleted. Any ideology has to censor that which poses a threat to itself. And while I do not delude myself into thinking that the ideology of black metal poses any real threat to the nauseating stupor of left-liberalism at the moment, its time will come. The reaction, though, of people to intellectualism and anti-egalitarianism is an inbuilt and natural extension of the left-liberal mindset, because ultimately this is what poses the biggest threat to the 'utopia' in which we live. So, if the people at Wikipedia are to truly practice the revolting morality which they preach, they will keep this article, not because they agree with it, or because it is in accord with whatever insane so-called 'rules' there are here. They will keep this article to avoid making bigger prats of themselves than they already are.</p>

<p><b>Strong Keep</b> A.N.U.S is an absolutely superb resource for numerous musical genres and subcultures. It is particularly insightful and well written. Indeed as someone who specialised in music youth and subculture as part of thier political studies I can only but wonder why this sight has been deemed inapproprate for this site. I would go so far as to argue that its relevance is particulalry pertinent due to the sure number of related pages of this nature concerning music in the metal scene. Many of those above that have nominated this page for deletion furthermore seem totally unfamiliar with the topic at hand and its deeper meaning and consequence for those who live this style of life and make it thier approach and philosophy.

<p><b>Keep</b> There are articles for similar organizations on Wikipedia, such as the Gay Nigger Association of America and the <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult_of_the_Dead_Cow_4e61.html" title="Cult of the Dead Cow">Cult of the Dead Cow</a>. The former has withstood votes for deletion several times, and the latter does not appear to be controversial. Thus I think <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Nihilist_Underground_Society_d6a7.html" title="American Nihilist Underground Society">American Nihilist Underground Society</a> is also a legitimate article for a notable organization. --<a href="../../../a/f/e/User%7EAfed_b194.html" title="User:Afed">Afed</a> 00:20, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> Anus is definitely more notable than the <a href="../../../g/n/a/GNAA_29cf.html" title="GNAA">GNAA</a> or even the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libertarian_National_Socialist_Green_Party_2535.html" title="Libertarian National Socialist Green Party">Libertarian National Socialist Green Party</a>, and both articles have survived deletion votes before. Anus has been around longer (since the BBS era), operates several websites (Anus.com, Corrupt.org, Sodomy.org and many more) and has been more active recently than GNAA, "trolling" both the cyberspace and <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meatspace.html" title="Meatspace">meatspace</a> (through flyering). Besides, Anus is much more than a simple trolling organisation, it advocates a philosophy and a lifestyle, and has articles that inform a certain subcuture (Death Metal / Nihilist culture) I can't see why it is less notable than <a href="../../../w/i/p/Wipipedia.html" title="Wipipedia">Wipipedia</a> which serves approximately the same purpose for the BDSM subculture. In fact, it can be said that the articles on Anus.com constitute social commentary that qualifies it on the same level of notability as <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lew_Rockwell.com_4214.html" title="Lew Rockwell.com">Lew Rockwell.com</a> and various other social commentary websites.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - The reason I originally made this page was to describe some of the more typical <a href="../../../t/o/o/Tool-assisted_speedrun.html" title="Tool-assisted speedrun">tool-assisted speedrunning</a> aspects by means of a concrete example, as this is the best textbook example of the phenomenon (and likely, the article would end up being big enough to warrant a split). It probably would have been better if A Man In Black hadn't proposed its deletion, since that's exactly the time that I stopped writing it.&#160;:) I'm sorry for making a non-notable article, but will still keep a copy around on my hard disk to move some of its contents back into <a href="../../../t/o/o/Tool-assisted_speedrun.html" title="Tool-assisted speedrun">tool-assisted speedrun</a>. —<a href="../../../m/s/i/User%7EMsikma_222d.html" title="User:Msikma">msikma</a> &lt;<a href="../../../m/s/i/User_talk%7EMsikma_e16b.html" title="User talk:Msikma">user_talk:msikma</a>&gt; 05:31, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Is Bowden being judged as an academic, a practitioner, or as a writer/performer? Bowden is none of these alone. Bowden does his work as a psychologist and writer/actor and manages to churn out an occasional scholarly article for publication/presentation in refereed journals. He also manages to practice his profession, and to write/produce original plays.

<li><b>Agreed</b>. I agree, theatre is not local when it moves beyond the local area - but not by tour or popularity alone - not only because you argue against 'popular press' as a reason to delete Bowen's article. The international attention Bowen accrued for his theatre accomplishments outweigh what 'theatre-concious people in Chicago' might be aware of. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Zimmerman_b4a8.html" title="Mary Zimmerman">Mary Zimmerman</a>'s work on The Oedypus was not noted when she first produced it in Chicago in the late 80s but has since gained at least national (if not international attention). Have all of Chicago theatre folks heard of this production? Let's not let provincialism among a select few from the city of big shoulders diminish the international accomplishments of writing/producing three shows in three years SIMULTANEOUSLY (but before in each case) with an international film release of related content.

<li><b>Comment</b> Don't get too hung up on my using Chicago as an example. I probably should have written "City A" and "City B" rather than two specific names.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Perhaps remove the allegation the the series creator is Bill Handel's brother, other than that there is no problem. This user who nominated it, nominated the other day too before any edit war happened, he (Orazio?) has clearly a religious censorship agenda. This man is trying to censor all the articles about the adult industry! The fact is that this has been a well trafficked article since May, the wikipedia article is the second google search result for meatholes and provides useful information about the series, its creator, and the women who have been in it, and the like, whats more i count about 50 unique editors since may, this article should never be deleted OR protected and requests to unprotect will be forthcoming if it ever gets protected, especially if it is protected after the right wing christian orayzio gets his slash and burn edits.Keep--0000001 01:55, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comments</b> (a few of them). First, the article can be semi-protected if people agree that anonymous editors persistently try to sway the content in an overly sympathetic way. Second, no one owns the page so if you go away for a week then that's not any other editor's problem. Third, there's no need for the right-wing-christian-censorship-conspiracy-theory scare here. Let's just look at the bare facts (no pun intended): the article contains quotes like "<i>Tusion's 'Meatmembers Network' continues to grow in popularity exponentially and doesn't show any sign of slowing down.</i>", there's no mention of the serious accusations formulated by a number of pornstars against unscripted abuse, there's completely unverifiable research like "<i>However it can be said that through anecdotal evidence that it can be determined that he is in fact a white male in approximately his mid forties. Mr. Tusion is said to be a wealthy real estate speculator and family man, if this is indeed the case, then this could perhaps be posited as the catalyst for his anonymous orientation as an artist.</i>". Let's face it: the article as it stands is a prime example of what good Wikipedia articles should not be. And it's not the christian right's fault, it's what happens when the article is maintained by essentially one user, namely 0000001 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_0000001_17a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/0000001">contribs</a>), who is either a big fan or someone related to the site (all his Wikipedia edits are to meatholes related) and where anonymous IPs keep adding extra spam. 000001 you claim that there are 50 unique editors but you're counting the anonymous IPs! remove them and the people that obviously are only editing because they're on RC patrol and you'll be hard pressed to find more than a dozen significant contributions. As for it being the second Google result, let me assure you that if this article received the significant traffic you claim, then it would be the first hit.<a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 18:41, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep. Keep.</b> I agree with 00001 this is imperitive that this religious guy doesn't get his way. There is no way this is an advertisement, it doesn't even list the official site, and it is about a website! what a joke! It is just like an entry for a rock album or something which says what label it is distributed under, hence giving information as to where one could acquire the product, it is informative about the series creator, if you are gonna tear that up, why don't we separate it and make Khan Tusion his own article just like <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Hardcore_9bf0.html" title="Max Hardcore">Max Hardcore</a>? Bet you wouldn't like that, there has also been numerous articles written about this guy and his series, and it is a popular series...the religious agenda here is so clear.

<dd><b>Comment</b> In response to my critics, please remember the rule of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a>. Second, I am both an atheist and a liberal, I support pornography, and I abhor censorship; I nominated this article for deletion because it reads like an advertisement and because there is no evidence that Meatholes is as popular as the article states. In my view, it is not a notable subject for Wikipedia, but my view is just that, my view. Third, my edits have all been explained in edit summaries and are backed up by opinions states on the talk page. If anyone disagrees with any edit, they should discuss this disagreement on the talk page before they revert anyone's edits that were made in good faith. My edits have gone towards the goal of making the article better. I've removed questionable assertions that have no references (including a link to an IMDb biography that contains no content and I've tried to make the article read less like ad copy for the Meatholes network.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As to the statement that this article doesn't even include a link to the Official Site, it contained an affiliate tagged URL that redirected to the Meatholes tour page, which was obvious advertising. I've replaced this with a link to the offical site, not once, but twice now. The first time it was reverted back to the spammy link.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My opinion is that "Meatholes", as presented in the current version of this article, is still not notable and should not be in this encyclopedia. However, if the consensus is that the article can be improved to become notable, I wholly support that and my edits have gone towards that goal. -<a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOrayzio_bfec.html" title="User:Orayzio">Orayzio</a> 20:13, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for confirming that the previous right-wing conspiracy accusations are nonsense. However, I have a slight beef (still no pun intended) with that last comment: the debate should not be about whether the current article reads as advertisement. I think it undisputably needs to be severely rewritten and carefully watched in the future (that is, if it is kept at all). The current debate is whether or not this is a subject on which one <i>could</i> write a significant article that meets our criteria with respect to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">notability of web content</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutrality</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> - None of the articles listed above are principally about Meatholes. The New Partisan pieces (how notable is this online journal anyways?) are interviews with porn stars; in one case her work for Meatholes is discussed at length, in the other it was mentioned briefly. Another of the articles does not mention Meatholes at all, but the site is mentioned in the reader comments. The New Partisan editor was evidently planning an article on extreme porn, but I don't see any signs that the article got written. AVN online is an industry publication, the article is about a group of several sites including Meatholes. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 02:55, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>How does appearing on a few compilations and mostly self-released or short-run records meet notability standards? Previous unverifiable claims of using "homemade software" (see earlier versions of entry) that have been cleaned up also lead one to believe that the artist is using wikipedia as a means for shameless self-promotion to create the illusion of greater notability. There is but one external source or citation within the entire article, currently a dead link. No offense meant to the artist, but what is the baseline of this idea of notability?

<li><b>keep</b> The reason this deletion request exists is because of vandalism from teenagers on a message board, and has little to no merit. This artist has released a lot of significant albums, many of which are available through mainstream distributors (Best Buy, Amazon, etc) in America and Europe. A couple minutes research will show you that he has a significant following as well as attention from the media.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore he has toured around the world and composed music for many popular television shows, advertisements, and films. This page has been copied on other sites such as answers.com, about.com, and other information databases. That alone should tell you that this information has a place here on Wikipedia. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.167.26.171 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.167.26.171_3ee8.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.167.26.171">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>I just want to warn you that articles being copied onto other sites isn't evidence of notability, or lack of it being evidence of lack of notability. about/answers/etc copy the whole of the wikipedia database from time to time and host it on their own servers, which means any article that is on there was in the database at the time they copied it. It doesn't mean anything else. As for significant, <i>who</i> says they're significant, and have they put their opinions in a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>? That's the question I'm asking in the procedural nomination, and nobody wants to answer it for some reason (I can't because I'm not familiar with the breakcore genre). If you guys know that much about him, you can surely find sources (since you claim he's toured around the world, one of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>'s criteria). <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 01:32, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>keep</b> His tour information can be verified on many sources, for example: <a href="http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:1oMbMR8rhmYJ:metalfeed.com/+the+flashbulb+tour&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=5" class="external free" title="http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:1oMbMR8rhmYJ:metalfeed.com/+the+flashbulb+tour&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=5" rel="nofollow">http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:1oMbMR8rhmYJ:metalfeed.com/+the+flashbulb+tour&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=5</a></li>
</ul>
<p>lists the following information about this large American tour: "THE DILLINGER ESCAPE PLAN have also announced a full North American headlining tour, their first since late 2004. The tour begins November 6 in Ottawa at the Babylon Club and includes HELLA (through November 27), THE BRONX (November 28 onward), BETWEEN THE BURIED AND ME, HORSE THE BAND and THE FLASHBULB."</p>
<p>On the events page listed on his website, he has some past tourdates listed in the frame: <a href="http://www.theflashbulb.net/events.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.theflashbulb.net/events.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.theflashbulb.net/events.htm</a></p>
<p>Here is another article I found about him (and not just a review) from the Pittsburgh City Paper, a widely circulated and respected newspaper for the area.

<p>Although this is missing a lot of information, here is an IMDB page made for his film composing work: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1651685/" class="external free" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1651685/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1651685/</a></p>

<p>Furthermore, this artist has extensive releases listed and supplied everywhere from iTunes to Amazon to retail stores. It's clear to me that he most definately has a place here on Wikipedia.</p>

<li><b>1st Response from author:</b>I added more links. Why don't you call your local fire department and ask them for a defitition before you come to the conclusion that this does not exist. Thanks. thejax
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> The additional links are helpful. I'd still feel better if you had a reliable source (like a newspaper article) that specifically discussed or defined what a "whacker" is. That said, it's <b>your</b> job, as the article creator, to make sure that the article is backed by <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> sources. It's not other editors' responsibility to "call their local fire department" to verify an article. Finally, the article is no longer tagged for speedy deletion, so there's no need to repost the hangon tag. AFD discussions normally run for five days. If there are reputable news sources, that should be enough time to find them. <a href="../../../n/a/w/User%7ENawlinWiki_2ff5.html" title="User:NawlinWiki">NawlinWiki</a> 20:46, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>2nd Response from author:</b>Though I know it is my responsibility to show factual information, it does not give you the right to say its not factual just because you are ignorant on the subject of volunteer emergency services. If you don't know anything about this subject and refuse to contact anyone to see if its factual, then why would you tag the page for speedy deletion. That is like me tagging your John Anderson page because I have no idea who he is. I don't know anything about sports so i should just ASSUME what you say is false? No, I'm not going to do that. Why? Because unlike some people, not saying you, I do not refute information that I am not aware of. But hey, thats me. Don't you think I have a point. If I were you I would be like, "yeah, he has a point. I think I will also take the initiative to find out if this is correct because I jumped to conclusions without all the information". At least thats what i would do. ----thejax

<li><b>Delete</b>. Even if this is for real, it's still an obscure occupational slang term and without sources, there's no evidence it needs an article of its own. (On a side note, 99.9 of this article would have to be removed even if the article isn't deleted, because it's atrociously written and completely POV and OR from start to finish.) <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 23:47, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. I placed the original speedy-delete tag on the article (which was removed without comment by the author). I suppose that tagging this as nonsense was a stretch, but the POV nature of it, its obscurity, the in-joke feel it has, all led me to that conclusion. I then received a message from thejax on my talk page questioning my courage and calling me ignorant. Such comments certainly did not induce me to change my opinion. This simply does not read as an encyclopaedia article, as has been stated above, no matter what said author thinks. ---<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoldanarchist_24ab.html" title="User:Theoldanarchist">Charles</a> 19:38, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think it's pathetic that, while real facts like these get attacked, fiction such as 'Sunnydale, CA' (or even a local high school) get played up. There are thousands of high schools, yet you are attacking the 'oldest person in Indiana' and 'seventh-oldest in the world.' Speaking of the 100-year test: try again. This woman is 113 years old. Was she remembered in a 113 years? The answer is yes. Do you realize how long ago '1893' was? Why don't you take a look at the '1893' link and do some reading.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Let's not forget that Edna is also a moving target; her world ranking could further improve the longer she lives. But, I find it repulsive and anti-American when people continue attacking USA supercentenarian articles (i.e. Florence Homan of Ohio was the prior battle) when those for the Brits involve people years younger (i.e. mere 110 and 111-year-olds, such as <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florence_Reeves_72d2.html" title="Florence Reeves">Florence Reeves</a>). Currently the USA has the world's largest supercentenarian population (and overall, is to reach 300 million next week).

<dd>(edit conflict) Actually, all U.S. towns and census-designated places (however small) have articles, and high schools are generally deemed notable. There would be articles on both Shanksville and Columbine anyway. As for this building, I would have voted keep if it was listed in my AIA Guide (which includes 5000+ NYC buildings, including many in the immediate neighborhood of this apt building). I was looking to it as a source, but found nothing on this building to be able to expand the article.

<li><b>Keep</b> I added this article because I couldn't find one at all on wikipedia on Medziboz. All of Hasidus started with the Baal Shem Tov in Medziboz. I was looking to get in touch with the current Medziboz Rebbe and couldn't find it until I indirectly got to Zhvil, so I thought there should at least be some link and background on the Baal Shem Tov connecting this lineage. That information, and some of the rest which I added, is not found anywhere else in wikipedia. I do not think this should be deleted. --<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChosidFrumBirth_1288.html" title="User:ChosidFrumBirth">ChosidFrumBirth</a> 09:35, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> for now. Here is what I have written to Meshulam: You should avoid this kind of move (the hasty nomination to delete) because <i>it's a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/slippery_slope" class="extiw" title="wikt:slippery_slope">slippery slope</a></i> and could lead to the nomination for and deletion of similar articles about smaller Hasidic dynasties - by people who are not experts and don't care - with unintended consequences. Votes to delete are open to the world and you are inviting people who have no idea what this topic is about at all to cast a vote, which is very unfair and lacking insight. It seems that you may have been better off trying to add a {{<a href="../../../m/e/r/Template%7EMerge_to_78ed.html" title="Template:Merge to">merge to</a>}} template or considered MERGING the material at some point perhaps and WAITED (at least a month!) to do so.

Or you could have contacted other editors who deal with topics like this to solicit their views. This action of your is extreme and I do not condone it. I urge you to withdraw this nomination.

<dd>It looks like merging the articles has become the best option. I will explain my only objection: Mezibuz (or, as we have spelled it here Medzhibozh) is a city that is significant to every Chassidic sect. By making an article identifying Mezibuz with one specific dynasty, to the exception of othes, is a problem. This is similar to what would happen if I decided that I was the King of Camelot, and had one of my 2 followers write a wikipedia article amending the Camelot page that read "after that while Lancelot thing, Meshulam became King of Camelot." Ignoring the accuracy of the claim (that is, assuming that the Zhviller Rebbe of Boston is also the Mezibuz Rebbe, and that this claim is not fraught with error), the claim is misleading. Mezibuz has a rich history that has nothing to do with a specific dynasty <i>that was established in Boston.</i> I feel that linking the Medzhibozh article to the Zhvill article gives too much importance to a figure who is essentially a lightweight in the Jewish world. --<a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMeshulam_1f5a.html" title="User:Meshulam">Meshulam</a> 19:09, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep as is</b> . I don't agree with Meshulam one bit. It's not Rabbi Korff's fault that he is a direct descendant of the Baal Shem Tov and that his grandfather, great grandfather, etc., etc. inherited the Baal Shem Tov's home and shul, but that does make him different from the other offshoots. Meshulam says Mezibuz has a rich history that has nothing to do with a specific dynasty -- so does Boston, so do many other places, but that doesn't preclude a dynasty that began there.</li>
</ul>
<p>Neither is it relevant that other dynasties have roots in Mezbuz, simply because the Baal Shem Tov was from there. There is a distinct line and separate dynasty here. Ignoring Meshulam's sarcasm, which is inappropriate if we are really looking for the truth here, Rabbi Korff did not unilaterally decide to become King of Camelot. The fact is that, unlike all the other dynasties and rebbes Meshulam would merge, his grandfather was actually born in Mezbuz, in the Baal Shem Tov's house, to a father who was the Mezbuz Rebbe and who inherited that house and title from his father, and he from his father, and back to Reb Boruch, the Baal Shem Tov's grandson. That is recognized and acknowledged by ALL the other Rebbes that I know of, including the Boyaner, Zviller, Skverer, Chernobyler, Foltichaner, Skolyer, etc., etc. who joined the late Talner Rebbe in strongly encouraging Rabbi Korff to become Rebbe and fill his grandfather's place, who view him as a major figure not a "lightweight", and who are obviously in a much better position to know and judge than Meshulam is, and it makes the Mezbuz Hasidic dynasty distinct. Meshulam's comments are insulting and show a bias and personal opinion. I don't know what happened between him and the Rebbe, or what he has against him, but this is just not acceptable and not a credit to wikipedia. --<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChosidFrumBirth_1288.html" title="User:ChosidFrumBirth">ChosidFrumBirth</a> 20:25, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

Just so we compare apples to apples, the clothing retailer <a href="../../../d/e/s/Designer_Depot_1945.html" title="Designer Depot">Designer Depot</a> has less than 10 stores, the artlce cites absolutely no references or sources and I find no "cultural phenomenon" aspect to it.

On a Google search for "John Russell Florida," the Wikipedia page comes up at the top, even ahead of the candidate's own website, and it is entirely conceivable that the general public would come to this site for NPOV biographical information on this person.--<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisx_7e51.html" title="User:Francisx">Francisx</a> 20:22, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

I'm not asking for equal sized articles or equal time in an election article for less-competitive candidates. Nor am I suggesting that they will remain notable following an election. But I think failing to mention their existence is an expression of a POV. As for notability, I think Wikipedia is especially ill-suited for judging the political notability of candidates. In the United States, each state has a notability test of its own, namely ballot listing. Additionally, major parties have primaries or caucuses to determine notability. I will bring this up in Wiki C&amp;E, but I think ballot listing by a major party in a federal election constitutes de facto notability, even if the candidate is not otherwise notable.--<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisx_7e51.html" title="User:Francisx">Francisx</a> 20:49, 12 October 2006 (UTC)
