<li>Wikipedia is not a dictionary.

<li>I agree, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>. But if <i>glasnost</i> had not been incorporated into English, hardly any non-Russian-speaking English speakers would have heard of it, and they wouldn't need to look it up in an encyclopedia. I can't find any significant use of <i>vzryv</i> in English-language texts (based on Googling), which means that there isn't much need for English-speakers to look it up in an English-language encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 04:11, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Del</b>. There was no special Stalin teaching about this word. I, a staunch stalinist&#160;:-), am telling you. The expression "social explosion" in many european languages predates both stalin and lenin, although there is some interesting discussion about this in Talk:Vzryv between me and the author of "vzryv". (No, he is not Stalin&#160;:-) <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 21:40, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> see my reasons here Talk:Vzryv, it is a term used in English literature, just not yet on google. Whether or not Stalin put special meaning in his native language to the word is meaningless, as it came over to the English in several major books on the subject as describing his form of idea about Capitalist upheaval in particular, contrasting socialist progression. It doesn't even mean "revolution" it means any change toward or away from socialism which alters a society, which is unique to the mode of great change in Capitalism, so it is not a repetition or twin concept with 'revolution.' I am not interpretating it this way, this is what the book 'Dialectical Materialism' told me, which in itself sources many English works. Google is not an end all, there is a lot of well circulated literature which has zero representation through google.<a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagelfar_fb83.html" title="User:Nagelfar">Nagelfar</a> 05:53, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> unless more evidence turns up. To me, Nagelfar's citations look like typical translator bet-hedging, not proof that this word is used in English. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 06:00, 16 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The best I can do it cite English works &amp; books, there is nothing online, which to me, is the most valuable use for wikipedia; adding citations of uses unfindable elsewhere on the internet, among the sources I listed in English were; "<i>K. Mehnerts Stalin versus Marx: The Stalinist Historical Doctrine (London, 1952), The New Gospel of Stalinism, in Problems of Communism, Washington, Jan. 1953. Boris Souvarine Stalin. A Critical Survey of Bolshevism (London 1939).</i> Which use the word 'vyzryv' in an English context to describe Stalins 'Capitalist social interruption'" <a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagelfar_fb83.html" title="User:Nagelfar">Nagelfar</a> 17:56, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>That's what I was saying in the article talk page, but the guy simply does not hear, in best practices of communists. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 06:48, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Although I understand you're frustrated, Mikka, that comes across as a bit snarky.

<li>I think what is more frustrating is having works before you, many decades old, which cite something in a particular way, but because people only believe the internet anymore, its considered nonsense if it isn't there "first". <a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagelfar_fb83.html" title="User:Nagelfar">Nagelfar</a> 17:56, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>The arguments presented in the talk page have nothing to do with internet.

<ul>
<li>This has nothing to do with Stalins works, it has to do with English academic use of Stalins theories putting a key Russian word therein as an English loan word.

</ul>
</li>
<li>Also I agree it is of historical interest and quite educating to present a picture how Stalin's disciples tried to squeeze water from rock and show great theoretical contributions of Stalin into the communist theory. But this particular article is not only improper, it is even incorrect. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 18:06, 16 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This has nothing to do with "Stalins disciples", it has to do with Anglo-western academic use, most certainly NPOV if not anti-Communist, in a great many works from the '40s &amp; '50s, based on the Russian terminology. <a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagelfar_fb83.html" title="User:Nagelfar">Nagelfar</a> 19:00, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

</li>
<li>Sorry, Nagelfar. I went and looked again at your citations, and I can't see them other than as the very common trick in writing about translated works where you use the original word parenthetically to make it clear what you're referring to. Also, it would be swell if you could <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> regarding editors' familiarity with the merits of books. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 21:39, 17 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am very familiar with this use of parenthetically quoting foreign terms, and wouldn't have added it if I had believed it to be that this was the case. Besides however that in the instances provided being unnecessary for those ends (i. e. there is no need to clarify there), it wasn't just used "parenthetically" in that work or others, in the overall contexts of the works presented they used 'vzryv' especially, as that moment of change, qualified as meaning a philosophically based social instability in capitalist systems, but not elsewhere as a social revolution. I only took the initative to add it for it seemed rather entrenched in Anglo-American works on the subject in the late 40's &amp; early 50's, but maybe not thereafter. So that was my reasoning. I suppose that would make it a half-century old <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protologism.html" title="Protologism">paleologism</a>. <a href="../../../n/a/g/User%7ENagelfar_fb83.html" title="User:Nagelfar">Nagelfar</a> 23:28, 17 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In other words, a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a> that did not survive. If you are so sure about this, please write an article into a reputable journal, get it <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer_review.html" title="Peer review">peer reviewed</a>, then come back here. At the moment we have a problem of "<a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">wikipedia:Verifiability</a>" of your theory. Especially since your article speaks about "Russian", not "English" usage of the word. As I wrote, Stalin "discovered" exactly the opposite: "non-vzryv". And I can explain you why, although this is not the place, but for the sake of archiving; may be in future I will write the article. The "non-vzryv" was invented to resolve an apparent paradox of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">communism</a>. By marxist's religion of <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialectical_materialism.html" title="Dialectical materialism">dialectical materialism</a>, the driving force of progress, motion and development is internal contradictions in things. In application to society, this would mean contradiction betwen classes and contradiciton between "means of production" and "relations of production". Now, communism's greatest fit would be to eliminate both and to becume an ultimate, ideal form of society. But this would leave communism without drive to progress (and you know, Marx turned out to be right after all!:-). For this reason it was necessary to invent another, <b>non-catastrophic</b> philosophical driving force of change. That's what Stalin's invention was about. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 00:11, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
