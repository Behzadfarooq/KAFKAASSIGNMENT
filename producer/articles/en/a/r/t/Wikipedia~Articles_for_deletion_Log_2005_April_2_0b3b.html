<li>Cathal Coughlan is definitely a notable musician and artist (for instance, he has a show coming up as part of Cork's European Capital of Culture programme - called 'Flannery's Mounted Head', it is apparently a 'narrative song-cycle with spoken and visual extension'). The article does need to be expanded upon to reflect his importance. The website for the European Capital of Culture <a href="http://www.cork2005.ie" class="external text" title="http://www.cork2005.ie" rel="nofollow">Cork2005</a> describes him thus, "Cathal Coughlan is a key figure in Irish music, having been lead singer in the acclaimed Cork group Microdisney. He later formed the raucous and controversial Fatima Mansions. Coughlan has released three well-received albums of solo material. He has provided soundtrack music for feature films including Johnny Gogan's The Mapmaker and has taken singing roles in French composer François Ribac's contemporary operas Qui Est Fou?

Since that action does not destroy history, any reader/editor can <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_6b7b.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold">be bold</a> and carry out that decision. If it turns out to have been a controversial decision, it should be discussed on the respective article talk pages.

<li>Merging at this point would already be more than a controversial decision because based on the above votes, it would be contrary to expressed community consensus. Though the nominator could have taken that unilateral action initially without any kind of sanction, the result of this VfD discussion is that the subject will keep a separate article unless future discussion reverses that consensus. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 03:32, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>On a straight vote count, I get 3 clear "delete" to 2 clear "keep" votes. Tjc made a conditional vote about clean-up but it's a hard call to say whether that condition was adequately met. Smithfarm's subsequent comment also casts doubt on his/her final intent. I am going to have to call this one as <b>no concensus</b> which defaults to keep for now. If not expanded past the current sub-stub stage, it may be appropriate to merge this article into another larger article (though no one has yet suggested an appropriate target) or eventually renominated. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 05:49, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Couldn't one say the same thing about a lot of songs that are listed within Wikipedia? <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fish_Heads_5502.html" title="Fish Heads">Fish Heads</a> comes to mind... but I don't think we should go weeding out most of the listed songs because we don't feel that they are special enough. I think the question is more notability, which in this case would be determined more by how long they've been around and how large a subscriber base they have. I can't find info on subscriber base but I think the fact that the magazine has been around for over a year without signs of dying has to indicate that is has, at least <i>some</i>, notability. (None of this was meant as a personal attack and I hope you don't see it as such Radiant.

<li>I'm always open to friendly debate. I'm simply not convinced that this magazine is notable (considering that my local bookstore carries over a thousand magazines). There's also a recent tendency around here of creating new magazines that disappear (go bankrupt) after a couple of months. It may be useful to set up some guideline for magazines (and related publications such as newspapers) (which should probably cover 1) how long it has existed, and 2) circulation size). <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 11:01, Apr 5, 2005 (UTC)

<li>This appears to be one of thousands of magazines serving niche markets. There is no evidence presented that this magazine is at all significant even within their niche. Evidence to the contrary: They have only been around since Jan 2004. They have only published six issues so far. Their associated website scores 1,083,686 (substantially improved in the past few days, but I'm guessing that most of that improvement is based on investigations by participants of this very discussion thread).

The result of the debate was keep though the decision is split on whether to keep as is or keep as merge with a more comprehensive article. I would argue to merge this since the current content is a single line.

<dd>iNES is actually pretty well known in the emulation community. Although it isn't as popular now as it once was, iNES and Pasofami were the first usable NES emulators to be developed around 1995-96. Thus, this has some historical significance. A Google search for "+Nintendo +iNES" turns up over 28,000 (!) hits.

<li>Comment: Yes to both. Let's take the hits first. My review of the hits convinced me that the straight hit-count was a very poor measure for this particular product. 49k hits when most of them are duplicative and/or trivial do not establish significance on their own. I could be convinced by other evidence but the hit counts don't do it for me in this case. To <a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmithfarm_eede.html" title="User:Smithfarm">Smithfarm</a>'s question, yes I do think that new software has to have some measure of significance if we are to have an article with the potential to rise above the level of sub-stub and that will draw enough knowledgable reader/editors to successfully monitor the article against subtle vandalism. Minor software products, like all other minor products, increase the maintenance load on our population without adding sufficient value to the encyclopedia. Again, I'm willing to be convinced that this software package is non-minor but the evidence I've found so far doesn't do it. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 14:54, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>Comment: Hit counts in a Google _web_ search are easily inflated in many ways. Hit counts on a Google _groups_ search are somewhat harder to inflate artificially and people usually don't bother to do it, so they are a good cross-check. Generally, you'll get on the order of 1/5 to 1/10 as many hits in Groups as you do in Web. For example, a Groups search on exact phrase "star wars quake" yields <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=active&amp;num=100&amp;q=%22star+wars+quake%22&amp;safe=active&amp;qt_s=Search+Groups" class="external text" title="http://groups-beta.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=active&amp;num=100&amp;q=%22star+wars+quake%22&amp;safe=active&amp;qt_s=Search+Groups" rel="nofollow">44 hits</a>. In contrast, a Groups search on "mybulletinboard" yields <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/groups?as_q=mybulletinboard&amp;num=100&amp;scoring=r&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_ugroup=&amp;as_usubject=&amp;as_uauthors=&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb=q&amp;as_qdr=&amp;as_mind=1&amp;as_minm=1&amp;as_miny=1981&amp;as_maxd=7&amp;as_maxm=4&amp;as_maxy=2005&amp;safe=active" class="external text" title="http://groups-beta.google.com/groups?as_q=mybulletinboard&amp;num=100&amp;scoring=r&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_ugroup=&amp;as_usubject=&amp;as_uauthors=&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb=q&amp;as_qdr=&amp;as_mind=1&amp;as_minm=1&amp;as_miny=1981&amp;as_maxd=7&amp;as_maxm=4&amp;as_maxy=2005&amp;safe=active" rel="nofollow">no hits at all</a>.

The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>I count 22 clear "delete" votes to 22 "keep" votes (with about 5 of those explicitly "keep as merge/redirect"). A number of anonymous or very new users were discounted (with votes on both sides of the debate). Failing to reach a clear concensus to delete, the decision defaults to keep for now.</p>
<p>Reviewing the comments in detail, I find the main objection to be the level of detail. Many of the "keep" votes, all of the "merge" votes and quite a few of the "delete" votes expressed support for a merger of this article back into the parent. Since merge/redirect is a reversible decision, I am going to <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_6b7b.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold">be bold</a> and exercise my discretion as an ordinary editor to redirect this article to <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_fandom_6451.html" title="Harry Potter fandom">Harry Potter fandom</a> which already has what appears to be a very good overview of this topic. Any further discussion on the appropriateness of that redirect should be made on the respective article Talk pages. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 06:30, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Ah, the famous Wikipedia obsession with pop culture. This is all, of course, completely bloody irrelevent. The plot is what Rowling says it is, and all the wild speculation in the world is just that. As for splitting it off because the original article was too long - just because someone can wildly expound at great length on a topic does not mean that that topic is of any worth as an encyclopedia article - often it just means they should get to the point. The section in the Harry Potter fandom article is sufficient and to the point, and is all that is needed on this subject.

It wasn't just space; almost all contributions were focused on this section, which is how it got to be so long and out of proportion with the other section.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Can anyone confirm that this "shipping" thing is a phenomenon outside of a small set of forumgoers? Unless a large portion of the Harry Potter fanbase is familiar with this kind of stuff (I, for one, am not), I don't see why it should be kept. Also, consider a title change; referring to romantic relationship speculation in popular fiction as <i>shipping</i> is just bizarre.
<ul>
<li><b>response to comment</b>. Well, J.K. Rowling is familiar with it, has commented on it and has referred to it as "shipping". Clearly she didn't have to find a small, obscure set of forumgoers to run across the phenomenon.

<li>Tough one. If it were just about fanfic, I would have wanted it deleted post haste. But this is genuine analysis of a famous series. I don't think looking for deeper meanings to character development in a book is necessarily original research either, nor does 'not a crystal ball' apply since this doesn't speculate much about future books, but rather tries to find meaning in the existing ones. So I can't really find a solid argument for deleting it. And I found it interesting. So <b>keep</b>.

<li><b>Keep.</b> First, the shipping problem is very common among the readers of <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_5aec.html" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a>, which is growing in large amount everyday. As a very common series worldwide I believe that the interpreting of the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_5aec.html" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> series is going to have a worldwide, though might not be very significant, effect on a population, not only a few individuals. Secondly, to many of these readers, choosing their ship is not a random act but is also a belief they uphold, based on and strengthened by continuous changing of reasons, I believe that <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> should give an account of the development of these ideas over time, which may help us to understand our own minds. (e.g. moral values) The shipping problem is also a very entry point and an alternative way for us to understand characters in the book better. If the major characters of the Harry Potter series have an entry in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> too, I see no reason why this page, which discussed the relationships (if any) between these characters in such a detailed way, should be deleted. I must admit that I consider myself to be a heavy reader of the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_5aec.html" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> series, and I won't mind if you believe my reasonings are heavily biased, but please tell me what you think too! -- <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7EComputor_f451.html" title="User:Computor">Computor</a> 19:40, 6 Apr 2005 (GMT +0800)

The result of the debate was ambiguous. Failing to reach a clear concensus to delete, the decision defaults to keep for now. Reviewing the contents of the article and the comments and evidence presented, I am going to call this one as a strong recommendation to <b>merge</b> however. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 06:41, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The only Supershit 666 release was an eponymous 6-track E.P. on Inferno records released in 1999.

<li>I feel I must try and justify this article. The band, although having one release - are made up of some of the biggest musicians in Swedish rock music today, as well as Ginger from the Wildhearts (a UK band with a large following). The record has sold thousands of copies and because of the people involved in the project (and the fact that 3 other long-standing articles already mentioned the band) I would class this as a notable entry. Scandinavian rock 'n' roll is something that isn't covered much in Wikipedia, and this record is something which, arguably, is an important part of it. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnts_20ef.html" title="User:Ants">Ants</a> 20:25 2 Apr 2005 (GMT)

<li>I forgot to add that this record is still a current release being sold globally after nearly 6 years, and Google searches for those involved turn up a great number of results.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think that 30 people died make it much more notable than the average fire. (E.g. average fires don't get press coverage from AP). If this had happened in your home state rather than Belarus, it may seem more notable to you, so let's try to keep an objective head about this. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 10:36, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is notable as news, but not as encyclopedic entry. Every day TV reports something horrible happening around the world. This is life. And saying that death of two persons is less notable than death of 30 may sound very antihumane to many, especially those who work on <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_Schiavo_9996.html" title="Terry Schiavo">Terry Schiavo</a> article. We have an article about her, but not about thousands of other on coma. Why? Notability of the case, not the very fact of death. Belarussian deaths, sad as they were, teach nothing and lead to nothing. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 18:36, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>From an objective perspective, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Station_nightclub_fire_db5d.html" title="The Station nightclub fire">The Station nightclub fire</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belarus_mental_hospital_fire.html" title="Belarus mental hospital fire">Belarus mental hospital fire</a> have the same degree of notability. However as we have seen time and time again, VfD nominators and voters do not act objectively. They act on gut instincts about notability, and their gut instincts are far too often too provincial, which is why this is on vfd and the nightclub fire never has been. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 19:29, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>You have your point here. Provinciality speaks. But against your argument is the fact that neither Russian nor Belarussian wikipedias cover the event, despite being of local notability. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">Mikkalai</a> 21:50, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Separately, it is very unlikely that these deaths will teach nothing and lead to nothing. It is almost certain that safety and construction procedures will change as a result of this incident, just as they will because of the Chicago. The fact that <i>you think</i> the deaths will lead to nothing (because from your perspective, they will lead to nothing) is an example of the bias we should be trying to get rid of on VfD. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pcb21|</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">Pete</a> 19:29, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>The title and order have been changed but without quite a bit more to say, this is still a WikiNews story, not an encyclopedia article. It was in the news but only because of the fire.

<li>Comment: Is the topic (which is now the <i>hospital</i>, not the fire) significant enough that it will attract the critical mass of knowledgable reader/editors to keep the article safe from subtle vandalism?

What he actually says, though, is that there is one <i>single student</i> who doesn't like her. Or, at least, the latter is as fair a reading as the former.

<ul>
<li><i>point of order</i> Given the nature of antipopes, and the various and sundry reasons that lines of those are created, it is particularly important to understand that, even though there was a Pius V in the XVIe century, a particular line of antipopes may have seen the <i>sede vacante</i> as appearing before that particular Pius V, and therefore the name was still open for use.<a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVermin1302_8ec5.html" title="User:Vermin1302">Vermi</a> 08:10, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>You're right about the open use, if you want to trace the vacant thaaaat back. Usually recent antipopes set the <i>sede vacante</i> from 1958, but it could easily be traced back to, just as examples, the times of Avignon, or the schism between the Western and Eastern churches, or since the times of legendary female 'pope' Joan (I don't remember the english word for a female pope... but indeed there could be a femenist sedevacantist movement that could proclaim a current Joan II as the real one). Maybe your vacant dates are quite logical, since it would be some kind of Native American sedevacantism claim that sees all Roman popes since 1492 as invalid because Native Americans were not taken into account for the further elections. But maybe a US Saginaw line would be firstly seen by some as a freemason and not an Indigenous movement, thus putting the <i>sede vacante</i> in the 19th- and/or 20th centuries. All this, of course, given that you want to continue the joke, which was actually good since all above users demonstrated little skepticism about it, instead of realizing the joke sooner. Maybe you could keep the article as your personal User profile for Wikipedia, instead of an encyclopedial article. <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalegrett_a2ee.html" title="User:Dalegrett">Daniel</a></li>

<p><b>Delete.</b> Article was speedied, listed on VfU, re-created before VfU discussion was complete, marked for speedy, speedy tag deleted. Article is about Google's latest April Fool's prank, a fictitious soft drink. This topic has no potential to become encyclopedic. It was not even newsworthy. An online search of The New York Times shows 26 articles mentioning Google since March 1, 2005, including an April 2nd article mentioning its expansion of GMail's online storage to 2 gigabytes, but none mentioning the Google Gulp prank. <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;q=Google+Gulp&amp;btnG=Search+News" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;q=Google+Gulp&amp;btnG=Search+News" rel="nofollow">Google News search for Google Gulp</a> shows no coverage in the mainstream press.

It is basically a Google in-joke. It will be forgotten long before next April 1st. There's no way that this topic merits more than a brief mention in the article on <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a>, which has more than enough space for trivia of this kind. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 22:53, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Although not traditionally encyclopedic this article does deserves a place in Wikipedia, because everything known about everything should be included in Wikipedia, even about expressions of humor such as this one. Think of it this way: Wouldn't you like to know what kind of pranks were played 50 or 100 years ago? That's exactly why to keep it. I started this article so that 100 years from now in 2105 people will know what humor was like in 2005.

<li><b>Keep</b> First of all, sjorford, your argument that it was previously deleted has little relevance. It was recreated as a different article, which is not the same as undeletion. That is the reason it was not speedy-deleted again and that we are having this debate. Let's ignore the status quo and have a debate on the merits of the article. To me, it does have the possibility to become a much more detailed article, and I will work on it myself if I can. The Google News test is flawed, given that a search for <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terry_Schiavo_9996.html" title="Terry Schiavo">Schiavo</a> currently garners much more press than one for <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_John_Paul_II_390d.html" title="Pope John Paul II">Pope</a>, although the <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">Pope</a> was the one who was official leader of 1 billion Catholics, and most of Schiavo's supporters hadn't heard her name a year ago. Whether or not it has main-stream press is irrelevant to whether there can be an encyclopedia article about it. Sjford, if you believe someone would search for it, why would you vote redirect. I ask that you change your vote to keep. InShaneee, how does Google being notable show that this shouldn't be an article. Google's notability affects this hoax, especially given that it was on Google's front page, and <i><b>after</b></i> Google's IPO, which some feared would take away from Google's spirit. Just because this could be a yearly thing doesn't mean this can't be an article. We could link to each year's hoax. While saying <i><b>everything</b></i> should be in goes a bit far, this is significant enough for inclusion. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_paper_aa2d.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not paper">Wikipedia is not paper</a>, as they say. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperm401_861f.html" title="User:Superm401">Superm401</a> 23:29, Apr 2, 2005 (UTC)</li>

Google is a huge part of our culture... It basically is a main "gateway to the internet." I think the content should be kept.

<ul>
<li>I was discussing whether or not it was "blatant advertising" violating Wikipedia's "NON-COMMERCIAL" stance, per the user above me. It looks to me like the vast majority here think it's notable enough for at least a section of an upcoming Google Hoaxes article.<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarry491_9990.html" title="User:Harry491">Dave</a> <a href="../../../h/a/r/User_talk%7EHarry491_73d9.html" title="User talk:Harry491">(talk)</a> 06:52, Apr 5, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia already contains articles about commercial products. How does one define what is blatant advertising and what is not? If I write an article about an <a href="../../../e/-/c/E-commerce.html" title="E-commerce">e-commerce</a> payment server developed by a commercial, privately-owned company, is it automatically blatant advertising? <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"></a> — <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 08:57, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps you don't realize it, but Google is a for-profit company, and if you put up an entire article on this stupid "Google Gulp" promotional technique, why not have a separate article about each advertisement on television? Even though it might seem "cute" for some, the only reason for the existence of this page is to show the advertising savvy of the Google company, which is not a purpose of Wikipedia. 17:43, Apr 5, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well then, Apple Computers is a for-profit company too, yet Wikipedia has an article for the <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_1102.html" title="IPod">iPod</a>. Why is that not an advertisement and Google Gulp is? Is it because iPods exist and Google Gulp doesn't? If that's the criterion, then I would deduce that the payment server I mentioned above would be OK. All I'm asking for is a detailed explanation of which articles about commercial products by for-profit companies are advertising and which are not. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"></a> — <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 08:50, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

Sure, Infinity+1 may be "impossible" but they didn't say how soon it would come into place, and with their Gmail space counter rising like it does, it lends some potential to the idea of Infinity+1.

<li><b>Keep</b> Somebody above contested newsworthiness of the item by saying that there were only 20 odd references to Google in the New York Times. But the New York Times is not necessarily the authoritative source of what should be called news and what otherwise. Besides, using an alternate medium to dictate what an encyclopedia should contain is itself contentious and should never be the right guideline to follow. The Wikipedia's motto is to welcome all manners of entries and additions by anybody, not just whatever is "important" or "newsworthy". That would be self-defeating and contrary to its philosophy. If some do believe that the entry should be merged with other April Fool's pranks pulled by Google, that is acceptable and perhaps advisable given what is now an annual occurrence of jokes foisted by Google.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> This is not an "event", it is a marketing campaign for a commercial company.

<li><b>Comment</b> As the poster of the original entry, I would argue that it is not a copyvio because the quotes have all been accumulated from watching SNL, no matter who made the list....it is the intellectual property of SNL, not various bloggers.
