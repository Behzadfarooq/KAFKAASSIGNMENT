<dd>I think the adds + Conan + Grey's Anatomy easily do it. Since you're pressing me, a look at his website shows even more television appearances, he's doing a radio tour currently, and multiple media mentions (<i>Teen Vogue</i>, <i>Glamour</i>, <i>Perfoming Songwriter</i>). Easily meets the guideline, a guideline which states "Please note that the failure to meet any of these criteria does not mean an article must be deleted." --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:33, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Let me refute these:
<ol>
<li>No debate here. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Raconteurs_9161.html" title="The Raconteurs">The Raconteurs</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Waronker_3049.html" title="Anna Waronker">Anna Waronker</a>, and <a href="../../../b/e/_/Be_Your_Own_Pet_4279.html" title="Be Your Own Pet">Be Your Own Pet</a> only have one album out, too, but meet other criteria, much like Pigg does.</li>
<li>WP:MUSIC actually says "Has performed music for a work of media that is notable, e.g. a theme for a network television show." A theme is an example, not the only rationale. His music has been performed on shows, and he's done live performances on notable media. He certainly meets this criteria.</li>
<li>This is tough to say, although registering as a major add on Records and Radio make this an arguable one.</li>
<li>WP:MUSIC simply says national tour. A national publicity tour is still a national tour.</li>

<ul>
<li>Thank you for the rebuttal. I think we are now clear about the cause of our disagreements, and that's a great step forward. My <b>summary</b> then is that Pigg's song appears on two episodes of one TV show, and he has/will perform live on his national publicity tour. I strongly suspect that "national tour" was meant to mean "a tour that people would actually pay money to go see." I think we should all resist a big label's attempt to buy an encyclopedic article for one of its performers without him/her actually earning the privilege through talent and hard work. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 18:11, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps it did. He still meets other criteria, and whether it's "a big label's attempt to buy an encyclopedic article for one of its performers" is irrelevant, really. We base encyclopedicness on a series of subjective criteria, and he meets it, so I'm not sure where the protest comes from. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 18:15, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>The protest comes from the discussion of the points we've had above. If there are other criteria not already discussed, please note them. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 18:19, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a>, you chided me earlier for making "assumptions." You are making assumptions about this performer and his talent/hard work or lack thereof. I also think you're <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">disrupting Wikipedia to make a point</a>, though certainly not to a high degree (AfDs are infamous for these kind of discussions... I'm just not sure why you're so passionate in this particular case). At this point, both sides have been presented, and I think it's time for other editors to have a turn to make a decision for themselves, and perhaps we should suspend our contributions to this discussion and let the AfD ride out. No reason for the people who have already commented on here to harp on further about their opinions. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 18:20, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm looking at his article and it's bleak: one album, two tv episodes playing his song, and a publicity tour. The assumption is that this somehow makes him notable. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 19:28, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, of the points above, we have one agreement, one disagreement of the interpretation of the touring requirement, and one where you were incorrect and he meets. None of your points discuss the multiple media mentions that are clearly linked and displayed on his website, either, so we have two absolutely certain ones. I also haven't had any luck finding past tour information for him, but I have a feeling he's actually done a tour on his own, too. That's two definitely verifiable parts of WP:MUSIC he meets in any case, and, past that, I'll re-paste what WP:MUSIC says here: "Please note that the failure to meet any of these criteria does not mean an article must be deleted." Given everything we know about him, deletion seems misguided. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 18:24, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I grouped the multiple media mentions under the category of "publicity tour," and argue that <i>publicity tours are not notable</i> - they are a routine part of the entertainment business. The fact that you <i>think</i> he's had a previous tour is certainly <i>not</i> verifiable and not grounds for passing WP:MUSIC. Lastly, and for the sake of honesty, let's share the <i>whole</i> quote: "Please note that the failure to meet any of these criteria does not mean an article must be deleted; <i>likewise, the meeting of any of these criteria does not mean that an article must be kept.</i>" <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 18:55, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>"I also haven't had any luck finding past tour information for him, but I have a feeling he's actually done a tour on his own, too." Excuse me? That's "verification?" Our <i>feelings</i> are completely irrelevant. Either he has -- and you can verify that -- or he hasn't. Wishful thinking cannot come into play. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 19:11, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>OK, the arguments have been made. Maybe the four of us should let other editors comment now? This page is getting crowded! (P.S. MrFizyx, you should write an article about the Ashton Clone Conspiracy. It's obviously everywhere, we just need reliable sources to cite to prove it!).&#160;;) <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 19:14, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I knew I shouldn't have mentioned my suspicions of the tour (and I wasn't trying to pass it off as a rock-solid rationale, for the record). My point is simple - he has multiple media mentions (even outside of the tour) and has had his music performed on notable media (Conan, <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>).
