<li>There are <i>already</i> categories for almost every one of these occupations. It's not a question of replacing one with the other. It's that a category is the better organizational scheme.

<li><b>Keep</b> You think Categories are a better way to organize this information. I prefer lists. I see no reason why Wikipedia can't have both. In any case, I do not like mass proposals like this one, they make it hard to deal with a subject effectively. Especially when the first discussion in the series isn't even closed. Poor form, I would say. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 14:39, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>The reason not to have both is that Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information and IMHO these lists are exactly that. You may disagree, but given your antipathy toward mass nominations I'd be willing to bet that you didn't review the actual lists themselves before weighing in. And as for not waiting for "the first discussion" to close being "bad form," I said clearly in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_fictional_heroes_03b5.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of fictional heroes">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of fictional heroes</a> that I thought all the lists in the category needed to be examined. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 15:12, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>characters by type is a common way to organize information, and honestly, I can't see anything in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> that fits anyway. And in some of these cases, I'd say a list would be a better idea since not all of the names deserve an article. The content is another issue, and one that should be referred to with cleanup. And indeed, I won't say I've reviewed all of those items. You nominated over a dozens articles. If you want people to judge those lists on their own merits, then nominate them individually. I decline to participate in this discussion in any way except the nomination, which objects to the concept of it. I don't. If you want me to review them each, nominate them again later, on whatever other concept you believe is an issue.

<li><b>Neutral</b> I can see an advantage for a list over a category when a character is only covered by the work of fiction's article or "List of characters in XXX" lists instead of having their own article.

<li><b>Keep</b>, oh the irony of using indiscriminate AfD listings to try to eliminate list articles for being indiscriminate lists! To be honest, I don't find the nominator's listing of each list article on an individual AfD page any more illuminating... they've still pasted the same dubious "reason" for deletion in each one without considering the merits of each article, so we might as well discuss it here instead of pasting identical keep reasons as seems to be happening in the discussions. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 15:19, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> While I have some issues with this whole situation, it is important to note that the original nominator did not perform the individual nominations himself.

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, I split them up. And while I don't intend to justify what I did — but only because I feel rather miserably about making a mess of everything — let me explain. I came across one of the articles in the list and noticed that it had an AFD tag on it, but a redlink to the <i>Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/&lt;ArticleName&gt;</i> sub-page. (In retrospect, they had not been linked here with {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd1_cc96.html" title="Template:Afd1">subst:afd1</a>}}.) I looked in the history to see when it was tagged; it had been awhile. Then I went to the nominator's contribution history to see if there might be other odd things happening, where I noticed that there were <i>many</i> lists that had red-linked afd tags. (Again in retrospect, it was every list except <i>List of fictional actors</i>.) Unfortunately, I didn't look at them all, and I did not do enough investigation. Thus I did not come to this sub-page and see that they were all meant to point here. At any rate, before I found that out, I had already created subpages for (I think) every page that had been tagged. So it was I who created an indiscriminate number of AFD nominations, thinking that I was creating the subpages and thus completing them, when in reality they were already completed at this subpage — <a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamunknown_d3ca.html" title="User:Iamunknown">Iamunknown</a> 17:38, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
