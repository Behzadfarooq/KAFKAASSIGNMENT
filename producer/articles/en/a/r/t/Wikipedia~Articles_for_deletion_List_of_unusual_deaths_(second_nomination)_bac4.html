<p>This is the second nomination, but virtually all keep opinions in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_unusual_deaths_0797.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of unusual deaths">original nomination</a> were backed by simple "<a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">I like it</a>" arguments. No matter how "interesting" this list is, it is theoretically <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a> (not the fact that these people died, but that their deaths ought to be considered "unusual" and therefore worthy of inclusion).

<ul>
<li>Fortunately, I never said anything about the difficulty of its maintenance. Please consider <i>my</i> argument, which is that the list is <b>theoretically</b> unverifiable. This is a direct appeal to Wikipedia policy (unlike yet another "I like it" argument). <b><a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoes_d467.html" title="User:Simoes"><font color="#006400">Simões</font></a></b> (<font size="1"><sup><a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimoes_e6ed.html" title="User talk:Simoes">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simoes_0c82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simoes">contribs</a></sub></font>) 02:07, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Mortality statistics are available and from those I think you can determine whether a death is unusual. Granted the most unusual deaths are likely caused by rare diseases like <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progeria.html" title="Progeria">progeria</a>, but still I think it's doable.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 06:18, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So what mortality rate is to be set for a particular circumstance of death? Is it 5% of all deaths (millions to add to the list)? 1% (still millions)? .01% (we might be getting to hundreds of thousands at this point...for each circumstance)? Even if there are such accessible figures, there is no way to set a non-arbitrary standard based on them.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, statistics exist on <i>cause of death</i>, not "circumstances concurrent with or immediately preceding the death." For example, <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_John_XXI_6035.html" title="Pope John XXI">Pope John XXI</a>'s cause of death is getting crushed by debris (or maybe it was just asphyxiation). He shares this fate with millions. What is "unusual," I'm assuming, is that he's a pope and it happened in scientific laboratory. Ergo, he's on the list. But such conjunctions of circumstances can make anyone's death unusual: so and so's great grandfather was the only white, male, left-handed American citizen who died in the state of Texas on a Thursday afternoon by drowning in a body of water containing more than 38<a href="../../../p/p/b/Ppb.html" title="Ppb">ppb</a> of <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benzene.html" title="Benzene">benzene</a>. Grandpa now has instant parity with the Pope.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, if one might then say that only notable people should be included on the list, then this doesn't help much. Like with the pope and non-notable grandfather examples, it merely takes sufficiently bold research to include every dead, notable person by virtue of conjuncting enough circumstances roughly concurrent with his or her death to make it also unique. <b><a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoes_d467.html" title="User:Simoes"><font color="#006400">Simões</font></a></b> (<font size="1"><sup><a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimoes_e6ed.html" title="User talk:Simoes">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simoes_0c82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simoes">contribs</a></sub></font>) 06:59, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree there's no way to set some objective standard where an algorithm decides what goes on this list; it will have subjectivity and concerns about POV.

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Unmaintainable; I feel the threshhold for an article like this is that it should be exhaustible and that it shouldn't be too long. This seems to fail that. Furthermore, its inherently POV and likely has OR problems as well. What is 'unusual' to one person may not seem so to another. One may try to counter this by defining unusual as being "not many people have died this way" but surely there are countless numbers of ways in which only one or two people in all of history have died. There is no real way to have concrete criteria that avoid POV and OR issues. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 07:09, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom and The Way. Amusing and/or tragic as many of these deaths are, it's unencyclopedic to link them in such a way. A large number of these deaths only become "unusual" because they happen to have befallen a prominent person or because they occurred in an unexpected manner (there's an American President listed who died of indigestion, which was probably a common enough way to die at the time, but presumably his death is "unusual" because <i>he</i> died of it or because it's not something that <i>we</i> tend to die from or whatever), which opens up more cans of worms than can be gainfully dealt with. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 07:45, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Change name to List of notable deaths</b>. Agree with nominator that "unusual" implies this is inherently POV. However, this information is encyclopedic and should be kept. "Notable" leaves less room for POV as there are wikipedia policies defining what notable means, including requiring things like third party sources, which all entries on this list should have. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 10:09, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure that that really helps either. People are notable - and many of the people in this list are patently so - but their deaths are not necessarily. As I read it, "notable deaths" would only cover the small sub-group of people on this list who are not notable for any reason but the fact that they died in a possibly unusual manner (the pizza deliveryman with the timebomb and so on). The majority of this list is more along the lines of "List of the manners of death of notable people", since the actual fact that Pope John XXI was crushed to death (for example) only becomes notable when it was <i>Pope John XXI</i> being crushed to death and not anyone else. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 10:16, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It's verifiable, interesting information. Isn't judging 'notability' also a POV judgment? <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFys_bced.html" title="User:Fys">Fys</a>. <a href="../../../f/y/s/User%7EFys_bced.html" title="User:Fys">Ta</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fys_a016.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fys">fys</a> <a href="../../../f/y/s/User_talk%7EFys_d202.html" title="User talk:Fys">aym</a>. 10:42, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>My main objection to <i>keep</i>ing this, is the uncertaintly of the <i>unusual</i> criterion. Would innovative suicides and murders qualify&#160;?

<dd>If they are rare enough forms of murder or suicide I'd say yes. Well unless they are just slightly different variants on a common form. (Like say using a hard to find sleeping pill to commit suicide or being shot with a gun that had <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hello_Kitty_61f0.html" title="Hello Kitty">Hello Kitty</a> stickers on it) And there are things on here that truly are rare "freak" forms of death.

<dd>None of them are. Or all of them are, depending on how conjunction-happy you want to get. Ray Chapman died of a crushed skull. Millions and millions have died of this. But wait, he died of a crushed skull–crushed by a baseball! We've narrowed it down to (say) hundreds, and he's, perhaps, the only notable person to die of a crushed skull, crushed by a baseball (though I'm going to go ahead and doubt this, too). <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augusto_Pinochet_2e33.html" title="Augusto Pinochet">Augusto Pinochet</a>'s official cause of death is listed as both congestive heart failure <i>and</i> pulmonary edema. Either one of these will probably include dozens of notable people. But <i>both together</i> narrows it down to, as far as I know, just him. He's not on the list now, though, so what an exclusion this is! Again, there is absolutely no possible way to prevent everyone from getting on this list. It is flawed by design.<b><a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoes_d467.html" title="User:Simoes"><font color="#006400">Simões</font></a></b> (<font size="1"><sup><a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimoes_e6ed.html" title="User talk:Simoes">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simoes_0c82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simoes">contribs</a></sub></font>) 16:52, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><s>You're either being stubborn, snarky, or literal to the point of absurdity. You really think all skull wounds are the same, none more unusual than the other? Are you making that evaluation as a doctor? Still if I buy the premise how weird is that?

<dd>Baseball related deaths are generally children. From 1973 to 1995 88 such deaths were reported.<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:FLMI8JG6nd8J:www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/pubs/cpsr_nws01.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=2" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:FLMI8JG6nd8J:www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/pubs/cpsr_nws01.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=2" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Although tragic this is still less than 4 per year and I've never seen any evidence that it's more common in adults. Children's bodies are often more fragile, but even then 38 of the deaths were apparently from being hit in the chest. This was the single greatest baseball-related fatality cause. Therefore baseball related death is unusual.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 17:19, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I'd like to warn you against making further <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> in this or any other discussion. Now, I noted that this Chapman fellow died of a crushed skull, that it was crushed by a baseball, and that those who share this circumstance are few. Please read the rest of what I wrote. Also, I take it that you're unable to provide even an arbitrary standard for inclusion, given that your current method is to proffer an example and then insult those who question it. <b><a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoes_d467.html" title="User:Simoes"><font color="#006400">Simões</font></a></b> (<font size="1"><sup><a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimoes_e6ed.html" title="User talk:Simoes">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simoes_0c82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simoes">contribs</a></sub></font>) 17:26, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was a bit confused by your response, but I tried not to attack you as a person.

<dd>Now as to the issue itself I don't feel I was being arbitrary. The lowest accidental death rate I find is the Bahamas with 17.9 per 100,000 people. Using the "1 per 2000" notion in <a href="../../../r/a/r/Rare_disease.html" title="Rare disease">rare disease</a> an accident that kills less than 17.9 per 200,000,000 per annum I think could be rare.

<dd>Yet again, these are <i>examples</i> of allegedly unusual deaths, not a method to determine whether one is. Not one person voting keep and no one editing the article has been able to provide a method. No one has even given an <i>arbitrary</i> standard, which would at least be a start. The reason for this is simple: there's no possible way. When people use the term, what they really mean is that they find a death and the circumstances surrounding it <i>interesting</i>. So, technically, the article title should be "List of interesting deaths." But this should make it even clearer how badly the list violates <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. <b><a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoes_d467.html" title="User:Simoes"><font color="#006400">Simões</font></a></b> (<font size="1"><sup><a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimoes_e6ed.html" title="User talk:Simoes">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simoes_0c82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simoes">contribs</a></sub></font>) 19:56, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It doesn't need to be "alleged." Some forms of death truly are rare and this can be statistically determined. I think doing so is more work then anyone on the list is willing to do, but it's not in itself impossible. For example we have an article called <a href="../../../r/a/r/Rare_disease.html" title="Rare disease">Rare disease</a>. The term is not POV, it is an actual medical term. I think by the same standard a "rare accident" could be one that effects less than 1 in 2000 accident victims. Perhaps this would be better as List of people who died of rare diseases and rare accidents, still I don't understand your insistence here. That said I apologize again for being overheated yesterday.

<dd>Why is a death caused by medical malpractice (to take one example) even "unusual" or "interesting"? The sad truth of the matter is that there are more deaths caused this way than I think anyone would want to contemplate. Indeed, not too far north of where I live, there's a particular doctor who's accused of causing a phenomenal number of deaths in this manner. The only "unusual" or "interesting" aspect of a President dying that way is that (much like our crushed Pope), it was a <i>President</i> who died that way and not some average Joe. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:03, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's why I stated the <i>uniqueness</i> of the occurrence. <b>Unique</b> means <i>one of a kind</i>. There was only <i>one</i> President who died as a result of medical malpractice, only <b>one</b> major league baseball player who died of a beaning in a major league game, only <b>one</b> known instance of a person being executed by having molten gold poured down his throat, only <b>one</b> person in recorded history to having been adjudged in a coroner's inquest has having laughed himself to death. The actual definition of <i><b>uniqueness</b></i> is strictly NPOV: there is only one instance of it occurring under those circumstances. Most on the current list would not fit that criterion and would have to be weeded out, but at least there is an objective criterion with a standard definition. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 23:37, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Keep</b> - Explain how unusual is strictly POV. It can be used objectively, since unusual states these deaths do not normally occur. The list is maintainable, since unusual deaths, by nature of being unusual are not happening in such a large number (especially in terms of actually being notable) that it is impossible to keep up. Now to answer some concerns that anyone's death can be made unusual - that is just absurd. The circumstances you listed, drowning in a lake (we're assuming your great grandfather wasn't doing anything incredibly strange) is not unusual. Even with the modifiers you presented, it doesn't become unusual. The modifiers don't change the fact he died in a usual manner. Just because there isn't a strict set of standards doesn't make it POV, it just means any strict set of standards would fail the article. For instance, look at the listing for David Bailey. Is that not unusual. Could you, under any circumstances, claim that dying by having a rat urinating on someone not be unusual. Not hypothetically. In reality, can you claim that, and if you were, could you explain how that is usual. Many of these deaths are notable enough to be passed down through history or be reported by news, so clearly, the list has a lot of merit. --THollan 23:06, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>In which case, the question becomes at which point we say that a given death is "unusual". In Bailey's case, I'm no medical specialist, but we'd need to see just how common an infection of leptospirosis is (let alone one which turns fatal). The article on that condition implies that vets have been known to get it, but actually digging up some statistics would be the key. Is an unusual cause of death something which only 5 people have been the victim of, or is the number more like 100 or more? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 23:24, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, the specific cause of death may not be unusual, but the circumstances (i.e., the rat urinating on him being what caused his death), would be what makes it unusual. To me, the biggest problem with trying to come up with a set standard for what is a usual death and what is an unusual death is that it would be automatically fail the purposes of what it is trying to validate. It also ignores the fact that it is either the cause of death, or the circumstances leading to death that make it unusual. You can't say that many people are dying from nose bleeds. If that was the case, we'd be dropping like flies. --THollan 07:09, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>comment</b> In some cases, there are standard brief reference sources, and one with an appropriately concise coverage can be chosen, &amp; an article can be limited to the ones in there--or to some selection thereof, or to at least all the ones in there plus what one can justify. To use such a list as a limiting source is almost certainly fair use, just the information is being used --to reproduce the list unchanged is almost certainly not. There may be lists of things according to ratings: It may be necessary to stop an an arbitrary number. This also applied to the general use of list of notable Xs.

<dd>I don't really understand how it is original research and not just making an editorial decision. From what I gather, original research is me publishing my own findings on Wikipedia, so let's just say - percentage of people who die when they suffer a nosebleed. Edit - Also, just because there is some subjectivity to the matter doesn't mean it is not suitable for Wikipedia. For instance, a debate on notability, you have are making a subjective opinion at the end of the day. The point is, the list isn't subjective. Unusual isn't the same as strange. We could safely say it would be unusual for my speakers to burst into flames while playing music at a low level. --THollan 02:14, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>depends on what you're doing for criteria for inclusion. if you use the statistical method suggested, to prevent original research, someone's going to have to find a source listing unusual death percentages. If they have to find many sources and combine them into one article, that's seems like original research to me.
<dl>
<dd>Then virtually all articles are OR as they may require "finding many sources and combining them in an article." Still possibly a different compromise could be done. In the media <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;tab=wn&amp;q=%22unusual+death%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search+News" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;tab=wn&amp;q=%22unusual+death%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search+News" rel="nofollow">"unusual death"</a> is a reported term. So I suppose we could say "List of deaths deemed unusual by the media" as our opinion of what's unusual would not be taken into account.
