sex and the city syndrome these days is when a girl starts acting like she's one of the characters on sex and the city. they start being all prissy and start sitting on patios all day talking about dick size and irrelevant things that dont matter to relationships. they relate to one character so much because she had a similar relationship problem in the past so now they think theyre the real life version of one particular character from the show. they trying to emulate the character and end up making an ass of themself when they realize theres 20 other girls doing the exact same thing.</p>

<p>One of the truly underrated talents in big-wave surfing, Wormhoudt works as a skateboard-park designer in Santa Cruz, zipping up to Mavericks whenever the surf gets big. He had a solid eighth-place finish in the inaugural contest, including one ride that saw him pull into an inside-section barrel, and came right back to finish fifth in 2000. Last year, as consistent as ever, he finished fourth.</p>

QUBE played a pivotal role in the history of American cable television. Launched in Columbus, Ohio in December, 1977, QUBE introduced viewers, and the international press, to several concepts that became central to the future development of cable television: pay-per-view programs, special-interest cable television networks, and interactive services.</p>
<p>The story begins in a hotel room in Japan, where Warner Communications chairman Steve Ross is watching television. The Otani Hotel offered some advanced features in its closed-circuit television system, which set Ross to wondering what might be done to improve the performance of his tiny cable television division. Ross was intrigued by the potential of delivering Warner Brothers movies directly to home subscribers.</p>
<p>At the time, Warner Cable was a tiny division of Warner Communications, run by a former Western Union telecommunications executive and attorney, Gus Hauser. Ross surrounded Hauser with entertainment industry executives-- Jac Holzman, who had sold his Elektra Records to Ross in 1967; Mike Dann, the CBS programming wizard responsible for The Beverly Hillbillies and Green Acres; former CBS general counsel Spencer Harrison, who was the primary reason why My Fair Lady got produced on Broadway; super-agent Ted Ashley, whose talent agency was Ross’s first show-biz acquisition.</p>
<p>At the same time-- and probably for the very first time since the invention of television-- entertainment and technology dated and ultimately married. Pioneer Electronics was hired to “build the box” that would transform the dull cable TV service in a few hundred thousand households into a device that would change the entire entertainment landscape. And a group of young, ambitious producers were hired-- myself among them-- to invent the future of television.</p>
<p>The story unfolded in directions that nobody anticipated. The service was first launched in Columbus, Ohio amidst considerable national and international press coverage-- here, amongst a reworked version of The Original Amateur Hour (whose hook was jerked by the interactive audience), Wonderama (starring a local TV clown), and The Today Show (complete with a big window-- but in Columbus, without any actual human beings outside the studio), was television’s bold future. In 50,000 homes scattered around the city and its suburbs, QUBE viewers could choose from an astonishing number of channels (thirty!), including ten pay-per-view movie channels (including one adult channel), and ten originals, including the first weather channel, a children’s channel that become Nickelodeon, and endless innovations, including infomercials (both infomercials and pay-per-view were begun at QUBE, as was MTV).</p>
<p>At first, every QUBE console was equipped with five interactive buttons which were used to play games, shop at home, and answer questions like “Who should be the next mayor of Columbus?” Home viewers considered the on-screen choices, and then selected their favorite by pressing-- or touching-- a button on the console. Six seconds later, 50,000 homes were polled by what was then state-of-the-art technology, and the results were posted on the screen for all to see, live.</p>
<p>The system proved so popular that Warner Cable began to win valuable cable franchises-- the right to build and operate cable monopolies-- in large markets throughout the country. The dirty business of local municipal politics set new boundaries for the definition of extortion. Among the more publicized stories: a demand that the winner of the franchise build not only a new public library for the city, but plant 20,000 new trees as well. Warner Cable’s QUBE was changing the entire industry-- and causing substantive changes in the legislative environment, mainly through the efforts of a former Washington insider who was now Warner Cable’s chairman, Gus Hauser.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, building new cable systems is a costly endeavor. At the time, Warner Communications was an $850 million concern, and by 1982, Warner Cable was running a $99 million loss (by 1983, the total debt was $875 million). Steve Ross wanted none of this on his balance sheet. Enter American Express, a cash-rich organization enlisted both for its cash and for its impeccable credibility-- an essential front for what was, in fact, a rather dirty business of local politics. Warner-Amex Cable Communications was formed with a stellar board of directors, including American Express chairman Jim Robinson and President Lou Gerstener, and the former head of Shearson, Sanford Weill. It wasn’t long before the very public fighting began. Weill, attempting to oust Robinson, manipulated the long payout involved in cable system development into piercing attacks on Robinson’s propensity toward lousy investments. As a result, Warner and Amex began to view the world quite differently. The fight comes to a dramatic climax when the franchise for NYC’s boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens comes up for bid. A dramatic story of power and local politics, the incident is the beginning of the end. American Express makes an offer to buy Warner’s position. To their surprise, Warner counters their lowball bid with an offer they cannot refuse. Unfortunately, Warner can no longer afford to play what is becoming an increasingly costly game-- in part because of their other investment in the future, a once-promising videogame company called Atari, which is now tanking and taking Warner’s stock price on a dangerous downhill ride.</p>
<p>By this time, MTV and Nickelodeon were becoming meaningful endeavors in their own right, with powerful leaders in Bob Pittman and Geraldine Layborne. And QUBE was either up and running or already built in Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Milwaukee, Dallas and elsewhere. Warner Cable was no longer a fledgling 200,000 subscriber operation; now, there were 2 million subs, roughly 1/10 of the entire subscriber universe. Pittman led an unsuccessful effort to buy MTV; there was also an unsuccessful attempt at a public offering. Gus Hauser was gone, replaced by Reagan’s future Transportation Secretary, Drew Lewis. It was the hard-boiled Lewis who had the nerve, and the conviction, to return to the municipalities who had so abused their franchise process and say “no, we are not building your library, your school system, your water supply system, or dozen city parks.” Slowly, he renegotiated the greedy franchise deals.</p>
<p>It wasn’t enough. Warner had to sell something. And this is the turning point. There were two choices: sell the either cable networks, or the cable systems themselves. It’s 1985/1986. Is there more value in owning a chunk of the future of TV distribution, or is the real value in the future of a children’s network and a music network for teenagers?</p>
<p>In today’s world, AOL Time Warner is struggling and will likely be taken apart. Viacom, which bought the cable networks, is thriving. MTV reaches over 375 households in 166 countries; it is not only the world’s most widely distributed television signal, it is one of the world’s best-known consumer brands. In fact, Nickelodeon reaches even more households, 471 million in all, and it’s still growing.</p>
<p>Did QUBE matter? Why should anybody care? First, it was a business without a plan. Contrary to almost every business book on the market, there was no real plan. There was an annual budget, and if things went well, the next year’s budget was larger (Nickelodeon started on $1 million in year one). Smart, ambitious people saw what could be done, and Warner Communications was, at the time, the kind of large corporation that nurtured new businesses. Second, QUBE changed the rules. At the start of the story, Congress had little interest in helping cable TV clobber the broadcasters; by the end, it’s cable TV that dominates. At the start, a cable system rarely filled a dozen channels; as a result of QUBE, few US cable systems now offer few than a hundred. Third, corporations had no control over television-- only ABC, CBS, and NBC had any meaningful participation in the business, apart from regional owners of station licenses. Today, the media business is all about ownership of content and distribution-- a model pioneered by Steve Ross and his executive posse way back at a time when Ted Turner was still contemplating his father’s outdoor advertising billboards. Most of all, though, it’s the fact that Madonna and SpongeBob are now stars-- that Rugrats is the most-watched children’s program in history-- that Nickelodeon now outdistances Disney as the world’s most profitable children’s license-- that demonstrates a key concept that has been completely obscured by today’s MBA and financially structured world-- if you hire a bunch of really talented people, and you provide them with some direction, they can make you a fortune…</p>

<p>Lewis "Lewy Lew" A-K was born and bread in Victoria, Australia, and attended the prestigious Wesley College from the early age of 2. By age 3 he was already punching on with his fellow classmates, and in a particular incident, which has since become known as the farcical David vs Goliath match, Lewy Lew dropped Mr David Thorpe with a single blow to the forehead – his first kill. A bright future for Lewy Lew was apparent, and headmaster at the time, Mr David Loader, encouraged Lewy Lew’s violent behaviour to the point where he broke a classmates fathers jaw. Maximillion’s father, whilst drunk at the Park Royal Hotel in North Melbourne, accidentally ripped Lewy Lew’s shirt, and immediately felt the wrath of the soon to be Heavy weight champion.</p>
<p>A legendary figure was born here soon after.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-09-05_1039.html" title="Edit section: Daniel Day Luas Pub Crawl">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Daniel Day Luas Pub Crawl</span></h2>
<p>The "Daniel Day Luas" pub-crawl is a recently established pub crawl which grows in popularity yearly. As can be determined from the name the organisers take a light-hearted approach to affairs (the name derives from the slang name for the new LUAS tram in Dublin - a nickname uniquely Irish in its irreverance). For further such nicknames, see <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dublin_statues_and_their_nicknames.html" title="Dublin statues and their nicknames">Dublin statues and their nicknames</a>. The DDL is a peculiar mix between the usually revelry and good times that can be found on most pub crawls and a Kafka-esque structure of rules and forfeits. This has resulted in generating a cult-following for the DDL - it even has its own MySpace site set up by followers:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://groups.myspace.com/DanielDayLuas/" class="external text" title="http://groups.myspace.com/DanielDayLuas/" rel="nofollow">Daniel Day Luas MySpace Group</a></li>
</ul>
<p>At its core the DDL two main conditions - firstly, that it takes place on the Luas (or rather in pubs frequented at various stops along the Luas line) and that everyone participating on it must refer to everyone else participating on it as “Daniel”. This last condition gives the pub crawl its rather informal and good-natured feel.</p>
<p>The remaining rules are divided into the mandatory, "rules" and more the relaxed, "traditions".</p>

<ul>
<li>The DDL will take place each year on the 27th of December (subject to the LUAS running).</li>
<li>The Dundrum House pub in Dundrum will be the meeting point for participants and is considered the first pub on the crawl.</li>
<li>In the Dundrum House the route is decided and the roles of the "Pace-Setter" and the "Jar-Carrier" are decided (see roles).</li>
<li>As people arrive, it is at the moment they take their first sip of their drink that they have officially joined and started the DDL.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>While on the DDL you must call everyone Daniel. Any mistakes made result in a token forfeit. This is currently 20 cent (EURO). The pub-crawl is non-profit and the proceeds from the forfeits are raffled amongst the participants at the end. The vessel for holding the forfeit money is called the "Daniel Jar" and is carried by the "Jar-Carrier".</li>
<li>Under no circumstances are you allowed to ever get off at Windy Arbour. The forfeit for breaking this rule is that you must double the value of the "Daniel Jar" at the end of the pub-crawl. Windy Arbour, for arcane reaons is considered unlucky by the DDL.</li>
<li>The “pace-setter” will give a ten-minute warning of drinking-up time before we leave a pub. The forfeit for not being ready in time is to pay 50 cent into the Daniel jar.</li>
<li>If a LUAS is seen and participants miss it, they all must get a shot in the nearest pub.</li>
<li>It ends when the first drink in the last pub has been drunk. At this stage, all participants present write their names on their LUAS ticket. A raffle is held by choosing one of these tickets. The winner receives the contents of the Daniel Jar and is encouraged by everyone else to buy a celebratory round. At this point you can call those around you whatever you wish.</li>

The most common use of this medicine is to treat urinary tract infections. The DS in "Bactrim DS" stands for Double Strength. Therefore, one Bactrim DS tablet is equivilent to two Bactrim tablets. Sulfamethoxazole belongs to the sulfonamide, or sulfa class of drugs, and should not be taken by persons who are allergic to sulfa drugs. Bactrim DS is available in the U.S. and Canada by prescription only. Other common brand names marketed in the U.S. are Septra DS and Cotrim DS.</p>

<p>Michael Payne is the host and interior designer of Home and Garden Television's show <b>Designing For The Sexes.</b> The show was aired from 1998 to 2003, and featured Michael navigating design conflicts between couples with conflicting tastes. Known for his vibrant British charm and his keen sense of design, Michael delighted fans by humorously exposing the gender-based quirks of the show's guests. Each show ended with a joyous reveal of the final room, which contained elements satisfying to both parties.</p>
<p>Payne is the author of "Let's Ask Michael," published in 2003. It was designed by his son, Juston Payne, and published by McGraw-Hill. According to Juston's website, a second book ("Michael's Method") is currently in the works, though specifics on release date are absent.</p>
<p>Michael designed a series of furniture lines, which have been manufactured and distributed by Powell. They are currently for sale through independent distributers.</p>
<p>Michael is frequently the featured speaker at home shows and expos. In 2006, he began a relationship with Wickes Furniture, promoting pieces of their collection he deemed "must haves."</p>

<p>Kathryn White (b. 1956) is an Children's Author working in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Kathryn specialises in Picture Books for 3 to 8 year olds and has more than a dozen titles to her name. She is also a frequent visitor to schools and libraries where she entertains young children with an eclectic mix of story-telling and fun to join-in activities.</p>

<p><br />
Background</p>
<p>Kathryn White was born in Bradford-on-Avon, England in 1956, and now lives in Somerset with her husband David and their two teenage children; Kathryn and David also have three grown-up Children.</p>
<p>Kathryn is an active member of the Society of Authors and campaigns for Children's rights. She was a contributing author in the Frances Lincoln's Lines in the Sand (2004) which sought to highlight the plight of children in the conflict in Iraq; and more recently has been at the forefront of a campaign by Somerest authors to defend the interests of the local Childrens Library Service in the face of proposed cuts in Local Authority funding.</p>
<p>Early Works</p>
<p>Kathryn began her writing career when her three older children were already at Senior School, and she was in her forties. By then she felt comfortable enought to revisit her own rather troubled childhood which she did in her first book, "When They Fight", which was published by OUP in 1998. She partnered with Cliff Wright, who illustrated the story in such a sensitive manner with his beautiful pictures of Badgers - this was to be the first in a series of partnerships with leading illustrators who have done so much to bring Kathryn's works to life.</p>
<p>Also during this period, Kathryn wrote her first work for Eggmont, entitled Smowshoe the Hare, which was accepted in 2001 but for contractual reasons was not published until four years later.</p>
<p>Kathryn began her longstanding relationship with Educational Publishers, Ginn, in 1999. Since then she has contributed to a number of books of short stories, inclduing her own very first short story, the enchanting Tupilak, published by Ginn as a separte volume in 2000.</p>
<p>Little Tiger Press</p>
<p>Since 2003, Kathryn's primary focus has been her work for Little Tiger Press, for whom she has published two picture books, including The Nutty Nut Chase (illustrated by Vanessa Coban) in 2005, and the best selling Here Comes the Crocodile (illustrated by Michael Terry) in 2003.</p>
<p>With strong support from Little Tiger, Kathryn's work has reached a much wider audience. Here Comes the Crocodile was shortlisted for both the Nottingham Children's Book Award and the Sheffield Book Award in 2005, receiving strong praise from both sets of Judges.</p>
<p>Kathryn is currently working with Little Tiger on a series of short stories and novels for children.</p>
<p>Other Work</p>
<p>Kathryn is a regular visitor to Literary Festivals up and down the country. She presents at both the Birmingham Childrens Book Festival and the Cheltenham Literary Festival where her fun activities and story telling are always much in demand.</p>
<p>In 2006, Kathryn made her debut at the Edinburgh Literary Festival, where she presented a fun mix of animal masks and stories to a sell out audience in the Workshop Tent.</p>
<p>Kathryn also carries out school and library visits in the UK, and cites as a highlight her work with Disabled Children in Birmingham in 2005. "They were by far the most appreciative audience to whom I have presented, and the effort they had made in preparing masks and other animal decorations for the event totally blew me away. I cannot wait to go back and see them this year."</p>

<p>A new bridge is being constructed in Venice, Italy, to cross the Grand Canal. It will be only the fourth bridge that crosses the Grand Canal. The bridge will be at a strategic point in Venice's transport system, connecting Ferrovia (train station) and Piazzale Roma (bus station).</p>
<p><b>Design</b></p>
<p>Considering the steel part only, it will have a span of 81 meters. The total length is 94 meters measured from the steps. The width varies from 9.38 meters at the middle of the bridge to 5.58 meters at the start of the bridge with heights of from +3.20 meters at the beginning of the steps to +9.28 meters at the highest point midway along the bridge. The pedestrian walkway is arched with a radius of 180 meters. Its structure consists of a central arch, two lateral arches and two bottom arches. The arches are joined by means of beams positioned radially according to the principal radius. The beams are made up of steel tubes and walls to form a closed box. The walkway is constructed on top of this and consists partly of safety glass (laminated) and partly of slabs of natural Istrian stone. The same stone will be used the clad the abutments and the end sections of the structure will be finished with slabs of stone. The parapets will be in glass with a coated bronze handrail. The surroundings will be paved in Istrian stone and trachyte.</p>
<p>The bridge was designed by <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santiago_Calatrava_1355.html" title="Santiago Calatrava">Santiago Calatrava</a>.</p>

<p>HISTORY The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maid_Service" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maid_Service" rel="nofollow">maid service</a> industry has grown exponentially over the last twenty years. The 80's were dominated by independent cleaning persons that served a handful of clients. Eventually, franchises were formed to serve homeowners on a large scale. Today, there are at least seven franchises that serve the entire country. The maid service industry has evolved from an amateur operation into a corporate operation in the matter of just one decade. As a result, there is lots of room for an aspiring maid service entrepreneur to grow.</p>
<p><br />
HOW TO START YOUR OWN MAID SERVICE</p>
<p>One House At A Time One option is to start the business by starting out just like people in the 80's started out. Clean one house at a time and grow one house at a time. Many of today's most successful maid service companies were started by one person cleaning one house. The biggest advantage that this option provides is that your start-up costs are small. If the new venture doesn't work out, then you've got nothing to lose. The biggest disadvantage that this option provides is that the rate of growth will be slow. A person will risk less, but the reward will also be less (at least in the beginning).</p>
<p>Franchising This option has become very popular since the late 90's. Examples of franchises include Merry Maids, Molly Maid, The Maids, MaidPro, and Maid Brigade. Franchising allows a person to be taught how to run the maid service without going through the growing pains of a new business. Most maid service franchises charge an initial fee plus royalties for the life of the franchise agreement. A franchise doesn't guarantee success, but it can be very helpful if you are new to the business. The disadvantage of this business arrangement is that a business owner must follow the rules of the franchise. A franchisee can not create operating strategies that are not designed by the franchise.</p>
<p>Partnership This option is new to the maid service industry. In fact, there are only two companies attempting this strategy, <a href="http://www.ineedamaid.com/opentwomaids.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ineedamaid.com/opentwomaids.html" rel="nofollow">Two Maids &amp; A Mop</a> and <a href="http://www.maidservicesofamerica.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.maidservicesofamerica.com/" rel="nofollow">Maid Service of America</a>. The partnership model is a great choice for the entrepreneur that has limited capital. Basically, you partner with the corporate company and run the business yourself. As a partner, you own a stake in the business and receive profits based on that ownership stake. The capital required for this is low because the corporate company funds all start-up costs and initial working capital. The corporate company also provides the same type of training and support that a franchise provides.</p>

<p>The Cosmic Energy exists everywhere in the Cosmos. It is the Bond between the galaxies, the planets, humans and molecules. It is the 'space' between each and everything. It is the bond which keeps the whole Cosmos in order. Cosmic Energy is the 'Life Force'. This Cosmic Energy is essential to maintain the order of our life and to expand our Consciousness. Cosmic Energy is the base for all our actions and functions. We receive some amount of Cosmic Energy in deep Sleep and in total Silence. We are using this Cosmic Energy for our day to day activities of our Mind like seeing, speaking, hearing, thinking and all actions of our Body. This limited energy gained through sleep is not sufficient for these activities. That is why we feel exhausted tired and tensed. This leads to mental and physical stress and all kinds of illnesses. The only way to over come this is to get more and more Cosmic Energy. Cosmic Energy is essential to: Maintain the order of our life, to lead a healthy and happy life, to totally involve in all situations we are in, to obtain Knowledge and finally for expansion of our Consciousness. Abundant Cosmic Energy is obtained only through Meditation. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMeditationguru_7022.html" title="User:Meditationguru">Meditationguru</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/d/User_talk%7EMeditationguru_e175.html" title="User talk:Meditationguru">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Meditationguru_732f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Meditationguru">contribs</a>) 2004 September 4 15:35 UTC.</small></p>

<p>The song first appeared in his book <i><a href="../../../a/n/a/Anandamatha.html" title="Anandamatha">Anandamatha</a></i>, published in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1882.html" title="1882">1882</a> amid fears of a ban by <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Raj_db3a.html" title="British Raj">British Raj</a>, though the song itself was actually written six years prior in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1876.html" title="1876">1876</a>. "Vande maatram" was the national cry for freedom from British oppression during the freedom movement. Large rallies, fermenting initially in <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Bengal_be5b.html" title="West Bengal">West Bengal</a>, in the major metropolis of <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calcutta.html" title="Calcutta">Calcutta</a> (Kolkata), would work themselves up into a patriotic fever by shouting the slogan "Vande maatram," or "Hail to the Mother(land)!". The British, fearful of the potential danger of an incited Indian populace, at one point banned the utterance of the motto in public forums and jailed many freedom fighters for disobeying the proscription. To this day, "Vande maatram" is seen as a national <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mantra.html" title="Mantra">mantra</a> describing the love of patriots for the country of India. <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabindranath_Tagore_9e00.html" title="Rabindranath Tagore">Rabindranath Tagore</a> sang 'Vande maatram' in 1896 at the Calcutta (Kolkata) Congress Session. Poet Sarala Devi Chaudurani sang 'Vande maatram' in the Benares Congress Session in 1905. <a href="../../../l/a/l/Lala_Lajpat_Rai_1968.html" title="Lala Lajpat Rai">Lala Lajpat Rai</a> started a journal called Vande maatram from Lahore.</p>

<p>While Vande maatram was treated as the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_anthem.html" title="National anthem">national anthem</a> of India for long, ultimately <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jana_Gana_Mana_84d3.html" title="Jana Gana Mana">Jana Gana Mana</a>, was chosen as the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_anthem.html" title="National anthem">national anthem</a> of independent India. The song was rejected on the grounds that <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslims</a> felt offended by its depiction of the nation as "Ma <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durga.html" title="Durga">Durga</a>"—a <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindu</a> goddess— thus equating the nation with the Hindu conception of <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shakti.html" title="Shakti">shakti</a>, divine feminine dynamic force; and by its origin as part of <i><a href="../../../a/n/a/Anandamatha.html" title="Anandamatha">Anandamatha</a></i>, a novel they felt had an <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Muslim_742a.html" title="Anti-Muslim">anti-Muslim</a> message (see External links below).</p>
<p>In 1937 the Indian National congress discussed at length the status of the song. It was pointed out then that though the first two stanzas began with an unexceptionable evocation of the beauty of the motherland, in later stanzas there are refences where the motherland is likened to godess <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durga.html" title="Durga">Durga</a>. Therefore, the Congress decided to adopt only the first two stanzas as the national song.<sup><a href="#Notes" title="">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The controversy becomes more complex in the light of <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabindranath_Tagore_9e00.html" title="Rabindranath Tagore">Rabindranath Tagore</a>'s rejection of the song as one that would unite all communities in India. In his letter to <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subhas_Chandra_Bose_6e89.html" title="Subhas Chandra Bose">Subhas Chandra Bose</a> (1937) Rabindranath wrote, <i>"The core of 'Vande maatram' is a <a href="../../../h/y/m/Hymn.html" title="Hymn">hymn</a> to goddess Durga: this is so plain that there can be no debate about it. Of course Bankim does show Durga to be inseparably united with Bengal in the end, but no Mussulman [Muslim] can be expected patriotically to worship the ten-handed deity as 'Swadesh' [the nation]. This year many of the special [Durga] Puja numbers of our magazines have quoted verses from 'Vanda maatram' - proof that the editors take the song to be a hymn to Durga. The novel</i> Anandamath <i>is a work of literature, and so the song is appropriate in it. But Parliament is a place of union for all religious groups, and there the song can not be appropriate. When Bengali Mussulmans show signs of stubborn fanaticism, we regard these as intolerable. When we too copy them and make unreasonable demands, it will be self-defeating."</i> In a postscript to this same letter Rabindranath says: <i>"Bengali Hindus have become agitated over this matter, but it does not concern only Hindus. Since there are strong feelings on both sides, a balanced judgement is essential. In pursuit of our political aims we want peace, unity and good will - we do not want the endless tug of war that comes from supporting the demands of one faction over the other."</i> (Letter #314, <i>Selected Letters of Rabindranath Tagore</i>, edited by K. Datta and A. Robinson, Cambridge University Press ). In the last decade Vande maatram has been used as a rallying cry by Hindu nationalists in India, who have challenged the status of the current national anthem by Rabindranath.</p>

<p>On 22nd August 2006, there was a row in the house over Vande maatram.

Porque perder as esperanças se a tanto querer&#160;? não é mais que um até logo não é mais que um breve adeus bem cedo junto ao fogo tornaremos a nos ver . com nossas mãos entrelaçadas ao redor do calor formemos nesta noite um circulo de amor . pois o senhor que nos protege e nos vai abençoar um dia certamente vai de novo nos juntar .</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-09-05_1039.html" title="Edit section: Star Air (of Copenhagen, Denmark)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Star Air (of Copenhagen, Denmark)</span></h2>
<p>Star Air was founded on September 1st 1987 by the A P Moller Line who bought a hangar and the operating organisation from Alk-Air and leased 3 Fokker 27-600's. Until 1995 Star Air was based in a hangar in Copenhagen Airport, Denmark. At the outset, Star Air's customer base consisted of companies who required transport for their customers and employees, as well as other airlines who required the lease of aircrafts with crew. As Star Air's business objective was airfreight, the activities gradually turned towards freight-related customers; TNT, FEDEX, UPS, XP-Aviation etc. The F-27 aircrafts were converted to freighters (Class E Cargo version) and for some years cargo flights were the company's sole activity. However, Star Air never established its own distribution network, instead it sold its capacity as charter or sub-charter. By 1993 the market rate for charters of freighter aircraft of the Fokker 27 size had fallen to an unacceptably low level and the dismantling of the fleet was initiated. The administration, operations and navigation departments were taken over by Maersk Air and Star Air took up passenger flying again. Meanwhile, UPS, United Parcel Service, due to lack of traffic rights within the EU - found themselves in need of a local operator to carry out the flights they couldn't operate themselves. Star Air was in contention to become UPS's partner within the EU, but it lost out to Sterling Airways who already operated Boeing 727's and had an FAA approved maintenance organisation. However, STERLING AIRWAYS went bankrupt shortly before commencing the UPS operation and thus, at very short notice, it became Star Air who set up UPS's new European operation, using aircrafts leased from UPS. On October 22nd 1993, Star Air entered into a contract with UPS for the operation of 2 Boeing 727 routes; Cologne - Zaragoza - Porto and Cologne - Bergamo ­ Rome. The first flights began only 10 days after the signing of the contract. In 1996 the last remaining Star Air Fokker 27 was sold, leaving Star Air 100% engaged in the UPS operation. At the end of July, 2004, the last B727 were returned to UPS and the 4 routes were being operated by Star Air with a fleet of 4 B757. During 2003 Star Air and UPS entered into a new contractual agreement for the next 10 years. Starting primo 2005 Star Air will gradually place 11 Boeing 767SF (Special Freighter) in service with UPS. As the 767SFs arrived the 757PFs was returned to UPS. When A. P. Moller - Maersk in 2005 sold Maersk Air, Star Air remained as an independent entity within the A. P. Moller - Maersk group which required a substantial increase of techical and administrative staff. About 110 mechanics and pilots are employed full-time - most are based in Cologne, Germany, where UPS has its main European hub.</p>

<p>UNIVERSE COMICS</p>
<p>Universe Comics are comic books, often superhero titles, where the characters inhabit the same universe as characters from other books. This is to distinguish them from superhero titles like Paul Chadwick's <b><i>Concrete</i></b>, Mike Allred's <b><i>Madman</i></b>, Alan Moore &amp; Dave Gibbon's <b><i>Watchmen</i></b> and others where the heroes exist solely within their own title.</p>
<p>The best known Universe Comics are those of DC— which includes Superman, Batman, the Justice League, the Legion of Superheroes, and a plethora of others— and Marvel— home to Spiderman, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, Captain America, the Punisher, et al.</p>
<p>Other comics universes include the Wildstorm Universe and ABC Comics (both owned by DC Comics), Marvel's Ultimate Universe, and the now defunct Valiant, Malibu and Crossgen Universes. <b><i>Watchmen</i></b> was originally based on characters from the Charleton Universe, which DC Comics bought— however, the Charleton characters were instead incorporated into the DC Universe, while <b><i>Watchmen</i></b> nominally changed the characters into original creations.</p>
<p>Publishers such as Dark Horse, Image Comics, Devil's Due, AAA Pop and Vertigo do publish superhero titles, but they are rarely— if ever— tied into a joint universe. Attempts by both Devil's Due and Image (the <b><i>Firebreather/Invincible/Shadowhawk/Noble Causes</i></b> crossover) met with failure, and no Universe Comics publisher which has started since the 1970's has lasted. Non-superhero publishers— such as Oni Press, IDW Publishing, Fantagraphics Books, Drawn &amp; Quarterly Publishing and AiT/Planet Lar— generally avoid universe comics.</p>
<p><b>ADVANTAGES OF UNIVERSE COMICS</b></p>
<p>By creating a single universe which all of a company's characters inhabit, there is an increased sense of realism. While this may seem counter-intuitive— how can manysuperheroes be more realistic than one anomaly?— readers are more willing to accept an event or occurrence when they see its impact in multiple titles. Magical realist authors have emphasized that what makes the fantastic believable is the level of detail, which allows the reader to acclimate themselves to this new world. Thus, the fact that Lex Luther is an enemy of Superman but also a business rival of Bruce Wayne (aka, Batman) grounds each of the characters in a more firmly established world.</p>
<p>Another advantage of a universe is the way that interaction between characters can lead to team-ups, interpersonal conflicts and epic "events" which often draw a larger readership by attracting readers of separate titles together. Books such as <b><i>World's Finest</i></b> and <b><i>Marvel Team-Ups</i></b> thrived on the interaction between already-known heroes within a universe, while <b><i>Marvel Presents</i></b> and <b><i>DC Showcase</i></b> allowed lesser-known characters a chance to develop a following and remain relevant within the universe.</p>
<p>Within this context, death in a Universe can be a significant event— even for minor characters— because they had an established identity. Compared to deaths in other genres, which kill off unknowns for dramatic effect (see <b><i>Star Trek</i></b>'s infamous red shirts for but one example), death in Universe Comics carry a certain gravatis. This is often, however, undermined by the willingness of Universe Comics publishers to resurrect characters. While Marvel Comics promoted a "Dead means Dead" policy under Bill Jemas in the early aughts, this policy fell to the wayside under Dan Buckley's leadership, and has never been taken very seriously by either publisher. (The exceptions remain minor characters, Barry Allen the Silver Age Flash, and the creator-owned Automatic Kafka. Wildstorm and ABC Comics have remained more consistent in their policy towards death.</p>
<p>Finally, the Universe system allows for publishers to develop a sense of reader-loyalty based on the DC/Marvel dichotomy. Promoted most fervently by Marvel Comics, and specifically by figures like Joe Quesada and Bill Jemas, this publisher-based loyalty creates a unique situation unseen in most other genres and mediums. Harlequin Romances and indie music seem to be the exceptions— and even with these cases, people who buy Warp Records or Secret Desire Romances rarely ignore other cds or books because they are from another company. In recent years, many have decried this universe loyalty— especially because writers, artists and editors often work for both sides— but there are still fans who hold onto this sort of loyalty.</p>
<p><b><i>DISADVANTAGES OF UNIVERSE COMICS</i></b></p>
<p>To start with the reverse, reader-loyalty tied to a specific universe has created a policy of entrenchment within the comics industry. This demonstrates itself in two forms. First, many readers are willing to buy comics starring their favorite characters, no matter how poor the quality of the writing or art. Subpar authors such as Chuck Austen were retained, in spite of significant protests against their work, because readers were still purchasing the books in question for fear of missing out on important developments in the universe. It is difficult to judge, from sales, the quality of an artist or author, because the sales numbers reflect the readers' interest in the title and universe, not in the quality of the work itself.</p>
<p>Beyond the problem of quality, entrenchment also leads to a policy of reader-loyalty to specific characters, making significant change within the universe difficult to impossible. When the DC Comics hero Hal Jordan, star of <b><i>Green Lantern</i></b>, was twisted by personal loss and a sense of misguided power into a villain, readers protested his death, creating fan-groups to write letters of complaint and boycott new books out of protest. Jordan's replacement <b><i>Green Lantern</i></b>, Kyle Rayner, was treated as the "new guy" by creative teams and fans alike, even after ten years of stories and development. Jordan was eventually "reborn" and Rayner moved into a separate title, <b><i>Ion</i></b>, after which point nothing is yet known. Other famous characters who have been revived due to reader response include Colossus and Green Arrow. Characters of the <b><i>X-Men</i></b> comics have been resurrected with such frequency that their deaths have become a standing joke in some circles, including within the comics themselves. (Peter David's <b><i>X- Factor</i></b> involves a character blowing off the death of her father because, after all, all X-Men come back eventually.)</p>
<p>An equally significant, and perhaps unavoidable problem, is continuity. While all ongoing stories— be they tv shows, soap operas, book series or film sets— have a certain amount of overlap from previous stories, comics' continuity is often significantly larger, more convoluted and harder to keep track of. There are various reasons for this.</p>
<p>First off, even a daily soap opera is limited on the number of characters and plots it can introduce before becoming incomprehensible. However, within a universe set-up, multiple characters can all have individual stories developing in various books simultaneously. To use Batman as an example: Batman appears in his self-titled comic, <b><i>Batman</i></b>, as well as <b><i>Detective Comics</i></b> and <b><i>Legends of the Dark Knight</i></b>, two titles explicitly about him. He also plays a major role in the <b><i>Justice League of America</i></b> and its spin-off, <b><i>JLA Classified</i></b> while he shares the book <b><i>Superman/Batman</i></b> with its other titular hero. Yet, to continue the cameos, Batman also makes regular appearances in <b><i>Robin, Batgirl,</i></b> and <b><i>Gotham Central</i></b>, less regular appearances elsewhere. Add to this the Batman miniseri which are offered every month, and Batman stars in anywhere between 10 and 15 books a month, each written by a different author. Given that Batman's history dates back to the 1930's, there is a great deal of continuity to be followed. (It may be worth noting that a variety of other titles about Batman, including <b><i>Gotham Knights</i></b> and <b><i>Shadow of the Bat</i></b> have existed, and he has been member of other teams, including <b><i>The Outsiders</i></b>, over the years. These are also part of his continuity.)</p>
<p>The problem of continuity is not simply quantity— the number of books— but perception. Each creative team who deals with Batman has their own impression of him: why does he act a certain way, what would he do in a given situation, what is his relationship with a specific character? This can lead to contradictions, where he can be rational yet kind-hearted in Alan Moore and Brian Bolland's <b><i>The Killing Joke</i></b>, mystic to the point of shamanism in Grant Morrison and Dave McKean's <b><i>Arkham Asylum</i></b> and violently psychotic in Frank Miller's <b><i>The Dark Knight Returns</i></b>. How does a reader reconcile these various opinions of who Batman is? This situation applies to every character within a universe, because every character is reinvented by multiple creative teams. This is distinctly different than books like <b><i>Hellboy</i></b> and <b><i>Too Much Coffee Man</i></b>, who are written in one or two titles by a single author, keeping the continuity limited and focused.</p>
<p>Beyond individual questions, the entire Universe suffers from the weight of continuity. Creative teams cannot ignore past events for fear of upsetting long-time readers, while they also cannot depend on them too heavily for fear of alienating new readers. Marvel, in an attempt to combat this, created the Ultimate Universe so readers could start from scratch; the problem, however, is that the Ultimate Universe creates its own continuity over time. Rather innovatively, DC Comics used events such as <b><i>Crisis on Infinite Earths, Zero Hour</i></b> and the more recent <b><i>Infinite Crisis</i></b> to "reset" continuity. The goal was to wash away past events and create a clean slate. This has led to various complications, however, including the question of which backstories remained valid or "in continuity" and which backstories were forgotten or "out of continuity." This whole problem was parodied in Andi Watson's comic, <b><i>Love Fights</i></b>, but no solution has yet been reached as to how to fix the problem of continuity.</p>
<p><b>ECONOMIC ISSUES RELATED TO UNIVERSE COMICS</b> The limited success or often abject failure of most recent universes suggests that the economic model is too large and unwieldy to be successful on a large scale. CrossGen's owner was forced to declare bankruptcy despite beginning with millions of dollars investment. The viability of DC, Wildstorm and ABC Comics is tied to their ownership by AOL/Time- Warner, while Marvel Comics has faced bankruptcy as recently as the 1990's.</p>
<p>One could, however, make the argument that American comic companies face significant hurdles as a niche market, and that factors beyond being a "Universe" come into play in these difficulties. Most non-Universe publishers, for example, do not publish their entire line in full-color, which is a significant expense. (IDW Publishing remains one of the few exceptions.) There are also economic concerns such as merchandizing (films, toys, novelizations, etc), the Direct Market system, the loss of newstands, the growth of book sales through trade paperbacks and graphic novels, company organizational models, and a myriad of other concerns.</p>
<p>At their heart, universe comics have grown to become, in spite of their low readership and the stigmatization of graphic literature in America, a part of Americana.</p>

<p>Ethan Mount is a Chronic Future album subject to be released in Late 2006 or Early 2007.</p>
<p>According to ChronicFuture member Ben Collins "we are at least 3-6 months away from our record being released. We're not rushing this and we're not going to put out a half assed record, so yes we are taking our time writing songs. It will come out when it comes out......being annoyed by that is kind of well....annoying. We are working hard, and all the while trying to keep people interested and happy by putting out the special releases. Most bands DO take 3 years between records. Lines in My Face came out 2 years ago. CHILLLLL PEOPLE!"</p>
<p>In the meantime, Chronic Future is releasing a limited edition album with the following songs:</p>
<p>all things considered, temper anthem, shellshocked (remix), home game, if you ever run away, jupiter (future lord), the summer of 1980, flight of the birds, insects, antartica.</p>
<p>All copies of the limited edition CD will be signed and numbered by the band.</p>

<p>John Hibben was the President of Princeton from 1912 until 1932. He is considered to be one of the best presidents of Princeton.</p>
<p>The following is an excerpt from his commencement speech for <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princeton.html" title="Princeton">Princeton</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1913.html" title="1913">1913</a>, as America was entering <a href="../../../w/w/i/WWI_f5e9.html" title="WWI">WWI</a>.</p>
<p>You, enlightened, self-sufficient, self-governed, endowed with gifts above your fellows, the world expects you to produce as well as to consume, to add to and not to subtract from its store of good, to build up and not tear down, to enable and not degrade.</p>
<p>It commands you to take your place and to fight your fight in the name of honor and of chivalry, against the powers of organized evil and of commercialized vice, against the poverty, disease and death which follow fast in the wake of sin and ignorance, against all the innumberable forces, which are working to destroy the image of God in man, and unleash the passions of the beast.</p>
<p>There comes to you from many quarters, from many voices, the call of your kind. It is the human cry of spirits in bondage, of souls in despair, of lives debased and doomed. It is the call of man to his brother ... such is your vocation; follow the voice that calls you in the name of God and of man. The time is short, the opportunity is great; therefore, crowd the hours with the best that is in you.</p>
