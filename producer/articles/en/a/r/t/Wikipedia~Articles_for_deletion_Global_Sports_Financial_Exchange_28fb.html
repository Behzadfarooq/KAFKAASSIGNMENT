<li>Please do not delete this article. My name is Carlos Duran and I am the marketing director for the GSFE. This article was created by a member of our exchange. I do not know how to directly contact you, but if you can contact me at carlosd@allsportsmarket.com and provide instructions I will supply academic articles on the GSFE from doctorate members of the UCLA economics department along with documentation from US Lobbying and legal firms as to the function and purpose of the GSFE.
<p>I can also provide various media reports on the GSFE/ASM platform including one from the NYSE floor in Wall Street, this report was aired on Channel 11 WPIX in NY,NY.</p>
<p>I am asking that you provide a way that I can supply this documentation for your review. It seems that the person(s) who have been accusing us of fraudulent activities and erasing the entry to put up a libelous script are set with malignant intent. It is our belief that this person(s) were found to be violating exchange trade policy and are now resorting to a vengful response.</p>
<p>Please give us a fair chance to show Wikipedia what the GSFE is. My email is Carlosd@allsportsmarket.com</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and assistance.</p>

<p><i>That is funny. I wonder what my real boyfriend would say to that. Now, with regard to my "agenda" or my "libelous" comments (I can only speak for myself), everyone is able to read what I posted in the article disputed here. In contrast to you, I included a few external references. I have many more, and I can also scan offline evidence and post it for everyone to see if that's what you want. The only "agenda" that could be attributed to me is the decision that I am not going to tolerate any longer how you scam people again and again (you know as much as I do that ASM / GSFE is not your first fraudulent business). For plenty of years, I have been enjoying Wikipedia as a user and felt too much respect for the work of others to even try to write my own articles on whatever subject. I know that there are tons of talented Wikipedia users out there who can do much better than I could. But now that you openly decided to abuse Wikipedia for one of your (in-)famous marketing campaigns, I had to step in and so had others. I did not come here first and post "libelous" stuff. YOUR team started the whole thing without checking first what Wikipedia is all about. I will be totally fine if the ultimate decision will be to remove everything. Stuff like that simply DOES NOT belong on Wikipedia (some of the other users here please correct me if I am wrong. As I said, I'm more a reader here, not a writer).</i> waiwiki80 21:38, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>My name is Chris P. Rabalais and I am the President of AllSportsMarket.com. Direct your questions or concerns about this matter to me at ChrisR@AllSportsMarket.com. If the operators of Wikipedia are not interested in the true nature of our business and will sustain the efforts of malicious parties who have other agendas, simply remove this definition and prevent further definitions from being posted by anyone.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Regardless of whether or not the article passes WP:CORP and/or WP:WEB, and regardless of whether the two latest recommendations of deletion are indeed "out to get you", as is claimed, as a general rule, articles should not be written by people associated with the article's subject. Since it very much appears that users on your site were offered incentives for creating and contributing to this article, I strongly doubt whether this article can remain neutral should it survive AfD. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheProject_f8b7.html" title="User:TheProject">theProject</a> 18:20, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: It is true we offered an incentive to any trader who provided an accurate entry into Wikipedia. At the time I was not familiar with all the Wikipedia requirements that I have now become familiar with. This was not done as a marketing stunt; it was done because I am not technically inclined and we all love Wikipedia so I thought it only fair to offer something of appreciation for someone who took the time to create the entry. I can guarantee that ASM/GSFE will work with Wikipedia to provide a neutral and accurate article and keep it that way. I would like to point out that because of the growing trader base on our exchange it is difficult to say that no one associated with our exchange will contribute. Both GSFE and Wikipedia are part of a global community. I also think this unfair because, as an example, I would think that patrons of McDonalds contribute to the McDonalds entry as I am sure those who fly on planes contribute to the entries regarding Boeing. However if we can not reach a harmonious agreement as to the GSFE/ASM entry we simply ask that no entry be allowed in regard to our exchange, most specifically those that are libelous and unsubstantiated. I would also offer to put any Wikipedia administrator in contact with both our US Government Affairs contact and our legal firm in Virginia.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I would like to present the following media archive with two separate T.V. news stories covering ASM/GSFE. Please let me know if these meet the requirements of WP:Corp. Thank you. Here is the link and password NO DOWNLOAD is required, you will need to scroll down to watch the second story:</li>

<p>And in the hope of further shedding light on what the GSFE is I offer the below link to a paper written by Dr. Alper Ozgit (PhD UCLA Economics). Here Dr. Alper writes on what is ASM/GSFE; along with its purpose and place among financial markets and its social and economic functions.</p>
