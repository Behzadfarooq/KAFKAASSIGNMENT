<b>Warth v. Seldin</b>, 422 U.S. 490 (1975), was a Supreme Court case in which the Court reviewed the concept of judicial standing and affirmed that the plaintiffs lacked standing; therefore, they could not maintain a case against the defendants. The plaintiffs had brought action against the town of Penfield and against members of the Zoning, Plainning, and Town Boards of Penfield, alleging that Penfield's zoning ordinances intentionally and wrongly excluded persons of low and moderate income from living there. The court found that as none of the plaintiffs could demonstrate any injury actually done to them by the defendants, the plaintiffs were third partys to the issue and had no standing to sue. The plaintiff's descriptions of their own meager financial situations and subsequent inabilty to live in Penfield were found by the Court to be the consequence of the economics and housing market of the area rather than any wrong doing by the defendants.</p>

"The Life" by Alan Cramer was one of the first Urban Street novels to attempt to cross genres. It is a cross between a "police procedural", and a mystery thriller. Still the most important characters were drawn from the Urban genre. Even though the book is listed along side other Urban books it is listed on amazon.com and Barnes&amp;Noble.com as a mystery.</p>

<p>Christopher Sims has developed a reputation for being a raw and unrefined new talent in the film industry. He began his work in the Orange County hardcore punk scene, touring with his friends’ bands and making rock documentaries. One by one, bands began to approach him for compelling, authentic representations of their art form. From projects for emerging stars Eighteen Visions to platinum selling artists like Queens of the Stone Age, Sims is quickly advancing onto the film world.</p>
<p>In high school, Sims was most dedicated to his photo class, where he’d spend hours in the darkroom perfecting print. While pursuing higher education, he grappled with his prescribed role in the “real world;” a college degree, a nine-to-five and a white picket fence. On virtually no budget, he filmed a full-length feature loosely based on his experiences, about a group of suburban youngsters living in direct opposition to society’s rules on how to “make it.” Further manifesting his ideals, he refused to take a single film class and turned down numerous job offers from production companies while gaining notice as a driven rookie filmmaker, and has quickly moved on to larger budget music videos and films.</p>
<p>Christopher’s first directorial debut was for the band Eighteen Visions. Being a long time friend of the band gave him a comfortable advantage. He chose to shoot the entire video in High Definition, an extremely new format at the time. Choosing to shoot HD gave him the room in the exceptionally small budget to shoot a music video that rivaled the look of the bigger budget videos of the time. Since then Sims and his cinematographer Jessica Young choose to shoot traditional film because of its beautiful inconsistencies and celluloid imperfections.</p>
<p>Starting as an editor for 4 years before moving on to directing gave Sims the advantage and creative sensibility to create and shoot material for the edit. He is known to edit all of his music videos. Recognized by the juxtaposed arrangement and perfectly manipulated cuts, Christopher’s sequences are almost masterful as he’s known to sometimes spend days just cutting a few frames. “I’ve cut a video in 6 hours before, and it’ll be the final cut with nothing needed to be re-cut, and other pieces could take me weeks, it depends on my mood and the rhythm of the material.” Sims says.</p>
<p>Sims’ noteworthy talent for film lies not in his ability to bring his world to the viewer, but the urgency with which he brings the viewer into his world. He’s notorious for gripping imagery, composition with a sense of chaos and masterful arrangement in the edit. Favoring stark tones, jilted sequences, perceived light flaws and images that are both jarring and elegant, his work often pervades viewers with emotions they can’t help. He works with deviance, obsession and incredible momentum; it’s not uncommon for him to complete 40 set-ups a day.</p>
<p>With a full appreciation for the digital realm yet a total commitment to the tradition of film and a knack for groundbreaking concepts, director and visionary Christopher Sims will continue a career in his most prized obsession; imagery.</p>

<p>Vai Lung Thlan is a mancala variant played on a board consisting of 2 rows of 6 holes. Each hole is filled with 5 beads.</p>
<p>a player sows beads clockwise around the board once starting from a hole in his possesion... i'm not sure about the chain of unbroken single stones, does that mean each must be single, or it doesn't matter as long as it is unbroken. Does it count as broken if you come to a point were you must go to another row?</p>

[High Feather]</p>
<p><br />
High Feather was a television show which ran on PBS stations in the 1980's. It was a 13 part series produced by Bureau of Mass Communications, New York State Education Dept in 1980. The show followed 8 teenagers through a summer at the High Feather Camp, where they learned the values of honesty, nutririon, physical fitness, as well as just getting along.</p>
<p>The 30 min. series was one the first programs to highlight teens living with diabetes and anorexia nervosa. Particulary memorable episodes included "Ballerina" where the character of Leslie starves herself to the point of exhaustion to acheive a dancer's body, "Swim Test" where the character of Tom was afraid to go shirtless in the lake because of his obesity, and "Swifty" featuring a memorable hurdle race.</p>
<p>The term "high feather" like the old English expression, "high fettle" means enjoying life and cheerfully doing all the daily tasks of living.</p>
<p>Cast: Leslie - Jacqueline Allen, Stan - Brian Goldberg, Leo - Virgil Hayes, Tom - Richard Levey, Suzanne - Cindy O'Neal, Cathy - Emily Wagner, Ann - Tasha Washington, Domingo - Tino Zaldivar, Kim - Robert Y. R. Chung, Mrs. Riggs - Barbara Brown, Nurse - Ramona Brito, Swim Coach - Powell McGill</p>

<p>Saint Charles Lwanga</p>
<p>In Uganda, Africa 1879 a Catholic mission was started.The African Missionaries were called " White Fathers" because of their white relious habits. The king at the time, King Mwanga was not familiar with Christianity. His ignorant tolerance changed to rage when Catholic, Joseph Mkasa corrected the king's living styles. The king murdered an Angelican bishop and a group of Christians. Mwanga was also involved in homosexual activities. The court pages caught his interest the most. By this time he deeply hated Joseph Mkasa and Catholism. A select few of the kings fuled his resentment with lies. He beheaded Mkasa on November 18, 1885. That was the start of a long persecution of one hundred people. Twenty-two who would later be named saints.</p>
<p>After Mkasa was killed, Charles Lwanga became the main religious teacher of the Catholic pages. The king found out about his Catholic pages on May 26, 1886. In his rage Mwanga called Denis Sebuggwawo if he had been taeching the pages. Denis said "yes" and the king ran the young man through the throat with a spear.Then he shouted that no one wasw allowed out of his facilities. While drums beat endlessly throught the night Lwanga baptized four pages. St. Kizito a cheerful, kind 13-year-old was one of them. Lwanga often pratected him from the kins sinful habits.</p>
<p>On June 3, 1886 22 Uganda martyrs were murdered. They had to walk 37 miles to the execution site. After a few days in prison some were ran through with swords while others, including Lwanga were tossed alive on a bonfire. Lwanga arranged the sticks so they would burn slowly and prayed to God while dying.</p>
<p>In 1964 he and the other 21 were proclaimed saints by Pope Paul VI. Charles is the patron saint of youthful, black Africans. He is also patron of torture victims.</p>

<p>The Apple Wassail is a tradition from the middle ages practiced in the cider orchards of south west England during the winter. Slices of bread or toast are tied to branches, and cider is poured over the tree roots. The ceremony is said to "bless" the trees to produce a good crop in the forthcoming season.</p>
<p>These days the Apple Wassail is also an excuse to drink vast quantities of cider and party all night.</p>

About Yogesh Chabria</p>
<p>Yogesh started his first successful venture when he was 6 years old, nothing fancy. He was studying at an international school in Tehran, Iran. He loved reading, and spent lots of time reading comics. There was a slight problem though, Iran is a non-English speaking country and so he couldn’t find any English comics there. He used to buy loads of comics every time he went to India for vacations, or requested people coming to Iran to get him comics. That is how it all started; he now had an ever-increasing stock of comics and didn’t know what to do with his gigantic comic collection. He decided to rent out his huge collection of comics to his classmates and friends at school. Soon he was renting out comics to everybody at school. It worked out very well, and that is how it all started.</p>
<p>Over the years he has been involved in training foreign students communicate confidently and fluently in English, helped companies manage people, been in charge of event management, marketing sales, freelance writing, been the editor of two magazines, has worked with NGO’s to help spread Child Rights, alternative energy, meditation, the list is endless. He presently is motivational speaker, freelance writer and consultant. He also runs a firm called Streamline and is busy writing a book.</p>
<p>He is also the recipient of several scholarships and awards, such as the “Air India Scholastic Award”, “Tarachand Hassomal Kundanni Scholarship”, “Sindhi Social Samaj Scholarship”, is the winner of the “Monsieur Alliance Francais” title, and has represented India at an international program in France, organized by The Lions Club , aimed at social, cultural and international welfare.</p>
<p><br />
His interests include learning new languages, (He presently speaks 5 languages fluently- English, Hindi, Persian, French and Sindhi ), listening to music, reading, writing, boogie workouts, making people laugh and practicing transcendental meditation.</p>

<p>USS Nyack was a wooden gunboat commissioned on 28 September 1864. She saw duty towards the end of the Civil War and was moored in Callao Harbour on June 20th 1866 when she joined other US and British ships to fire a salute to mark the anniversary of Queen Victoria's coronation. She was decommissioned on 15 March 1871.</p>

<p>Van Conner was born in Ellensburg, Washington, U.S.A. He and his brother (Gary Lee Conner), along with Mark Lanegan and Mark Pickeral formed the band The Explosive Generation. They would later change their name to The Screaming Trees. They recorded their first EP demo, entitled Clairvoyance, on Velvetone Records and it would enjoy moderate success.</p>
<p>The Screaming Trees would be fairly successful, but had to endure many lineup changes over the years. The band spent almost the entire year of 1990 working on their own side project. Van would for his own band, Solomon Grundy, and released a self-titled album on New Alliance records.</p>
<p>Van later got back together with the rest of the band members to release their album "Uncle Anesthesia" in 1991, which was produced by SOundgarden's )and later Audioslave's) frontman Chris Cornell, along with Terry Date.</p>
<p>The original lineup of the Screaming Trees was Mark Lanegen on vocals, Van Conner on bass, Gary Lee Conner on guitar, and Mark Pickerel on drums, but the band would be often changed up. Mark Pickeral left the band and was replaced by ex-Skin Yard drummer Barrett Martin (who would later drum in Mad Season with various other "grunge" artists). The Trees would break up in 1996, as it was announced at Seattle's EMP music museum while they were in concert.</p>
<p>Van Conner now plays in the band Valis with Barrett Martin and former Mudhoney drummer Dan Peters.</p>

<p>Inside the NBA is a critically acclaimed television show dedicated to professional basketball that airs Thursdays on TNT during the regular season and playoffs. It is well known and respected by fans and critics for it's expert analysis and the lively and humorous banter that goes on regularly between the panelists. Ernie Johnson is the host, with Kenny Smith, Charles Barkley, and, periodically, Magic Johnson, offering their insight on the night's games and other news around the league.</p>
<p><a href="../../../f/o/r/Format.html" title="Format">Format</a> The show takes place in a studio in Atlanta, Georgia, where the foursome sit at a table as Ernie tosses out topics for the analysts to discuss. The show is unscripted, meaning the panel is able to jump off topic and move from one subject to another.</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/o/l/Roles.html" title="Roles">Roles</a> Ernie Johnson serves as the quarterback of the show, throwing out subjects for debate. He makes the show run with his ability to change pace at a moments notice, guaranteeing that there's always some kind of action. He is also witty and funny and more than able to exchange quips with Smith and especially Barkley. Smith has a considerable knowledge of the game, leading to talk that he may have a future career on the sidelines. Smith is like a coach on the set and offers pictures at halftime of each game (each week features a double-header), referred to on the show as "Kenny's Pictures." He also often trades jibes with Barkley. Barkley took the show to a new level when he arrived during the 2000-01 season with his outrageous and wildly hilarious comments, sometimes embarrasing, which lead to him often being the butt of jokes. He is also very insightful and often proves to be right when he makes predictions (there are some exceptions, though). Magic, when he's there, which is rare, adds another credible panelists to the show.</p>
<p>Things you should expect to see when you tune in to the show. Ernie mocking Barkley about his lack of championships. Barkley mocking Ernie about his lack of athletic ability. Smith mocking Barkley about his lack of rings and his weight. Barkley pointing out that Smith would have no rings if it weren't for Hakeem Olajuwon. Everyone mocking Magic for his poor attendance.</p>

<p>A Metropolitan from the Indian Orthodox Church (1922-1996) will be remembered for pioneering Eastern Orthodox perspective on contemporary "western" Catholic and Protestant developments. His Grace Dr. Paulos Mar Gregorios was the first Metropolitan of Delhi, from inception of the Diocese in 1976 &amp; also the Principal of the Orthodox Theological Seminary in Kottayam, Kerala since 1967.</p>
<p>Born in Thripunithra, Kerala, he had his early education in his hometown. He worked with the government in the P &amp; T Dept., before joining Ethiopian government schools as a teacher. He continued his studies in Indiana at Goshen College (BA), Oklahoma University and the Union Theological Seminary, NY and thereafter at Princeton (M.Div.) and Yale (STM). He did his doctoral studies in Oxford and Muenster (Germany) and received his Doctorate in Theology from the Serampore University, India. Prior to his ordination as priest in 1961, His Grace had successively held offices such as Gen. Secy-Orthodox Christian Student Movement of India; Associate Secy-Student Christian Movement of India; Hon. Lecturer-Union Christian College; Lecturer-University College of Addis Ababa and Director of the Division of Ecumenical Action &amp; Associate Secy. of the World Council of Churches, Geneva.</p>
<p>He both <a href="http://www.paulosmargregorios.info/English%20Articles/Orthodox%20Churches.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.paulosmargregorios.info/English%20Articles/Orthodox%20Churches.htm" rel="nofollow">introduced</a> eastern qualities while forging interfaith dialogue. He was in Ethiopia serving first at the Educational Department and later as personal Advisor to Emperor Haile Selasi. He also wrote the Grammar book of the Ethiopian language.</p>
<p>His stellar experiences with the Emperor are <a href="http://www.paulosmargregorios.info/Autobiography/Chapter%204.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.paulosmargregorios.info/Autobiography/Chapter%204.htm" rel="nofollow">detailed</a> in his autobiography. From there he went to Geneva to serve as one of the Secretaries of the World Council of Churches for inter - church Aid. Later he became one of the Associate General Secretaries of the WCC.</p>
<p>Along with his proficiency with languages he was one of the first to establish modern Orthodox precedence in engaging with contemporary secular philosophy, as seen by his active engagement speaking with organizations like the International Society of Metaphysics, a sermon available in A Human God. After returning to India, he taught at the Orthodox theological Seminary at Kottayam and became its Principal. This position he continued to hold even after his consecration as a bishop and elevation as Metropolitan. He was the Metropolitan of the Orthodox church Delhi Diocese, with Head Quarters at New Delhi.</p>
<p>As Principal of the Orthodox Theological Seminary, he was a member of the Senate of Serampore College and played an important role in the guiding of theological education in India.</p>

<p>Infamous Mobb followed the precedent established by fellow Queensbridge rappers Nas and Mobb Deep. The latter introduced the trio -- comprised of Ty Nitty, Gambino, and Godfather, Pt. 3 -- on Hell on Earth (1996) and Murda Muzik (1998); however, Infamous Mobb didn't release their debut album until 2002, after guest appearances on DJ Muggs' second Soul Assassins album and Nas' QB Finest collection. The trio's debut album, Special Edition, featured extensive production work by Alchemist and was self-relased on their own IM3 label (distributed by Landspeed Records). They returned a couple years later in 2004 with Blood Thicker Than Water, Vol. 1, which was again self-released on IM3 (via Monopolee this time). The album was accompanied by a bonus DVD including numerous music videos as well as in-depth interviews with various members of the Queensbridge hardcore rap scene of which Infamous Mobb are an integral part.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-01-22_0ae0.html" title="Edit section: Damien Top">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../d/a/m/Damien_Top_2d93.html" title="Damien Top">Damien Top</a></span></h2>
<p>After studying Literature and Philosophy in Lille and graduating in Germanic Studies at the University of Paris, Damien Top studied Singing and Dramatic Art at the Conservatoire in Lille. Later, at the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique de Paris, he joined the classes of Nicole Broissin (Atelier Lyrique-Opérette) and Rémy Corazza (Vocal Technique), Isabelle Aboulker (Musical Theory), and studied with Galina Vischnievskaya, Jean-Christophe Benoit, and Jacques Pottier (Melbourne University).</p>
<p>His dual training as a singer and an actor enables him to appear in opera, operetta, and sacred works, as well as perform the difficult repertoire of French mélodie - his favorite genre. He has given recitals at Flaneries Musicales de Reims for the Yehudi Menuhin Foundation, Musicales en Valois, and Festival des Grands Crus de Bourgogne,... As a renowned interpreter of French song, Damien Top frequently gives recitals abroad, including performances in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Macedonia, New Zealand, and the United States.</p>
<p>In Diapason, critic Jean Roy wrote of Top, "one will not reproach him error of taste." In 1993, he was engaged by the Opera de Paris-Bastille to sing in a new production of Benvenuto Cellini by Berlioz. In 2001, he has performed in Heloise and Abelard by Australian composer Peter Tahourdin, toured France and Poland with Mozart's Requiem and gave a recital of operatic arias with the Hawaii Youth Symphony Orchestra. In 2002, Damien Top has sung and conducted the cantata "L'oiseau a vu tout cela" by Sauguet at the Institut de France-Académie Française for the celebration of the Centenary of Vercors. Upcoming appearances in Brussels, in Paris, in Honolulu, in Torino and Palermo, in Vevey, in Kiev are scheduled.</p>
<p>Damien Top has studied Analysis, Harmony and the History of Music at the Paris Conservatoire with Michel Quéval. Under the guidance of Sergiu Celibidache, he began research into musical aesthetics and attended seminars in the phenomenology of music. With these two master teachers, he was introduced to orchestral conducting. In his programs, he particularly focuses on the music of our time (Roussel, d'Indy, Delvi))ncourt, Martinet, Sandagerdi, Martinu, Looten, Macha, Ratovondrahety, A. Weber, etc.).</p>
<p>Son of the poet Andrée Brunin, Damien Top gave as well successfull poetry recitals (Alliance Française de Sydney, Université de Melbourne, Société d'Honneur Pi-Delta-Phi d'Hawaii, etc.) He explores a wide range of the repertoire and introduce the audience to the poetry of our time (Anthologie de la poésie française, Poètes féminins contemporains, Centenaire Verlaine,etc.)</p>
<p>Biographical and musicological work on Albert Roussel has been a particular feature of Damien Top’s research and in 1989, in the composer’s birthplace, he devoted an entire recital to Roussel's mélodies. Since 1992 he has been the director of the Centre International Albert Roussel and in 1997 he created the Festival Albert Roussel. His biography of Albert Roussel was published in 2000 by Editions Séguier and he has also written a book on Sergei Rachmaninov and René de Castéra (Prix “Gens de Guyenne et de Gascogne”). Damien Top writes the musical chronic in the monthly "Politique Magazine". He is presently writing a book on the Stringquartett with photographer Louis Monier. Consequently, he is frequently invited to speak at the radio (France Musiques, France Culture, Hawaii Public Radio, Radio Suisse Romande, ...) ; to present papers on French music at international conferences and to give classes at Universities of the Pacific Basin, including Melbourne, Monash, La Trobe, Wollongong, and Wellington as well as in North America : James Madison University, Sherbrooke, Montreal,...</p>
<p>In response to his fine talents as a singer, several composers have written music especially for him: Aboulker, Carr, Choveaux, Cox, Dunleavy, Féron, Marshall, Surianu, Tahourdin, Trumble, Werder, and Jacques Chailley who considers "l'art de Damien Top est exemplaire.” In 1992, BNL Productions released Top’s CD of four song cycles by Jules Massenet - three of which were previously unrecorded. Among others, Top recorded De Coussemaker 's romances and Emile Goué’s songs(R.C.P.)</p>
<p>Member of the SACEM, his compositions have been played in France, Belgium, Italy, United States,... The “Damien Top price for composition” has been given this year by the ASCAP in New York to Eli Marshall. Involved in many organisations, Damien Top is a member of the Advisory Committee of the Lotte Lehmann Foundation (USA), he is at the head of the "Centre International Albert-Roussel" wich he founded in 1992 and the director of the "Albert-Roussel International Festival."</p>
<p>In 2002 Damien Top has been awarded with the "Prix Charles Oulmont - Fondation de France" for his outstanding carreer.</p>
