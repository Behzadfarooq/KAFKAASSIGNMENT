<dd>by analogy, a list of fictional characters would be too long. This is merely a listing of fictional characters by a notable trait. This is hardly a normally deletion worthy article. Check the history. It has dozens of editors and dates back over 2 years. If the page was not useful, it would not show this kind of activity. The list article has proved its usefulness by that standard. Oh, and nothing at wikipedia is self-evident. If you want to delete, make a point that shows this information is a) not notable b) not verifiable or c) redundant. If none of these apply, the article has no reason to be deleted. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 05:53, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> WP is not an indiscriminate collection of information. Looking at this list, it's simply a lot of characters that share an arbitrary trait. There is nothing to be said about them. You cannot draw any sort of connection that helps one understand their encyclopaedic notability. As it stands, it just exists for the sake of documenting minutiae - not a good thing. I would contrast this with, say, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_fictional_pirates.html" title="List of fictional pirates">List of fictional pirates</a>, which can be used to draw connections among and typify the portrayal of pirates in fictional works, or something of that nature.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, but rename to List of fictional amputees. The motif of amputation in fiction is definitely a worthwhile topic, and such a list is comparable to the real-world List_of_amputees. I'd suggest that this list is well within Wikipedia norms, and can become encyclopedic with some editing: its main weakness, as previously noted, is the skew to SF/Fantasy, and its lack of sourcing. Its contents are neutral, verifiable, and its constituents notable. In certain cases, amputation is a core trait to the fictional character (e.g. <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_James_Hook_602d.html" title="Captain James Hook">Captain James Hook</a> or <a href="../../../s/i/x/Six_Million_Dollar_Man_0bb6.html" title="Six Million Dollar Man">Six Million Dollar Man</a>).

<dd><i>In certain cases, amputation is a core trait...</i> I agree with that and believe that should be covered in the characters' respective articles; however, in many of these cases, this does not hold up and, again, it's just an arbitrary trait that they share with other characters. It is of little difference from "Fictional characters with long hair" or "Fictional characters who live in mansions." My test is, after reading through the entries in the list, is there a possible reasonable answer to the question "So what?" If the answer is yes, there is likely an encyclopaedic use for this list. If the answer is either no or is a contrived, strecthed sort of case, as occurs here, then it probably doesn't belong. GassyGuy 23:45, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>It is quite a stretch to compare a permanent condition like amputation with "long hair" or "living in mansions" -- both of these are transitory states, and not a core physical disability, which is <i>always</i> employed by a fictional creator for a specific purpose. Just because a topic or list is relevant or important to you does not make it an invalid article. Would you make the same argument for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_with_visual_disabilities.html" title="List of people with visual disabilities">List_of_people_with_visual_disabilities</a>, which has a section of "Ancient, fictional, and mythological characters"?

However, I do make the same sort of case by case basis, and I was not saying that I attempted to find relevance to me - I was saying I attempted to find <i>a possible reasonable answer</i> - as in, something that could be relevant to people even if not me personally.

<li>I'm still not clear how you view a list of fictional characters with visual disabilities as different from a list of fictional amputees? You wrote, "My test is, after reading through the entries in the list..." that's a pretty clear personal discretionary method. The answer to "So what?", as I gave above, is that the motif of amputation is used for a specific purpose by authors; it is not an arbitrary or accidental trait in fiction.--<font size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 01:30, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The amputation of Captain Hook is similar to the amputation of Frodo Baggins which in turn was employed with a similar purpose as the amputation of Thomas Covenant? Sorry, perhaps you can help me with this one? GassyGuy 02:24, 15 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thank you for the question -- and if you'll allow me to expound on this rather interesting topic, I hope I can answer the "So what?" to your satisfaction. First to clarify: I wrote "amputation is used for a <i>specific</i> purpose" -- not "similar" purpose. The amputations of the characters you've mentioned are central to their characters and story development. <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Hook_ec40.html" title="Captain Hook">Captain Hook</a>'s amputation of his hand by Peter Pan, and the subsequent eating of his appendage by the Crocodile are the core axes of his character's arc: because of this, Hook is set on a vendetta against Peter, and is in turn hunted by the Croc (who found the taste of the hand delicious) -- both of which prove to be his undoing: hook is ultimately defeated by Peter and swallowed whole by the crocodile. In the case of <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frodo_Baggins_d8a3.html" title="Frodo Baggins">Frodo Baggins</a>, the amputation of his finger, by being bitten off by the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gollum.html" title="Gollum">Gollum</a>, is the climax to the entire course of the <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_of_the_Rings_293e.html" title="Lord of the Rings">Lord of the Rings</a> trilogy. It is only through this, that the One Ring is ultimately destroyed. Thereafter, he's called "Frodo of the Nine Fingers" in acknowledgement of his status. Finally, and just as critically, <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Covenant_1bb7.html" title="Thomas Covenant">Thomas Covenant</a> was actually created by Stephen Donaldson based on his father's description of experiences with leprosy in India. Covenant's leprosy is discovered after the amputation of his fingers, and becomes the central thread of his struggle to survive. In his first appearance in <i><a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Foul%27s_Bane_360e.html" title="Lord Foul's Bane">Lord_Foul's_Bane</a></i>, his amputation is what identifies him as the reincarnation of Berek Halfhand. You may be interested in reading an article from the April 2001 <i><a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Psychologist_e8af.html" title="American Psychologist">American Psychologist</a></i> journal, "Creative Cognition, Conceptual Combination, and the Creative Writing of Stephen R. Donaldson "<a href="http://educ.ubc.ca/courses/epse516/readings/oct19/stephen_donaldson.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://educ.ubc.ca/courses/epse516/readings/oct19/stephen_donaldson.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, which notes, <i>"To help himself to avoid the prospect of future amputations, Covenant has developed a rigid discipline of regularly surveying his extremities for injuries... The dynamic tension between the attractions of the fantasy world and Covenant's fear of neglecting the discipline that has kept him well sets the stage for a remarkably compelling story."</i>--<font size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 03:16, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Sorry, but when you'd said specific, I'd assumed that meant one specific purpose - so, in essence, if I read you correctly, your argument is that these people all have a purpose for having a missing appendage. I never said they didn't. In fact, I'm sorry you wrote all of these explanations, because I not only agree but already found those three amputations important to their respective stories. What I'm saying, however, is that that purpose isn't similar. I think that the missing appendage should be documented in each character's article because it is indeed important. What I am saying is that this list cannot demonstrate much because the purposes and portrayals are starkly different, so that this list, again, becomes a group of characters sharing an arbitrary characteristic. The characteristic is important enough to be documented in the character's articles, sure; but the memebrs of the list are related by any sort of encyclopaedic connection, just a common trait. GassyGuy 03:22, 15 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think you've just acknowledged why this is a notable list: that the amputations are an important part of the fictional characters. However, it's inaccurate to claim that it's an "arbitrary characteristic" -- as you've just pointed out yourself, it's not at all arbitrary. The choice by an author of making a character an amputee is a trait perhaps more significant even than being visual disability in fiction-- amputation becomes a critical element of change for most of the characters, whereas blindness in fictional characters is either inherent from the beginning or a motif of symbolic significance as an outcome for some wrongdoing (e.g. As in <a href="../../../o/e/d/Oedipus.html" title="Oedipus">Oedipus</a> and later fiction, eyes being plucked out is a popular theme).--<font size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup>Talk</sup></strong></font> 07:14, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>I think we must be arguing different things. I have never argued against the missing appendage being somehow significant to the character or story - I am saying that there is no actual encyclopedic connection among characters who have missing appendages. You yourself said that the authors' purposes are not similar, just that each individual case has a purpose. What you've given is a very good argument for why missing appendages should be detailed in the individual articles for these characters, and I agree. What I still don't see is any explanation how this list helps to elucidate on characters missing appendages rather than simply collects them indiscriminately. GassyGuy 08:17, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Perhaps you have a differing understanding of what an "indiscriminate list" is. There's no need for the authors to have exactly the same purpose in making certain characters disabled -- as you have already agreed, the use of amputation by an author is notable, in and of itself. That's what makes it encyclopedic. How is this list indiscriminate -- or any less descriminate than the hundreds of other <b><a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_fictional_things.html" title="Lists of fictional things">Lists_of_fictional_things</a></b> that make up Wikipedia? Perhaps you might apply the same metric to the dozen other articles in the category <b><a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_fictional_characters_by_medical_condition_dd6c.html" title="Category:Lists of fictional characters by medical condition">Lists of fictional characters by medical condition</a></b>?--<font size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 23:19, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Per Leflyman. This category is informative and i think it would have taken a lot of time to find all those amputee characters, its just as notbale as most of the other categories!

<li><b>Keep</b> I would have supported deletion with this made into a category, but having centralized information on what appendages are lost and how they were removed is useful. Someone researching disabilities in fiction might otherwise have to go to each wikipedia page in the category, and that's assuming such information is on each wikipedia page. Half of these entries don't even have wikipedia pages. This is more than just entries on a list.--<a href="../../../t/r/y/User%7ETrypsin_f14a.html" title="User:Trypsin">Trypsin</a> 10:07, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That name would be inaccurate. Not everybody on this list is an amputee. GassyGuy 00:07, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>True. Well, renaming optional then. Still keep, as this is a case where imo a list is better than a category. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 00:25, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm well aware of what amputation is. I also think Wicked is an awesome musical and can't recall any element of the plot that establishes Nessarose Thropp is an amputee. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe her lack of arms was not through amputation, but rather was because she was born without them. GassyGuy 01:44, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>P.S. I meant the novel in this case (though the musical was great too) and mistyped. Apologies for any potential confusion. GassyGuy 01:46, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Um, that single entry has been removed as a congenital birth defect -- although that's correct for the current title, but not the list of fictional amputees. Next?--<font size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 03:20, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Why would you remove that entry? What significance do you attribute to amputees somehow? It still doesn't serve a similar purpose within the story. While I repeatedly agree that the authors have a purpose, I maintain that there's no reason to group them when all of the purposes are dissimilar. I feel as if we're going over the same ground repeatedly and see no reason to do so, so I shan't be adding to this AfD anymore (I pretty much said everything I had to say days ago and have just been rephrasing myself since.) Anyway, at a glance I don't notice anyone else who wouldn't fit the amputee list, but I can't be bothered to study a list I think ought not exist in the first place.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Sometimes this is important, sometimes it's not. Sometimes the character is a cripple, sometimes it's just a distinguishing feature. Sometimes the character had the limb amputated in the story, sometimes it's backstory. Sometimes the character is legitimately limbless, sometimes the character has an equally-efficient replacement, sometimes the character has a superior replacement.<br />
In short, this hopelessly broad list covers so many dissimilar cases that it isn't illustrating a topic, but merely indiscriminately including anything with a single feature, like a (hypothetical) List of blue things. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 02:21, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
