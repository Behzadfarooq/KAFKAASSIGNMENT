<p>I am nominating all the articles in the "Category:Robot Wars competitors". They are all about individual contestant robots in Robot Wars (all, I think, are from the UK series), an undoubtedly notable TV programme. My contention, though, is that the robots themselves are no more notable than competitors in other game shows; ie unless they achieved significant fame outside of the framework of the show (eg <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Jennings_ed15.html" title="Ken Jennings">Ken Jennings</a>), they are not in themselves notable. None of them, as far as I know, is known to the average "man on the street", who had not watched the show; this is one acid test of their notability. I am sorry there are so many of them; if they are all deleted, obviously, I will nominate the category for deletion too. Most of the articles have not been touched for months; <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypno-Disc_4ee5.html" title="Hypno-Disc">Hypno-Disc</a>, one of the more complete articles, was last seriously edited in April and May. Most if not all have {{stub}}, {{wikify}}, {{verify}} and other such tags on them, again, many for many months. I can see a possibility of creating a Winners of Robot Wars UK article, with some content merged from the winners articles, but apart from that, I am not sure what a merge would achieve. Accordingly, I regretably (people have put a lot of effort into these articles, which, if I get my way, will in a sense have gone to waste) have to urge people to vote delete.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Will those supporting merge please specify exactly which articles should be merged ("most notable bots" is absolutely no help at all), otherwise, if I was closing the AfD and no-one seemed to have any idea which were worth merging, would be to delete them all and ask anyone who was genuinely interested in merging some of the articles to contact me to restore them into userspace. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 08:32, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

I am well aware that some people on wikipedia do not believe that robots deserve whole pages on wikipedia as they are not real characters and have no backgorund. If this tact is followed then it is consevable that all fictitious characters on wikipedia should be delted as they have no <i>real</i> background. so I urge you to save <i>all</i> these pages and the hard work that went in to them to be created.--<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucy-marie_ba99.html" title="User:Lucy-marie">Lucy-marie</a> 12:23, 19 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not sure that the slippery slope leads to the Robot Wars article itself. A TV program is notable and verifiable by more than just it's existence and people watching it. The component parts of a program may or may not be notable, in this case I and some other editors do not think they are notable enough for their own article but they might be notable enough to have a collated article. However, the slippery slope could easily lead to <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Francis_%28Robot_Wars%29_33ba.html" title="George Francis (Robot Wars)">George Francis (Robot Wars)</a>. The work so far is not currently wasted as it wouldn't be too hard to copy the information as it is now (prior to any deletion/merge) and take it to a new website or wiki. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 13:32, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep Some</b> some of the robots are signifcant and notable in robot battle competition while the rest of the also ran competitors can be merged into the appropriate Robot Wars or Battlebots article. -- <a href="../../../w/h/p/User%7EWhpq_e938.html" title="User:Whpq">Whpq</a> 13:38, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm hoping to do some major work to the Robot Wars articles on here over the summer, but I think the best option with the incredibly jumbled competitor articles is to <b>merge</b> Roadblock, Panic Attack, Chaos 2, Razer, Tornado and Typhoon 2 into Winners of Robot Wars UK, <b>merge</b> other definitely notable but perhaps less successful robots such as Hypno-Disc (first fly wheel weapon, second in series 4) and Diotoir (covered in fur - 'nuff said!) into another article (Notable Competitors on Robot Wars UK, perhaps) and to <b>delete</b> anything that remains, such as Derek. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECountdownCrispy_c3f0.html" title="User:CountdownCrispy">CountdownCrispy</a> 16:28, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> into Competitors on Robot Wars UK Afterwards, it is up to the editors of that page to determine which robots should remain, and which should be deleted. (Perhaps a table of all robots by series might be appropriate.) It might be necessary to create a couple of pages in the future, but for ease of closing this debate, I would suggest merging into a single page. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluap_751b.html" title="User:Bluap">Bluap</a> 18:02, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep some</b> - per Whpq. Also, these mass deletions are getting out of hand. There's a heck of lot of difference between <a href="../../../r/a/z/Razer_%28Robot%29_9547.html" title="Razer (Robot)">Razer</a> and <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychosprout.html" title="Psychosprout">Psychosprout</a>.--<a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENydas_f9e8.html" title="User:Nydas">Nydas</a> 18:37, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep all</b> until broken into smaller AfDs. The winners of the competitions are certainly notable, but I believe that some non-champions would also qualify. I really despise AfDs with a jillion articles nominated at the same time when it's very clearly obvious that the articles are different from each other and that some of the articles are much more notable than others. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 22:10, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>- If no clear concensus is reached on what to do with these pages, I think they should remain and should not be put back through this cycle again as they were when no concensus was reached last time.--<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucy-marie_ba99.html" title="User:Lucy-marie">Lucy-marie</a> 22:16, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Keep all, such a blanket deletion is not suitable in this case. Minor stuff should probably be merged into one article in any case, but this should be worked out on talk pages, not AFD. <a href="../../../z/o/n/User%7EZoney_0cf9.html" title="User:Zoney"><b>zoney</b></a> <span style="color:green; font-size:larger">♣</span> <a href="../../../z/o/n/User_talk%7EZoney_bef0.html" title="User talk:Zoney"><b>talk</b></a> 20:37, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> to Competitors on Robot Wars UK. They cannot really be considered ficticious characters as the robots were the cummulation many hours work by engineers and enthusiasts to take part in a nationally know competition that did give a degree of recognition in their field. Deletion would be to belittle the hard work of a competitor. Their name and acheivement/final ranking should be recorded and also links to the builders site (if they have one), but just one page should be sufficiant. The round by round ranking is probably unnessecary. Also, if it is copied&amp;pasted from a fansite, does that not have potential copyright/attributation implications? <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevinCarmody_2db4.html" title="User:KevinCarmody">KevinCarmody</a> 02:20, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep Some, merge others</b>. I figured this would happen. I reccomend the champions be kept in their own articles, but lots of others could be merged into a few lists (i.e. List of Robot Wars Finalists, List of Robot Wars Semi-Finalists) <a href="../../../l/e/n/User%7ELenin_%26_McCarthy_7656.html" title="User:Lenin &amp; McCarthy">Lenin &amp; McCarthy</a> 16:39, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
