<p>The setting mainly takes place in Jimithy City. But there is also space (Episode 2), The Liazrad lair (Episodes 3 and 4) located on Mt. Everest, and the North Poll(Episode 3).

<p>The series uses Pok√©mon jokes in the last 2 cartoons. In Episode 4, they used the same gag 2 times in a row, and it took the viewer to a Pok√©mon Slave Mine where they all die. In The Movie, The Pok√©ball Head Guy is probably a joke.</p>

<p>They were a few Liazrad Man cartoons called Liazrad Man Emails, which are like Strong Bad Emails on Homestar Runner. The first question was about it being like them. Many funny questions like what if you were in Halo? and it ended with,"I don't fit into Halo, but Scooby-Doo does!", and it shows a picture of a kid's meal toy Scooby in a Halo screenshot.</p>

<p>Resident Evil 1.5(originally meant to be Resident Evil 2) was set a month and a day after the events of the original Redident Evil. 'The Highly skilled S.T.A.R.S unit disovered a Bio-Weapon on the outskirts of Raccoon City, leaving the area. Many of the citizens were recovering from what they dubbed the 'Umbrella Incident' however, there was a minor rash spreading across the city...</p>

<p>Interestingly enough most of the locations and characters from the Resdient Evil 2 released are present in the beta version(Bar Elza or Eliza walker and the more modern R.P.D).</p>
<p>Leon Kennedy: Just like the released version a rookie cop(but not a newbie) reatins much of his naive nature</p>
<p>Elza(Eliza) Walker: A moto-cross daredevil trying to get a degree, interestingly Claire Redfield(who took her place) retains all of Elzas personality hair style and clothing, she even rides a motorbike like Claire</p>
<p>Ada Wong: Rather than a spy, she was an umbrella researcher(hinted in Resident Evil 1), it is unknown wether she would develop a romantic relationship with Leon</p>
<p>The Birkins: Rather than William, Sherry and Annette being related to the umbrella corporation(via researchers for William and Annette) they were a group of shell shocked survivors, with Sherry travilling with Elza</p>
<p>Kendo: In the beta version more than the guy who gets eaten he travelled with Elza during the game</p>
<p>Marvin Brannagh: He also does not die, he travlles with Leon through the game</p>
<p>The Game appeared to be very modern despite the graphics, ther was no gender division between firearms including two kinds of handgun, an assualy rifle, shotgun, magnum, flame thrower and was sugeested that grenades would make it into the final version. The player also travlled with a group, any of the group dying would affect the game(with a possibility for multiple endings).</p>

Stephen Street, was established in April 1837 as one of the 8 north/south streets on Robert Hoddle's original survey of Melbourne. It was situated between Russell Street to the west and Spring Street to the east.</p>
<p>Garryowen surmises a few years after its naming that "Stephen Street is a tribute to a permanent under-secretary of state for the colonies." <a href="http://www.whitehat.com.au/Melbourne/History/StreetNames.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.whitehat.com.au/Melbourne/History/StreetNames.asp" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>It is suggested that it was named after Sir James Stephen, the Permanent Underdersecretary of State in London who was at the peak of his power within the Colonial Office at the time of the naming of the streets of Hoddles Grid. <a href="http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A020439b.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A020439b.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> Alternatively, it could have been named after his father of the same name who die in 1832 after a distinguished career in the service of England.</p>
<p>Stephen Street, was renamed Exhibition Street to celebrate the 1880 International Exhibition and the 1888 Centenial Exhibition held at the Royal Exhibition Buildings during the 1880's Boom times of 'Marvellous Melbourne'. Its name was officially changed by the Nelbourne City Council on 5 December 1898.<a href="http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=53&amp;pg=729" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=53&amp;pg=729" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>The Exhibition Buildings are not actually on Exhibition Street, instead, the Western Entrance faces Rathdown Street, Carlton which is a continuation of Exhibition Street.</p>

<p><b>Biografie</b></p>
<p>De Rotterdamse groep DuvelDuvel ontstond zo rond 1997. Het drietal opereerde vanuit hun hoofdkwartier "de Aperotz" en was eerst voornamelijk actief in het Engels, bij vorming van de formatie DuvelDuvel begonnen ze voor het eerst in het Nederlands te rappen. Daarnaast produceren de heren van DuvelDuvel ook beats, dat zowel voor eigen materiaal wordt gebruikt, als voor andere artiesten. Samen met de andere Nederlandstalige hiphopformatie Opgezwolle, vormen ze de groep Opgeduveld, dat in 2002 het album 'Opgeduveld' heeft uitgebracht.</p>
<p>In 2005 is Rein De Vos om onbekende redenen op non-actief in de groep gezet. In oktober 2006 maakte het label TopNotch en DuvelDuvel zelf op hun website bekend dat de groep DuvelDuvel ermee gestopt is. Echter zijn de redenen hiervoor niet bekend. Wel is bekend dat het langverwachte album van Opgeduveld, genaamd "2" niet zal worden uitgebracht. Het is niet bekend wat de leden Duvel en Supah nu verder gaan doen. Rein vormt samen met Kastro de Kraai en Dave de das de hiphopformatie Audio Elixer.</p>

<p>Most Latin verbs are regular (meaning they follow the general pattern). The verb ending changes according to the person (I, you, he, she, it, we, you, they) and the tense. A verb does not need the person stated to keep its meaning. eg. rather than saying "ego porto (I carry)" you would use, simply "porto"</p>
<p><b>Present Tense</b></p>
<table class="wikitable">

</table>
<p>The letter that comes before "re" (normally "a", "e" or "i")in the infinative of the verb is added before the endings listed above.</p>
<p>Example: portare (infinative)</p>
<pre>
        porto- I carry
        portas- You carry (singular)
        portat- He, she or it carries

<p><br />
Kevin "The Baptist" Murray is a little known Scottish phenomenon who it is claimed possesses miraculous, magical powers.</p>
<p>He is by no means a Holy Man or even a religious man, but his powers have led to him being nicknamed 'The Baptist' after a certain incident. The incident in question happened sometime in 2006. When at a social gathering a reveller took ill, The Baptist cupped water in his hads and allowed the victim to drink deeply, Splashing a little on his face. Almost instantenously the illness of the victim vanished And he felt great and was able to carry-on with the celebration of the night.</p>
<p>Again in 2006, he was seen to allow an unacceptable container to hold far more liquid than should have been possible, with only the application of his right index finger.</p>
<p>Most notable of his powers though are his powers of ordaining temporary bad luck on an individual of his choice, known as a hex or a <b>jinx</b>[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinx|Jinx" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinx|Jinx" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>] Witnessed by many people, The Baptist is seen to make a gesture of his hand and muttering some words in a low gutteral chanting and the individual is plagued by a temporary bout of bad luck. This works mostly in competitive circumstances where the opposition has been a <i>"jammy git"</i> and deserves the wrath of The Baptist.</p>
<p>Nobody knows where his powers come from, but many theories have been derived. Foremost amongst these theories is that on a visit to Kashmir, a younger Kevin Murray stumbled upon the tomb of a Holy Man known as <b>Yus Asaf</b>[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_in_Kashmir|" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_in_Kashmir|" rel="nofollow">Yus Asaf</a>]. Upon inspection of the shrine he found a single die (or dice) on a neck-rope and took it with him. Upon putting on this makeshift medallion his powers came to him. This can not be 100% confirmed or denied, but The Baptist is regualrly seen sporting a necklace fitting this description which he regularly uses to <i>"roll the dice one last time"</i></p>
<p>Another, less popular myth is that upon a visit to Oak Island, The baptist accidentally discovered the entrance to the legendary <b>Money Pit</b>[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Island_Money_Pit|" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Island_Money_Pit|" rel="nofollow">Money Pit</a>] and somehow is now ordained with a secret power it was holding. This may explain the apparent impossibility of entering said Money Pit.</p>
<p>Many other theories have arisen: He is the second coming of Christ, he is the descendant of Christ, the Sang Real of Templar legend, or simply that he makes the whole thing up.</p>
<p>Needless to say, his powers are growing. A recent addition to his impressive repertoire is reported to be some sort of mystical head garment, looking like a ten gallon hat or stetson giving him great powers of perception and foresight. Reports that he uses this to regularly win high-stakes poker matches are unestablished.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason behind his powers, real or not, The Baptist is definitely a living Scottish legend and as one report says <i>"a helluva guy"</i></p>

<p>Leisters are an imaginary ethnic group that is endowed with magical powers. This group is found in the book "A History of the Vikkan Empire". In this stories it explores the imaginary world ruled by another ethnic group the Vikkans. Vikkans are another group endowed with magical powers. Vikkans and Leisters are mortal enemies. They routinely kill each other purely for their own entertainment. The Leister's were the first group to live in the area which comprises the main part of the Vikkan empire. The Vikkans moved from Southern Colorado and into Wyoming. All the while expanding their empire. The Leisters are a very purist race. They kill anyone who is not full Leister. Also the Vikkan rulers have enacted laws making interracial unions illegal. The Leisters currently live mainly in the Wunschland, but some have moved on into Arabithia. The Leisters every so often will try and force an uprising to unseat the ruling matriachal dynasty that has ben ruling over a thousand years. The current Empress of the Vikkan empire is Danika Flemming and her husband Dante Flemming. Do to some earlier interracial marriages the royal bloodline is not pure Vikkan, but has a combination of Nederlander, Cannaster, Leister, and Brussels blood. Leister is also an imaginary land in the short story "Das Madchen"</p>

<p>Magnant is an <a href="../../../r/t/s/RTS_2436.html" title="RTS">RTS</a> which features the military expansion of a colony of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Ants.html" title="Ants">ants</a>; since the main objective of the game is to destroy all enemy colonies.</p>
<p><b>Card System</b></p>
<p>There is a card system which permits the player to draw cards during the game which can bring diverse bonuses to the colony; to obtain these cards, the player can exchange points gained during matches for 3 copies of one type of card. The player can also trade these cards with other Magnant players at the Magnant official website and also steal or gain a card from the defeated opponent‚Äôs deck, as well as loose a card when having been defeated.</p>
<p><b>Corresponding Category</b></p>
<p>Magnant enters properly in the <a href="../../../r/t/s/RTS_2436.html" title="RTS">RTS</a> category and is somehow considered as an ant simulation video game; it is not considered completely an ant simulation video game because it concentrates on many unrealistic features, such as: Ants carrying weapons, ants employing siege machinery such as <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catapults.html" title="Catapults">catapults</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/l/Ballistics.html" title="Ballistics">ballistics</a>, etc. which were common in the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_ages.html" title="Middle ages">middle ages</a> and in <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_times.html" title="Ancient times">ancient times</a> of <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human.html" title="Human">human</a> <a href="../../../h/i/s/History.html" title="History">history</a>.</p>

<p>Roberta Baskin has been an investigative reporter, senior producer, and executive director.</p>
<p>For years, Baskin was an investigative journalist working for CBS. She eventually left after she encountered fierce resistance to re-air her story on Nike's labor practices in Vietnam. After shortley working as a senior producer for ABC 20/20, and a reporter for NOW with Bill Moyers, Roberta Baskin took over the reins of the Center for Public Integrity in January 2005 from founder Charles Lewis, whose leadership laid the groundwork for a new kind of non-partisan, not-for-profit watchdog journalism. Baskin is building on Lewis' foundation, forging a strategy that will take the Center's unique and important investigative work to new and wider audiences.</p>
<p>In her long journalism career, Baskin has won 75 journalism awards, including two duPont-Columbia University Awards and two George Foster Peabody Awards for her investigative reporting. Most recently she was senior Washington correspondent for Now with Bill Moyers, where she reported primarily on money and influence peddling in the federal government. Previously, as senior producer for the ABC news magazine 20/20 Baskin directed all of the program's consumer investigative reports. She also managed the Washington Bureau staff of 20/20 and Primetime, supervising producers, correspondents, editors and photographers. Baskin joined ABC from CBS News, where she was chief investigative correspondent for the news magazine 48 Hours and contributed special reports to the CBS Evening News. She began her journalism career as an investigative reporter on local news in Chicago and Washington, D.C., where her investigations led to changes in state and federal laws, business practices and public policy.</p>
<p>Baskin has been honored with a Nieman Fellowship at Harvard University and an Ethics Fellowship at the Poynter Institute in 2002.

<p>Erp27 is an ER located protein; it has two domains similar to the non-catalytic domains of PDI. It has been shown recently that ERp27 interacts with Erp57 in a similar manner as that of ERp57-Calreticulin interactions. The functional significance of ERp27 and ERp57interaction remains to be established.</p>

He donated 3,015 acres to the city of Los Angeles which became <a href="../../../g/r/i/Griffith_Park_9dc6.html" title="Griffith Park">Griffith Park</a>, he donated the money to build the park's Greek Theater and <a href="../../../g/r/i/Griffith_Observatory_ad8c.html" title="Griffith Observatory">Griffith Observatory</a>.</p>

Griffith only served two years in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Quentin_af9b.html" title="San Quentin">San Quentin</a> likely due to the fact that his defense team was lead by the ex-governor of California.</p>
<p>In 1912 he offered to donate $100,000 to the city of Los Angeles to build an observatory, however the city refused the offer responded, in part "On behalf of the rising generation of girls and boys, we protest against the acceptance of this bribe . . . This community is neither so poor nor so lost to sense of public decency that it can afford to accept this money.". However several years after his death the city did accept the offer.</p>

<p>The harsh, aggressive, metallic tone of Dog Day Sunrise's music is emblematic of the band's honest and independent attitude. A musical recipe of 2 decades of life and pain, combined with their individual influences in many genres of music to create a tasty dish that is addictive for many of today's heavy music fans. This must see band, combines intelligent lyrics, heavy melodic guitar, and a massive rhythm backbone to achieve a ground breaking sound that proves to hold it's own in the industry today.</p>
<p>Dog Day Sunrise was originally formed as a power-trio in 1996. A year later, 1997 saw the first glimpse of what this group had to offer in the form of their first studio recorded "Demo", a cassette comprised of 3 of their original songs. 1,000 copies of this "Demo" had been pressed, and within two weeks of its release, every copy had been sold. From 1997 to 2000 Dog Day Sunrise concentrated on live performances over the North East as well as new material for their first full-length release entitled "Chemical Carnival" (Currently there are over 12,000 copies of the record independently distributed in the US). With their music and reputation spreading rapidly, Dog Day Sunrise was becoming a household name for heavy music fans.</p>
<p>In Dec. of 2002 Dog Day Sunrise hit the studio with legendary recording producer Alex Perialas (Metallica, Anthrax, Testament, Violence, and many others), at Pyramid Studios in New York to record their second full-length release Seasons That Suffer. Currently the band is supporting the record with live performances, online exposure, and radio play covering many of the North-Eastern US states.</p>
<p>Dog Day Sunrise has toured extensively in about 10 states and has shared the stage with such national acts as Fuel, Dope, Dog Fashion Disco, Raging Slab, LA Guns, Bang Tango, Joan Jett, Jackyl, Blue Oyster Cult, Survivor, Eddy Money, along with many others. 2003 promises to add to this growing list of national exposure.</p>
<p>Dog Day Sunrise has gathered an enormous fan base over the years with an online street team of over 8,000 members and proves to be growing daily. The band plans to continue touring the north east this year and will begin working on showcasing to labels at the beginning of summer 2003. With their newest singles 'Outtayermind', 'Loneliest Day', and 'Wrench' climbing the local and regional charts, D.D.S is ready to graduate from regional performances to the national scene.</p>

A <b>marriage by proxy</b>, or <b>proxy marriage</b>, is one in which a third person physically stands in for an absent party in the marriage. Thereby, either the bride or the groom is not present at the ceremony.</p>
<p>Many countries do not carry out or recognize marriages by proxy, and currently in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, they may only be carried out in four states: <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colorado.html" title="Colorado">Colorado</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montana.html" title="Montana">Montana</a>, often limited to armed forces posted overseas.</p>

<p>Hriste Boze raspeti i sveti, Srpska zemlja kroz oblake leti.</p>
<p>Leti preko nebeskih visina, Krila su joj Morava i Drina</p>
<p>Na tri sveto i na tri sastavno, Odlazimo na Kosovo ravno.</p>
<p>Odlazimo na sudjeno mesto Mila majko, sestro i nevesto.</p>
<p>Zbogom leto, jeseni i zimo. Odlazimo da ih pobedimo.</p>
<p>Zbogom prvi nerodjeni sine, Zbogom ruzo, zbogom ruzmarine.</p>
<p>Kad je draga da odlazim cula, Za rever mi neven zadenula.</p>
<p>Hriste Boze raspeti i sveti, Sva Srbija na Kosovo leti.</p>
<p>Hriste dragi raspeti i sveti, Sva Srbija na Kosovo leti.</p>
