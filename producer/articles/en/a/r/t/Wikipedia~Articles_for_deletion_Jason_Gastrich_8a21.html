<p>Gastrich, or one of his supporters clearly wrote the original entry... Cut down, emasculated, and with a healthy dose of scepticism added I think it's worth leaving a page here on him if only to provide a voice that counters the enormous spin-machine that he runs through his ministry... He's clearly an important figure in North American fundamentalism which sadly twists real Christian teaching and attitudes through power abuse, ignorance, manipulation and personal ambition... I'm sorry... from the tone of the original article, Gastrich is clearly no different... so if he wants a presence in wikipedia, so be it, and let the article 'testify' to that...</p>

<p>This is simply a vanity page, as far as I can see. The level of debate he has managed to stir up is actually quite limited, and his "debating" with Usenet and other users is not particularly erudite. He has been as guilty of mis-representation as some of the tele-evangelists referenced below, often quoting at length arguments made by other creationists that have been thoroughly discredited, often years ago.</p>
<p>If Mr Gastrich deserves a Wikepedia article about himself, then I am afraid that the whole resource may as well degenerate into a free-for-all of vanity articles and ego-massaging entries.</p>
<p>Please delete this article.</p>

<p>While it is true that Jason is still at a fairly early stage in his life and career for God, he already has managed to stir up so much discussion and debate about the Christian faith in the net, running one of the most visited Christian resources, and facilitating online work for many other Christians, as well as actively debating the most zealous and high profile atheists of America in Usenet and Bulletin Board discussions, so that he has actually become very high profile among them.</p>
<p>There exists a sizeable campaign among them to shut his mouth and make him look bad, and they usually use their overwhelming number on their forums to flood out his posts with bad posts about him, which actually in my view have no serious substance other than to serve as an excuse not to listen to the Message.</p>
<p>The existence of a few regrettable frauds in the tele-evangelists have enabled people to paint even sincere people in the worst possible colours, and they have been leveraging this to the hilt in defaming Gastrich, who is innocent of the matters they alledge and insinuate against him.</p>
<p>The existence of an officially sanctioned by Jason article about him on a resource of authority like Wikipedia would be a useful way to offer a balanced view about him, and would not detract from the quality and authority of this online encyclopedia. On the contrary, it would enhance it.</p>

<li>No, Davey, there is no "so much discussion" nor "most visited site" nor "sizeable campagin" nor any such thing involved. It's a relatively minor sideshow in the online world. Nothing to get excited about. Face it, if Gastrich were of any real significance, he and his merry band of sycophants wouldn't have to try to wedge a vanity page into the Wikipedia. Fact is, this system is not meant for self-promotion. You can whine about "persecution" all you want but there exist page after page after page here explaining what the Wikipedia is for and how it works. Deliberately breaking the rules then whining "Help! Help! I'm being oppressed!" only makes you look foolish. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkkbilbo_8d0f.html" title="User:Markkbilbo">Mark K.

<li><b>Delete</b> Though at an early stage in his "career for God," the only reason this "evangelist" has "managed to stir up so much discussion," which is mostly *not* about the Christian faith, is because of his underhanded and dishonest tactics as well as his methods of self-promotion. This "officially sanctioned" article does nothing more than repeat a number of his own self-aggrandizing claims. Like most such articles, it leaves more questions unanswered than answered.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>This Entry Should Stay</b>. Duncharris is biased and has been against Gastrich for some time. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Skeptic%27s_Annotated_Bible&amp;action=history" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Skeptic%27s_Annotated_Bible&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Skeptic%27s_Annotated_Bible&amp;action=history</a> where he edited the entry so that someone wouldn't create a page for Gastrich (and he also made a negative comment about Gastrich in the attributions, indicating a personal bias against him).
<p>The Jason Gastrich entry is informative and he is notable as an author of several books, former gubernatorial candidate, college professor, etc. He is also mentioned and linked on several other Wikipedia pages. See:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gastrich complains about bias in others, but would pretend that he has no bias. People are biased against him because of his actions and tactics, and the issues about an encyclopedia entry are just more examples of Gastrich's arrogance. Gastrich is not notable and did not author "several" books. There are two of record, one of them in three editions. Of those, both are amateurish, self-published, and self-promoted (just as all of this is about selling those books). He is not a "college professor." Having taught at a tech/trade college in undergraduate courses, assuming that's even true, does not make one a "college professor." His run for Governor of California was a joke. He got 11 votes, despite a fairly vigorous campaign. He couldn't even get the support of his local churches and fellow Christians, and that was so infuriating to him that he issued a press release, whining about it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On the Internet Infidels Discussion Board, Gastrich has had several debates. IIDB's top <a href="http://www.iidb.org/vbb/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;f=17&amp;page=1&amp;pp=25&amp;sort=views&amp;order=desc&amp;daysprune=-1" class="external text" title="http://www.iidb.org/vbb/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;f=17&amp;page=1&amp;pp=25&amp;sort=views&amp;order=desc&amp;daysprune=-1" rel="nofollow">two most popular debates</a> of all time belong to Gastrich. They've been read tens of thousands of times and so has the <a href="http://www.iidb.org/vbb/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;f=59&amp;page=1&amp;pp=25&amp;sort=views&amp;order=desc&amp;daysprune=-1" class="external text" title="http://www.iidb.org/vbb/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;f=59&amp;page=1&amp;pp=25&amp;sort=views&amp;order=desc&amp;daysprune=-1" rel="nofollow">commentary thread</a>(also most popular of all time). Among the commentary threads and debate threads, there are well over 60,000 reads; more than any other member or debater or thread.
<ul>
<li>It should be kept in mind that part of the reason for this is Gastrich arrogance, and the general desire among the readers to see Gastrich properly roasted in these debates, which is, of course, exactly what happened.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On the Infidel Guy forum, <a href="http://www.infidelguy.com/forum-31.html" class="external text" title="http://www.infidelguy.com/forum-31.html" rel="nofollow">Gastrich's debate</a> is also the most popular of all time. And so is its <a href="http://www.infidelguy.com/forum-37.html" class="external text" title="http://www.infidelguy.com/forum-37.html" rel="nofollow">commentary thread</a> with tens of thousands of reads.
<ul>
<li>I don't know how the "debate" was determined to "the most popular of all time." It was fairly universally panned, with neither participant gaining much in the way of praise, and it's said that Gastrich charged (and, amazingly, was paid) $1,000 for his "performance." Gastrich's arguments, as usual, were eviscerated in the "Peanut Gallery" and Gastrich, himself, was unable to answer many pertinent questions about his position and about things related to him. If this was a "popular" debate, it was because there is some satisfaction in seeing one such as Gastrich humbled.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This certainly isn't a vanity page and even if Gastrich is a nutjob, that isn't reason to remove this entry. I'm not an admin, but I vote to keep it. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Daddy_576d.html" title="User:Big Daddy">Big Daddy</a> 11:20, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Big Daddy is Jason Gastrich, so it's disingenuous, but common, for Gastrich to refer to himself as we see above, just as it's quite normal for Gastrich to take on a name like "Big Daddy" and refer to himself in the third person. Wiki does not keep articles by every narcissist that comes down the pike, and Gastrich should be no different. <b>DELETE</b></li>

<li>Gastrich teaching college courses at Coleman College (a nationally accredited technical school) in Psychology and Sociology is not new information.

<ul>
<li>Coleman College is a small trade/tech college near San Diego, and teaching classes there does not make one a "professor." Usually the granting of the title, "Professor," has a specific criteria and meaning. Gastrich has always been impressed with the use of titles--"Doctor," "Professor," "counselor," and so on, even when he hasn't really earned the right to use those titles.</li>

<li>Yes, there are more positive reviews, many clearly written by Gastrich. However, anyone who bothers to give the issue any thought can see that the negative reviews are clearly the more objective and substantial, and so have the most value. Even many Christians have steered clear of Gastrich and his controversies, and of those who comment, most find is methods offensive.</li>

<li>I don't think we will have any trouble turning the article into something more objective and honest, should it be retained. There's a lot of information on the web and in Usenet about Jason Gastrich and even from stuff written BY him. We can draw on that. Encyclopedia articles are not about promotion, and if they are written about personalities, they include the warts and controversies that Gastrich clearly wants to avoid. If the article is kept, it should include those. Otherwise, it is just a vanity piece.</li>

<li>That's true. Gastrich has attempted to use the legal system to shut down critics, at least once through a frivolous lawsuit, and when it came to court, Gastrich couldn't even be bothered to show up! And Ralph...I know what you're saying about "free speech," and no one is denying Gastrich free speech, but encyclopedias are not about free speech, they are about information, and that means all the information that is pertinent, not just what the subject of the article would like you to know.</li>

However, before he tampered with it, it did resemble other Wiki entries on authors, evangelists, professors, etc.--<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Daddy_576d.html" title="User:Big Daddy">Big Daddy</a> 22:45, 19 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Actually, Jason, what it looked like was an advertising and promotion piece for your ministry and yourself. Can you imagine an article about Peter Popoff that didn't include his exposure as a fraud, or one about Jimmy Swaggart that did not include his famous "I have sinned" speech after being caught with prostitutes? An encyclopedia entry is not one that must needs be limited to whatever the subject wants others to see. Sometimes, it has to include things that the subject may wish to have hidden.</li>
<li>Jason, I notice you want us to believe that you have a degree in psychology, but <a href="http://www.jasongastrich.com/personal.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.jasongastrich.com/personal.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>, on your campaign site, you tell us that your degree is in "Liberal Arts and Sciences (Psychology)," which tells me that the degree is not in psych, but in a more general area, and you probably took quite a few courses in psych, just not enough to get a degree in it. You do understand the difference, don't you?</li>
