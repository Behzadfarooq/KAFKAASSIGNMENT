<p>This vanity article's <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Bellevue_West_High_School_65ae.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Bellevue West High School">last vfd</a> was closed with a result of merge. A sockpuppet banned from VfD refused to accept consensus, and reverted the closing redirect against several editors, adding trivia less notable than my proverbial pet fish to the article as he went. The article is currently protected in a disgusting display of biased inclusionism, three minutes after the protecting admin reverted it to the non-consensus version. While I admit this vfd is probably futile, as the schoolwatch trolls will flock to it like sheep, the article should still be <b>deleted</b> as utterly non-notable. —<a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorath_83d6.html" title="User:Korath">Korath</a> (<a href="../../../k/o/r/User_talk%7EKorath_cda5.html" title="User talk:Korath">Talk</a>) 07:13, May 25, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a shame that the lister included an attack on those who think that schools should be in Wikipedia. Wikipedia would not get far if we all engaged in such behavior. I've looked at the local school district article, <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bellevue_Public_Schools_bfef.html" title="Bellevue Public Schools">Bellevue Public Schools</a>, and I don't think a merge would be suitable in this case.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm also concerned at the lister's misinterpretation of the result of the last VfD.

I sometimes do this myself but, to avoid this kind of misinterpretation I always carry out the editing after closing and as a separate edit. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 23:31, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The lister also writes: "<i>The article is currently protected in a disgusting display of biased inclusionism, three minutes after the protecting admin reverted it to the non-consensus version</i>"</li>
<li>Actually that was me protecting the article which I'd been told was subject to a revert war. When I got there there was indeed a very silly revert war in progress. I protected <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/The_Wrong_Version" class="extiw" title="m:The_Wrong_Version">The Wrong Version</a>, as is my privilege, because of a perception, which I think was quite correct, that an attempt was being made to enforce a merge without consensus. Four people up to that point had tried to get it back to an article and four people had tried to get it back to a redirect. That just doesn't happen when there is a consensus. I made a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Bellevue_West_High_School&amp;diff=13862836&amp;oldid=13860495" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Bellevue_West_High_School&amp;diff=13862836&amp;oldid=13860495" rel="nofollow">rather exasperated note</a> about the whole silly thing on the talk page at the time. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 23:37, 25 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Capitalist, I greatly respect the cleanup work you do, but I don't think it's reasonable to expect much improvement in this article. It's on its second trip through VfD, and its already got about 60 edits (of that total GRider has made about 20 and Tony about 5). It is what it is. Notable Alumni have been doubled by including a college volleyball player to go along with the original notable alumnus, Mr Biggs, a radio DJ. I guess some people might consider that an improvement. For some reason WP doesn't yet have an article on their cross-town rival, Bellevue East High School. It isn't even a redlink in the article, although Mr Biggs is. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 05:05, 26 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Possibly not but it might be useful feedback given that it is likely that we will end up with a hung vote on this school and the school will probably remain.<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 05:41, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well, personally I don't find either of the alumni listed to be notable. The quality of an article can't be measured by number of edits and length, otherwise a rambling 30 paragraph long article of asides and irrelevency would be viewed as better than a one paragraph straight to the point article. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 18:13, 26 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Aaaaargh</b>. Can we get a moratorium on school VfDs? I'm as big an opponent of schoolcruft as most of the delete voters here, but this is just getting silly.

<ul>
<li>Delete: It's a school. It has students. The same could be said about the local donut shop. Why is this particular school needed in an encyclopedia? As for the desired moratorium on votes, I hate to be cynical, but this is the way I look at it: school votes end up with half and half (unless the valiant warriors of Schoolwatch get clued in, and then a dozen "OMG KEEEP!!!! Schools must never be deleted ever ever ever you trolls! Start an RfC on the nominator!" votes show up, and then it's about 60/40. True. However, the policy proposal can end no other way than a similar knot. Not to vote until a definitive conclusion to the policy discussion is, de facto, to vote "keep" on all and to welcome more stunningly profound entries as "Lincoln School is an elementary school in New Jersey" to the encyclopedia. I should rather say that a moratorium could be observed <i>after</i> a policy consensus is reached. Until then, these nasty fights will continue, with people acting entirely irrationally and hating each other over the absurd issue of meaningless stubs staying or going. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 03:42, 26 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh I say, it's really not a hating matter, is it? A number of people make hopeless, doomed VfD listings and they fail to reach consensus (or, increasingly often, end up with a straight majority to keep). That's the beginnning and the end of it. None of us need hate or be hated, I should hope. It's just a difference of opinion. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 07:22, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Unless some well known people have graduated from the school, or there was some notable contreversy surrounding the school, or the school had a unique or ground-breaking program of some sort.

The latter school was the first school in Nebraska, and claims Peter Fonda among its allumni. It's possible there's something notable about Bellevue West, but I can't tell that there is from the article, and I'm sure Nebraska has hundreds of other high schools which are just as un-noteworthy, so let the fun begin~! --<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 06:24, 26 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wikipedia is not a general knowledge base, that is, it is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information.

<ul>
<li>If you go to the donations page you will see that the mission statement set out by Jimbo states that we are gathering the "sum of all human knowledge," I see no reason this excludes high schools. Wikipedia is not a directory so hundreds of lists of scientists by publication would probably not belong here. Personally I feel prose is a requirement for an article and if a list of publications is the only information that is verifiable it would be best to move such pages to another Wikiproject. That said if someone started creating such pages more than likley they would be kept, most published professors survive VfD. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 14:42, May 27, 2005 (UTC)</li>
