<dd>Just to further clarify, the last thing I ever want to do is bite newcomers and I have no idea if that is applicable to this nom. I was responding to a direct comment addressed to me. However, while the nomination would seem to be perfectly legimate based on the voting, I continue to feel that AfD (not just schools but any topic) is rarely the best approach. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 03:55, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think the main issue still falls back to, <i>*cringe*</i>, the "bar of notability," of which there's no definitive consensus. "And if you had any legitimate concerns" (i.e., his concerns of notability) is what came off as hostile to me, though I know you're civil and a good faith user. Don't worry about it. -<a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebelguys2_63db.html" title="User:Rebelguys2">Rebelguys2</a> 04:07, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>An attitude like "Better wikipedia articles through confrontation?" is why I do my very best to avoid making improvements to articles as a response to AFDs.
