The Waterhouse Stop was an early form of controlling the entry of light into a camera. Commonly a thin piece of metal is drilled with a series of holes corresponding to what today we call f/stops or f/numbers. Alternatively a number of pieces of metal would be drilled with various sized holes. It was also used in photographic enlargers in the darkroom.</p>
<p>It is a way today of obtaining a smaller aperture than the lens maker has provided when wanting extreme depth of field such as a pinhole camera provides.</p>

Laya Raki ( born Brunhilde Jörns on July 27, 1927 in Hamburg,Germany), the dancer with the singular erotic radiation and adored film actress in the Germany of the 1950s and early 60s, became also an international star for her roles in English films and TV productions.</p>
<p><b>Biography</b></p>
<p>The black - haired daughter of the acrobat Maria Althoff and the partner acrobat and clown Wilhelm Jörns attracted the attention for the first time in 1947 – 1950, when she danced in the nightclubs of Frankfurt (Frankfort) and other German cities. In 1950 she performed in Berlin. Her perfect figure (with the measurements of 38-23-36) became the talk of the town and her star began to rise.</p>
<p>The film company DEFA engaged her for a role as a dancer in the famous film Der Rat der Götter (The Council of the Gods), which won two awards. The Berliner Morgenpost wrote about her enthusiastically that she`s a really great dancer with an expressive face rich in nuances. In the same year the press department of the Realfilm presented her as a new discovery for Die Dritte von rechts (The third from the Right), a rather boring dance film, with a highlight, being the scene in which the scantily clad dancer Laya Raki exposes to the lustful gazes of the male cinema audience. In 1953 she also danced in the film Ehe für eine Nacht (Marriage for One Night). The next film was Die Rose von Stambul (The Rose of Stamboul), where the great Austrian actor Paul Hörbiger wants to marry her when seeing her dancing. In Roter Mohn (Red Poppy) she played the ardently dancing gipsy girl Ilonka who also conducted amusing dialogs with the famous Viennese comic actor Hans Moser.</p>
<p>In 1954 a swindler promised her film roles in England and even in Hollywood and succeeded in luring her to London, where she was without means – but only for a short time. Fortunately that made headlines. The Arthur Rank Film Company, which needed a slightly exotic type for a film in New Zealand, received her with open arms. In The Seekers she played convincing the Maori chieftain`s seductive wife. The film caused a worldwide stir by showing her with naked breasts, 10 years before Rudi Gernreich invented the first topless swimsuit. Other interesting film roles waited for her, for example in Up to His Neck. Finally she advanced to be a topstar in English TV productions. In the 39 episodes of the popular English TV show Crane (from 1963 - 1965) she played the Arabic girl Halima.</p>
<p>The light clad Laya Raki captured the men`s attention like nearly no other German show- or glamourgirl in the fifties. It was her speciality to exhibit her feminine charms. The sought after pin-up girl posed for wonderful filmpostcards and lots of magazines all over the world. The Broadway columnist Earl Wilson annotated her preference for scanty clothing like this: “You should have seen Laya Raki. Even if she is dressed, she looks like , as if she only wears the zipper and has forgotten the material”. Of course he placed some photos of her in Earl Wilson’s Album of Showgirls (1st Issue! 1956).</p>
<p>In 1962 she performed as a singer. At a recording studio she breathed 2 titles in the microphone, Faire l`amour and Oh Johnny hier nicht parken, which are still available. The latter was forbidden with punishment by the county court of Nuremberg because the ecstatially moaning singer would imitate a coitus.</p>
<p>At the age of 30 Laya Raki married the Australian actor Ron Randell in London. “He is the best and most beautiful man of the world”, she said and remained at shis side until he died on June 11, 2005, in Los Angeles.</p>

His father Abraham Bann was an optician (in the sense of making lenses for eyeglasses), and his mother Delhia had to take care of her three children by herself.

<p>The Orange Tree Theatre was founded in a room above the Orange Tree pub in Richmond in December 1971. It was set up as a result of the "alternative theatre" explosion across the 60's and 70's. In 1975 Young's Brewery rennovated the pub and the theatre changed from lunchtime to evening performances. James Saunders became the house playwright, writing <i>Bodies</i> for the theatre, as did David Cregan. The new Orange Tree Theatre opened in February 1991 in an old school across the road from the original pub site. Since then the Orange Tree has been commited to theatre in the round.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-21_12ff.html" title="Edit section: Ryan Brown">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ryan Brown</span></h2>
<p>Ryan Brown is an artist originally from South Bend, Indiana. He is son to Sandra Stackhouse, M.D., founder of the Kelly Elaine Brown Memorial Endowment, and Adrian D. Stackhouse, Ph.D., co-editor of <b>After Africa: <i>Extracts From British Travel Accounts and Journals of the Seventeenth, Eighteenth, and Nineteenth Centuries Concerning the Slaves, Their Manners, and Customs in the British West Indies</i></b> at Yale University and author of <b>Gutbuckets and Bluetips: <i>Rationales and Reality Attitudes Towards the Blues</i></b>, in 1975.</p>
<p>Brown migrated to New York City in 2004, where he completed his Master's Degree in Communication Design at the renowned Pratt Institute, after touring the United States, South America, West Indies, Europe, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, and living briefly in London where he completed notable materials for The Design Distillery. At a young age, Brown started his career as a graphic artist but began infusing his own illustration, printmaking techniques, and hand-lettered typography in his work.</p>
<p>As a fan of Pratt predecessor Paul Rand, Brown devotes his designs to complete clarity and space– a minimialist approach to visual harmony, though priding himself on eccleticism and no one brand or method of design. His Master's work, <b>The ShedNEDD Hypothesis</b> (NEDD- Neo Etiquette Deficiency Disorder) is not only an example of his social attack on fragmented society (cited at <a href="http://www.shednedd.com" class="external free" title="http://www.shednedd.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.shednedd.com</a> by communication devices), but also of his playful manner in handling profound subjects with polished illustration and animation. The campaign features a full-budget pharmaceutical ad spoof executed by guerilla vandalism, which Brown later admitted was inpired by the work of Shepard Fairey and OBEY. Original installation of work was completed at Pratt Manhattan Gallery.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In 2005, Brown submitted a brand revision campaign to the world-famous natural health spa/cosmetic company, AmorePacific, and was received as consultant and grand contest winner. His work was featured in Asia's DESIGN Magazine and in AmorePacific's flagship store and headquarters in Seoul, Korea. The publicity from this award brought him to the attention of Arthur Lubow, president of AD Lubow Advertising. AD Lubow is one of many New York advertising agencies, but is unique in serving the cultural audience in the fields of Not-for-Profits, Education, Philanthropy and the Arts. Lubow quickly acquired Brown and he now serves as Art Director at this quickly growing enterprise. Recent work includes specialty podcasting pieces, video, web animation and print publications as a part of AD Lubow's 360° approach to advertising.</p>
<p>Ryan Brown currently lives in Hoboken, New Jersey.</p>

<p>The word "Mysore" refers to a place in Karnataka, India. "Mallige" is Jasmine in Kannada (an Indian language).</p>
<p>The word has been used to describe: 1. A variety of rice grown in India. This variety of rice is popularly believed to result in soft idlis (idli is an edible common in South India). 2. Several poets and natable artists. 3. Recently, sometime around 2003 - 05, an ametuer video titled "Mysore Mallige" created a lot of buzz on the internet.</p>

<p><i>Publishing Knowledge</i></p>
<p>ISTE Ltd was launched in 2005 with the intention of providing a fresh outlook on science and technical publishing. It produces cutting-edge and incisive titles in English for academics, researchers and industrial engineers on a range of subjects: engineering, information and communication technology, materials science, digital signal and image processing, networks and numerical methods.</p>
<p>The publishing programme is ambitious, with over 100 titles planned for 2006. One-third of the list is new material commissioned in English; the rest of the titles are adapted and expanded versions of highly-regarded French publications, available in English and accessible to a wider audience for the first time. A French list of 250 titles a year is also managed from the same offices and is published under the Hermès Science Publications/Lavoisier imprint.</p>

<p>( The book is diveded into 42 chapters which will be indicated after the quotations) clement begins with a warning never to flatter the rich, admiring their wealth and power, since his behavior will only enhance their vanity and may also drive them to despair if they come across Christ's parable of the camel and the ear of a neddle (Mk 10, 25) As a consequence they will use their riches to enjoy themselves sinfully as long as they can in this world, since they are convinced that eternal damnation will follow in the other anyway (1,2).</p>
<p>Clement hopes to enlighten and save them by analysing Christ's allegory and its counterpart, the story of the good Samaritan (Lk 10,29). Wealth in itself, he concludes, is not sinful nor is poverty in itself a safeguard to salvation. In both cases the individual must keep God's commandments and not get lost in temporal issues and sinful distractions. In fact , the rich are given a marvelous opportunity to do many good works with their wealth. Indeed, they are obliged to do so if they want to be saved. the poor, on the other hand, must see their poverty as a way to salvation which they accept for a higher purpose. Poverty for the sake of pverty is no virtue. "If somebody manages not to take advantage of the possibilities of wealth and remain moderate and wise and only seeks God and breathes the spirit of God and walks in the community of God, he will stand before God's commandments as a poor man, free, undefeated healthy, not violated by his possessions. But if this is not the case, a camel will easier pass through the ear of a needle than a rich man will enter the kingdom of God" (26).</p>
<p>The parable of the good Samaritan who obviously was a rich man corroborates Christ's acceptance of the virtuous rich man. Neither the priest nor the pious laymen of the orthodox persuasion "love their neighbor as themselves." They pay no attention to the wounded man in the ditch, but the heterodox Samaritan takes care of him and uses his own wealth to rescue and heal the wounded and destitute stranger by the wayside. Christ admonishes us: "Go and do the same!" Love, he wants to tell us, is the source of all good deeds. (28)</p>
<p>Clement reveals his Greek bachground when he describes our way to salvation as an athletic competition in an Olympic arena: " . . .an individual who owns many worldly goods must not declare himself from the very beginning excluded from the victory trophies of our Savior . . . nor may he hope to gain the wreath of eternal life without fighting, without dust and sweat. . . . On the contrary, he will joyfully subit to the Logos as the trainer of the competition and Christ as the referee. . . His prescibed diet of food and drink should be the New Testament of our Lord, his exercises should be the commandments, and his decorations the marvelous virtues of love, faith, and hope, the recognition of truth, goodness, mildness, compassion, chastity, so that at the sound of the last trumpet which announcec the end of the race. . . and of the track of life he can stand before the referee as a winner and will be considered worthy of the heavenly fatherland to which he will return decorated with the wreaths of victory and received by the herald call of the angels" (3).</p>
