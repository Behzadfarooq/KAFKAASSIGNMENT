<p>Non-notable footballer. soccerbase.com has no record of him ever having played in the football league and he is now plying his trade for a non-league team nine levels below the Premiership. Article also contains essentially no information on him <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 12:03, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> A Google search for "Pat Mullin"+"Coventry City" brings up 1 hit that isn't from WP and mirrors, and that link doesn't work. Since the only info on this player which would make him notable is unverfiable, he's therefore non-notable. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 12:39, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - as mentioned above, soccerbase.com has no record of him, which would suggest that he never played for the Coventry first team..... <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 12:44, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Wait, just to clarify did he play for Milwall? If so then he warrants an article as a professional sportsman (per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>) --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDaduzi_7081.html" title="User:Daduzi"><font color="Brown"><b>Daduzi</b></font></a> <a href="../../../d/a/d/User_talk%7EDaduzi_7219.html" title="User talk:Daduzi"><font color="green"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 10:02, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>As mentioned above, soccerbase.com has no record of him ever having played in the football league, which would seem to suggest that, while he may well have been on the books of Coventry and/or Millwall, he apparently never played a professional match for either club and therefore surely receives no notability as a result. As an aside, I'd also question whether he would be necessarily notable even if he <i>had</i> played for either or both of these clubs. There's an awful lot of journeyman players out there who have played a handful of games for lower division teams (which both Coventry and Millwall are), but I don't think that means that they automatically merit an entry on Wikipedia.... <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 10:21, 21 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I've just had a look at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and I have noticed (for the first time) that it does indeed state that a sportsman can be considered notable if he has played in a "fully professional league", however all sources would appear to indicate that this player was on the books of the clubs mentioned (maybe as a youth team player or some such) but never actually played for the first team. Rambling off somewhat, I have to say that I personally don't think that every player who has ever played in the "fully professional" Football League (of which there must be literally tens of thousands) can be considered notable just by that fact alone, but that's probably a debate for somewhere else.... <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 10:31, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>In that case <b>delete</b> (and I'd probably agree with you on the policy issue, it seems to have been written with American sports in mind; the suggested guidelines at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28athletes%29_2ecf.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (athletes)">Wikipedia:Notability (athletes)</a> look better to me). --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDaduzi_7081.html" title="User:Daduzi"><font color="Brown"><b>Daduzi</b></font></a> <a href="../../../d/a/d/User_talk%7EDaduzi_7219.html" title="User talk:Daduzi"><font color="green"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 22:25, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I have made enquiries on the Millwall message board and he played for Millwall as a junior but no-one remembers him getting anywhere near the first team. Playing for Maidstone doesn't do as they are not a FL team. I can find no info on him playing for Coventry. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 03:59, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
