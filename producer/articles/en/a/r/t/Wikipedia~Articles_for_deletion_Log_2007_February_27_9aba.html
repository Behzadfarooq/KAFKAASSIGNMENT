<dd><a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_mathematics.html" title="Indian mathematics">Indian mathematics</a> does not need a better title. A (very) few people could have been confused had the title been "Mathematics of India", but "Indian mathematics" does not cause any confusion, and is the only term used to refer to this field. This was the reason "Cuisine of India" was changed to <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_cuisine.html" title="Indian cuisine">Indian cuisine</a> (to explicitly generalize to the entire <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_subcontinent.html" title="Indian subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a>), although, it still didn't prevent people from creating <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistani_cuisine.html" title="Pakistani cuisine">Pakistani cuisine</a>, which doesn't quite explain why most Pakistanis in Europe or America would call their restaurants "Indian restaurants" serving "Indian cuisine."

<dd>As the title <i>Indian mathematics</i> seems to cause offense to some and confusion to others, I simply meant that there would be benefits to giving the article a <i>more precise</i> title, such as <i>Ancient Indian mathematics</i> (a term used in <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Indexes/Indians.html" class="external text" title="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Indexes/Indians.html" rel="nofollow">MacTutor</a>) or <i>History of mathematics in the Indian sub-continent</i> (for which we have a precedent <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_metallurgy_in_the_Indian_subcontinent_4679.html" title="History of metallurgy in the Indian subcontinent">here</a>). <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGandalf61_7a88.html" title="User:Gandalf61">Gandalf61</a> 11:34, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - per Smcafirst, but concur with Steve block that the articles could be tagged with {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} if needed. Unref tags should have been the first resort anyway, instead of just slapping on the AfDs - building up WP by adding sources, verifiability etc. is better policy than simply tearing things down. We should note that <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arterial_road.html" title="Arterial road">Arterial</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collector_road.html" title="Collector road">Collector roads</a> are the most notable designations of roads in urban areas - most roads listed are arterial or collector and should therefore be automatically notable.

Wikipedia is not an encyclopedia built from sources people can only find online. Furthermore, Wikipedia has no deadline, and it's only your opinion that "these article probably cannot be sourced to this level", or even that that level matters.

I'm not convinced that it's sufficiently notable, because being a major local thoroughfare is <i>not</i>, in and of itself, a sufficient argument that a road deserves an encyclopedia entry — the bare minimum criterion for the notability of a road is whether it's at least reasonably plausible to expect that somebody who lives hundreds or thousands of miles away, and has <i>never</i> been to the city in question, might still have heard of the street. Streets like Yonge, Bay, Bloor, Spadina, Eglinton and Queen certainly pass that test; I'm not convinced that Woodbine does. But in a misguided batch nomination, I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt. So: <b>keep</b> Woodbine, and <b>redirect</b> Wilmort to <a href="../../../c/a/c/Cachet%2C_Ontario_df25.html" title="Cachet, Ontario">Cachet, Ontario</a>. <b>Delete</b> the others; being a local collector route is <i>not</i> a sufficient claim of notability. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 09:15, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>these shouldn't each have their own articles.</b> I'm going to redirect each one as seems appropriate to me, and anyone who wants to work on merges can do so, but I don't see any particular consensus here other than that we shouldn't have articles on these topics. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><span style="color:orange"><b>juice</b></span></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 15:05, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Catalog listing of various toy models. Several reasons for deleting: Fails the primary criterion for product notability: <i>A company, corporation, organization, group, product, or service is notable if it has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works, the source of which is both independent of the company... or of the product's manufacturer or vendor, and reliable.</i> The only reliable references are either on websites selling these toys, or those related to the manufacturers. Also, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a directory</a>.</p>
<p>I am also nominating the following related catalogue listings for the same reasons:</p>

<li>The companies that made these toys are certainly notable - <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tomy.html" title="Tomy">Tomy</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/r/Hornby_Railways_84d0.html" title="Hornby Railways">Hornby Railways</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachmann_Industries_883e.html" title="Bachmann Industries">Bachmann Industries</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/g/Lego.html" title="Lego">Lego</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/p/Duplo.html" title="Duplo">Duplo</a> etc etc. However, how notable the actual products are is debatable. There's probably quite a bit of <b>Merging</b> that can go on here. Indeed, <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_the_Tank_Engine_and_Friends_ERTL_Models_2c4c.html" title="Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends ERTL Models">Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends ERTL Models</a> is already under discussion for merging with <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachmann_Thomas_and_Friends_6dd2.html" title="Bachmann Thomas and Friends">Bachmann Thomas and Friends</a> for example. <b><a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliminatorJR_b0b2.html" title="User:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B">Eliminator</font><font color="#FF4500">JR</font></a> <a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EEliminatorJR_a208.html" title="User talk:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B"><sup>Talk</sup></font></a></b> 00:32, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> all into a big super-article. They seem in a gray area as to being notable enough to exist as separate articles, but together I'm pretty sure they meet notability requirements. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 01:19, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The only thing I can see resulting from merging all nine individual lists together is one huge, long list of hundreds of non-notable models. Merging the notable stuff into <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_the_Tank_Engine_and_Friends_7b1c.html" title="Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends">Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends</a> might be an option, if it was a brief general description of each company's line, rather than listing every single product. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroxley_5f28.html" title="User:Croxley">Croxley</a> 06:36, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> These toys are entirely separate. They are all fairly major toys in their own right. The catalog listings are perhaps not all that helpful, but the toys themselves are entirely distinct. Would all benefit from pictures to illustrate the toys in question. <a href="../../../n/s/s/User%7ENssdfdsfds_5480.html" title="User:Nssdfdsfds">Nssdfdsfds</a> 09:47, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Can I just point out that if this was minor anime, or other somewhat notable geek subject, then this debate would not even be had. Just because they are toys for the under 10s, doesn't mean they are less notable than more geeky subjects.<a href="../../../n/s/s/User%7ENssdfdsfds_5480.html" title="User:Nssdfdsfds">Nssdfdsfds</a> 10:06, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Merging could produce a table which shows what companies produced a certain character. I guess this could be extremly usefull for collectors, yet I do not know wether WP would be the right place for such a fan orientated information. Is there something like "WP is not a collection of information only usefull and of interest to fans of a specific subject"? I hope not because then we would have to delete lists of trees, building styles or rulers of a given country just to name a few. (I for myself am not much interested in sports so there would be a lot of list cluttered articles that I wouldn't even notice missing). I guess the phrase <i>a product ... is notable if it has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works...</i> is difficult as most grownups would think collecting toys or showing interest in toy history or design is ... well ... trivial. Think of some other sets of questions.
<ul>
<li>Who should read and use the WP? Everybody? Children included?</li>
<li>What subjects would be of interest to a young person? What subjects would draw a child into the WP maybe encouraging it to follow links to related "grownup" information?</li>
<li>If a young person decides to participate, in what subjects is it naturally an expert?</li>
</ul>

<dd>I was dissapointed when I first found the articles on Thomas the tank merchandising but the reason I came accross them was because I was searching for information on the subject and was hoping the WP would be more helpfull than my local library. Following the basic guidline of what WP wants to be though I guess it will never be more usefull as it is sort of said that "if it has never been printed it doesn't belong into th WP" I wonder if there should be some "easy entry" subjects with lowered rules because these subjects tend to draw people into entering information and maybe thus some of them may become writers on more "non trivial" subjects. Articles on sports, toys, tv-shows and <i>my home town</i> would be my suggestion for such areas of somewhat lowered rules. Although I dont think the list of products of certain manufactures that important I would very much want the basic information to be kept in some sort or other. --<a href="../../../t/2E/w/User%7ET.woelk_a719.html" title="User:T.woelk">T.woelk</a> 10:08, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b> - There seems to be enough articles here, ok, not from the same manufacturers certainly, but there is enough info to turn this into one large article by merging relevant information and discarding flotsam off the leftovers. After all, its all essentially the same type of toy and same character. <a href="../../../t/m/a/User%7ETmalmjursson_5155.html" title="User:Tmalmjursson">Thor Malmjursson</a> 11:09, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I do have some knowledge of the toys in question. Remember please that my first language is not english, and when I say all the same type of toy, I mean - They are all train sets, and they all refer to or include Thomas the Tank Engine.

<p>Just yesterday when I had a look at the Thomas stuff shelves at my local TRU, wondering wether all these in some respects very different toys should go into one very very large article, I spotted a HO gauge version by <a href="../../../m/%C3%A4/r/M%C3%A4rklin.html" title="Märklin">Märklin</a> I hadn't heard of before (<a href="http://www.maerklin.de/produkte/thomas.php" class="external text" title="http://www.maerklin.de/produkte/thomas.php" rel="nofollow">on Märklin homepage</a>). I think the Thomas merchandising phenomena is extremely important. The impact this has had on the <a href="../../../t/o/y/Toy_train.html" title="Toy train">toy train</a> industrie is probably huge (anybody any numbers). In fact most of the <a href="../../../w/o/o/Wooden_toy_train.html" title="Wooden toy train">wooden toy trains</a> manufactors started or expanded after Learning Curve had revived the interest in wooden toy trains. I guess the <a href="../../../m/o/d/Model_train.html" title="Model train">model train</a> producers and Train museums are also aware of the interest this character is building for their products and sites among the young ones. I can't really remember any other merchandised character that has so many parallel products in the same category. How many ways are there to build a track and run a thomas engine on it? I don't think there are as many different play figures so simillar in play technic for say <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spiderman.html" title="Spiderman">Spiderman</a> or <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Sparrow_de2c.html" title="Jack Sparrow">Jack Sparrow</a>. OK, some suggestions. I could imagine all lists could be put into one super list article. This one might look awfull, but it might be to the benefit of all the original articles. The <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_the_Tank_Engine_and_Friends_merchandise_e3ae.html" title="Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends merchandise">Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends merchandise</a> should include all merchandising products! Each with some information on what exactly the product is (a bag, a bed sheet, a toy train with this or that sort of tracks, a model train in gauge soandso). I guess without the lists a lot of the articles would become stubs that can be integrated into the "Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends merchandise" article. The list will probably have to be protected from frequent deletion requests. It could be made more tabular, maybe the lists united to groups each with an own table like: Toy trains, Model trains, whatever. It would be great to have more info on the phenomena as such and the impact it is having on the toy industrie. This could lift the article from its appearance as something that rather fits to a fan site than an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>Ok after having a look at the ERTL Models list (we have two of them?) I don't really know how to organise the information in such a list better. Yet the list should be taken (not necessarly deleted) from the merchandise article and the article should rather give more info on every product line each than point to a category page. --<a href="../../../t/2E/w/User%7ET.woelk_a719.html" title="User:T.woelk">T.woelk</a> 11:01, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>COMMENT</b> – could I please ask everyone to involve the members of <a href="../../../t/h/o/WP%7ETHOMAS_a1cc.html" title="WP:THOMAS">WikiProject Thomas</a> before merging or deleting <i>anything</i> in this list??? The 'Thomas' pages in WP are certainly an entry point for the younger editors, as anyone in the project involved in vandal-patrolling could tell you at length! But we welcome constructive inoput, as it has the potential for developing the next generation of WP editors.</li>

<dl>
<dd>The article <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_the_Tank_Engine_and_Friends_merchandise_e3ae.html" title="Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends merchandise">Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends merchandise</a> was created in Jan 2007 to act as a top-level article and cover the subject properly from an encyclopedic viewpoint. It is still very much 'under development' (like an awful lot of other pages on WP!). Agreed, the current coverage is heavily list-based, and there are few sources so-far found to support the lists, but then I, for one, have not really looked. <a href="../../../t/h/o/WP%7ETHOMAS_a1cc.html" title="WP:THOMAS">WP:THOMAS</a> members have been discussing the problem, but the most active project members are mainly familiar with <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Railway_Series_85b6.html" title="The Railway Series">The Railway Series</a> books, or the <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_the_Tank_Engine_and_Friends_7b1c.html" title="Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends">Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends</a> TV Series, and not the specific ranges of merchandise, per se.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It may be that the best course of action is to copy the pages to <a href="http://train.spottingworld.com/" class="external text" title="http://train.spottingworld.com/" rel="nofollow">Train Spotting World</a>, which is a Wiki created from WP but designed to be less strict in terms of article coverage. If they would be happy to have the younger Thomas fans there, that Wiki would be ideally suited to house the long lists. In the meantime, it would be helpful if the pages can remain in existence, since that will simplify the cut-and-paste process in the future!</dd>

<dd>As for the 'multiple published sources', I'm sure that there's an awful lot of articles in WP that fail to meet this criteria.</dd>

<li><b>COMMENT</b> Can I just add that I don't necessarily object to merging some of these pages, but it should be done with a little more care, as there's not been much attention to what the individual toys actually are.

<li>Since the problem of currency is a problem for more than just Australia(see the other discussion), I wouldn't suggest consulting an Australian attorney whether you call them a lawyer, solicitor or monkey in a suit. Better to hire a consultant who is a little closer, as an this is likely to be an extensive issue that covers most every country. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 05:15, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>The problem is that each nation has different rules, and although Wikipedia is based on US servers images of currency are likely to be a problem if they contravene the laws of <i>that country</i>. Some countries allow images, some allow them only if they're specimens, some don't allow them at all.

<p>I almost deleted this as an advertisement. It seems to do little but promote the magazine/website. This http://www.inc.com?partner=wikipedia also disturbs me (look in the article). Wikipedia is <b>not</b> their partner last time I checked... I'm thinking that link was designed to figure out how many page views the company was getting from wikipedia, though I could be wrong.

I've tried to find sources, and come to the conclusion that this entire article is original research. It's documenting a style of poetry that simply isn't documented <i>anywhere</i>. I've looked for sources that document "netcees", "textcees", "kistyling" (the original spelling in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scrypt&amp;oldid=33089919" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scrypt&amp;oldid=33089919" rel="nofollow">the original version</a> of the article), "kick-backs", "Richard Corey", and (of course) "scrypt" and "scryptology", and come up entirely empty handed. There is <i>nothing</i> to support the content of this article, which is a novel analysis and history of things that happen on World Wide Web discussion fora, being written and first published directly in Wikipedia by a Wikipedia editor, contrary to our <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policy. That is <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">not what Wikipedia is for</a>. The proper place for this content is a journal article in one of the several peer-reviewed academic journals that cover literature and poetry, or even a book, so that this style of poetry <i>becomes</i> documented.
<p>I found several sources on the history and structure of <i>rap poetry</i>. But they support none of the content of this article, that subject is in any case a different one (according to this article, at any rate), none of this content is useful for expanding our coverage of rap poetry (because it is original research), and rap poetry is already dealt with in our article on <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rapping.html" title="Rapping">rapping</a>. There's no documentation that supports the assertion that this is even an alternative name for rap poetry, thus no support even for a redirect. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:28, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Do not delete.</b> Thanks friend. But alas, your views are totally wayward and unfounded. Scrypt is merely an underground movement of urban based, hip hop influenced poetry and creative writing. I like to think of it like the Harlem of the 20s. Anyways, Scrpyt is real, it exists, and impacts a key area of creative writing. It's not purely rap poetry, it's moved on to become something totally different and entirely unique in its own right. However, deleting the Scrypt article won't actually change anything. It'll just push the movement further underground once more, where it will develop and grow further, until one day will become widely accepted as an above ground form of creative writing. Viva la revolution! Or should it be viva Las Vegas? Who knows. Yours in humbleness of pride,George Whitefield, the honorable pastor of Scrypt. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.155.77.144_67bf.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.155.77.144">81.155.77.144</a> (talk) 11:32, 3 March 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - There are many, many articles on WP that have but one mention in another source, often a newspaper. This calendar isn't discussed in every journal these days, but it is a very legitimate calendar proposal that got "press" in the 20th century (if "publicity" is a good measure of notability, which it is obviously not.) The nominator posted a warning that sources were required, and a source for this calendar was produced. The book that serves as a source is a legitimate one, printed by a major publishing house, not a self-published paper or even an obscure journal. It should suffice. Yet, it was immdiately put up for deletion after the actions of the nominator were challenged. I believe this is being deleted as part of a what seems to be a very aggressive deletion strategy of most calendar reform proposals, based in part upon what isn't even an accepted WP <b>guideline</b>, but instead, a <b>proposal</b> for a guideline, on Notability. One thing is certain, it is NOT currently a policy, and shouldn't be aggresively interpreted as such. When every cartoon character or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Crash_Bandicoot_characters_e1f6.html" title="List of Crash Bandicoot characters">minor video game character</a> is afforded an article on Wikipedia, going after calendar reform proposals seems a bit absurd. - <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a> <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_Userinterestlist_56e3.html" title="User:Nhprman/Userinterestlist"><small><sup>List</sup></small></a> 21:56, 21 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm really not sure where to start here, but let's try:
<ol>
<li>Exactly what are you claiming is a "proposal for a guideline"? <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a> is one of the <a href="../../../5/p/_/WP%7E5P_c2b8.html" title="WP:5P">five pillars</a>. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Notability</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> are both accepted guidelines.</li>
<li>The claimed source for this calendar (Steel, 2000) says nothing more than "In 1930, there was another leap-week calendar proposal put forward, this time by a Jesuit, James A. Colligan". That does not appear to fulfil the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> requirement that "any reader should be able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source", as it does not give any details of the calendar beyond its inventor and the date of invention. Which sources are being referred to for the rest of the information in the article?</li>
<li>The line of reasoning of "What about article x?" is well covered at <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS</a> and the further linked essays; I see no need to rehash them further here. --<a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPak21_529c.html" title="User:Pak21">Pak21</a> 22:12, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> There is all sorts of lawyerly cleverness one could throw at this argument, and the previous post is a masterful example of this technique. Suffice it to say this *seems to be* a selective purge of certain pages, and despite the fact that a clever answer has been written by someone in the past that "crap" exists elsewhere, the implication that this is "crap" is not an argument, it's an attack.
<p>And let me elaborate, and clarify, my previous comments. First, Notability is a GUIDELINE, and carries with it far less weight than a policy, and even as a Guideline, its meaning and application here is hotly disputed, as the Notability article's <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_71e3.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability">history of reversions and extensive revisions</a> can attest to. As for Reliable sources, they are being added at this point, so this process of deletion was a bit premature. - <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a> <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_Userinterestlist_56e3.html" title="User:Nhprman/Userinterestlist"><small><sup>List</sup></small></a> 02:07, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrong in several ways. You are not <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assuming good faith</a> by assuming that this is some kind of "selective purge". The application of notability here at AFD is the subject of widespread agreement. It has been in use at AFD for several years, now. The current dispute was caused by a few editors trying to change the long-standing definition to something else. And it was <i>you</i> that called articles crap, by employing the long-discredited <a href="../../../p/o/k/Wikipedia%7EPokemon_test_84d6.html" title="Wikipedia:Pokemon test">Pokémon argument</a>, not <a href="../../../p/a/k/User%7EPak21_529c.html" title="User:Pak21">Pak21</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 08:59, 22 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm hoping for the day when wanton deletionism is just as discredited as that argument, which was apparently written by deletionists, and is a straw many anyway, since clearly this calendar isn't as well known as the Pokemon characters, and no one is saying this. The "other crap exists" <i>essay</i> was similarly designed to build up the idea that all deletions are valid, and shouldn't be questioned. Sorry. I question all deletions, and wonder why deletionists don't simply improve articles, not run around deleting dozens of them. I'm assuming you're acting on your best judgement when you nominate the many articles for deletion you do, and not out of malice, even though you seem to be aggressively applying a guideline that clearly is <i>still</i> in hot dispute. Let me also note that two people commenting here is not sufficient for a consensus. It's good that you relisted this. Let's hope people find their way here <b>on their own</b> to comment on it further. - <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a> <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_Userinterestlist_56e3.html" title="User:Nhprman/Userinterestlist"><small><sup>List</sup></small></a> 05:07, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Article was recreated after first Prod deletion, so now I'm brining it here. It's not a real term, only a slang term used in a few sources. Does not qualify as encyclopedic per <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>. Probably not suitable for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikitionary.html" title="Wikitionary">wikitionary</a> either.

<li>Oops, I didn't know you could move a page. Anyways, I think you're right about the article not qualifying as encyclopedic, but I think that the practice of computer manufacturers loading up new computers with trial versions of applications (and receiving money from the application companies to do so) should be mentioned somewhere on Wikipedia.

<li>I suppose I understand your issue with the entry, especially in light of the fact that Google shows no hits. However, you have to understand a little more about the history of the society. The society was a legend among the students until this week. It finally manifested itself to the student body in the form of a note to the student body president. It explained in the note that the society had been dormant since the First World War. Do you really expect a society that has been dormant for almost 100 years to suddenly appear on the web two days later? The only sources which make reference to the society are those found in the library which I have listed. I think it's slightly ignorant to blackball an article simply because you can't find reference to it online. Theburgh 00:40, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> [edit conflict]. No, I don't expect a dormant society to be a presence on the Internet after a week out of the closet, but I <i>do</i> expect there to be some reference to it, somewhere, even in the context of being a rumour, if members included individuals such as Arthur Conan Doyle and Lord Palmerston. <font color="DarkGray">...</font> <a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDiscospinster_5902.html" title="User:Discospinster"><font color="DarkOrange"><b>disco</b></font><font color="DarkOliveGreen"><b>spinster</b></font></a> <sub><a href="../../../d/i/s/User_talk%7EDiscospinster_3a6c.html" title="User talk:Discospinster"><b><font color="DarkGray">talk</font></b></a></sub> 00:40, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Well what do you suggest I do? I'm not making this up, if that's what you're implying. It is an established legend (at the very least), here, in Edinburgh. And I must say, I find it slightly offensive that someone, who I doubt very much is from the area, is correcting me on this. That said, I understand the lack of evidence. How should I go about proving the existence of a secret society? Especially one which may have never existed. The point is that it is a piece of history, of legend, at the very least. So... we should just delete this article? Seems silly to me. Oh, and I use both of these two accounts, by the way.Laxer076 00:51, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Please do. All three books may be found in the Special Collection at the University Library. I don't think this article should be deleted, however I don't have the time to continue to discuss this matter. I find it hard to believe that I am the only person who has heard of this society, but I understand the complaints raised by others. Taking the high ground, I suggest the article is deleted. I will wait until information becomes available online (as it must, inevitably) and then repost the article. I hope this is a consensus to which everyone can agree.

<li><b>Keep</b> All of this can be sourced through in-game dialogue and other in-game elements and strategy guides (quite possibly Brady's, in particular); the gangs can also be considered, albeit in a somewhat warped sense, major characters through <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>: most of these gangs play major roles through <i>all</i> of the games starting from GTA III.

<li><b>No vote</b>. Generally I dislike this sort of specialized article (i.e. List of X in Game Y), and this one relies very heavily on primary sources, so I don't want to endorse keeping it. That said, it the article itself isn't all that bad, and it seems to have avoided many of the "game-guide" pitfalls that plague other game-specific articles, so I don't think it really needs to be deleted either. I suppose maybe I'd be happier if the title of the article were more inclusive; "list of gangs" sounds very narrow.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Au_82f0.html" title="User:Alan Au">Alan Au</a> 18:52, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>Merge</b> Too much WP:ILIKEIT in the arguments for Keep for my taste. Notable gangs can be merged into the main article and if they can't then they weren't significant to the plot to begin with. The GTA series specializes in sandbox games but it's not in WP's goals to list all the people/gangs you can interact with while you play. The major gangs can be merged and the minor ones can be deleted. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChevinki_c5c7.html" title="User:Chevinki">Chevinki</a> 09:37, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. What is a "major indie label"? Sounds like an oxymoron to me. Their label is an indie label that was apparently involved in buyout discussions at one point with MCA. And "being mentioned in a video game" is even worse than releasing their albums through an "indie" label. Anyway, failing music notability guidelines doesn't necessarily mean it should be deleted.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The purpose of this encyclopedia is to provide free accounting of information in a formal and encyclopedic way. This group is a group and therefore deserves for their voice to be heard. To me, this article represents what wikipedia is about. Now, if they have completely made up this group, or this is a lil child group "power ranger" type thing, then that is another story. But just because they are not on a major lable or anything, does not merit their article for deletion.</li>

<li><b>keep</b> My first gut reaction was to keep (but mainly just to offset a few above who are saying delete on political grounds) However, doing that is not good for Wikipedia, so I did a search for "solar system warming" and I was surprised at the number of references. A few described "solar system warming" as a term for the idea that global warming is caused by an increase in output energy from the sun. Secondarily the article has only been edited for two days -it clearly has been jumped on by some people with a very political stick. As far as I can see, it satisfies the main test of being a real term, the second test of being notable I'm not sure about, the argument that "it's not true" - if that were a valid argument then bang would go reincarnation, christianity, etc. It will do no harm to Wikipedia to leave it a few months to allow the editors to develop the article at which point we will know better whether it is worth keeping. <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 09:48, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Response:</b> The book "Solar Activity and Earth's Climate" by Rasmus E. Benestad discusses solar activity and climate change on Earth and also looks at other planets in the solar system. The author writes: "We will glean some information from two other earth-like planets, Venus and Mars, as well as the Moon, and compare these to our own Earth. Both the planets have an atmosphere which exhibit similar features as well as different attributes to the Earth's atmosphere. If variations in the Sun produce changes in the Earth's climate, one may expect to see similar fluctuations in the brightness temperature on Venus and perhaps Mars." (page 4) <a href="http://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;id=bZm3efIPqF0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR13&amp;sig=RHNXBaObTJZi9e8wXH6oUX3nhZM&amp;dq=Mars+warming+solar+irradiance&amp;hl=en#PPA4,M1" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;id=bZm3efIPqF0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR13&amp;sig=RHNXBaObTJZi9e8wXH6oUX3nhZM&amp;dq=Mars+warming+solar+irradiance&amp;hl=en#PPA4,M1" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> This is just one example of evidence showing that the Sun's role in warming on other planets is a subject of scientific interest. The effort to delete this page is purely an effort to censor information rather than deliver information to Wikipedia readers. Stephan, your theory is interesting and may even be factual. I have not seen any citation to back it up and if the article is deleted, you will not have a place to provide me with a citation.

I don't know what you call "my theory", the fact that planets warm and cool as they follow their elliptical orbit is not a "theory" (in either the scientific or the common sense), but indeed a fact. And btw, the book seems to fully accept and support the IPCC positions...--<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephan_Schulz_3024.html" title="User:Stephan Schulz">Stephan Schulz</a> 12:06, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Stephan, I did not mean to imply the book supported the article. I quoted it because it shows that this is a scientific question that has been raised and is worthy of discussion. Since the book is now five years old, the lacking time series for temperature may exist. At the very least, the temperature record is five years longer than it was then. Your "theory" has to do with planetary seasons. The fact seasons exist is a fact and not a theory. However, applying the fact to the observed warming is a theory. While the theory may be correct regarding some of the more distant planets and moons (which have very long orbits), it seems to be wholly unsatisfactory for Mars which orbits the Sun about every 2 years and has been undergoing warming for a decade or two. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonCram_11d9.html" title="User:RonCram">RonCram</a> 13:33, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is a valid subject. This does have things writen about it. The fact that it is currently a bad article, and needs more sources doesn't mean it should be deleted. I only created it the other day as a stub, and it has already grown to this size. Obviously it is going to need a lot of clean-up, refference additions, etc... however, I do not think that it should be deleted. Also, conserning the Global Warming articles, I testify to the above, it does seem they have been hijacked by a few administrators, specificly <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a>. I happened upon this when looking up <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_cooling.html" title="Global cooling">Global cooling</a>, and noticed that (at least at the time) it was writen like an attack that made the topic almost not readable, and mostly consisted of an attack on it with <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">Global warming</a>... and yet it was deffended by him and others. I do not know if it is the same way still. However, I feel that a more neutral-to-the-subject administrator should look into it. I'm not advocating anyone's position... just pointing out that the problem does seem to be real. Anyway, I suggest this article be cleaned up. If you want to take all the unproven things to the talk page, or just remove them, I would have no problem with that. I would have no problem if this was reduced to very little for now. However, the researchable and salvageable information should maybe be taken to the talk page until something can be done with this. Just some ideas.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Mr. Arritt, myself, and the other editors advocating deletion have done so for one reason only: to maintain some level of scientific credibility on Wikipedia (that was why I noted Rameses claims above). Wikipedia is not a forum for pseudoscience. I know the levels of debate surrounding the global-warming articles, but this is not related to them. It is merely nonsense. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelbusch_fe90.html" title="User:Michaelbusch">Michaelbusch</a> 16:57, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Nice POV essay, although a bit short. I appreciate that you admitted your desire to "cleanse" Wikipedia of the stuff you disagree with.

<li><b>Comment</b>: How is it nonsense? I can understand the page itself being a bit of a problem as it is, being only a day old; however, what makes the subject itself nonsense? It is certainly spoken of. It is certainly writen about. Not as much as <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_Warming_8f17.html" title="Global Warming">Global Warming</a>, and maybe not as much as <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_cooling.html" title="Global cooling">Global cooling</a> but it is still a theory that is out there that an encyclopedia should cover. <a href="../../../s/a/d/User%7ESadanYagci_70f6.html" title="User:SadanYagci">SadanYagci</a> 17:13, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Theories are like opinions and azzholes, everyone has one. Now the decision is which theory is notable enough to be encyclopedic content and which one is for the sole purpose of political debate on "message boards"? Do we include every message board theory created to discredit global warming or just the ones that are being actively debated in the scientific community? If it is an active scientific debate or theory, lets see the refs stating its an actual theory? --<a href="../../../i/_/a/User%7EI_already_forgot_0fa6.html" title="User:I already forgot">I already forgot</a> 17:24, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

This particular article is nonsense for the reasons given for deletion by other editors here. Note also: everyone has been mis-using 'theory'. This implies consistency with existing data, which this article does not have (no, we will not have a forty-post argument about that, because that is not the purpose of this discussion).

It seems to me that most of the above arguments are based on a disagreement with the POV the article is currently largely slanted towards, but that just says that the article need more POV/information the other way to show how dumb it is.

<li><b>Delete</b> My main objection is that they do not present a reliable source presenting the theory. I see here original research in the form of synthesis of weak sources while ignoring better evidence which refutes it. See <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_variation.html" title="Solar variation">Solar variation</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_constant.html" title="Solar constant">Solar constant</a> which are better articles addressing the output of the sun. Astronomical observation of the sun is a far more legitimate index of solar output than ice on the Martian pole melting. The article appears to be a POV argument lacking adequate sources based on an indirect index. It is like claiming low water pressure in the house based on a teenager taking too long in the shower, while ignoring a water pressure meter. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkpaduta_0868.html" title="User:Inkpaduta">Inkpaduta</a> 18:51, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. There doesn't seem to be any English evidence of the language's existence, although this may be one of those cases where we'll have to rely on sources in Turkish or Georgian or something along those lines. The Turks certainly seem to think the language exists (at their Wikipedia), but I don't have enough Turkish to figure out where they're getting their information from. If it <i>is</i> a dialect, then calling it a "language" is perhaps not the best idea. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 05:46, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hi. I'm a native speaker of Georgian and quite familiar with the <a href="../../../a/d/j/Adjara.html" title="Adjara">Adjara</a> region. <i>Adjaran</i> is a dialect of the <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgian_language.html" title="Georgian language">Georgian language</a>. It formerly contained many Turkish loanwords since Adjara and some other Georgian lands had been part of the Ottoman Empire until 1878. Linguists don't consider Adjaran to be a separate language though. --<a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a><sup><a href="../../../k/o/b/User_talk%7EKober_0b14.html" title="User talk:Kober">Talk</a></sup> 06:04, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, thanks for that. I should've checked your userpage straight off the mark. If it's a legitimate dialect, should we perhaps rename it as "Adjar dialect" (or something along those lines, I'm not sure quite what the best adjective is) and write up an article on the distinguishing features of this dialect <i>vis a vis</i> regular Georgian? I'd expect that as well as the former loanwords (are they all gone now?), there could well be grammatical differences as well. I don't have much access to anything on Georgian grammar, so I'll have to rely on your work here. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 06:46, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I'm far from being an expert on linguistics, but I'll try to prod people that have more info on the subject. Also, I think there is very little to write about the Adjarian dialect in a separate article. I would rather suggest creating the Dialects of Georgian language article and merging Adjarian dialect with it. --<a href="../../../k/o/b/User%7EKober_63f5.html" title="User:Kober">Kober</a><sup><a href="../../../k/o/b/User_talk%7EKober_0b14.html" title="User talk:Kober">Talk</a></sup> 07:21, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As <a href="../../../d/r/_/Dr_Zoidberg_ae13.html" title="Dr Zoidberg">my hero</a> famously said, "Also good". It's probably showing my ignorance of your country, but I'm genuinely surprised that there can be multiple dialects in such a small area (still, there are mountains, so maybe that's the reason). If you end up with any rough translations or other examples of slightly odd English, I'd be happy to help out with polishing the results. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 07:44, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A list we cannot possibly hope to write well. This has got to be the longest Wikipedia list I have ever seen, and it's probably, at best, 5% complete. There is an entire genre of writing called <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_fiction.html" title="Historical fiction">Historical fiction</a> which exists to portray real people in fictional contexts. Even keeping the list down to figures prominently featured in the works, this would still imply that every Historical novel written should be listed on the page at least a half-dozen or so times. And of course, the list does not stick to the limits set in the introduction, but has grown beyond all reason. There were 28 listings, for instance, of <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_Guy_f6a0.html" title="Family Guy">Family Guy</a>, which I guarantee does not really feature any real person prominently, with the possible exception of Adam West (which by the way is not listed). What this article is, really, is about a hundred trivia articles rolled into one. The page has been listed on AfD previously: see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Litefantastic_Files_7f8d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Litefantastic Files">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Litefantastic Files</a> and <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_List_of_real_people_appearing_in_fictional_context_06c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of real people appearing in fictional context">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of real people appearing in fictional context</a>. It was kept in both cases, but the problems with the article have only gotten worse. I'd mark it with a cleanup tag, but I honestly can't think what would make this a reasonable article. Forking out sections based on what kind of real people appear doesn't seem much better. Perhaps an article featuring only older works? But that seems arbitrary, and is a heck of a lot of work to distil from this article. We could restrict to only books, or only movies, but this wouldn't cut down the list much... and we could try to restrict to only particuarly important works, but systemic bias will kill us there. I see deletion as the only way to fix the situation. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 05:28, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>1. Information: While this isn't a structured list, it could be useful for helping English language learners or young people understand the concept of "rhyme".</li>
<li>2. Navigation: If a Wikipedian is trying to find the name of a band, and the only thing they can remember is that it rhymes, this could be an extremely useful list.</li>

<p>I realize that some of these justifications are highly conditional and might not occur with great regularity. But that's the whole point of Wikipedia: It's VAST!

<dd>No offense, but I think those points are stretching things a bit. I sincerely doubt <i>anybody</i> would use this article to "learn about the concept of rhyming" or "find missing band articles" or "remember that a band name rhymes but not the name and use this list to find the band". I mean, maybe I'm overly skeptical, but that's just my opinion. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 17:07, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree (as I mentioned in my original post) that these things might not happen often. But if they happen ONCE, then this list has served a useful purpose. I found nothing under <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> or <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> that says a page needs to be likely to attract a high (or any) amount of traffic.

<dd>Not a good reason. She appeared on American Idol, The Tonight Show, and Family Feud and has a prominent role in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.

Plus, since Idol has such a huge fan base, let's not turn off potential readers of wikipedia by being deletionist goofs. Best, --164.107.223.217 06:20, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Argument 1</li>
</ul>
<p>(Non notable student film, no use to an encyclopedia, etc. etc.) I feel unnecessarily targeted in the sense that there are a countless number of wikipedia articles that aren't "notable" or of "encyclopedic value", yet simply because our movie isn't known nationally means that it has to be deleted. What is notable? What is encyclopedic value?</p>
<p>Encyclopedia's don't include intense publication information about the comic book "Bones" for one thing *sneeeeematticuszeessss*. Nor do encyclopedias include articles about Star Wars, television shows, magazines, or popular websites like Myspace. With this in mind, and also with the fact that articles, like the ones I mentioned, DO exist on Wikipedia; I think that your argument that Cop Movie is not of "Encyclopedic Value" is irrelevant due to the fact that Wikipedia does not work that way (despite how much you guys wish it did).</p>
<p>As to the <b>notable</b> part of the argument, the definition of <b>notable</b> is "worthy of note or notice".</p>
<p>As a teenager, I know how hard it is to concentrate on getting something done. Whether it be schoolwork or a short story for some geek fantasy forum that you guys go to. I cannot begin to tell you how difficult it was for me to convince a group of teenagers to help me do a 25 minute movie. After convincing them, we took time out of our schedules after school, everyday, for about a week straight. We came to the school on the weekends. We didn't eat lunch with our friends. We did whatever we could to meet our goal and personal deadline, which we did. And although it isn't the best movie in the would, we put a hell of an effort in it and got it done when everyone told us we couldn't.</p>
<p>Now...is that not notable?</p>

<dd>I think you're missing a few points there. Yes, you are right that Wikipedia covers many topics in far greater detail than you would find in a conventional encyclopedia. Wikipedia itself states <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#PAPER" title="WP:NOT">"Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia"</a>, and that there is "no practical limit to the number of topics". However, that same paragraph continues with the caveat "other than verifiability and the other points presented on this page". The issue here is not that the movie is short, or made by teenagers or amateurs (I don't mean that in a pejorative sense, by the way), or that anyone here wants to belittle the effort put into making it, but that none of the information is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> by multiple <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> independent of the creators. Wikipedia editors of good faith want this encyclopedia to be both comprehensive and <i>verifiable</i>. If the film had been shown at a festival, for example, and its programme gave details and review, then you would have a reliable independent source. If its creators had been interviewed for a local newspaper, then you would have another. Comments on blogs, MySpace, YouTube and the like cannot be counted as reliable sources, simply because anyone can make them and there is no accountability for accuracy. As the article stands at present there is no evidence of those all-important third-party reliable sources, but the AfD debate runs for a week (barring early closure) giving editors time to add them. ~<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatticus78_7ff9.html" title="User:Matticus78">Matticus</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatticus78_82c5.html" title="User talk:Matticus78">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Matticus78_2dbc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Matticus78">C</a></sub> 11:32, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete and Comment</b> This article should be deleted. Sorry Leet Films but it's well established that your film needs to be notable to be included to justify it having an article in Wikipedia. I appreciate that you have put a lot of work into your film, but it does not appear to qualify as notable. Just working hard at it isn't enough. A few points occur to me:-</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>(a) Has your film been signed up by a distributor and screened anywhere for the general public?</li>
<li>(b) Has your film been released anywhere <b>commercially</b> on DVD or for internet download?</li>
<li>(c) Are any of the actors, director, producer, writer etc notable?</li>
<li>(d) Has your film been reviewed anywhere?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can say "yes" to any of these, then your film may well be considered notable, if you can verify the claims.</p>
<p>You mention viewer responses you might provide, who are the viewers? Comments from friends you have shown the film to won't make the film notable. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJules1975_f2fe.html" title="User:Jules1975">Jules1975</a> 11:49, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Claimed to be the first African-American Greek letter fraternity. A prior article was deleted twice based on reason which had little to do with notability (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Alpha_Kappa_Nu_a1ed.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Alpha Kappa Nu">1st Afd</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Alpha_Kappa_Nu_%28second_nomination%29_4384.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Alpha Kappa Nu (second nomination)">2nd AfD</a>).

This AfD is to decide whether the prior problems have been resolved with this version and, if remediable, fix remaining problems, and also, if the sources are sufficient to write a neutral article and support the claims. I am currently <b>neutral</b>, but I might form an opinion later. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 09:16, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep.</b> I've read the previous AfD several times, and I do not understand the claim on that AfD that the existence of this article can somehow be construed as an <a href="../../../a/t/k/WP%7EATK_b196.html" title="WP:ATK">attack page</a> against the <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Phi_Alpha_482f.html" title="Alpha Phi Alpha">Alpha Phi Alpha</a> page.

<li>OK, changing from <b>keep</b> to <b>strong keep</b> based on the comments on the 2nd AfD. The historical significance of this article <i>does not rest</i> on whether the claim to be the first black fraternity is accurate or not. The article discusses a topic which is notable simply for the fact that the subject is part of a notable controversy, discussed in reliable sources, regarding whether it was the first black fraternity. It's place in history as part of the controversy seals its notability. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 10:18, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I am unfamiliar with the previously-deleted article, so I have no opinion on how closely it resembles that. But I can't see any problem with the article we have except references formatting and one or two wording tweaks. A stub, a bit of a mystery, but important. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 10:32, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I agree with Dhartung above in failing to see any problem with the topic of this article. I have started to put the first few references into footnotes, but the article needs some copy editing and I think the references need some consolidating by someone more willing than me to actually read up on the subject. <a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharamond_ed49.html" title="User:Pharamond">Pharamond</a> 15:10, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The underlying thread behind the first two AfD's (which by themselves were massively riddled with SPA and bad faith problems on both sides) is that the evidentiary basis for the claim that AKN was the first black fraternity is very thin. In particular the secondary sources seem to draw on the same primary sources, which since they are affiliated with <a href="../../../k/a/p/Kappa_Alpha_Psi_d0a0.html" title="Kappa Alpha Psi">Kappa Alpha Psi</a>, might not be independent. Kappa Alpha Psi used to be Kappa Alpha Nu, the follow-up black fraternity of Alpha Kappa Nu at Indiana University. I proposed to <a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFrozenApe_9307.html" title="User:FrozenApe">FrozenApe</a> to include a section on AKN in the KAP article, but he considered it a stand-alone topic. In any case, my primary goal is to get an AfD that focuses on the merit of the article and not on interpersonal issues that bogged down the first two (and the first DRV). ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 18:03, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment and Keep</b> There are numerous sources that aren't secondary that state that Alpha Kappa Nu is the first black fraternity <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=kI4_svFQOHYC&amp;pg=RA1-PA22&amp;lpg=RA1-PA22&amp;vq=alpha+kappa+nu&amp;dq=black+greek+101&amp;sig=182O7wqR7e1FStJQ-0otnxek3q8" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?id=kI4_svFQOHYC&amp;pg=RA1-PA22&amp;lpg=RA1-PA22&amp;vq=alpha+kappa+nu&amp;dq=black+greek+101&amp;sig=182O7wqR7e1FStJQ-0otnxek3q8" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0813123445&amp;id=yfTYV_H2XoEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA153&amp;lpg=RA1-PA153&amp;ots=eonoD3q4YR&amp;dq=%22alpha+kappa+nu%22+indiana&amp;sig=9WFLALwGmQmJo1oBzet26HnsG0Q#PRA1-PA137,M1" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0813123445&amp;id=yfTYV_H2XoEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA153&amp;lpg=RA1-PA153&amp;ots=eonoD3q4YR&amp;dq=%22alpha+kappa+nu%22+indiana&amp;sig=9WFLALwGmQmJo1oBzet26HnsG0Q#PRA1-PA137,M1" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> . The sources are documented and luckily available online thru a scanning of books by google.com. The problem is that it did not last very long and there is very little recorded history on them. You won't find any sources that will state that there is a black fraternity prior to the formation of Alpha Kappa Nu. You will find sources that state that they are the first black fraternity outside of Sigma Pi Phi which was founded in 1905 <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_11_59/ai_n6158341" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_11_59/ai_n6158341" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> (Ebony magazine 2004). I disagreed with Trialsanderrors because Alpha Kappa Nu and Kappa Alpha Psi were founded in the same school but were unrelated. I won't comment much because I'd like other outside opinions. thanks though. <a href="../../../f/r/o/User%7EFrozenApe_9307.html" title="User:FrozenApe">FrozenApe</a> 19:13, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

If I had then the knowledge of Wikipedia policy I do now, I would have simply deleted the material as indiscriminate information. The intro provides no context, and makes no assertion that this information is important or useful. If you check the history, you'll see that almost all of the activity since I created the article has been housekeeping.

<li><b>Keep</b> A well defined list of which of the 300 Div 1 schools never had a varsity football program is not an indiscriminate list. It is not a matter of some editor's taste, opinion or judgement. Nothing the least bit "crufty" about it. It can be easily maintained.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Let's review the meaning of an indiscriminate list. To me, it means something like "list of movies that drag on and should have ended sooner". That type of list is subject to personal opinion; there is no set criteria for inclusion. In contrast, the criteria for inclusion in this list is crystal clear. Is it NPOV. It is so clear that the title really says it all - no introduction is even needed. It is a finite list, and maintaining the list is not even a big problem since not many Division I schools rush out and add football. This inforamation is useful and interesting. It is necesary information if we are to become the worlds foremost authority on <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_football.html" title="College football">college football</a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. No, this is entirely to misunderstand how lists work here. We have a specific tool for handling this kind of information: the category. As it stands this article is simply a collection of information that could be handled more efficiently as a category. List articles only have value if they add some additional information, typically to enhance comprehension or ease comparison ( e.g. a list of people ordered by birth date, or a list of books sorted by genre ); this doesn't happen here. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 14:26, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I've heard of categories. For this particular grouping of colleges and universities, either method of presenting the information would work, and I can't see any reason to prefer one over the other. It's here now as a list, so keep it. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 06:00, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Let me help your vision out then, Commissar Lane&#160;;-) This is <i>far</i> preferable to a category. This list is of some interest as a collection. However, it's not a defining characteristic of these colleges. Categories take up real estate on the page. Too many minor categories clutter and obscure the major ones. There's no need to have that footprint for a very minor attribute. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 06:27, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Actually, that point occurred even to my aged eyes. As against that, the category tag does serve the purpose of alerting the reader of the <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairleigh_Dickinson_University_da33.html" title="Fairleigh Dickinson University">Fairleigh Dickinson University</a> article that s/he can readily see which other schools are in this select group. The list wouldn't do that unless it were to be given real estate in each school's "See also" section. Nevertheless, because I agree with you that this isn't a defining characteristic, the category's gain in facilitating its pursuit isn't of great value. So, on further review, the original call stands. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 06:52, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I can't verify it, because no sources are mentioned, and the article does not make sense making me think that it is not verifiable at all. For example, it says that the symbol is used to save time at examinations. However, the use of mysterious symbols in exams will cost students marks. Besides, the symbol seems to stand for "we have proven the statement for k = 1 and we have proven that if it holds for k = n, it also holds for k = n + 1, so it holds for all positive integers k". Such a sentence is usually not included in proofs, so you can save even more time by not putting the symbol in at all. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 11:16, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, living there, I consider myself <i>in the know</i> in a way. However, despite the nice references you provided, all of those are 1-paragraph mentions; my point is, it could be an anthropological study in theory, but I can't foresee how it can be a Wikipedia article without an <i>existing</i> thorough anthropological study. I mean, I <i>could</i> expand the article reasonably well, but I don't see how to do it without an original research of my own; and I'm not an anthropologist. To be clear, I'm not eager to delete this article, just questioning its encyclopedic value without a solid pre-existing ground. <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a><span style="font-size:70%;"><a href="../../../d/u/j/User_talk%7EDuja_3032.html" title="User talk:Duja">►</a></span> 14:01, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The first reference is an academic reference. Whilst the coverage is not massive, it gives an academic definition of the term - 'The point may be made more clear by looking at pre-war Bosnia. The institution of komšiluk (from Turkish) established clear obligations of reciprocity between people of different “nations” living in close proximity but also prohibited intermarriage between members of these religiously defined groups (Bringa 1995:66–84). Xavier Bougarel (1996:81–88) has argued that this relationship based on proximity was antithetical to one based on intimacy: marriage. While the idea of “citizen” is abstract,he says, “neighbor” (komšija) was always concrete. Essentially, then, the practices of komšiluk regulated re-lations between individuals as representatives of groupsthat chanced to live in close proximity while the groupsthemselves remained in structural opposition, un-mixable.' - It also gives further references that have discussed the theory of Komšiluk. As I said, I believe that there is more than enough academic coverage out there to create a properly referenced article. What it needs is someone knowledgable in anthropology to pull it together. <a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENuttah68_2daa.html" title="User:Nuttah68">Nuttah68</a> 14:13, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Since it seems like this may be snowballed soon, I want to ask to anyone who chooses to close this, to be very careful when merging. Right now, the parent Melanotan article is very ambiguous in using the term "Melanotan" both to describe the general class of compounds, and as a synonym for "Melanotan I".

The sourceable information from mainstream media is: 1) a brief description of the video; and 2) a brief description of its status as phenomenon, e.g. having been shown on Leno.

<p>Little information is known about the band with no new information in months, with no sign of an album or a performance.

<dd>I agree. The "official website" and "official myspace" have not been updated in months, as well. I do not see any new developments anywhere from and/or about this band.

<li><b>Delete</b> per a comment from <a href="../../../-/j/s/User%7E-js-.html" title="User:-js-">-js-</a> (a native-language Czech speaker with good Slovak) who's kindly translated the article for me. If anyone's curious, it's Slovak and not Czech that we're dealing with here. His translation is on his Talk page, but the salient points read <i>Podbradníkovce are unicellural organisms. Its body consists of only one cell two metres in diameter (it is the biggest known cell, is visible to the human eye). Podbradníkovec lives in very contaminated schools, swimming pools, swamps, dining rooms, attics ... It has to eat 500-800 kg of food every day, otherwise it will die etc etc. IMHO it's a rather poor joke describing a fictional organism not worth translating</i>. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 10:24, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - neither of these articles are critiques at all. They are summaries of his career progression from Bogota to Europe and his first job in Paris. Now, if all performers who have signed a contract with the Paris opera (which one?) are notable, then this guy should have an article. If not, then there is nothing in these sources to indicate this singer is notable. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 00:59, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - The short of it is, this guy is just starting his career, and I see nothing extraordinary. The article, makes it clear that he exists and that he's had two articles written about him in the Colombian press. He has made no records, taken no leading roles in major productions, and he has received no critical reviews from the opera press. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 16:36, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>To the contrary of popular musicians, classic musicians just don't disappear into oblivion after starting their career with positive critiques, and there is more than one notable classical musician who has not yet made a record... and I can't remember any classical music being in the top 100 of any chart since Miguel Rios' adaptation of the final chorus of Beethoven's 9th. And opera press, who are they? <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman"><font face="Amazone BT">Alf</font><font face="Aldine401 BT" size="2"><sup>Photoman</sup></font></a> 17:48, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The question is, who writes the positive critique? Has the subject generated any buzz within the opera community? It boils down to whether or not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> say this guy is any good. Just as there are well respected book, movie, and theatre critics, there are also well respected opera critics.

<li><b>Answer</b> - I don't try to disqualify anybody here, but it is really interesting, that only two professional photographers are criticizing an article about opera singer. Nevertheless, I asked two agencies in Paris and Geneva two send me additional press kit about him. I a going to improve the article with significant information. Back to the rules, there are clearly stated all conditions to post the article. He already meets more then only ONE condition.

<dd><b>Reply</b> - I see. So first you claim the two authors were reputable critics, and now you make no such claim? Next, would you mind telling us which criteria this person has satisfied so far? Finally, anyone who reads Wikipedia's rules can check to see if an article satisfies those rules. At present, I see nothing to indicate this biography satisfies those rules. I will be happy for the singer if indeed he is worthy of an article. I will be just as happy to see his article removed if he is not. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 00:03, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Question</b> - what roles has this subject actually sung in concert with the Paris opera? The second source indicates he hasn't sung anything in concert at all. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 01:05, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>weak keep</b> The roles are listed in the third paragraph under "education and profession" It would have been preferable to add the reviews in the first place--apparently it is not yet generally understood that a WP article needs sources. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> vague claims for roles (performed where, when, and for whom?) may be enough to prevent a speedy delete, but this is an AfD and those statements aren't supported by the sources. While it may not be commonly understood by novice editors that articles need sources (or biographical subjects should be notable), the article was first tagged for sources. It was later prodded with both the sources and notability problems clearly highlighted. Both these tags were ignored and deleted by the creating editor. In short, he/she was well advised prior to this AfD, and the article still lacks reliable, verifiable sources. Remember, the one "source" provided lists two improperly cited articles (it's not even a secondary source). The other source is the OIA and does nothing to verify most of the claims made in the article. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 04:32,</dd>

<li>Roles are indicated in the web page of the agency. I checked other articles about other tenors. Most of are written in same way. Why we are not going to overwrite those articles? Maybe we should revise whole contributions about opera? Article should remain, even to give the chance to improve it. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeritaRTs_db30.html" title="User:VeritaRTs">User:veritaRTs</a></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - this is a <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">WP:SPA</a>. The point I'm making above, is that while the OIA lists the performer's repertoire, it says nothing about if or where these roles were actually performed. The remaining articles are only partially credited reprints of (possibly) real articles – but none of them list any of his performances, either. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 16:55, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>First off, the title is a bit fancrufty. The <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> comic series should never be referred to as the "Archie Comics". Also, Rouge is very much a minor character in both the game and comic universes. All the data from both storylines could be easily combined into one article as it was. I understand that this was done because of the creator's concerns of page length, but a good editing of the main article itself could sort that out easily. (It's filled with fancruft) In fact, the main Rouge article could also go up for deletion, but that'll be considered another time.</p>
<p>I would say that the only characters in need of separate articles between the storylines are Sonic and Knuckles. The latter having has a 32 issue series of his own. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmastergalvatron_cec6.html" title="User:Grandmastergalvatron">GrandMasterGalvatron</a> 15:06, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>As if the Rouge article wasn't crufty enough, Amy is even more so! Amy is a minor character in the games, and an <i>extremely</i> minor character in the comics. She definitely does not warrant two articles. In addition to that, Amy's comic self is a direct clone of her game self...there's hardly any difference between the versions at all. I'm a devoted reader, and I can't think of any..of course, she's mostly background filler anyway.</p>
<p>Actually, the Sonic Character articles could use a good trimming in numbers. As for this one, everything that could be said here can just as well be said in Amy's game article. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmastergalvatron_cec6.html" title="User:Grandmastergalvatron">GrandMasterGalvatron</a> 15:20, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>These just get worse and worse. Rouge and Amy were bad enough, but <i>Shadow???</i> There is no difference at all between his game and comic incarnations. In fact, there was a recent issue involving him which was basically his game in a nutshell. Also, the article itself is little more than a plot synopsis. You could add about two lines to Shadow's game character article and say everything about his comic self with said lines...or even LESS!</p>
<p>Yeah, I seem to be on a roll today but it needs to be done. The <i>Sonic</i> series of articles is plagued with fancruft, and someone's gotta be <b>bold</b> about it!

<li>Not sure if this is the right place to respond but anyway.<br />
Well Talkgold is a big forum which in my opinion is reason enough to add it to wiki.<br />
But that's not all.<br />
Talkgold became a part of the internet history during the time 12dailypro was around, maybe the biggest ponzi scheme ever. 500.000.000$ where invested there altogether.<br />
Because the 12 daily pro forum was closed for new members and censored as well, Talkgold offered thousands of investors a place where they were able to share information, warn others not to join that scam and all the things they were not allowed to do in the original 12dp forum.<br />
The same story applies to other big scam programs like PIPs, "DXinone" etc.<br />
Additionally, Talkgold is, as said in the article, the biggest HYIP discussion forum. Just search for "HYIP forum" and similar terms.<br />
That's why I am against deleting the wiki article.<br />
I don't know which sources you guys mean. You can check google if you want, I guess you know what a number one ranking for such heavily competited terms like "HYIP forum" means.<br />
Additionally, you can ask alexa.com if the website really is in the top 5000, and I can assure you: it is.<br />
It would be great to get some hints from you what else would be good. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 88.73.55.120 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_88.73.55.120_57b3.html" title="Special:Contributions/88.73.55.120">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p>Regular journalist - (not senior staffer, editor), not notable under Wikipedia:Notability (journalists) Rothko65 17:37, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>, while simply being a journalist doesn't make her notable, the referenced New York Times/Washington Post articles written <i>about</i> her seem to indicate she has some degree of notability, even though the current article is kind of a mess. <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKrimpet_fb21.html" title="User:Krimpet">Krimpet</a> 17:54, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>, The articles about her are a New York <i>Sun</i> article (<i>not</i> NYT) and a property damage report <i>within</i> a Washington Post article (i.e. not an article <i>about</i> her). Hardly encyclopaedia material.Rothko65 18:03, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcandeto_0bda.html" title="User:Dcandeto">dcandeto</a> 18:09, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> She is a notable journalist for authoring hundreds of stories in the New York Times <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/jennifer_8_lee/index.html?inline=nyt-per" class="external autonumber" title="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/jennifer_8_lee/index.html?inline=nyt-per" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>. In addition, the article includes the two articles about her parties, one 370 words and the other 1900 words. The one in the Washington Post is most certainly about her partying habits and their effects on the premisis. She gets over 98000 Google hits. The claimed guideline <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28journalists%29_7ddb.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (journalists)">Wikipedia:Notability (journalists)</a> is NOT a guideline, and may never become one. It is just a proposal created a couple of days ago, and it is misleading to refer to it as if it is policy or an established guideline. The implication that it requires deleting this article is a nail in the coffin for its ever becoming a consensus guideline. Maybe at the Muncie Shoppers Guide one would neet to be a "senior staffer" or editor, but not at a world class paper such as the New York Times. It is also a poor idea to nominate an article then add a Delete comment as if the nominator were a different editor. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkpaduta_0868.html" title="User:Inkpaduta">Inkpaduta</a> 19:55, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> she meets the <i>general</i> notability criteria, that being non-trivial mention in multiple sources. The Washington Post article in fact <i>is</i> about her; to put it another way, if it was just an article about some random woman being sued by her landlady for throwing a party, would it have made the WP in the first place? Also it's entitled <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">Reliable Source</a>, so you know it must meet wikipedia guidelines =) Personally I don't see why we need a separate list of notability criteria for journalists either; just clarify that a byline or a staff profile by your own employer does not qualify as a "non-trivial mention" <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliforniaAliBaba_4aaa.html" title="User:CaliforniaAliBaba">cab</a> 23:35, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, sources establish notability <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman"><font face="Amazone BT">Alf</font><font face="Aldine401 BT" size="2"><sup>Photoman</sup></font></a> 01:10, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. All three independent sources (Leiby, Nugent, and Mayerson-Schneider) are about her (the Washington Post article is hardly a "property damage" report--it's about her behavior and actions). She easily passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, whereas <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28journalists%29_7ddb.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (journalists)">Wikipedia:Notability (journalists)</a> is still a proposed guideline. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 03:46, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> she does, in fact, meet the criteria for inclusion. Not to mention I just read about her in yet another source (why she's so popular, I don't know) and had to resort to Googling--my questions were then answered via Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDMCer_9be1.html" title="User:DMCer">DMCer</a> 23:48, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Ms. Lee is one of the most well-known journalists in the United States. That she is "not senior staffer, editor" is irrelevant. Neither was <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessica_Savitch_4c60.html" title="Jessica Savitch">Jessica Savitch</a>.

<li>FYI, <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> makes few recommendations one way or another about when to delete lists. Almost the entire guideline seems to be about how to properly format and edit lists, not when they should be removed. The only possible criteria mentioned for deletion in that guideline that I saw was that the information on the list should be verifiable per WP:V. So whether or not a list is "necessary" isn't talked about in that guideline. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 18:19, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, like all articles a list should be verifiable per WP:V. So all the entries should have proper sourcing. If the list <i>as a whole</i> is unverifiable, it should eventually be deleted. However, in this case, there appear to be a fair number of motorcycle clubs with Wikipedia articles under <a href="../../../m/o/t/Category%7EMotorcycle_clubs_f5d6.html" title="Category:Motorcycle clubs">Category:Motorcycle clubs</a>. <i>Those</i> clubs, at a minimum, could be included in this list assuming that the corresponding articles meet normal Wiki standards. So basically since this list should include as a subset the articles in the category, it is in part a list of articles as well as a list of clubs that might not have Wiki articles but that are otherwise verifiable and somehow worth mentioning (ie don't quite meet the standards for their own article, but are notably referenced somewhere). <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 18:23, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>To answer your question, it is perfectly acceptable to have a list that duplicates a category. The reason is that a list can potentially provide additional information the category can't. For example, in this particular case, the list could provide verifiable almanac style information alongside each entry on the actual city and state of the organization's headquarters, relative sizes, date of founding, and so forth. In addition, the list can include some organizations which do not have full Wikipedia articles and thus would not appear in the category. Simultaneously, the category is useful because it acts as a good subcategory for indexing of articles within its parent, so that if a reader is browsing the parent looking for groups related to hobbies they're interested in the corresponding articles are easy to find.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Thus the existence of a category doesn't necessarily preclude the existence of a list, and vice versa. They serve slightly different purposes and offer slightly different advantages to readers. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 15:54, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Fair cop guvnor, the page as it was before was absolutely appalling. It real reason for existence is that an editor of <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorcycle_club.html" title="Motorcycle club">Motorcycle club</a> has been very efficient in enforcing notability on mentioning in the article any motorcycle club. Thus there are article on Wikipedia not linked to from the article motorcycle club, so this was an attempt to stop / redress the numerous edits made to "Motorcycle club" where editors keep adding links. If you study the very long talk page over at "Motorcycle club" you note there has been a lot of debate around this subject trying to ascertain what is and what isn't a motorcycle club, with different editors taking very different views. A lack of time and a distinct inability on my part to conjure up the correct forms of words to satisfy all editors has prevented me from undertaking a rewrite as per the results of that very long talk page. Some help in conjuring up some words to keep everyone happy would enable the page is be divided as per the talk.... Thus this page up for AFD is severing two purposes, holding some seemingly useful information (to someone somewhere) and trying to stem the tide of repetitive edits/vandalisms/whatever to "Motorcycle club". Hope that makes sense, do ask questions of me if i wasn't clear. <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPickle_UK_324c.html" title="User:Pickle UK">Pickle</a> 16:22, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Never mind. I'll not attempt to rewrite the article given that "bioculture" seems to refer to two different things (unless they are one and the same and I've just gathered the wrong impression): (1) the interaction of the biological and the technological as provided <a href="http://www.biocultures.org/index2.php" class="external text" title="http://www.biocultures.org/index2.php" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and (2) the interaction of the biological and the cultural--also referred to as the biocultural paradigm--as described <a href="http://www.infinityfoundation.com/ECITneuroyogaframe.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.infinityfoundation.com/ECITneuroyogaframe.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I will see if I can find some academic sources to clarify the issue. Nonetheless, despite this potential confusion (which, again, may only be the result of a misunderstanding on my part), I still think the article ought to be kept in lieu of the added references and the actuality of the subject. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 03:04, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The difference seems not to be one of separate definitions, but rather one of separate focus: Leatherman and Goodman focus specifically on anthropology and Dufour focuses on human biology, but their definition of the concept is essentially the same. The topic is most definitely notable: by doing a search for appearances of the word "bioculture" or "biocultural" in article titles, I receive 18 article results for the AJPA alone. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 03:40, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is not just a game minor screen. It's an item that lets you check how well you are progressing and records your information.

<li>I thought the aim of the game was to collect all the badges and the Pokemon? If there was a generic article on progress screens in games in general, I'd be all for a redirect and slight merge. Progress and stats screens in games are pretty important. But a specific example for a single game series, in my personal opinion is not. Also, the "stars" information is much better suited to a walkthrough or game guide (per [[WP:NOT#INDISCRIMINATE 4 (not an instruction manual or "how-to", and until it is the <i>subject</i> of multiple scholarly works or newspaper items, should be restricted to that area. -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">saberwyn</a> 02:58, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> There are indeed good book reviews, and I added two; Furthermore, the book has been translated into many languages.

<p>The article makes a claim of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability,</a> that this message board is "The largest ezboard message board on the internet", but the source it cites does not seem to clearly support that claim, and the article otherwise lacks the multiple independent sources that would help it pass <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. <a href="../../../f/i/s/User%7EFisherQueen_a50d.html" title="User:FisherQueen">FisherQueen</a> (<a href="../../../f/i/s/User_talk%7EFisherQueen_b952.html" title="User talk:FisherQueen">Talk</a>) 18:59, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

They have since supported the claim. That should make you happy.</p>

<li>No, they haven't "supported the claim". There still aren't multiple independent references in the article - the external links are to a hitcounter, a blog, a board archive and some "controversy" on the board. The article also needs fixing badly. The major section is all about "Member Controversies" which is patently unencyclopedic trivia and needs to go.

<li><b>Delete</b> I ran across this page when I reverted some vandalism done to it while patrolling recent changes. My sense is that this site is not notable enough to rate an encyclopedia entry. It may have been mentioned on an MTV reality show or a Hollywood gossip television tabloid, but I don't consider these to be particularly reliable sources. The evidentiary links seem to point to other non-notable message boards. I find that these lack credibility, as well.

<p>Most books do not merit separate articles devoted to them. An individual essay being more slight than a monograph, it would, <i>a fortiori</i>, be the rare essay that is sufficiently influential or widely commented-upon or in some other way exceptionally noteworthy to merit a separate article. This essay falls below that threshold, and moreover fails <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> --<a href="../../../r/r/b/User%7ERrburke_948e.html" title="User:Rrburke">Rrburke</a><sup><small>(<a href="../../../r/r/b/User_talk%7ERrburke_ef4a.html" title="User talk:Rrburke">talk</a>)</small></sup> 19:01, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I hope it's acceptable to clarify my reasons for nominating this article, as many of the straw-poll responses suggest I haven't made those reasons clear. I should also probably declare that my Wikipedian orientation lies somewhere between <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Deletionism" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Deletionism" rel="nofollow">deletionism</a> and <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Mergism" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Mergism" rel="nofollow">mergism</a></dd>

<li>Some of the comments refer to the importance of the subject, but by <i>subject</i> these comments appear to mean <i>the new antisemitism</i> and not the essay entitled <i>Progressive Jewish Thought and the New Anti-Semitism.</i> However, the <i>subject</i> of the article is the <i>essay</i>, not the <i>new antisemitism</i>: an essay on a given topic cannot borrow the notability of its subject-matter for purposes of determining whether the essay <i>qua</i> essay is notable and worthy of a separate article. That the topic of an article is notable is irrelevant to whether the essay itself is notable. Were that not the case, any first-year essay on <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i> might qualify to have a Wikipedia article devoted to it because <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i> is notable.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Moreover, some of the claims of notability seem to rest on a confusion between what is <i>notable</i> and what is <i>newsworthy</i>. I agree the essay is <i>newsworthy</i>; I disagree that it's <i>notable</i>, because <i>notability</i> refers, as the guideline states, to a quality that is relatively permanent. This distinction divides what belongs in an encyclopedia from what belongs in a newspaper. Confusing the two is an example of a defect some Wikipedians have dubbed <a href="../../../r/e/c/Wikipedia%7ERecentism_cde3.html" title="Wikipedia:Recentism">recentism</a>. As a rejoinder to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#PAPER" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#PAPER</a> I offer <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTNEWS_ff3e.html" title="WP:NOTNEWS">WP:NOTNEWS</a>. For myself, a rough guide to whether an essay merits a separate article would be the answer to the question <i>Is it an exceptional example of the genre that will continue to be read when the events or conditions it refers to are no longer current?</i> If the answer is <i>yes</i>, perhaps it deserves its own article; if the answer is <i>no</i>, it probably doesn't: for example, Burma is no longer a province of British-controlled India; however, people still read Orwell's <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shooting_an_Elephant_bde8.html" title="Shooting an Elephant">Shooting an Elephant</a> as an exceptional example of the essay genre. <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shooting_an_Elephant_bde8.html" title="Shooting an Elephant">Shooting an Elephant</a>, then, merits an article. If I apply that question to <i>Progressive Jewish Thought and the New Anti-Semitism,</i> I'm almost certain the answer is <i>no</i>.</li>

<li>Much of the commentary in support of keeping the article refer to the accomplished quality of its writing and its other excellent qualities compared with many Wikipedia articles. These qualities are not in doubt, but they're moot. Citing them as a reason for keeping an article puts the cart before the horse: no well-written, well-conceived article merits retention if it treats a subject that falls below the threshold of notability, an issue which ought be treated as prior.</li>

<li>Finally, I want to point out again that this essay is not even cited in the article <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Antisemitism_b40d.html" title="New Antisemitism">New Antisemitism</a>, save in <i>further reading</i>. If it is indeed sufficiently notable to merit its own article, wouldn't one expect the essay to occupy a prominent place in the article devoted to the subject of the essay -- as, for example, an article on the <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dreyfus_Affair_1f7e.html" title="Dreyfus Affair">Dreyfus Affair</a> would have to include a section on <a href="../../../%C3%A9/m/i/%C3%89mile_Zola_888d.html" title="Émile Zola">Zola</a>'s <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/J_accuse.jpg" class="external text" title="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/J_accuse.jpg" rel="nofollow">J'accuse</a>?

<li><b>Comment</b>: no assertion of notability has been made in any of the articles. Many of those voting to keep the article have based this claim on the appearance of some (by no means all) of the individuals in question in a television series that aired for only three weeks and is now on hiatus. The use of a simple Google test reveals that the wrestlers in question are by no means well known - Steven Lyndon has just <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;rls=GGLD%2CGGLD%3A2005-11%2CGGLD%3Aen&amp;q=%22Steven+Lyndon%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;rls=GGLD%2CGGLD%3A2005-11%2CGGLD%3Aen&amp;q=%22Steven+Lyndon%22" rel="nofollow">458 hits</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> WSX is just a small blip of the American wrestling scene, the show was on for like 4 weeks, even OVW/DSW guys are more notable than this. We can't have articles on every wrestler ever born. And there is no way that WSX was the 3rd biggest promotion in wrestling, it was short-lived, and the show wasn't even all that much about wrestling than the bands it featured. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooshakla_a61e.html" title="User:Booshakla">Booshakla</a> 21:09, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> The article as it stands is virtually useless, but if people don't expand on articles of history, no matter how small they are, Wikipedia will never expand to its full potential.

<p>This article is on a few comedic cartoon shorts on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Colbert_Report_3547.html" title="The Colbert Report">The Colbert Report</a> that satirize superhero cartoons. It is hardly <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> enough for its own article. <a href="../../../d/p/o/User%7EDposse_bcc1.html" title="User:Dposse">dposse</a> 22:23, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> As stated on the talk page, the article has many issues. The biggest issue is that there has been absolutely no media coverage about this cartoon. Out of all the articles about the Colbert Report, I have found none that even mention Alpha Squad Seven. In short, this fails <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. <a href="../../../g/d/o/User%7EGdo01_992f.html" title="User:Gdo01">Gdo01</a> 22:25, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, based on the following arguments:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Based on the <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGoogle_Test_6be3.html" title="Wikipedia:Google Test">Google Test</a> (not a concrete test of notability, but it should be considered), there are <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=oEs&amp;q=%22Stephen+Colbert%27s+Alpha+Squad+Seven%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=oEs&amp;q=%22Stephen+Colbert%27s+Alpha+Squad+Seven%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">112 results</a> for "Stephen Colbert's Alpha Squad Seven."</li>
<li>Given Colbert's <i>extreme</i> notability, and the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2006/03/21/stephen-colbert-signs-sev_n_17640.html" class="external text" title="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2006/03/21/stephen-colbert-signs-sev_n_17640.html" rel="nofollow">existing book deal</a>, I'd say that the series has some definite, tangible notability. If <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Lucas_cbb4.html" title="George Lucas">George Lucas</a> made a five-minute craptastic cartoon, you'd bet that it would have notability, <i>because it was made by someone extremely notable</i>.</li>
<li>Cleanup: I will admit that the article is in <i>dire need</i> of cleanup, but AFD is not the cleanup department.</li>
<li>Metaphor argument: Don't all of the other cartoons on <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comedy_Central_c9d4.html" title="Comedy Central">Comedy Central</a> have articles? Do all of the series played on <a href="../../../a/d/u/Adult_Swim_e7c7.html" title="Adult Swim">Adult Swim</a> have articles? Don't even get me started on <a href="../../../p/o/k/Category%7EPok%C3%A9mon_9e8a.html" title="Category:Pokémon">Pokemon</a>.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not sure how this works, but it's probably worth noting that <a href="../../../o/n/i/Oni_Press_08fd.html" title="Oni Press">Oni Press</a> recently began publishing a comic book about this character. For some reason, I can't find the original press release, but here's an appearance at the NY comicon<a href="http://www.onipress.com/blog/?p=22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.onipress.com/blog/?p=22" rel="nofollow">[34]</a> and here's a solicitation for the second issue <a href="http://www.dcbservice.com/search.aspx#1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dcbservice.com/search.aspx#1" rel="nofollow">[35]</a>. Also, regarding Google hits, a search for "Tek Jansen" turns up over 100k <a href="http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;hl=en&amp;q=%22tek+jansen%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;hl=en&amp;q=%22tek+jansen%22" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. No third-party reliable sources. The cartoons are merely one of <i>many</i> recurring segments on The Colbert Report, which do not all need individual articles. Part of the claim made by the article to establish the subject's notability is incorrect -- Tek Jansen did not start out as a book which was then made into a cartoon for the Colbert Report; No Tek Jansen media of any kind was published before the series was introduced on The Report. There's no reason to treat the cartoon as a distinct series from the Colbert Report, and no obvious way to fill out an entire article on this subject without violating WP:NOT and WP:RS. -- <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Bailey_63ba.html" title="User:Lee Bailey">Bailey</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELee_Bailey_a8f7.html" title="User talk:Lee Bailey"><font color="black">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:47, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>You're checking the online edition of Routledge which is different than their actual published encyclopedias. A reference was left and I suggest you check it before you get all up in arms about this. It would be against what we're working toward here at Wikipedia to delete an article with a reputable reference. And Chris Sabo would be the first to admit to you that he beats off all the time, and if you want I can provide a reference for that too. --140.103.193.66 14:42, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Delete as hoax. Not only is the article itself self-indicting, but the so-called reference fails to check out. There is no reference to Jakob Meils in the <i>Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy</i> printed or online. There is no 2006 printed edition of that work. The last printed edition with that exact title was 1998 and it was ten volumes. The 2000 edition was entitled <i>Concise Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy</i> at 1030 p. The 2005 printed version was entitled <i>The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy</i> at 1077 p. The lack of an ISBN in the Wikipedia article is suggestive of the fact that the publication is non-existent, and that is confirmed by both Routledge and Baker &amp; Taylor. The online version currently only contains the text of the <i>Concise</i> version.

<li><b>Keep</b>, I shall make this short, because my reasons should be self explanitory. <b>This is not a random baseball card set posted on Wikipedia.</b> <b>This set, is in fact, the first of its kind.</b> It was the first set where in every pack of cards the owner would recieve a limited edition graded card. <b>This was a major moment in card collecting history.</b> Not only that, it was nearly impossible for anyone to find out what the complete set contained. I spent years researching this, and I finally learned of the entire set's contents. Therefore, since I was already writing a Wikipedia page about the set, I figured I would release the entire sets contents to the world, bringing a meaning to my research. <b>Before deciding to delete any Wikipage that does not interest you, I suggest that you at least READ THE ARTICLE to find out why it is here in the first place.</b> Although not long, it has provided information that I have recieved some emails that thanked me for finally releasing the article. This is, in essence, no different that the pointless deletion of the <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donruss.html" title="Donruss">Donruss</a> page awhile back. Please, look at it now, its a completely stripped down page from what It used to be. Wikipedia isn't just about getting medals for clearing up wasted space, its actually an encyclopedia and should be treated as such.

<dd>Yes wikipedia is a encyclopedia, but this isn't the type of info that is needed in this site. We aren't beckett, people looking for a list of cards from that set will look at the beckett or the baseball reference wiki first rather than here. I'm a long time collector of thousands of sports cards and I could name 20 sets that are more important than this, 1952 Topps, and 2003-04 Exquite collection comes to mind. The set was just some bonus cards that a fan could get in the all-star game, I got several of the cards in my collection, nothing special. <a href="../../../j/a/r/User%7EJaranda_ee94.html" title="User:Jaranda">Jaranda</a> <a href="../../../j/a/r/User_talk%7EJaranda_87d5.html" title="User talk:Jaranda"><sup>wat's sup</sup></a> 04:43, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I understand, because I am the person who researched this for Beckett, along with Rich Klein (I'm sure you've heard of him if you read Beckett). There is no question that there are more important sets than this, but it is notable nonetheless. How about I combine this article into another baseball article, or create one devoted only to notable sets? That way the encyclopedia can be expanded with other sets included, not just 1 - there's no Wikipedia rule that says articles can't be long. Look, I'm fairly new to Wikipedia, and I just wanted to contribute something useful that I could expand on further as time went on. I will also remove the checklist (if thats the only way I can save my article). I only request to mave my page preserved long ebough for me to make the changes (another day or two) because I am quite busy with work now.

<dd>The entire topic (GAMES) should be expanded and backed up with strong and reliable sources. This is the 21st century, ladies and gentlemen. It is about "time."</dd>
<dd>Those of us blessed with children, in any school, in any place in this world, know full well that this topic deserves a large and bright spot... in any encyclopedia. We have an obligation, in my opinion, to provide the world with current reliable information. If we lose the children, we lose the world. Help to make this institution more reliable for our schools? Sounds like a good idea to me.</dd>
<dd>I am a single father of 3 girls. (ages 11. 15. and 23.) I love Wikipedia; use it all the time. My children cannot use Wikipedia (as a factual reference) in our school system in Illinois, more often than not, because of either,
<ul>
<li>1. Lack of pertinent (up to date) content, or</li>
<li>2. lack of reliable sources, or</li>
<li>3. The ability of vandals to change the truth, at will. (This is the worst one in my opinion.)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I prefer that my children come here for knowledge and an understanding of the world than many other places they are likely to go on the web.</dd>
<dd>Finally, I mention "the children" because it is timely to consider that most companies with a vision for the future, plan for repeat users well into the next generation, or more. (e.g., I cite Apple, Inc. as a primary example of this.)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, on the basis the nominator fails to have provided a strong basis for deletion.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Fancruft. A list of minigames is unnecessary. If they are notable or ground-breaking they should be merged into the main Mario Party 2 article. Going by the precedent in WP:Fiction, Wikipedia's goal is to summarize and be reasonably short, not give detailed descriptions. So far the arguments in keeping just amount to wanting it for the sake of the children, someone using it as a substitute for Gamefaqs for minigame info, and that being poorly written, unreferenced list of unnotable minigames isn't enough to delete when it very well is. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChevinki_c5c7.html" title="User:Chevinki">Chevinki</a> 09:17, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> The Fancruft argument against lists has been tried in the Mario 3-7; it failed to be persuasive. The 3-7 nomination was withdrawn. The same argument was used in the Mario 8 and the result was "no consensus." The list stayed. <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Nysted_e100.html" title="User:Lee Nysted">Lee Nysted</a> 15:05, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Del</b> as n-n. I was indeed concerned by what seemed to me a promotional tone, tho that of course is irrelevant to this discussion of whether an encyclopedic article on her can be written (quite distinct from the current quality of the article).

<li><b>Keep</b>. What's the harm in including her as long as the inclusion follows Wikipedia's policy.

<li><b>Keep</b>- I disagree Joyous: WP states "Articles that can be improved should be edited OR tagged, NOT nominated for deletion". I didn't constitute subject matter as being promotional. Links are clear as to her writings and painting exhibits. Ms. Osborne doesn't fall into "Rubbish" content pages. I vote to leave her on plus she appears to have some wits abour her.

<li><b>Delete</b> There is little notability asserted in the article. Her work looks good. But Wikipedia requires "non-trivial" sources. I don't think that includes personal web sites. Notability can be established by critical reviews, or a more than just passing mention in serious publications unrelated to the artist, as well as by other means. When that can be supplied, I think the work would support inclusion. I like the paintings. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 00:13, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I can't help but wonder how 11 (eleven!) graffiti artists of Melbourne, escaped deletion, and an obviously serious artist such as Max Miller can get deleted. All thirteen of the Melbourne street graffiti artists have articles of their own. Is it that this artist (Max Miller) is merely toiling away in traditional art, and the street artists are agitating for world change? Is political point of view a criterion for inclusion/deletion? <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 01:09, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Not in the articles for deletion process, that is. The reason why there are no distinctions, based on category of art being considered, is because the same criteria are applied to all. Unless you can show me that different criteria are applied, or should be applied, based on the type of art being considered, then votes are all the same. You or someone else may wish to voice an opinion that different categories of art should have different criteria applied to them, as concerns their validity for inclusion. I would be open to entertaining that thought. But that would have to be articulated by someone advocating for that. As it now stands, all visual art articles are subject to the same standards for inclusion. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBus_stop_aacf.html" title="User:Bus stop">Bus stop</a> 17:14, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not wishing to speak for <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnbod_859e.html" title="User:Johnbod">Johnbod</a>, I however took his comment to mean a vote on a group of articles, rather than a single article. For example, if several abstract expressionists were under AfD together, it would be informally the "abstract expressionist vote" or at least that's what I had thought he meant. The reason they weren't deleted was precisely because they were grouped together and consensus was difficult to reach. Individually, most of them would most likely have been deleted. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshacconci_f743.html" title="User:Freshacconci">Freshacconci</a> 17:21, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Well anyways I don't see the Who's Who thing much, because I'm in there and you don't see me writing an article on myself, do you? The Photographers thing is interesting and I don't think Wikipedia has an article on this event and since it seems to be a major thing that many editors don't know about, I am currently putting these facts into my decision and I will be with you shortly. ^_^.<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_ov_the_blue_sand_359d.html" title="User:Sam ov the blue sand"><span style="color: #ff0000">Sam</span> <span style="color: #000000">ov</span> <span style="color: #000000">the</span> <span style="color: #0000ff">blue</span> <span style="color: #808000">sand</span></a> 01:35, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> the assertions of N are not convincing: took part as one of a group of exchange journalists between two very small sister cities; first place in 2 Nevada state fairs; this is simply not a notable career as a photographer.

As for DGG's comment "Not a notable career as a photographer" define your standards for such a career. If your putting a three year old career against say Ansel Adams, bruce dale, robbert cappa, or Charles O'Rear then of course it is not notable. if you keep it in context that walt sorensen is a local photographer in the second largest city in Utah, and with a 2 year old career was selected for an artist exchange then yes it is notable.<a href="../../../p/h/o/User%7EPhotodude_fa37.html" title="User:Photodude">photodude</a> 16:02, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>For those of you who don't know since last November I have had a wikipedia page. Today I discovered several things. 1 the page was vandalized. and 2) shortly after I fixed the vandalism, it was nominated for deletion. I'm sad about this because I don't think I have a chance in this white bitter cold world of saving the page. so I'm totally depressed and will soon drowned my sorrows in bubbely. If you have a Wikipedia account I ask for your vote to save my page if you don't have an account get one and add your vote. This is what I ask. There is only a 5 day window for this so please hurry.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>:Yes there was vandalism, re-read the history I corrected spelling walther reverted back to walt, these changes were made by user 67.171.124.246 who claimed walt sorensen (photographer) was Walther Mathius Sorensen.

<li>R U Joe King, Mr Eye? Or, as an answer to your question, hmm, what's the negative equivalent of "Does a pope shit in the woods?" I get the strong impression that being listed by the "Cambridge Who's Who" depends less on the kind of merit that gets you listed by a "Who's Who" of one of the varieties that libraries bother with, and a lot more on your willingness to donate a couple of sawbucks or whatever is the going rate. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 06:19, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: as for the question of self promotion. all articles on wikipedia are created from one of three sources 1) the person or company the article is about 2) a PR firm or 3) a fan. it is still possible for any one of these sources to write a objective and Neutral point of view on the subject. it is content not the author that determines whether an article is self-promotion or informative.<a href="../../../p/h/o/User%7EPhotodude_fa37.html" title="User:Photodude">photodude</a> 16:02, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Response</b>: Actually Walt/(<a href="../../../p/h/o/User%7EPhotodude_fa37.html" title="User:Photodude">photodude</a>/166.70.88.70), you are wrong about this. A basic tenant of Wikipedia is the achievement of NPOV - Neutral Point of View. This cannot be achieved in an autobiography. May I suggest that you review several Wiki policies? <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_interest_727a.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest">Wikipedia:Conflict of interest</a> explains how important NPOV is to writing an objective encyclopedia. <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Wikipedia:Autobiography</a> is a guideline that explains the problem with autobiographies and how difficult it is to achieve NPOV when writing about yourself. Its a good thing to believe in yourself and to think that your accomplishments deserve widespread recognition. But if you really think this, then its only a matter of time until others acknowledge your achievements, and write an encyclopedia entry about you. I suggest that you wait for that to happen. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMindsEye_e83c.html" title="User:TheMindsEye">TheMindsEye</a> 16:49, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>comment</b> Difficult, yes, but not impossible. This is one of the many articles that show how difficult it is. There are, unfortunately, also many articles in WP begun as autobios and never checked independently, or with no third-party sources--all well worth deletion--or, possibly, upgrading That they can be upgraded is shown by the many respected WP articles begun as autobios--and were then carefully checked and references added if necessary by independent editors. We need to go article by article, just as we are doing now. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 23:13, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>comment</b> before I wrote the article I made sure to read all the guidelines about creating such an article. I understood the difficulty of the issue, the downside is many editors believe it can't be done. but as DGG beautifully put many well respected articles started as autobios; thank you DGG. I hope for the article to stay and for other editors to contribute as they feel they should. The downside for this article is most of the information about it is in hard copy, limited circulation or has limited reliance. This makes obtaining and citing 3rd party sources difficult, I also limited much of the information and references to only the details available online or that I made available. <a href="../../../p/h/o/User%7EPhotodude_fa37.html" title="User:Photodude">photodude</a> 16:43, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>COMMENT</b> I fail to see how this would be construed as "blatant self promotion." I agree it's impossible to ever write a completely non-biased account of anything. Regardless of the topic, the author's individual preferences are bound to come through to some degree or other. If the article requirements constitute a third party as a ghost writer for any article to achieve true neutrality then the rules themselves are contradictory. I don't see it as whether or not this is "blatant self promotion" but what the overall intent behind the article is. In its own right the article displays very little persuasive structure one way or the other and instead focuses on listing a "travel log" of sorts in the subject's progressive history with verifiable sources. As for the insinuation that the subject could buy his way into the Cambridge Who's Who book, I'd like to see the college photography student with funds capable of making a noted donation. If you can prove that this article was written with the intent of feeding the subject's ego, market familiarity, and/or pocket book and not simply as being a documentary and something that others may be referred to for informational purposes, then I will vote for deletion as well.--<span style="color: #990000">RedJaron</span> 08:41, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Response</b>: Sorensen/photodude himself has said above <i>the answer to the question on who's who Merit vs money is money</i>. This particular "Who's Who" is merely a business: you give them the money (probably not much), they stick you in their book, they hope that you will then shell out a couple of hundred bucks (really) for a copy of this book. When not taking photos, Sorensen is working in some Utah company that photodude suggests is doing pretty well; I'd guess that it pays enough to finance expenses such as this. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 09:33, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>comment</b> All who's who, including Mariquis, the answer to merit vs money is money before merit. Some will not include nominees without someone shelling out for it; and others include the nominee then try to get them to pay, to get their own copy of the book, certificate and lapel pin and other knickknacks. As for Sorensen working for a Utah company, he is an on staff photographer at the company with a title that sounds like he does more. Pay is competitive for such a position. The who's who only has relivence so much as nominations are third party which identifies merit. Cambridge who's who does not have a self nomination which some who's who do.<a href="../../../p/h/o/User%7EPhotodude_fa37.html" title="User:Photodude">photodude</a> 23:21, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> (i) It is not true that <i>all</i> editions of books that carry the title <i>Who's Who</i> do this. And even if it were true, that would not make the case for keeping an article on Sorensen (aka yourself) more persuasive. (ii) The company for which Sorensen works (you work) is small, so it's hardly surprising that he is (you are) a (the) staff photographer there. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 23:42, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> The point of my comment was notable local interests are still qualified for articles. The issue of local notability vs larger notability has brought up several times in this discussion. The issue can be resolved by categorization. All notability on a subject falls into at least into one of the following areas: local, regional, national, trivial, popular and historical etc. “Notability is not synonymous with "fame" or "importance".” Fame or importaince is something many wiki editors confuse notability with. "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of at least one substantial or multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject and of each other.”</dd>

<p>as for the notability of Walt Sorensen as an artist, I shall quote from Wikipedia:Notability (artists) “notability as an artist is defined by the notability of his/her art. Notable art is: b) A piece acquired by government (national, state or major city) and put on public display.” Under this guide line Walt Sorensen has 6 notible art pieces. The 5 pieces that were displayed durring the Nantou are part of a permanent collection on public display in the Nantou city hall. The Last piece was a photograph of West Valley City including the E-center in West Valley City, this piece was commisioned by West Valley and 2 Prints were made of it. One is on public display in the Nantou Taiwan city hall, the other is on Public Display in West Valley City’s City Hall. Thanks for getting me to look this information up, this should be added to the Walt Sorensen article <a href="../../../p/h/o/User%7EPhotodude_fa37.html" title="User:Photodude">photodude</a> 02:16, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, and I believe you're mistaken.

<dd>I couldn't begin to guess. Perhaps the web-master was Latvian.

<dd>Well, looking around I really couldn't find anything about the origin of the phrase. Most mentions of the site were blogs that provided a link and a little summary. I'm unsure on how we might go about finding out when it was first used in Windows. I'm not sure whether we would err on the side of inclusion or exclution if we can't find evidence of which proceeded which.</dd>
