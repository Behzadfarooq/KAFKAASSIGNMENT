<p>The result of the debate was <b>merge and delete</b>. Among the policy-based opinions voiced below, there is an overwhelming consensus that an article with this title should not exist. It is absolutely irrelevant whether the article is of sufficient length, has references, etc. Rather, this debate is about the inherent merit of the topic of this article and its place within the larger context of related articles. Those who have actually managed to address these core issues of this debate are clearly in favor of not including an article on this topic in this encyclopedia. Opinions on merging are a bit more divided; however, merging worthwhile changes between related articles is standard procedure. However, any necessary mergers may have already happened (see Alphax' comment). There is no overwhelming support for leaving behind a redirect. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a>&#160;<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">(call me collect)</a></small> 10:09, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Remember, no vote-stacking please (it is frowned upon) and in particular no sockpuppetry. Do assume good faith, and debate with civility here. Your opinon should be based on the merit/demerit of the article itself, and not by the events from the previous AfD. - <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMailer_diablo_6ffa.html" title="User:Mailer diablo">Mailer Diablo</a> 05:28, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would also like to ask that persons expressing their views avoid posting long copies of policies which we already know. Lengthy arguments or replies to opinions you dislike should be placed on the talk page (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EArticles_for_deletion_Rationales_to_impeach_George_W._Bush_%283rd_nomination%29_3eef.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion/Rationales to impeach George W.

<ul>
<li><i>This article is merely a soapbox for Wikipedia editors who want George W. Bush impeached. We already have an article called Movement to impeach George W. Bush, which in my opinion is informative and NPOV.

<li><b>Very Strong Delete</b> POV soapbox. To begin with, impeachment is a process restricted to the legislative branch and can only begin and end there. There is no serious discussion on The Hill about beginning these processes.

<dd>Note that this article is <b>not</b> titled "Movement to impeach George W. Bush". So whether or not there is or is not <i>"serious discussion on The Hill about beginning these processes"</i> is completely irrelevant to <b>this</b> article, which is about <b>reasons</b> for impeachment, not the <b>movement</b> for impeachment. Those <b>reasons</b> certainly do exist and are notable, quite apart from whether the movement for impeachment exists or who may or may not be participating in it. -- <a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoosphere_6ec7.html" title="User:Noosphere">noosph</a><a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoosphere_Esperanza_2f72.html" title="User:Noosphere/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../n/o/o/User%7ENoosphere_6ec7.html" title="User:Noosphere">re</a> 05:44, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> given that the main article this was split from, <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movement_to_impeach_George_W._Bush_9b23.html" title="Movement to impeach George W. Bush">Movement to impeach George W. Bush</a>, is far too long and needs to be cut down so that article can include the rationales, and I don't think that voting for a merge would achieve that. Nevertheless, as a second choice I would support a merge if the parent article were cut down significantly so that Wikipedia doesn't just wind up with one double-length article. Note that the title of this article has been changed to <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rationales_provided_by_advocates_of_the_impeachment_of_George_W._Bush_8ea4.html" title="Rationales provided by advocates of the impeachment of George W.

Each section of the article is covered in greater detail in several other articles (<a href="../../../n/s/a/NSA_warrantless_surveillance_controversy_c517.html" title="NSA warrantless surveillance controversy">NSA warrantless surveillance controversy</a>, Bush-Blair memos, and so forth). The only function served by the current article is to create summaries of those articles (offering an opportunity to introduce POV) and install a level of indirection between <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movement_to_impeach_George_W._Bush_9b23.html" title="Movement to impeach George W. Bush">Movement to impeach George W. Bush</a> and the primary description of the events which have motivated the movement. Verifiable information which is not included in those other articles linked under the section headers should be merged to the appopriate articles, and the current article deleted; the page on the movement can point to those articles directly. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChoess_95be.html" title="User:Choess">Choess</a> 05:44, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strongest possible Delete, redirect, and protect against recreation</b> This article is just a soap-box for people who don't like Bush. It is an inherent violation of WP:NPOV. Also, I don't know exactly what Mailer Diablo means by "vote stacking", but no one has been able to provide any policy link that says people can't recruit additional participants to an AfD. Sock-puppetry is prohibited. Get out the vote campaigns are not prohibited. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 05:44, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Which is not against WP policy, how ever much some people may not like it. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 06:58, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>How about <i>It's also inappropriate to invite "all one's friends" to help argue an article</i> (quote from <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">official policy on sockpuppetry</a>, more on the subject in that same paragraph.) Is this policy real and applicable? <a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWeregerbil_edbb.html" title="User:Weregerbil">Weregerbil</a> 09:59, 4 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's valid, just not applicable. That quote is from a section titled <i>Advertising and soliciting single-purpose accounts</i>. It reads in context "It's also inappropriate to invite 'all one's friends' to help argue an article. Soliciting people to create accounts for the purpose of arguing on your side is not an acceptable practice on Wikipedia." The policy is about recruiting your-off wiki friends to come create a single purpose account. That hasn't happened here, so that policy is not on point. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 19:24, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Meatpuppetry means a person recruiting other people on an online forum or something of that like, not asking established WP members to comment, at least in my interpretation of the definition. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueGoose_a607.html" title="User:BlueGoose">BlueGoose</a> 15:12, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Which is serious weaselwording (<a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">WP:WEASEL</a>). I don't see anything so very special about stacking an AfD vote with people who would otherwise never notice a debate (outsiders) as opposed to stacking an AfD vote with people who would otherwise never notice a debate (WP editors who don't normally follow AfD). There's a point where, strange though it may sound in the partisan We Have To Get Those Guys And Screw The Rules climate in the United States, common sense ought to prevail for a change. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 19:51, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: The above comments are very disturbing. Wikipedia's debates, except those on policy changes, tend to follow a format along the lines of policy application. In a perfect deletion debate, the points of contention would be along the notability guidelines <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, and <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>; inclusion policies <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> are also common points of contention. Certain policies, like common courtesy (<a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>), user identification (<a href="../../../s/i/g/WP%7ESIG_e615.html" title="WP:SIG">WP:SIG</a>), and no use of sockpuppets or meatpuppets (<a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>), are expected to be followed. These last three policies that I listed are old. Very, very old. They are core tenets of the system, and the system cannot be expected to function correctly without them in place. The fact that not just <i>one</i> editor, but in fact <i>two</i> editors, have expressed blatant disregard for one of these policies is something that should make all of us sit up and pay attention. To the two editors who say that <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> does not apply, I say this: Wikipedia is not a democracy. We operate on debate and consensual process. "Get out the vote" is appropriate in America, where the person with the most money gets elected, but it doesn't work here. The closing admin has the last word on which votes count. If you actively engage in meatpuppetry, your votes and their votes may not be counted. Instead of quantity, focus on quality — make quality arguments. - <strong><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorbinSimpson_55db.html" title="User:CorbinSimpson"><font color="#0033CC">Corbin</font></a> <a href="../../../w/p/m/WP%7EWPM_9a68.html" title="WP:WPM"><font color="red">∫</font></a> <a href="../../../8/w/_/WP%7E8W_03c1.html" title="WP:8W"><font color="orange">1</font></a> <a href="../../../m/e/a/WP%7EMEA_d033.html" title="WP:MEA"><font color="gold">ɱ</font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><font color="lime">p</font></a> <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPATRA_5b5c.html" title="WP:SPATRA"><font color="blue">s</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_CorbinSimpson_9722.html" title="Special:Contributions/CorbinSimpson"><font color="indigo">ɔ</font></a> <a href="../../../w/p/m/WP%7EWPMU_ef61.html" title="WP:WPMU"><font color="violet">♫</font></a></strong> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECorbinSimpson_68d4.html" title="User talk:CorbinSimpson">Rock on, dude!</a></sup> 03:31, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Why is it not possible that there is objective evidence for the impeachment of a president? This article can provide these rationales. Also, it is bad faith to put an article up for Deletion for the second time in a day, when the previous article name also had an AfD finishing today. This seems to be an abuse of the process for purely political reasons. If people put this much effort into making the article NPOV it would be done by now.

<li><b>Keep and rename</b> per my reasons on the SECOND delete nom. Gah. In brief: If there are U.S. Congressmen who are moving to impeach Bush, then the reasons should be enumerated somewhere.

<li><b>Delete</b> Kotepho says above that "Cited sopaboxing by others" is allowed. I disagree. While I assume we have articles on white supremacy, anti-semitism, nazism, and so on, bringing together arguments from these diverse sources into an article Reasons why Jews secretly control the world would be unacceptable on so many grounds I can't list them all. This article is basically the same, starting with a book about impeachment and then piling on with everything that has happened in the last 6 years that is supposedly GWB's fault. The desires of some to see George Bush impeached are not a topic for an encylopedia entry unless they have some foundation in reality (and by this I mean the reality of the impeachment process, not the reality of having been stated in a quotable source). No one in the House of Representatives has even <i>proposed</i> a <i>draft</i> of Articles of Impeachment. Inclusion of particular topics as "rationales" is based on highly POV sources, and constitutes original research, crystal balling and soapboxing by the wikipedia editors involved.

<dd>Comment: George W. Bush is the top political leader of the militarily most powerful State on this planet. "The Jews" are a fuzzily-defined set of millions of people, whose membership is often a matter of personal religious/cultural identity, and which contains people of a vast variety of different social, cultural, political and linguistic traditions. The reasons presented by people advocating the impeachment of Bush for actions he allegedly took (of failed to take) as part of his role as President of the USA may be right or wrong, but they have no relation to <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_stereotype.html" title="Ethnic stereotype">racist stereotyping</a> or conspiracy theories; rather, they are part of a documentable phenomenon of major international political importance. <a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBoud_7cef.html" title="User:Boud">Boud</a> 23:24, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

Essays may be well written, carefully argued or achieve notability, for instance, <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bertrand_Russell_85bc.html" title="Bertrand Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>'s well-known <i>Why I Am Not a Christian</i>; however, essay material is not and can not ever be an encyclopedia entry.

Nor is it fixable by any amount of editing to couch everything in third-person phrasing. Nor is it fixable by providing more references ("some people agree with me" can be demonstrated for nearly any opinion on any topic).

<li>I did object, and do object, on the basis of _two_ premises. In any case, there was a very short span of time between the first and the second nomination. My second basis is the reason the vote was stopped: because it has been tainted by vote stacking. And now Merecat has been blocked for vote stacking. So I think my second premise is reasonably substantiated. albeit it may seem hyperbolic, it is true: i simply have not seen a more egregious example of vote stacking. so yes, i do object, on those grounds. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_baas_eec8.html" title="User:Kevin baas">Kevin Baas</a><sup><a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_baas_1af8.html" title="User talk:Kevin baas">talk</a></sup> 01:32, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

Vote stacking has allready happened, for this vfd. Most of the votes to delete betray the fact and problem that the voters haven't actually bothered to read the article, its references, or the articles discussion page. This isn't consensus process, its pack psychology and anarchy masquerading as such because of the ways the system is being gamed. The Article is about factual movements to impeach which are noteworthy because millions of people share the idea that impeachment should happen and because there are factually better than a dozen cogent legal reasons to impeach legally. Bush HAS IN FACT BROKEN SEVERAL LAWS.

<dd>hahahaha I agree with Nasa. Besides, what laws are you talking about? Are you even aware that Bush does not make decisions by himself. There's an entire group of people from Congress to the Executive Branch to the Supreme Court that are all responsible for policy. Congress has give authority to the President to do everything he has done. Further, he was put in that position to execute the powers of President by the people of the United States through an election which was certified and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. He has exercised his contitutional authority to stretch the law during a time of war. The fact of the matter is, and the Department of Justice has verified all of his actions in the legal realm especially in dealing with the war and terrorism, for which no laws exist to govern thus no laws to be broken. The President himself has never been proven to have broken any laws. When an entire government bureaucracy exists to execute policy it is extremely difficult to point fingers at a single individual as responsible which is why impeachments so rarely occur.--<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 20:11, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I reiterate, impeachment is a <i>political</i> decision. Congress could impeach the president for jaywalking if it wanted to. The <i>only</i> question is whether a majority of House members would vote out an article of impeachment on the ground raised.

<dd>Which is exactly why this piece shouldn't be an article on its own. It is the POV of a number of parties that these misdeeds rise to the level of impeachment.

<dd>While I see and appreciate your point of view, I still believe that "high crimes and misdemeanors" does not cover everything under the sun. Certainly, any House member could try to raise an impeachment bill on any topic. But "He bungled the Katrina situation" isn't even a <i>crime</i>. There can be arguments made for violating the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_Powers_Act_722a.html" title="War Powers Act">War Powers Act</a>, certainly, and perhaps violations of post <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lyndon_Johnson_a119.html" title="Lyndon Johnson">Johnson</a> and <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nixon_9d26.html" title="Richard Nixon">Nixon</a>-era curbs on presidential powers over the intelligence services in the warrantless wiretapping business. Yet, realistically, nobody's going to bring an article of impeachment for his acting like a clay golem during Katrina (if that were true, he ought to share the dock with <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Chertoff_c663.html" title="Michael Chertoff">Michael Chertoff</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Landrieu_7a0b.html" title="Mary Landrieu">Mary Landrieu</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Nagin_a73c.html" title="Ray Nagin">Ray Nagin</a>) or being vindictive over <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Wilson_f7b9.html" title="Joseph Wilson">Joseph Wilson</a>'s Yellowcake article -- unless he <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">perjured</a> himself over it, or ordered <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nixon_9d26.html" title="Richard Nixon">wider-ranging crimes</a> due to it.

<dd>Ah, but Jackson <i>was</i> impeached by the House - he simply wasn't removed by the Senate.

<li><b>Delete, Merge, or Cleanup</b> - The article currently reads like a proposal for President Bush's impeachment, though some of the information it includes may prove valuable. I suggest either moving some of its information to another article such as <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movement_to_impeach_George_W._Bush_9b23.html" title="Movement to impeach George W. Bush">Movement to impeach George W. Bush</a> and deleting or redirecting it, or rewording the article so as to eliminate POV.--Conrad Devonshire 00:39, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. All of the information can be summarised in the article on the impeachment movement, with links to the articles on the individual controversies, and links to some of the more significant references where people are calling for impeachment. Impressively enough, this Deletion page is now roughly as big as the article itself. (And for the record, no I wasn't "recruited" by a vote stacker, and yes I wouldn't mind seeing Bush impeached but that doesn't mean I think this article deserves to be on WP). <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConMan_d21d.html" title="User:ConMan">Confusing Manifestation</a> 00:59, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I was thinking about not voting, since I got a message on my Talk page to vote, and this is probably because I voted <i>delete</i> in the 2nd nomination. But on the other hand, I would have stumbled on this anyway since I do so many AfDs. So, it's all good. Anyway, I still think this is an obvious POV fork. More than that, Thatcher's arguments are extremely compelling; he's hit the nail on the head and was able to articulate the problem with this article way better than I could. And let me be clear, I am not saying delete the article because it contains I bunch of POV. I have voted <i>keep</i> whenever that was the only reason an article was up for AfD because that is not a valid reason to delete an article. However, this article is <i>inherently</i> POV; the <i>very reason</i> for this article to exist is to push a small minority's opinion. --<a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDeville_64d2.html" title="User:Deville">Deville</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/v/User_talk%7EDeville_300c.html" title="User talk:Deville">Talk</a>) 01:16, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> as opinion. The entire article is built upon a rhetorical prompt: What if King George were impeachable? More importantly, how would he be impeached? The article is nothing but fluff designed to answer that question. It doesn't matter how neutrally it's written, or how well-sourced and verifiable it is. The mere idea that there are advocates and protesters who have points of view guarantees the presence of POV and opinion. What we see here is simply the systemic bias at work: The community agrees that there are answers to that question, and that the question as phrased can be definitively answered. Of course, the community does not realize that a neutral encyclopedia cannot address that question, but that did not matter to the authors of this article. I mean, I'm more liberal than many people, including the original authors of the article, but I'm also fair and honest, and this article needs to be deleted before people read it and notice that there is opinion in it.

<li>Key distinction: all of the "Reasons to X" that you raise are directed at the everyman; e.g., reasons why <i>you</i> should become a Buddhist, vote Libertarian, or join the Crips. However, <i>you</i> can not impeach the president, only Congress can. Ergo, these are arguments as to what acts the proponents of these arguments believe should compell <i>Congress</i> to impeach, i.e. what acts the proponents deem not merely persuasive to the average citizen, but fitting within the legal rubric and artifice of an impeachment discussion among members of Congress, based on impeachment precedent and the like. <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background:gold"><i><b>BD2412</b></i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><b>T</b></a> 16:09, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I broke out the votes by detail, so I don't understand what your issue is. I simply included this as an FYI for anyone interested as it is becoming difficult to count the votes. The reason I included a total for "merge/delete/redirect" is that they all effectively result in the article going away, just via different mechanisms, plus as indicated, many people included these together while the only vote that included both "cleanup" (keep) "delete" and "merge" was listed separately. The closing admin will need to determine consensus, not just vote tallies. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a><b>•</b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Doug_Bell_cc6b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Doug Bell">contrib</a></sup> 18:37, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Look, there is, thus far, no consensus on this VfD. People are all over the map. A delete vote is not the same as a merge vote. You lumped them together to create a large block of 85 votes.

<dt><b>Comment:</b> Stbalbach is perfectly right; a nmerge vote is closer to a keep, since it is a decision that we want to retain the material (and therefore its edit history). AfD is not intended to enforce merges or redirects; that's normal editing, and a poll on them should be on the Talk page, not here. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 00</dt>

<li><b>Delete</b>: (Kind of a reluctant delete, but still). As the article stands now, it's a clear POV fork -- it states a bunch of reasons Bush should be impeached without any attempt to put those reasons in context or state the opposing view. I'm sure the editors are willing, in theory, to include the opposing POV, but I haven't seen even the slightest attempt to do so, and I'm skeptical over whether it could be done. Also "Rationales to impeach Bush" is inherently a POV-fork topic. I suppose "Rationales to impeach or not impeach Bush" wouldn't be, but if I created "Reasons to vote for John Kerry" or "Reasons to be sceptical about global warming", I think it would be a clear POV fork. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheronJ_75b8.html" title="User:TheronJ">TheronJ</a> 22:27, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. For those of you advocating a merge, have you SEEN the size of the pages you're proposing this is merged to? The very reason this article exists, as far as I can tell, is because the Movement to impeach page (which has also been AfD'd...again...) was way too large. This is not a fork, it's a division per <a href="../../../a/s/_/WP%7EAS_daed.html" title="WP:AS">WP:AS</a>.

<li>Exactly what I was thinking. How is it possible that this article is a POV fork when it is an extension from another article. How is the original article acceptable, but the division article is not? All of the deletionists fail to realize that this article is an extension of the original, because the original is too long. We're just abiding by Wikipedia standards for article size with this issue, because one article cannot house the allegations against Bush. The movement to impeach Bush is certainly a POV issue— there's no denying that, but this issue and its severity is definitely notable enough for inclusion in any encyclopedia.

<dd>Saying "merge looks more like keep" seems to ignore the number of votes that include merge and delete together.

<dd>Well, "merge" does not necessarily mean "put this article in the other article word by word". If the merge option is chosen as the outcome of this AfD, it seems that that article will have to be made shorter by some other means - and there are other means, including not going into so much detail (which is okay because there are subarticles for every single issue) and splitting out something else, or a larger chunk (since most people object to this because it's so one-sided).

<li>That's not policy. It's a subpage on Wikiquette. Repeat offenders are only subject to temporary blocking for breaking Wikiquette where such violations qualify as incivility. Is there any logical reason <i>not</i> to keep a tally in this case? When there are six votes on the AfD, keeping a tally to say "Ohh snap there are two more delete votes than keep votes" is obnoxious. On a page with over 100 votes, a tally isn't rude, it's sensible.

<li><b>Merge</b>: I tend to agree that an article called "rationales for..." is, in a way, inherently a POV article. however, that doesn't mean that some of the content of the article isn't important.

I do think that the article <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movement_to_impeach_George_W._Bush_9b23.html" title="Movement to impeach George W. Bush">Movement to impeach George W.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Seems vastly unencyclopedia to me - Wikipedia isnt a place to enumerate the arguments of everything topical. The article is clearly just a POV list "for the moment", and will be irrelevant and non-notable at the very time he either leaves office or a decision is reached on whether or not he will be impeached. Sometimes I wonder if everyone remembers this is about writing an encyclopedia rather a generic web site where we aim to collect all and every conceivable piece of information we consider notable at the time. <a href="../../../r/e/m/User%7ERemy_B_eda6.html" title="User:Remy B">Remy B</a> 09:16, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
