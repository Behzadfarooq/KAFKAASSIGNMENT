<li><strike><b>Keep</b>. Canada = notability <strike>. <b>Delete</b>. Speculation, and even if it were not, its encyclopedicness is highly suspect. Are we to have an article on Members of the US 136th Congress and tobacco subsidies? -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 07:01, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</strike></strike>
<ul>
<li><strike>A better analogy would be an article during the Clinton impeachment debate tracking the announced voting intentions of Senators or an article on voting intentions of British MPs on the foxhunting issue (which is BIG news in the UK). Tobacco subsidies are not a national issue dominating debate in the US, the same sex marriage issue is a national issue in Canada (and indeed has attracted significant attention in the US) and is dominating the front page. I think the move to delete this is yet another example of the Americentrism of various US based wikipedians. If it's not to do with the US then it's deletable.AndyL 18:59, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</strike>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><strike>I object to Andy's attempt to paint me as Americacentric on the basis of this nomination. As I indicated, the reason why this should be deleted is because it is speculative, it has nothing to do with the lack of notability of the subject, because I DO NOT believe that the subject is not notable. Note that I didn't say to delete <a href="../../../s/a/m/Same-sex_marriage_in_Canada_2f08.html" title="Same-sex marriage in Canada">Same-sex marriage in Canada</a>. THIS article, as it stands, is nothing more than opinion, because the votes have not been cast. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 20:36, Mar 10, 2005 (UTC)</strike></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strike>OK then, where is this phantom article on the 105th US Congress and the Clinton Impeachment? Is there one? If not, then that analogy sucks too. Looks like this article is another example of Canadian centrism of various Canada based wikipedians, who have also been writing articles on everyone who holds a local public office in the Toronto area (where are the ones for New York City?) among other things. And why isn't this information in the article on <a href="../../../s/a/m/Same-sex_marriage_in_Canada_2f08.html" title="Same-sex marriage in Canada">same-sex marriage in Canada</a>? -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 19:23, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</strike>
<ul>
<li><strike>Even though I live in Toronto, I didn't particularly support having articles on individual Toronto city councillors (except ones who are notable for other reasons), but the fact is that the ones that were nominated for deletion legitimately survived the votes. And it wasn't because they were Canadian; it was because there is some support, like it or not, for the notion that city councillors do merit articles. The idea that Canadian-centrism is something that needs to be fought against is utterly absurd; in reality, Canadian subjects on VfD are regularly forced to meet a <i>higher</i> standard of notability than equivalent articles from the United States. If you believe that city councillors don't generally deserve encyclopedia articles, that's one thing (and one I'd actually agree with you on), but let's get the issue straight: nobody's expecting special treatment for Canadian topics; we Canadians expect our topics to be given <i>equal</i> consideration. And there <i>are</i> American cities for whom people have written articles on councillors, even if New York isn't one of them. I don't agree with it, but they do seem to survive VfD often enough. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 03:02, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</strike></li>

<li><strike><b>Strong keep</b>. This is a very useful page performing a valuable service. Somehow we get a lot of comments on VfD talking about how since WP isn't on paper, we can afford to have this video game character or that stretch of road, but when something comes up that actually untilizes our online, wiki nature, it's VfD'd and derided as cruft.

<li><strike>Aye, I don't really see how the two can be compared.

<ul>
<li><strike>I'm not suggesting that fiction should be removed from Wikipedia. I am only pointing out that because there is room on Wikipedia for buckets of articles on fictional characters and events that people are interested in, there should also be room for an article about a hugely important and controversial and <b>real</b> issue in Canada that a lot of people are interested in. The issue will soon be resolved and this page will be quickly and easily converted to a record of the vote. As noted, the article focuses on the verifiable, publicly-stated positions of the MPs. Speculation has been discouraged and reverted, as watchers of this page well know. And in response to RickK's stunning logic ("Apples. Oranges."), no, it isn't. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevintoronto_ec05.html" title="User:Kevintoronto">Kevintoronto</a> 18:02, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)</strike></li>

<ul>
<li><strike>The point is that this article has been prepared using public statements of MPs, so it <i>is</i> verifiable, and <b>not</b> speculation. Where speculation is used, it should be removed, just as with any other article. One or two bits of stray specualtion in an otherwise useful and frequently viewed article should not be grounds for deletion, but rather for editing.</strike></li>
<li><strike>And by the way, there are <b>178</b> articles in the Category "Star Trek characters".

<li><strike>And there are 60 articles and 17 subcategories in the Star Wars category. Just one of those seventeen sub-categories, "Star Wars characters" has 38 articles, plus an additional 78 articles in 6 sub-categories. And this is about something that is fictional! Canada, and its debate over same-sex marriage, is real. How can you be so upset about something that you call "speculative", when there is so much room taken up by fiction? Do we need more space for another sci-fi character who was on screen for 8 seconds in a movie made in 1975? <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevintoronto_ec05.html" title="User:Kevintoronto">Kevintoronto</a> 16:16, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</strike>

<li><strike>I have to note that when <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario.html" title="Ontario">Ontario</a> passed a bill within the past couple of weeks to bring provincial laws which made reference to marriage into accordance with the court decisions, there was some controversy <i>specifically</i> around the fact that it <i>wasn't</i> a recorded vote. People <i>do</i> seem to want to know how each individual politician votes on this. I'm not sure I agree that it needs to be a separate page from <a href="../../../s/a/m/Same-sex_marriage_in_Canada_2f08.html" title="Same-sex marriage in Canada">Same-sex marriage in Canada</a>, but it's not original research or speculation, either. It's quite clearly based as much as possible on actual public record, the relatively few assumptions in the article are perfectly solid ones (I'm gay and Canadian, so trust me, I <i>know</i> what's a reasonable assumption on this topic, and there isn't a single bit of speculation in here that isn't supportable.) For that matter, final reading of the bill is only a few weeks away, so the article will be <i>entirely</i> documented fact in short order. <b>Keep</b> or <b>merge</b> into the main SSM article. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 04:17, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</strike></li>

<li><strike><b>Keep</b>. I have found this article very useful in getting updates on the position of MPs on the vote, and it really helps to have all the MPs positions all on one page. I find it very informative. It also helps to have a table to add up all the current votes of in favour and against. Having each MPs position on their own page would make adding up the totals very difficut and cumbersome. Also, articles on current events are allowed on Wikipedia, which is what this is. Current event articles can often be based on a certain amount of specualation. In fact, I would even argue that even the most encyclopedic articles may have a small amount of speccualtion in them. A little bit of specualtion should not discount and invalidate an entire article that is very informative and useful. Also note that indeed it is not complete specualtion, and is largely based on MPs acutal statements and positions. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrenj_96a0.html" title="User:Brenj">Brenj</a> 21:43, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</strike></li>
<li><strike><b>Strong Keep</b>. This isn't speculation, it's a repository of verifiable information taken from public statements. If some sections of the page are speculative, the solution is to change them -- not to delete the entire thing.

<li><strike><b>Keep, but cleanup</b>. The article, at its heart, is a record of MPs' stances on same-sex marriage and specfically Bill C-38, which <i>has</i> been drafted and <i>does</i> exist, which distinguishes this legislation from a hypothetical bill about tobacco lawsuits. Any information based on published reports of MPs' stances is <i>not</i> speculation. The comments and prognostications based on an MP's constituency, however, are ill-founded and the MPs in question should be listed as unknown in the absence of any verifiable statements. The Senate vote portion of the article is largely empty and should be done away with. <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanking_466f.html" title="User:Ianking">Ianking</a> 04:10, 11 Mar 2005 (UTC)</strike></li>

<li><strike><b>Strong Keep</b>. Very informative article. The page's format is very well done. If you really want to use the word "speculation," then consider it speculation based on reliable sources. The "Crystal Ball" analogy insinuates that the sources are questionable/poor/etc. Sure, MPs can change their votes at the last minute, but is that argument good enough to invalidate all this data?

<li><strike><b>Keep</b>. Obviously a lot of work went into this article, and it is very informative/interesting. If the MPs' opinions are verifiable through press articles and other published reports, then it is not speculation. I would say though that the MPs whose stances on the issue are unknown/unverifiable should be listed as "unknown" rather than assuming that they would vote along party lines or the view held by their constituents. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkcore_fe59.html" title="User:Darkcore">Darkcore</a> 10:09, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</strike></li>
