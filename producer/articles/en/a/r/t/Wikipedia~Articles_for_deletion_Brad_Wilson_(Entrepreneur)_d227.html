<li><b>Comment</b> Let's see. I looked at the article, read the sources and reviewed relevant Wikipedia policies, making reference to the criteria by which the article deserves retention. Then I did some additional Google News Archive searches verifying the information, and expanded the scope of the article with references. You came up with "vanispamcruftisement". I'd say knee-jerk is pretty accurate. Can you refer me to a Wikipedia source for "vanispamcruftisement" as a justification for deletion? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 18:13, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> <i>whose source is independent of the person</i> is the key phrase, the articles cited here are almost all puff pieces that depend on Brad for the contents. This <a href="http://www.rell.com" class="external text" title="http://www.rell.com" rel="nofollow">major electronics distributor</a> and <a href="http://www.hotdougs.com" class="external text" title="http://www.hotdougs.com" rel="nofollow">this hot dog stand</a> have both gotten more press than Bradsdeals, but don't have WP articles. I guess the question here is whether publicity = notability. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 18:16, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> 1) <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> - The individual in question has been covered by the <i><a href="../../../w/a/l/Wall_Street_Journal_599f.html" title="Wall Street Journal">Wall Street Journal</a></i>, a source that is independent of the person and is not a puff piece (Are you familiar with the Wall Street Journal?) and has been covered by several other independent articles in full compliance with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> The fact that you can supply other articles that you feel are less notable is completely and entirely irrelevant, either to support the article or to oppose it, it simply is not a valid argument. The question is whether we observe the fact that this article meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, that <b>The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.</b> or to use <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone's</a> imaginary standard of does it have more coverage than some arbitrary hot dog stand. 2) <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> - I don't see "vanispamcruftisement" at <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>, nor is this article a candidate for speedy deletion. Please make an attempt at justifying your vote, above and beyond concocting "vanispamcruftisement" by reference to relevant policy. 3) Will anyone address whether the individual meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> using sources that fully satisfy <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 18:57, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Do you have a subscription to WSJ? Because without one, it's impossible to verify the "Wall Street Journal" link to provide (really a BradsDeals page which ostensibly reprints the article). And that's all this guy has so far; even then, I still don't buy the relevance of the other (local) sources. And just because an article is up for AfD doesn't mean it can't be speedied. In my opinion, it meets the G11 speedy standard (which is sometimes called <a href="../../../v/s/c/WP%7EVSCA_4f2d.html" title="WP:VSCA">vanispamcruftisement</a>) and should go. A "strong keep" vote, on the other hand, has zero justifiction given the tenuous sourcing. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 19:17, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Tenuous, like <a href="../../../v/s/c/WP%7EVSCA_4f2d.html" title="WP:VSCA">WP:VSCA</a>? While it means that you will actually have to do some work, the full text of the article is not available online to non-subscribers. That it exists, refers to the individual in question is undeniable, and there is no requirement of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> that requires a link that will pull up the article in its entirety (nor has anyone ever provided one of those concocted sources that says so). The link provided in the reference is an accurate copy of the full article as it appeared online and corresponds exactly to the article that appeared in the Eastern Edition of the <i><a href="../../../w/a/l/Wall_Street_Journal_599f.html" title="Wall Street Journal">Wall Street Journal</a></i> on page B8 of the <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_4.html" title="January 4">January 4</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> issue of the paper. If you can demonstrate that this source does not pass both <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, let's hear. <a href="../../../v/s/c/WP%7EVSCA_4f2d.html" title="WP:VSCA">WP:VSCA</a> is a cute little blurb, but we don't pay attention to things someone made up in school one day, we use actual Wikipedia criteria, such as <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Please stop using imaginary, made-up criteria and deal with the issue at hand: the <i><a href="../../../w/a/l/Wall_Street_Journal_599f.html" title="Wall Street Journal">Wall Street Journal</a></i> article fully satisfies <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> with a source that meets <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 19:37, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>I'd say knee-jerk is pretty accurate.</i> I'd say it's mind-reading on your part, actually, to proclaim that you know the thinking and methodology of someone else using the thin evidence you have, Or perhaps "projection" is more apt. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 19:49, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Are you implying that "vanispamcruftisement" is a demonstration of "thinking and methodology" on anyone's behalf? And aren't you projecting what my thought process was?

<li>It's called a "conclusion": the mere conclusion of something says nothing about how that conclusion was reached. And as for your thought process, that's in evidence.

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> repeatedly says in its texts that multiple non-trivial sources are required. All the articles here, including the WSJ article, are fluffy "next big thing" pieces of little importance. (edit: I'm getting too heated and I don't even care about this topic. I'm not withdrawing my vote, but I'm not going to defend it.) <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 20:22, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm glad you're referring to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, which does not define "non-trivial". <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> provides the definition of trivial coverage as <b>Media reprints of press releases, other publications where the company or corporation talks about itself, and advertising for the company. [or] Works carrying merely trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that simply report extended shopping hours or the publications of telephone numbers and addresses in business directories.</b> This standard is more than satisfied by teh sources provided. The article in the <i><a href="../../../w/a/l/Wall_Street_Journal_599f.html" title="Wall Street Journal">Wall Street Journal</a></i> and the coverage on <a href="../../../w/l/s/WLS-TV_3d2c.html" title="WLS-TV">WLS-TV</a> (the ABC flagship affiliate in Chicago) far exceed the non-trivial standard required, as they cover the individual, his business and the industry at length and in detail. I'd suggest taking a look at a print copy of the Journal, which does NOT print "fluffy" articles. You can use that argument if there was only one article in one local publication, but the pattern of coverage in national publications demonstrates full compliance with <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>, using non-trivial sources from major media that meet the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> standard required by <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Anyone else want to defend thair delete vote? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 20:47, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> JMHO, you're <a href="../../../w/l/_/WP%7EWL_5eab.html" title="WP:WL">WikiLawyering</a>. The items cited including the WSJ articled are non-critical (and, yes, IMHO the WSJ has a POV to push, and can be as gullible as any other media outlet). Like the hot dog stand guy, this fellow obviously has media friends to get this much coverage on what amounts to yet another coupon/referral site that gets most of its business through paid search-engine advertising and doesn't handle any actual merchandise. I don't think skillful media manipulation should necessarily equal notability. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 22:14, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> JMHO, but your <a href="../../../w/l/_/WP%7EWL_5eab.html" title="WP:WL">WikiLawyering</a> charge is offensive and ignores the facts. All you can come up with is an appeal to <a href="../../../w/l/_/WP%7EWL_5eab.html" title="WP:WL">WikiLawyering</a>, which the article itself defines as "pejorative". My definition is that stooping to charges of <a href="../../../w/l/_/WP%7EWL_5eab.html" title="WP:WL">WikiLawyering</a> is what individuals do when Wikipedia policy does not fit their own arbitrary personal interpretation of what they have decided, based on their own personal research, to be the "right thing". While I have pointed to multiple major media references and explicit Wikipedia policy, all you can come up with is your entirely unsupported supposition that there has been "media manipulation", skillful or otherwise, of the "media friends" that he "obviously" has. As to your utterly pointless concern regarding the fact that it "doesn't handle any actual merchandise", isn't that sort of like the <a href="../../../e/b/a/EBay_4cc0.html" title="EBay">EBay</a> business model? When will you be opening the EBay AfD? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 19:49, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> You've taken a first step, refering to an actual Wikipedia policy as an excuse for deletion. Unfortunately the policy you refer to <b>Blatant advertising.

<li>While I do not wish to label this as "vanity" or "spam" or anything like that, I believe that the person is just not notable enough to be included in an encyclopedia. The person described is a very succesful businessman, apparently, <i>but nothing more</i>. Wikipedia cannot have articles on every successful businessman. The article is a short resume of his achievements, but does it contribute much to the general knowledge? Or think of it this way: can this article be significantly expanded by someone <i>not</i> connected personally with Brad Wilson or any of his enterprises? Can this ever become anything close to a featured article? I think not; if kept it will forever remain what it is, a directory entry. It's true that the Wall Street Journal is a reputable source, but simply being interviewed by the Wall Street Journal does not yet constitute notability. <a href="../../../e/k/j/User%7EEkjon_Lok_8b74.html" title="User:Ekjon Lok">Ekjon Lok</a> 17:08, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree that the Wall Street Journal is a reputable source, and it is not the only unimpeachable, independent, non-trivial source, as listed above and in the article. I have alrady edited this article and will continue to do so, expanding the article using the multiple available sources. I'm unfamiliar with your "successful, but nothing more" or the "potential featured article" standards, and you aren't making reference to a specific Wikipedia standard that is not being met. It's very difficult to defend an article against original research and gut feelings
<ul>
<li>I do have understanging for all the "keep" votes, but my vote still stands for "delete". As I have said, the person in question is indeed a very successful businessman, and I do not doubt that he is much admired by all around him and generally regarded as a pillar of society, but there really must be something more than that to make it into Wikipedia. <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Gates_65fa.html" title="Bill Gates">Bill Gates</a> is notable. <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Jobs_f8a1.html" title="Steve Jobs">Steve Jobs</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Wozniak_b111.html" title="Steve Wozniak">Steve Wozniak</a> are notable. I am sure the person in question, Brad Wilson, has achieved much and made a very valuable contribution to society, but I just don't feel he is significant or exceptional enough to be included in a general knowledge encyclopedia. After all, we do not include every high school teacher, however much admired by his (her) students, or every church minister, however much loved by his (her) congregation. I urge everyone to stand back, for a moment, and look at this project (Wikipedia) as what is aspires to be: a general-knowledge encyclopedia, a free counterpart to Britannica, Encarta, Columbia etc. We must maintain at least <i>some</i> standard for inclusion of entries. Simply being a successful businessman, founding successful companies, getting millions in revenues, and being interviewed by the Wall Street Journal, is just not enough, in my view. <a href="../../../e/k/j/User%7EEkjon_Lok_8b74.html" title="User:Ekjon Lok">Ekjon Lok</a> 03:12, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
