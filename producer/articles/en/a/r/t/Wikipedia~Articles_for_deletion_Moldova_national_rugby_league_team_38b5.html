<li><b>Strong delete</b> - rugby league is no longer played in Moldova and hasn't been for some time. I also feel that there is little justification for minor nations at a sport to have their own page James Bowes 21:38, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Firstly, it's the national team of a country in a notable sport, which seems like a reasonable basis for an article in an of itself. Further <a href="http://www.ballsout.com/art_rleague.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.ballsout.com/art_rleague.htm" rel="nofollow">this site</a> implies that there is at least <i>some</i> rugby league activity going on in Moldova at present. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:49, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>For "several years out of date", read "2003", with the site itself being copyright last year.

<dd>That was actually an entirely accurate assertion that rugby league is not played in Canada. Someone used a rugby union competition that had league in its name to show that there was rugby league there, think of it as using the NFL Europe to prove the existence of Canadian football in Germany if you're not aware of what rugby league is.James Bowes 15:51, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> with a note that rugby league is no longer played in Moldova. The consensus is that this should remain for history purposes. My comment about Canada was correct, but some people are ignorant of the difference between rugby union and rugby league.</li>

<dd>There's no proof that it isn't played in Moldova. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 11:19, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There's no proof it is either. It is known on rugby league sites that the game's no longer played there. I suggest keeping the article for history, but I've heard strong evidence that the game's been dead there years. In the last few years all European nations have been active, but nothing from Moldova who are not registered with the RLEF (www.rlef.eu) or anything.James Bowes 11:24, 4 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The site I've cited above talks about games which were scheduled for 2003, which would suggest that if it's died then the death occurred sometime in the last 3 years. Anything's possible in Eastern Europe, but it surely would've been reported somewhere. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 11:27, 4 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Those games never went ahead, despite being planned. I believe they were to be based on Moldovans playing and living in Russia. Like I said check the www.rlef.eu page, if a country plays any internationals or has a single club they get mentioned there. Now I know Wikipedia better, I know that a national team, current or active deserves a page, but I know for a fact that there is not a single rugby league club in Moldova, and that the national side has not played since 1995. I suggest we conclude this as keep and then discuss on the talk page what to include in the article?James Bowes 14:15, 4 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This link shows people discussing Moldova no longer playing rugby league:<a href="http://forums.leagueunlimited.com/showthread.php?t=142393&amp;highlight=moldova" class="external free" title="http://forums.leagueunlimited.com/showthread.php?t=142393&amp;highlight=moldova" rel="nofollow">http://forums.leagueunlimited.com/showthread.php?t=142393&amp;highlight=moldova</a> Not sure whether it's a valid source but it's more valid than the above article. It shows that there are Moldovans playing in Russia, but suggests there is no activity in the country itself. James Bowes 14:52, 4 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The people at that forum may have more evidence than we can find, but without it all we have is a group of people saying that the game isn't played in that country, which is largely what we have here. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:47, 4 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think the fact that the www.rlef.eu.com site doesn't mention them would suggest that it's unlikely that there's any rugby league in Moldova, due to the fact that that site lists countries where even a few schools play. However, the article does seem to suggest that the national team's inactive and has no mention of domestic rugby league.James Bowes 16:41, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
