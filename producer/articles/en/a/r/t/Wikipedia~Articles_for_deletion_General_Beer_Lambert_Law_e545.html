<li><b>Delete</b>. This article is so badly written, I regret to say, that it is impossible to really understand what the author is saying. I think the only important point that the author is making is that the absorbance is the sum of terms for each absorbing species. This is of course well known. For example, it is discussed on page 745 of "Physical Chemistry" by Ira N. Levine, 5th Ed (2002) and is probably discussed in every Physical Chemistry text. Note however, that this only holds if the different absorbing species do not interact with each other. This generalisation to several species is not covered in <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer-Lambert_law_32e1.html" title="Beer-Lambert law">Beer-Lambert law</a> and should be, but by an editor who can write more clearly than the editor of this article. Otherwise there is nothing worth keeping. I'm sorry if this is rather harsh on the author, but he has been given plenty of time to improve matters. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 01:52, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The situation about citation is also very widely discussed on the article, and it seems, that you didn't caught any of the facts, because otherwise you would never be able to argue in the way you did.

<li>As it can be understood, that you have a lot of troubles, to judge if the article is original research or not, and at the same time you are also not able to comprehend the special situation for citation, this is at least a superior evidence, that you are missing any spectroscopic background on absolutely all levels. But why, in this knowledge-situation you believe that it could be of any ethic to vote? <b>As example</b>, I would never be minded to vote, not for, nor against, a polite article about the special gravity, simple because I never studied it and I'm missing the required background, <b>what is unremitting to vote!!!</b></li>

<li><b>CONGRATULATION</b>, You document the absolutely highest spectroscopic background of all who voted on this page, and you did it with quite a big gab in-between!! Even if it seems, that your spectroscopic background is not satisfying this situation, but only you have presented quite several constructive discussion statements, and that's for sure <b>YOUR achievement</b> of <b>YOUR</b> big, <b>personal exertion</b> during your literature search, Thank you very much for your work!!</li>
<li>As you have worked out absolutely correct is, that everybody is able to find at least every part of "<b>General Beer Lambert Law</b>" in several publications, not only the one you cited, but that can only mean, that <b>there is nothing left, that's NOT according to <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a></b>.</li>
<li>Even if it ever could happen, that your Note: "that this only holds if the different absorbing species do not interact with each other" should come true, it must miss all the power to validate your vote, anyway. Why? If we generate an Interim Balance Sheet:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1.) The terminus technicus is well known, and so it is allowed, according to <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, that <b>Wikipedia</b> may contain an article with this particular headline.</dd>
<dd>2.) The content of the article is also well reported, even if mostly not correct, so it is still according to <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>.</dd>
<dd>3.) There is an absolutely significant difference between "<b>Special <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer-Lambert_law_32e1.html" title="Beer-Lambert law">Beer-Lambert law</a></b>" and "<b>General Beer Lambert Law</b>", which cannot be closed by the "<b>Special <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer-Lambert_law_32e1.html" title="Beer-Lambert law">Beer-Lambert law</a></b>", - what surprise!!!, so it is only legal, that both article exist within harmony.</dd>
<dd>4.) Also 'your' quite excellent citation is anyway presenting several mistakes, that's why I can't use it on the article page, but for a discussion page, it will be all time "adequate". But the citation situation is with it not really solved (<a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>). Please allow, that I will respond a little later to this problem.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Now you have to accept,</b> that the note of 'your' citation is completely <b>wrong</b> for the "<b>General Beer Lambert Law</b>", is it a surprise to you? What you think, where the name is coming from? And be told, that’s not the only lack of the "<b>Special <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer-Lambert_law_32e1.html" title="Beer-Lambert law">Beer-Lambert law</a></b>", that is lost, on the way to the "<b>General Beer Lambert Law</b>". But that's only for you, and for sure, not a theme for this page.</li>
<li><b>Finally for you:</b> Even if it is hard to accept, you can not correct the "<b>Special <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer-Lambert_law_32e1.html" title="Beer-Lambert law">Beer-Lambert law</a></b>" in the way you think, and I think you have already realized it, because you will affront any professor and any student, any industry, and who ever else in a very bad way. Think only as an Example what 'your' correction must have for consequences for <b>ISA</b>! So the coexistence of both articles makes live much easier!! About all other we can discuss every time at every place, if you like, - <b>Thank you for all your elaborateness!!</b></li>

</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Let's come to the citation problem, that still exist in a form/kind, <b>that IS NOT COVERD</b> by <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> at all:
<dl>
<dd>1.) We all know now, that absolutely every peace of the "<b>General Beer Lambert Law</b>" article is published thousand times on different places, as I told, and as <i><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyZ_5810.html" title="User:AndyZ">AndyZ</a></i>&#160;<sub><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndyZ_665b.html" title="User talk:AndyZ">t</a></sub> and <a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> have shown us.</dd>
<dd>2.) But we know too, that all citations contains at least one or more ERRORS, except one cite, but that cite is for me not allowed to use.</dd>
<dd>3.) Such a situation is not covert by any statement of <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>, so the problem must be solved outside of <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>, but must be kept as congruent as possible to <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>.</dd>
<dd>4.) Citation would not be any problem, also for <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>, if we would drop all ethic and all politeness, too, because we could use best citations and correct them with other citations, which are also wrong, but correct in the part we need to correct the first citations. I have to admit, that this procedure has not enough ethic and even not enough politeness, at least for me.</dd>
<dd>5.) Now the question is, but on the other hand, is it ethic, to delete a legal page (<a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>), because the whole science in this field has gone wrong, and penalise all students, and everybody, only to be formalistic more then only correct?</dd>
<dd>6.) Could it be possible to fulfil the last 'letter' of <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> ONLY to 98.9% and expose at the same moment an article with a known correctness of exactly 100% to everybody who is interested in knowledge? I think that's the final question we all have to solve/vote, because we know with the same true, that merging/correcting the "<b>Special <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer-Lambert_law_32e1.html" title="Beer-Lambert law">Beer-Lambert law</a></b>" cannot be any solution with accordance to anything called ethic.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>If we finally count the validated votes</b>, we are constrained to end by ONE, because it is the only vote that is as correctly as possible legalised, not only formalistic, no also with all water of science, too. And this vote is <font color="red">red</font>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So I think that's for the moment all of the official part. <b>Thank you all.</b></dd>
<dd>It took me so long to find out, that it is also for the primary author allowed to act on this page. <b>Sorry about that</b>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>Please allow me a frankly word to the end:</b></dd>
<dd>Is it really true, that absolutely no specialist in spectroscopy is a member of <b>Wikipedia</b>?</dd>
<dd>Is there also no student of chemistry/physics of a really higher semester known as a member?</dd>
<dd>If the situation is similar in all other disciplines, how long will <b>Wikipedia</b> survive, because we all know, that <b>Wikipedia</b> has already <b>lost a good amount of goodwill</b>?</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I've read the article (in several versions), the author's comments here and on the the talk page, and I'm still not quite certain what this is all about, but it's now a little clearer. My original opinion stated at Talk:General Beer Lambert Law that it's <i>original research at best</i> still stands. I'm not a physicist, chemist or expert in spectroscopy myself, but I've consulted some who are and they all agree with me on this. The suggestion that Wikipedia will lose prestige by rejecting this clearly unsuitable material leads me to revisit my earlier suspicion that it may even be a prank. I've now a strong hunch that it is. Proof unnecessary, delete as OR in any case. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 13:29, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

I normal feel a big respect for the believing of others, particularly if I meet a 'man of a church', but <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a>, you overthrow me totally back into doubt. Is it now because you believe so much in 'your' <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_creed_111d.html" title="User:Andrewa/creed">User:Andrewa/creed</a>, exposing fairness, politeness, and ethic, <font color="red">that makes you to arrogate: "<b>Proof unnecessary, delete as OR in any case</b>"</font>, or is there a believing in your stomach, that is more than compensating all 'your' <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_creed_111d.html" title="User:Andrewa/creed">User:Andrewa/creed</a>, or, even if too worse to think, are <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_creed_111d.html" title="User:Andrewa/creed">User:Andrewa/creed</a> only some nice words from a pulpit?

<li>Why you also not accept the arguments from <a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a>, which is an absolute clear evidence against ALL your 'experts of spectroscopy' at once? Or tell me how you understand the sentence from <a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a>: "<font color="blue">I think the only important point that the author is making is that the absorbance is the sum of terms for each absorbing species. This is of course well known.</font>", including the given citation? Please accept, there is nobody as exact as hi, because that's exactly the major difference to the "<b>Special <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beer-Lambert_law_32e1.html" title="Beer-Lambert law">Beer-Lambert law</a></b>", but <b><u>a sum OR not a sum</u></b> is much more than only important, whatever you may believe, or not!!!</li>
<li>I know, <b>in case</b> <font color="red">you don't believe even in <a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a></font>, you will also not believe (but ignore) the following citations, I will add it anyway, and if it is only, to give (me?) any small chance to leave the doubt, if possible:</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I am puzzled about what <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EARGOS%2B%2B_f281.html" title="User:ARGOS++">ARGOS++</a> says about my earlier comments. Let me clarify what I said. There is nothing to justify a separate article on the General Beer Lambert Law.
