<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia is also a historical reference. We have various Army officers, ranks and even politicians names and history documented here. Jayaram Padikkal had a important role to play when it comes to discussion of National Emergency and how it was enforced in Kerala. Wikipedia's aim is to share information without prejudices, nor towing the official party/government lines of any nation. --qmsarge 13:20, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article is well written. The person is a minor historical figure but does have signifiance to recent Indian history. --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShare_Bear_59e1.html" title="User:Share Bear">Share_Bear</a> 13:06, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - I can't say if he is notable or not. However, the article could use cleaning up and removal of some POV writing. --<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7ECholmes75_6eb1.html" title="User:Cholmes75">Cholmes75</a> 13:20, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><i>Comments only no Vote</i>: I am not sure about his notability and historical significance of his life to have an independent page here. I may say one thing for sure: if Jayaram Padikkal is notable than there have been / are 100s of similarly “notable” characters in the Indian bureaucracy, including the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Administrative_Service_2176.html" title="Indian Administrative Service">Indian Administrative Service</a> and the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Police_Service_d60e.html" title="Indian Police Service">Indian Police Service</a>. --<a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhadani_ade5.html" title="User:Bhadani">Bhadani</a> 14:07, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - A common enough motif in both conspiracy theories and fiction, and it's also pretty obvious that it's not potentially infinite. Just require sources if entries are in doubt. It should be reorganized and split into fiction and alleged fact, though. I'm not entirely sure why this should be a separate article, see for instance <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motif_of_harmful_sensation.html" title="Motif of harmful sensation">Motif of harmful sensation</a>, which includes a list of examples. It might also be better to make the list of fictional contents be chronological by publication date. The alleged factual entries might not be encyclopedic, but the list of the use of this motif in fiction is definitely worthy of inclusion. <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoakim_Ziegler_9154.html" title="User:Joakim Ziegler">JZ</a> 22:39, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> The book only has an amazon rank of ~150k, so it's certainly not a best seller. However, there were reviews in it by the heads of MTV and AOL, which implies that he might be somewhat notable. However, he is essentially only a buisness consultant (and not the head of the consulting company). A very high level consultant at a very important company, but more a VP, and less a CEO, from what I could tell. --<a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIcelight_76ef.html" title="User:Icelight">Icelight</a> 22:48, August 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I wrote the article on Michael Wolf, I am new to writing articles on wikipedia. I am sorry for my writing style, perhaps too much like a bio as stated above. <b>I just re-wrote it</b>. Hopefully you approve. If not, ideas would be appreciated. I have other articles that I want to write about and subjects / people related to economics. I would like to work out an approved style with this article before I tackle a large one. Thanks for all your feedback.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. That's certainly one view, Osomec. I urge caution, however. I can concieve of an acceptable article that spoke of sport within a socio-political polity. It would not necessarily imply that sport within the EU was somehow superior to sport in Europe. As a record of sporting activity that took place within a polity, I see no reason why it should not be allowed. Of course, there should be some broader significance to it; theoretically, one could write an article about "Sport in USA, Mexico and Thailand," but it's difficult to see a case for including such a thing in an encyclopedia. With the EU, however, such difficulties are very much less. I do agree with you that <i>as it stands</i> the article is a thinly veiled political statement, but I feel that for the above reasons the best course of action would be to <b>keep</b> and apply the {{{<b>attention</b>}}} tag; get the involved editors to write a piece that actually does a decent job describing "sport in the EU." If this effort fails, and the article remains as it is, I will vote delete if you bring it back to VfD.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000">Encephalon</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#000">ζ</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Encephalon_dcee.html" title="Special:Contributions/Encephalon"><font color="#000">Σ</font></a> 09:50:22, 2005-08-10 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Many of the articles linked from <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_in_the_European_Union_8734.html" title="Life in the European Union">Life in the European Union</a> itself up for deletion, had a chronic pro-EU bias, which I have done some work on. If this doesn't get deleted, it should at least be moved to a title which reflects the fact that sport does not operate at an EU level in the way it does at national level or in Europe at least at continental level. I have already moved <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_in_the_European_Union_6cce.html" title="Education in the European Union">Education in the European Union</a> to <a href="../../../e/d/u/Educational_policies_of_the_European_Union_954d.html" title="Educational policies of the European Union">Educational policies of the European Union</a>, as the EU does not run the education systems in its member states or operate a single education system. <a href="../../../o/s/o/User%7EOsomec_c7d4.html" title="User:Osomec">Osomec</a> 15:53, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Well it certainly wasn't the intention of the writers to make a serious impartial appraisal of the EU's minor role in sport.

<li>You want to keep all "verifiable permanent institutions" do you? how about sewage plants? water treatment facilities? power plants? factories? Jails? Casinos? Municipal power companies? A line really ought to be drawn somewhere, and I think preschools ought to be beyond it, unless there is sonmething unusual about a particular preschool that makes it notable and encyclopaedic. A preschool with general fame, or one founded to try a well known and contraversal method of education might well be notable, but a more or less ordinary preschool would not be. Montessori Schools in general as a movement or a type of school, certanly are notable, but not this particualr Montessori School. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 13:57, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>"sewage plants? water treatment facilities? power plants? factories? Jails? Casinos? Municipal power companies?" Absolutely! The only reason I would reject this article is lack of verifiability. Are you *seriousl* suggesting that if I wrote an article about my local water treatment plant you'd vote to delete it? And Wormwood Scrubs? Pentonville? You're proposing to delete articles about the prison systems? The mind boggles! What *are* your criteria for notability if you would delete such a thing? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a>
<ul>
<li>Yes I <b>would</b> vote to delete an article about a local water treatment plant, unless it was in some way unusual, significant, or of more than local importance, as shown in the article. Note: I said "jails" not "prisons" much less "prison systems". I was talking about ordinanry municipal or county level lockups -- there are tens if not hundreds of thousands of such, few of any particular interest or notability ouside of their local areas. (So, not Wormwood Scrubs, but the Foo Street Magistrate Court's lockup I would consider non-notable.) In general, a physical or social structure similar in function and design to many other such structures, in no way exceptional, and of little or no interest beyond its local area is IMO not notable, and all the above kinds of institutions would usually fit this limit, as do most schools. I trust that makes my criteria clearer. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 06:18, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

Either a dicdef of the phrase "false prophet", or you-name-it religious usages of the term plus lists of "things that did not come to pass" such as <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_fusion.html" title="Cold fusion">cold fusion</a> or <a href="../../../e/n/o/Enoch_Powell_475e.html" title="Enoch Powell">Enoch Powell</a>'s "rivers of blood" depending on the POV of the editor (the phrase is usable in contexts outside the religious, after all), or a wasteland of "Your edit saying that Julian The Grumpy was a false prophet in 1127 has been reverted because his prophecies will come to pass in 10 years, O blasphemer" entries. Either way, it'l be interesting... I note that the article has <b>already</b> caused a religious schism right here on the VfD talk page&#160;:-) <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonywalton_6afa.html" title="User:Tonywalton">Tonywalton</a> 21:31, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

If something like this is to exist at all, it should be like <a href="../../../c/r/i/Category%7ECriminals_by_nationality_1bcd.html" title="Category:Criminals by nationality">Category:Criminals by nationality</a>.</s> There is nothing principally wrong with organizing criminals by their religion, despite the obvious potential for abusive and frivolous entries, but the added value seems too questionable to warrant it. On the positive side of the relevance scale, you could consider a list of criminals subject to parental abuse. On the negative side, consider list of Catholic investment bankers. This list does not mention how their religion was <i>relevant</i> to the crimes committed by the people on it, because it usually simply wasn't.

<li><b>Delete.</b> There may be a gray area between clearly appropriate list articles and clearly inappropriate ones, but I don't think this inhabits that space. The topic lends itself too easily to ugly wars between editors, and it isn't useful enough to make up for that. Add to that the difficulty in deciding who counts as Catholic and what counts as a crime (<a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelson_Mandela_1695.html" title="Nelson Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a>, for example, counts as a criminal according to one standard definition, but I'm sure all of us would be appalled to see him listed next to serial killers, rapists, and embezzlers). <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 09:18, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>&#160;: Criminals categorized based on nationality is reasonable because the criminals often operate in certain geographical areas so geographical categorization is okay by me. However, categorization based on nuances of faith is like "Criminals with a tattoo on the left arm". This seems arbitrary as catholic criminals affect everyone, not just catholics. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManikraina_d995.html" title="User:Manikraina">Manik Raina</a> 09:25, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I realize now the category remark is way off. Actually this would be exactly what you'd use a list for, since lists have ways of annotating entries and categories don't. However, my original reasoning stands: without (sufficient) redeeming value. I don't agree with Zoe that the topic is inappropriate, though; it's too easy to condemn articles based on that. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 09:26, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - at least borderline POV. Listing a criminal under religious definition is irrelevant unless he states religion as his main motivation (and even then, they may use it as an excuse). At the very least, they did not follow the commandments of the religion.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Any single <i>List of [insert your favorite religion/sexual orientation/political party here]</i> is relatively harmless. However, the information, unless the listing criterion is tied to the individuals listed in some substantive way, just doesn't belong in any encyclopedia.

<li><b>Keep</b>. A little history: I nominated the comprehensive list of Catholics for being overly broad: <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_List_of_Roman_Catholics_c703.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of Roman Catholics">Votes for deletion/List of Roman Catholics</a>. The article was kept, but many wanted to break it up into smaller articles. This article was a section of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Roman_Catholics_4309.html" title="List of Roman Catholics">List of Roman Catholics</a>, and was recently split off into a separate article, as were many other sections. If it gets deleted it will just be returned as a section of the original article. We might as well keep the smaller lists, but in the greater scheme of things, it doesn't matter, the information will end up somewhere. It feels like we are going back and forth on this issue. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_ac1a.html" title="User:NoSeptember"><b><font color="green">NoSeptember</font></b></a> 14:53, 10 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Not a good reason to keep this list. Delete it, and delete mention of it from the larger list.

<dd>Well I nominated the whole RC list (categories would do I thought), but if the community says keep it, we shouldn't pick and choose which sections to keep or throw away. None of the new smaller articles list people who are notable in their field because they are Catholics, they just list people in job X who happen to be Catholics. There is nothing inherently wrong with a list of criminals of a certain faith, as long as it is made clear that they are notable for their criminality, and not because of their faith. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_ac1a.html" title="User:NoSeptember"><b><font color="green">NoSeptember</font></b></a> 15:46, 10 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If the list is of people whose criminality and religion have nothing to do with each other, and who weren't notable for their religion, what purpose does it serve? That would make it no more informative than "criminals who worked in hardware stores" or "left-handed criminals" or "criminals between 6 and 7 feet tall". <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 03:39, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is part of the broader discussion on what lists should and shouldn't be doing, and you're quite right that there's no consensus on that. For the record, I would agree with deleting this information from the main article too, as my original arguments apply regardless of where this list is. This is a matter of opinion, yes, as it boils down to "relevance" again, that old bugaboo we can't ever seem to get consensus about, especially when it comes to lists. If Wikipedia contains all "information" there is to contain, it will be less useful simply by virtue of being indiscriminate. If on the other hand it's picky people will complain what it's picky about, as any piece of information will be useful to <i>someone</i>. See also <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_List_of_Jews_e94e.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of Jews">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of Jews</a>.<br />
A lot of support for deletion of this article is of course more a result of the "OMG POV/vandal magnet" angle than the relevance angle, and there is something to say for that, too. "A criminal who also happened to be a Roman Catholic" is not the first image that springs to mind for "list of Catholic criminals"; rather you'd think "list of criminals notable for being Catholic", a dubious concept to say the least. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 15:23, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>Speedy</b>. Given its extreme length and equally extreme incoherence, it could probably be speedied as either nonsense or vandalism.

<li>Further note: considering the "<i>This is a book authors note it should not be changed by anyone other than myself</i>" part, it could be reasonably deduced that the author didn't fully understand the aspects of the GDFL they were getting themselves into by posting.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>MERGE</b> to <i>Human rights in Brazil</i>. Already done. The only sensible redirect, however, is to <i>Human rights</i>.

<p>I think the content here does not warrant for a separate article. I suggest that the text be merged with the main article of Brazil and the Law &amp; human rights article be deleted. Besides, "Law &amp; human rights" is highly inaccurate (or rather, too general) since the article is only about Brazil. There may also be neutrality / factual accuracy issues here due to the lack of sources but I won't argue about this since I know nothing of Brazil's prisons. --<a href="../../../f/2E/_/User%7EF._Delpierre_a901.html" title="User:F.

<li>Agreed. But if it was deleted, one could always restart it and write something like what you said.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. You should be creating charts that are of equal interval sizes, say every hundred million or every five hundred million. Right now, the presentation is skewed, b/c it's set at an arbritrary scale that you decided was convenient. One grouping contains samples with pops less than 50 M, and another contains a much larger interval, between 50-500 M. It just doesn't make sense. I recommend that or creating charts for each continent.</dd>

The <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/cookbook" class="extiw" title="b:cookbook">cookbook</a> doesn't seem to have a module on canning, and this would make a fine start for one. Contrary to popular belief, there's almost no effort involved in the actual act of transwikiing, just some monotony (which I'll be perfectly happy to deal with myself). The huge backlogs in the {{move to X}} categories are a combination of doubt whether the tagged articles are appropriate for the target projects, and the effort of figuring out what to do with the articles <i>after</i> they've been transwikied. —<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptic_b72b.html" title="User:Cryptic">Cryptic</a> <a href="../../../c/r/y/User_talk%7ECryptic_d8a7.html" title="User talk:Cryptic">(talk)</a> 23:41, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This article is the beginning of a cooperative effort to remove names of persons identified within the Venona project from the main article; as stated, a proposal to remove references to identified persons within the main text, with the exception of the List of Americans named in Venona papers, with the full intention to spin that section off or merge it elsewhere once biographical information is completed. Persistent vandalism to the page, and an effort to politicize the subject has hindered understanding of its historical and cryptographical contributions.

These pages are invitations to speechify without need to reference facts. Start a subsection in the Venona page on "politics of the..." and if it grows in a serious way to article length, split it off then.

<li>There are several aspects to the Venona materials; it has significant historic aspects to complete the picture of American history back to the 1930s at least (perhaps as far back as 1921); this is of nominal interest to a younger generation of persons interesting in further developing the field of cryptography. Splitting it off keeps the original art of cryptography clean, while the historic and political aspects can be examined elsewhere. <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobs01_a89e.html" title="User:Nobs01">nobs</a> 19:41, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is a trivial category. It should be, and already is, a list. Being a slaveholder, however repugnant today, was at some times in history extremely common and accepted; for most people at that time owning slaves was a footnote to their lives. If it was particularly relevant (e.g. <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Jefferson_1b17.html" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>), it should be described in the person's page. If there is an actual desire to maintain a comprehensive list (which would be overwhelmingly difficult, IMO), it should be done as a list, not a category. Preczewski 18:28, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

You should not nominate pages from either namespace unless you have a very strong case." {my emphasis} User:-Ril- has not stated a very strong case. I do not believe the AINB is necessarily POV (let alone extreme POV) either: "idiotarian" is pretty close to a synonym for "irrational POV", and hence AINB is an <i>anti-POV</i> project. I believe that this VfD is inappropriate based on that policy, and recommend that (a) the VfD be delisted immediately and/or (b) the page be kept regardless of VfD voting results. <a href="../../../o/b/s/User%7EObsidianOrder_2f88.html" title="User:ObsidianOrder">ObsidianOrder</a> 11:31, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's not the POV that bothers me. Its the pushing.

<p>By the way, anti-Idiotarian refers to a specific POV (discussed at that article), and not a general "anti-irrational POV" but a "anti-<i>what-certain-people-think-is</i>-irrational POV", which is POV. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> ( ! | ? | * ) 14:55, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>This may be somewhat similar to Sam Spade's "detective agency". If I recall correctly, that was frowned upon by many, but not deleted. If a user is seen to indulge in witch-hunting and bullying, it is a case of user conduct, and clearly <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a> applies. I.e., you do not discuss what you perceive as a user behaving unconstructively on vfd. That's not saying your concerns are not legitimate (I don't know if they are), I am saying this is entirely the wrong channel to adress it. That would be like nominating talk pages for deletion because you don't like the way a discussion is going. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(<b>ᛏ</b>)</a></small> 06:15, 12 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Another comment</b> This entire VfD shows some of the worse rudeness I have seen on Wikipedia. The editor that had put this article on VfD did so two minutes after a <i>new user</i> created this article. I see no reason why this cannot expand, and I still believe that it is plausible that Wikipedia have some articles that may not show on Yahoo! or Google. If deleting an article by a user that had been on this site for no more than five minutes, and not even giving it a chance to expand is a <i>warm welcome</i> to you all, I do not see how anyone stays on this site (including myself). This entire vote is biased, because I most point out that so many Wikipedian are adverse to religion, they pretty much don't want to see more religion articles here. One major problem with Wikipedia is that too many editors are caught up in their self righteous "intellect" that they don't see the most intelligent thing to do: let other's expand their mind as well. Ergo, how about welcoming a new idea, and allowing potential editors (i.e. the one who made this article) feel welcome and obliged to edit on this encyclopedia, rather than bashing his first article, and scaring him away. I didn't even see <i>one</i> of you all welcome him into this dispute. But that is too late now, because he left the encyclopedia. Gee, I wonder why?<a href="../../../d/b/r/User%7EDbraceyrules_85a6.html" title="User:Dbraceyrules">D. J.

<li><b>Wow</b> I really am not trying to argue. You didn't give it much time to be notable, did you? So, you delete it after giving it three minutes to expand. The whole arguement that this is not notable is an <i>opinion</i> in itself. Why is it not notable? It 1)presents fact about the subject at hand, and 2) adds new information to this site. Ben-w has accused me of "ad hominem attacks" when I have only stated that the notion of giving an entirely new editor three minutes to create and improve an article was somewhat rude. I just have a feeling that it is. <a href="../../../d/b/r/User%7EDbraceyrules_85a6.html" title="User:Dbraceyrules">D. J.

<li><b>Comment</b> All the time in the world will not make this article notable because <b>the subject is not notable</b>. Is there a way I can get this piece of information to enter your head? It is not relevant how long the article has been there or how mean you think I am or what you think Wikipedia should be. A two-person "religion" which consists entirely of a freeweb-hosted site is <b>not notable</b>. The group has at best a handful of adherents, there are no public documents or records or articles about it; it has no buildings dedicated to it, it has been involved in no newsworthy or historical events. It is <b>not notable</b>. <b>NOT NOTABLE</b>. If you want to make a case for keeping this article, you need to do so based on the <b>notability</b> of Cirrusism. Try to find an article about it in a newspaper. There isn't one. Find a reference to it in any published media. There isn't any. Find an external webpage that discusses it. There isn't one. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen-w_c1ef.html" title="User:Ben-w">Ben-w</a> 19:32, 11 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, there is an external link, as posted by the new user. How is it that your opinion: that it is not notable, any greater than it is notable? The article 1) DOES PRESENT EVIDENCE THAT IT DOES EXIST. YOU GAVE THE ARTICLE THREE MINUTES TO EXPAND AND YET BLINDLY BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE "NOTABLE" Maybe the article would be more to your whims if you had the dececency to have a modicum of patience. The whole argument that the notability should be basd on the side of an article is very scewed. One editor posted that "Wikipedia is not actually here to spread new ideas" And yet this supposed to be an encyclopedia of unbiased content, used to benefit others? This article has <b>not been given time to expand, as Ben-w has impulsively bought this up for VfD, without consideration that the article had been three minutes old, and thus, has not time to expand.</b><a href="../../../d/b/r/User%7EDbraceyrules_85a6.html" title="User:Dbraceyrules">D.

<p>There's really nothing that is useful. The fact that he plays Tom Riddle is already in the Harry Potter pages.

I rewrote the page and it should read better. I don't think you can get away with saying he is just an actor that played some guy in some movie. He's an actor who has played one of literatures most famous villians in one of Hollywoods most successful film adaptation.</p>

<dd>Sorry about the state of the article. It was one sentence when it got put up for deletion, so I just dumped a partial filmography into it to show that there was enough to warrent an article. If I get a few minutes next week ill have a look at other biographical pages and see if I can format it and flesh it out some (unless (hopefully) someon else does first). <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalf_cbb4.html" title="User:Dalf">Dalf</a> | <a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalf_cae6.html" title="User talk:Dalf">Talk</a> 06:39, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I spent a few hours already looking for biographical information. I think this is the best information out there. But I spent a lot of time on it, and I think it is a much better article.</p>

<p>Not only does the author give NO contextual information about the episode (it's a Family Guy episode, and I only know that because I am a fan), but this is just a random episode in the series with no significant cultural or any other kind of signficance.

<li>I don't see how. First of all it had an unsourced definition that someone just made up. I just replaced it with a sourced one. But, I had to look up its negative (authoritarianism) to derive it.

<dd>Whoa! No one has said you are a vandal, just that this article does not meet the criteria for inclusion in Wikipedia. Yes, other, less worthwhile articles have escaped notice -- so far. They will be hunted down: they cannot escape! Seriously, I have a suggestion for a good article: issues raised by the rapid obsolescence of data-storage technologies. The subject was discussed peripherally in a book, and associated PBS documentary, <i>Slow fires,</i> which dealt primarily with the loss of acid-paper books. Such an article can be well-sourced, informative, encyclopedic, and could include your proposal as an example of potential solutions without being either original research or vanity.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Weird. I took a course on Lie Algebra as an undergrad; it seems like this is talking about the symmetry groups of Newtonian and Lorentzian flat spacetimes. There are lots of things that mark this as crank literature, including the reference to "nonsense imaginary" factors, etc. etc...

<li><s>Comment</s>: a LACNIC search on the IP address reveals it to be in Brazil, and thumbing through the user's history we see that it has made a variety of somewhat accurate though syntactically tortured edits to a variety of algebra pages.

Certainly doesn't seem like a common term. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 00:05, August 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, slang definition. Hi Nabla. I think starting a VfD counts as a vote for deletion itself. Furthermore, you could have done a bit of research yourself and cast a vote. It seems strange to reopen a VfD creating more work for everyone. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> 00:24, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I did not start nor reopen a VfD. I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Floating_Bellhop&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Floating_Bellhop&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">found a VfD tag with no discussion page</a> and not listed here, so I simply completed someone else's nomination. I think that not voting is not unusual in those cases, although sometimes I do also vote. <a href="../../../n/a/b/User%7ENabla_d282.html" title="User:Nabla">Nabla</a> 00:48:15, 2005-08-11 (UTC)
