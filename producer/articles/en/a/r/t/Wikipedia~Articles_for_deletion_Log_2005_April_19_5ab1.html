<li>Lucky 6.9 put a speedy delete tag on it. I put a VfD tag on it earlier which I think was removed by a simultaneous edit by the originator of the article, 24.90.107.170. 24.90.107.170 then deleted the speedy delete tag. I reinstated the VfD tag.</li>
<li>As for it being worthy of being translated? I can't say with any reasonable certainty. However, I believe it's a local club in Peru. To the English speaking world, I imagine the club has very little interest. Quick Google check shows 75 hits in all languages, and only 6 in English. I don't think it passes muster. If we must, I can have a native Spanish speaking friend of mine review this entry. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 04:43, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>I don't have any particular attachment to this article. However, I think it was tagged as CSD when it shouldn't have been (sorry, Lucky) and the usual process for foreign-language articles is to attempt to translate them before VfD. If you can get a native speaker to look at it, that would be great. If it's too much trouble, though, I'll take your word as to the non-notability of the subject and change my vote. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">android</a>â<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79">talk</a> 04:49, Apr 19, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well, the original poster translated the article into English. I think it is still well beneath the threshold of acceptability. It's not a top league team, by the article's own admission. Strikes me more as a local club than anything. Is there precent-equivalent in articles referencing non-professional sporting clubs? There's nothing that links to the article's page yet, other then meta pages.

<li><b>Delete.</b> Since many historians have ranked Presidents in various ways, it would be possible to have an encyclopedic article on "Historians' rankings of U. S. Presidents" that would summarize the <i>opinions</i> of these historians in the approved "X said Y about Z" formulation. However, every such ranking or opinion should have a good solid source citation, preferably a traditional print reference with book title, publisher, ISBN, and page number. An article that says "The following United States Presidents have often been suggested for that title" with not the slightest hint of who has suggested them, when, or where is not such an article, nor is it useful guidance to anyone who would want to write such an article. Thus, "Historians' rankings of U. S. Presidents" is an encyclopedic topic, but <i>this article</i> has no potential to become encyclopedic. Wipe the slate clean.

<ul>
<li>I know. It was supposed to be as obnoxious as your handwaving and patronizing "I'm concerned about the number of delete votes I see here, and the logic I see being used". Your concern is touching, but not productive.<br />
I'm sorry I couldn't go far enough for your taste. I thought it was already absurd enough, but it's clear to me now you're voting on the <i>topic</i>, while I'm voting on the <i>article</i>. The TV show example I did to highlight the massive difficulties (or sheer impossibility) of keeping <i>any</i> article with "best"/"worst" in its title NPOV and relevant. To then suggest as casually as you did that it's perfectly fine and should be kept boggles the mind, especially if you imply that everyone else is using faulty logic.<br />
I do not at all object to the article you <i>allude to</i>âbut the article we're <i>voting on</i> has got to go. The only way you can "make" this into a good article is by completely replacing it, in which case you might as well send off a decent signal by deleting it. Had this article been improved substantially in the voting period, I would have voted <i>keep</i>. It wasn't. It's the same rubbish it used to be. Voting <i>keep</i> appeals to a level of patience and trust we shouldn't need to have for articles as clearly defective as this one isânot just in execution, but in the very approach. Again: nobody's losing <i>anything</i> over this. An article on the same <i>topic</i>, done properly, would sooner benefit from seeing this go than having it stay. This argument springs from incompatible assumptions, not because we really disagree on the conclusions. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> 07:01, 2005 Apr 26 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: the article is poor. The subject is very problematic, since at least one very prominent candidate for the position of worst ever is alive, newsworthy, and, extraordinarily, still popular among many US voters who otherwise aren't obviously insane. (Forty years ago, this would have been much easier, as we'd be complacently -- too complacently -- chuckling over comfortably long-dead Pierce, Harding, and the like.) It would be flamebait. Then again, anything related to Israel, Palestine, Iraq, "Creationism", etc etc is flamebait; yet there's no consensus to lock these articles for long periods, let alone to do away with them. Reasoned claims are made about this by well-informed and thought-provoking writers (I believe I've seen <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Krugman_2111.html" title="Paul Krugman">Paul Krugman</a> writing on it), e.g. in columns in non-tabloid newspapers; moreover, as pointed out above, it seems a subject of much wider interest (let alone importance) than plenty of subjects that get their own articles, e.g. fictional spaceships. The article is doomed, but I hope that a greatly superior replacement will soon emerge. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 03:07, 2005 Apr 30 (UTC)</li>

However, this says nothing about any cutoff at any number of barrels. A good thing too, as in my opinion (very likely no more valuable than yours) the <i>product</i> of this brewery is considerably more noteworthy than the uninteresting fizzy stuff churned out by Anheuser-Busch, Asahi, and the like. If it isn't so popular, blame mass stupidity, the power of advertising as applied to rivals' near-beer, etc. Hogs Back Brewery -- as it should be retitled as soon as it has survived the indignity of VfD (though I notice that the company itself sometimes uses an apostrophe) -- makes superb ales, among which I particularly recommend "Brewster's Bundle". <a href="http://www.camranorthlondon.org.uk/fullpint/fp0605.html" class="external text" title="http://www.camranorthlondon.org.uk/fullpint/fp0605.html" rel="nofollow">Here</a> we see a Hogs Back beer winning a silver award from <a href="../../../c/a/m/CAMRA_e38d.html" title="CAMRA">CAMRA</a>.

I'd say I'd buy a (virtual) pint of Hogs Back for anyone voting "keep" if I didn't worry that this might be regarded as undemocratic.

<li><b>Abstain</b>, I'm not entirely sure about this one. It's got a lot of weasel terms and not all that much info. I'd be more inclined to keeping if a brewery infobox was added. That said, I do agree that a production cut-off isn't really the best way to determine notability. Is it on sale worldwide?

<li><b>Answers</b>: You can buy Hogs Back beer <a href="http://www.hogsback.co.uk/acatalog/Bottled_Beers.html" class="external text" title="http://www.hogsback.co.uk/acatalog/Bottled_Beers.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>; <a href="http://www.hogsback.co.uk/acatalog/info.html" class="external text" title="http://www.hogsback.co.uk/acatalog/info.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a> says (via various, perhaps beery spelling mistakes) that the company ships outside Britain. The market share within Britain will be very low, of course -- isn't this obvious from the production figures? But let's consider music for a moment: the market share of <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harrison_Birtwistle_7da0.html" title="Harrison Birtwistle">Harrison Birtwistle</a> would appear infinitesimal beside that of, say, the beloved diva <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashlee_Simpson_fc55.html" title="Ashlee Simpson">Ashlee Simpson</a>; but WP contributors realize that in music, if not beer, there's a certain notability in <i>quality</i> and <i>originality</i> as well as sales. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 08:59, 2005 Apr 19 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Templates</b> are pages like any other, actually. The <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transclusion.html" title="Transclusion">transclusion</a> code <code>{{somepage}}</code> operates just as well on <b>any</b> page within the wiki. There is nothing <i>a priori</i> about pages within the template space to distinguish them from any other page. Deletion of a page within template space should be considered <i>here</i>, on <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">Votes for deletion</a> -- with the same consideration given any other page.</p>
<p><b>Wikipedia:Templates for deletion</b> was created to take some of the load off VfD workers; the idea was to deal with obviously malformed templates quickly. But it has degenerated into an angry, biased forum for the deletionists, who run roughshod over all other voices. There is no longer any discussion, no attempt to reach consensus; members simply weigh in with their votes, often without explanation. I have seen no evidence whatever that any member bothers to attempt to improve a malformed template. The process has devolved into a kangaroo court that recalls those of the French Revolution; a steady stream of heads are shoved through the thirsty guillotine. <i>See: <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">"...the decision to permanently delete an article is not taken lightly, and the deletion process is followed..."</a></i></p>
<p>The page itself is an embarrassment. <b>Compare it to VfD.</b> What ought to be an orderly process is barely sketched out. The last attempt to reform the process was obliterated by a faction that found its terms insufficiently ambiguous. The dead bodies of its victims are not even carried out with regularity.</p>
<p>The sad truth is that what ought to be a fair and honest process has become the little empire of a few strong opinions, who simply go ahead and do what they like, oblivious to any dissent, let alone the principle of consensus. Templates are nominated on shaky grounds or none. Nominations that fail to reach a consensus to delete are not relieved from the onus of TfD, either; they often languish indefinitely, as it were in a dungeon without trial.</p>
<p>Some TfD regulars have begun to pick up on the fact that any page may be transcluded, and are pushing to expand the scope of the process to include <i>other</i> pages which have been used as templates. By that logic, TfD's scope includes the several subpages of the Village Pump!</p>
<p>I nominate the page in question for deletion, on grounds that it has now become a mere POV soapbox for deletionists, a hazard to the larger community. It is frequently employed merely to vandalize properly-working, useful templates; it is seething with uncivil remarks. There are a limited number of Wikipedians with the willingness to fairly deliberate page deletions; they concentrate on VfD. TfD is left as a neglected backwater in which bad practice festers. The page itself should be deleted and all pages nominated for deletion <i>here</i> only. â <a href="../../../x/i/o/User%7EXiong_2293.html" title="User:Xiong">Xiong</a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Xiong_c362.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Xiong"><font color="#997749">ç</font></a><a href="../../../x/i/o/User_talk%7EXiong_bb60.html" title="User talk:Xiong">talk</a> 04:11, 2005 Apr 19 (UTC)</p>

<li>Excellent question. I try and base my votes on these school articles partially on their encyclopedic content. In all fairness, a good article on a so-so school should probably be considered as a keeper. It's the "bored student substubs" I vote against, especially if there's no information online to expand the stub. However, I think that a so-so school had better represent itself well, avoiding "weasel" words and phrases like their mission statement. I try and look at some of these from the viewpoint of an advertising copywriter. One of the biggest no-noes is unsubstantiated claims to greatness. School articles are usually rife with these. Hope I answered your question. Ask anytime. &#160;:) - Lucky 6.9 06:30, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>[A review of the deletion policy confirms my gut reaction. It is clearly implicit by what wiki provides as criteria for deletion that an article on a secondary school is, in and of itself, worthy of having in wiki. firstly, the number of articles that wiki can have is explicitly stated as a non-issue in judging an article's worth. secondly, an article on any school does not fall under any of the categories listed at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> as what wiki is not. moreover, its worth reiterating that any one school will mean something to literally thousands of people (the majority of which are not present wiki contributors or even users no doubt, but are nonetheless, potential ones). this is a cut and dry case <a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMayumashu_b61f.html" title="User:Mayumashu">Mayumashu</a> 16:56, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC) ]</p>

<li>Excuse me? I've been doing plenty of non-VFD-related edits, and I have voted Keep or Merge on numerous articles that have been put up for VFD. I'm not sure what you're stating or implying here. I put a lot of articles up for VFD because I have been doing RC patrol, and it is very common to see articles that are either nonsense or content-free (and thus candidates for speedy deletion), or articles that are unencyclopedic and have thus been posted here for consideration. If the consensus is to keep this article, I'll go along with this. But I <b>will not</b> be bullied.

<li>True, but I think we're a little too quick to VfD advertising web pages. We tend to assume that they're a kind of spam. Which they often are. But they're also often articles about notable topics that are simply written too subjectively. Very often people VfD them when they should clean them up or make them into stubs.

I spent most of my "fledgling" time revising other articles etc. and have only moved onto Vfd now that my "pet topics" are pretty much complete and I'm a little more acquainted with the workings here. Is there some problem with me being new to Vfding? That I am misvoting? That I am voting too much and/or too often? That I shouldn't dare suggest a Schoolwatch article be deleted? ....orrrr what?

<li><b>Comment</b>: there are many university and college articles out there that look <i>much</i> worse than this one currently does (just look though some of the categories), and there are probably thousands of institutions less notable than this one too, but they have so far been left alone because of the consensus that institutions of higher education are inherently notable enough to have an article.

<li>Agree on both points. An article about magic swords would be useful, perhaps even overdue, but this is <i>not</i> that article. I mean, where's Excalibur? I'll bet Japanese mythology is loaded with references to enchanted samurai swords, which is ironic given the name of the user who posted this article in the first place. I'd like to see this deleted to get it out of the edit history, but I'll <b>abstain</b> for now since I might turn this into something resembling a stub article later instead of what we currently have, namely a few fragments of fact gleaned from someone's mind. Where else but Wikipedia can you learn that a magic sword can be used to stab the enemy? - Lucky 6.9 17:38, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> â current article is highly non-informative. But I agree that magical swords are a common element in mythology, history, and in fantasy literature and games.

<li>The deletion criteria are not all-inclusive, and notability has been a <i>de facto</i> criterion for well over a year now.

<li>Besides, I don't see a procedural error. "Non-notable" is just shorthand for "not important enough to escape the 'not a general knowledge base' rule". ---<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac R</a> 16:04, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>On the contrary, "not notable" is shorthand for "not notable <i>to me</i>", which is nothing less than intellectual chauvinism. Lots of people find lots of "mundane" subjects perfectly "notable", and they can and should be able to write about those subjects in Wikipedia without having their work casually dismissed by ill-informed or ignorant contributors who possess a misplaced sense of their own importance.--<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Poole_836b.html" title="User:Gene Poole">Gene_poole</a> 04:25, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

No way, they were the most innovated band around. They had a huge following and are still a cultural icon in Ventura County. The band has broken up due to creative differences. Justin is currently living in the desert experimenting with alterative life styles. Shaun is climbing the corporate ladder at a major California company. Noah was last seen wandering the streets of Tijuana Mexico. If you have any information please contact his mother. He still looks the same as he did in 2001. EVFL must never die.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, but a pretty weak one. They actually seem to have a lot going on, judging from some of the web activity I've Googled.

<ul>
<li>The article used to include information that made Cyberia's activities unmysterious. That information was deleted by an admin on grounds that it did not reflect a "neutral point of view." The "virtual civil war" is well-known to the entire community at Micronations.Net. It's not really a civil war, per se. It's more that some other guy keeps putting up websites claiming to be Cyberia's legitimate web presence. (unsigned, by 66.130.8.96)</li>

<li>I don't think looniehood is the issue. We can judge an organization's notability without passing judgment on its self-justification.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Micronations will stay mysterious while Wikipedia does not describe them.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This micronation is no more intresting or legitamite than any other micronation, and there has to be a general rule enforced, either to delete all micronations viligante-style, or let them be. Honestly I think Wikipedia is used by many people to explain intresting Internet phenomena, and having the many micronations explained gives us this service to people.
