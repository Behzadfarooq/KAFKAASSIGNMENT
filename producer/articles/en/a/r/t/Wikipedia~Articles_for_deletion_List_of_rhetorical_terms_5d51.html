<li><b>Strong keep</b> if somebody promises they are going to work on it in the near future. According to its talk page, it's intended as part of a a rhetorics wikiportal, so I suppose there must be some previously established contributor interest? Delimitation of the topic area is not a problem; rhetorics is a very well-defined scholarly area with a long tradition, and "lists of rhetorical terms" abound in the literature. There are even specialist dictionaries of rhetorical terms. This is definitely a useful idea for a page, and I think the list page is also superior to a category-based alternative in this case, as per <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories%2C_lists%2C_and_series_boxes_edc0.html" title="Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and series boxes">Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and series boxes</a>. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 08:13, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I just left a message on the creator's talk page after he left a message on mine complaining about the move (from "Glossary" to "list" which I felt was more fitting).

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. After reading the creator's plans, it is clear to me that this list would be an excellent addition to the encyclopedia. I hope he and his students are not harrassed away.

<p>I'm not certain why this page was nominated for deletion, but perhaps the issue can be resolved if I explain my rationale for creating the page. I am Matt Barton, an English professor who has been using wikis in teaching for some years now. This semester, I had the idea of having the graduate students in my rhetorical theory course build a <a href="../../../r/h/e/Portal%7ERhetoric_7f93.html" title="Portal:Rhetoric">Rhetoric Portal</a> for wikipedia--one that would match the quality of the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Portal%7EPhilosophy_d8c5.html" title="Portal:Philosophy">Philosophy</a> philosophy wikiportal. As part of the project, I wanted the class to create a glossary of terms that are frequently found in rhetorical treatises. This glossary would consist of rhetorical terms with brief, one-line definitions, with all the terms linking to full-page articles (that the class will work to develop as the semester progresses). My plan is to use the Rhetoric Wikiportal as a "homebase," if you will, for developing and extending the rhetorical theory coverage at the wikipedia. If this page is deleted, it may negatively impact a class that is already struggling with "the whole wiki thing," if you will, and probably undercut their confidence in me.</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Perhaps the answer is: the same thing that other people have felt could be done well through pages like <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glossary_of_library_and_information_science_terms.html" title="Glossary of library and information science terms">Glossary of library and information science terms</a>, <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glossary_of_spirituality-related_terms.html" title="Glossary of spirituality-related terms">Glossary of spirituality-related terms</a>, <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glossary_of_the_Third_Reich_418b.html" title="Glossary of the Third Reich">Glossary of the Third Reich</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/p/Topology_glossary.html" title="Topology glossary">Topology glossary</a>, <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glossary_of_differential_geometry_and_topology.html" title="Glossary of differential geometry and topology">Glossary of differential geometry and topology</a>, etc., etc.? Look for more of these things under <a href="../../../g/l/o/Category%7EGlossaries_5e13.html" title="Category:Glossaries">Category:Glossaries</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_glossaries.html" title="List of glossaries">List of glossaries</a>. They are all over the place. If there's one scholarly discipline that's really pre-destined to have such a thing, it's classical rhetorics (a closed body of established, classical knowledge; terminology in widespread use across several neighbouring disciplines but partly inaccessible to the non-specialist due to its Latinate/Greek roots; useful combination of short definition within list page with more detailed explanation in main articles; pure listing of article titles on a category page would be opaque to the non-specialist.) - And why "unmanagable", for heaven's sake? It's a closed, stable, well-circumscribed field, and many of the articles are already there. It took me twenty minutes this morning to add half a dozen entries. I estimate the full page might grow to a hundred or so. Compare that with the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glossary_of_spirituality-related_terms.html" title="Glossary of spirituality-related terms">Glossary of spirituality-related terms</a> quoted above, which is huuuuge! <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 21:57, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>: and adjust the focus so that the list also includes terms and concepts from the intersections of rhetoric and writing studies, rhetoric and communications studies, rhetoric and speech, visual rhetoric, etc. If this were only a list of "pure" rhetorical terms, it is duplicating an extensive existing website, which though not a wiki, is still the primary online resource and likely to remain so. The value of a wikipedia entry to me would be the ways that contributors can help expand our sense of / understanding of "rhetoric." <small>This unsigned comment was added by new anonymous IP user <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_216.188.244.155_0a9d.html" title="Special:Contributions/216.188.244.155">216.188.244.155</a> at 14:49, 25 January 2006.
