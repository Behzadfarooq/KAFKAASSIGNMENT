<p><b>Keep</b> He is the key figure in a major news story that has garnered daily national coverage since it began. It's hardly "just another abduction," as some of you have (somewhat coldly) stated.</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> This is an extremely relevant case that will intrigue many in years to come. The rarity and unusualness of a 4 1/2 year kidnapping are undeniable. As a psychologist, I have a special scholarly interest in Shawn Hornbeck, clearly this boy may have suffered from an extraordinary case of Stockholm Syndrome similar to that of Elizabeth Smart who was held captive for 9 months. Also his kidnapper Michael Devlin, should have a linked but still separate page. Also I'm sure as information comes out about the tactics Devlin used to terrorize Shawn, and what he endured during his captivity, there will be much more to add to his page. Also for all everyone saying this boy is just out for 15 minutes of fame, 4 1/2 years of captivity with a man who probably did god knows what to him is never something someone would do for attention. I think that's a horrible suggestion.</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> - Was held captive for four years. If you want an AfD, try the other kid who was kept for two weeks or something like that. --<a href="../../../j/o/f/User%7EJoffeloff_ba63.html" title="User:Joffeloff">Joffeloff</a> 17:05, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Not my goal to AFD. I would rather be an inclusionist.&#160;:P But I digress, the article reads like a news piece, and if we include that, then we must include every other kidnapping/missing that resulted in "significant" results. There are too many cases.

<p><b>Keep</b> - <i>"Does not seem notable"</i>?!?!? How can a normal person think that this case is not notable. A child goes missing for over four years, in a situation where most kids are murdered, and he is miraculously found alive!?! What are you thinking?!?! And the statement that <i>"it reads like a news piece"</i> is no excuse for deletion. Revise it, add to it, fix it up, but KEEP THIS ARTICLE!!

<p><b>Keep</b> - I agree that because of the rare nature of the discovery following such a significant amount of time after the kidnapping, this article should be kept. The article could be greatly revised and expanded, but it should be included. Nicastpj 17:46, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as per nom. No indication of <i>encyclopedic</i> notability. Wikipedia is not a news report archive or a news service (that's Wikinews, a totally separate project) or a record of crime victims. News notability is not the same as encyclopedic notability. Encyclopedias are not news record archives. If the foundation created in the victim's name could be shown to have developed into a substantive, long-term organization, I would probably support a move to an article about that foundation. But of time of writing, the foundation website is down, and its unclear to me how significant this organization is. If there is evidence that this case had a broader substantive cultural or legal impact, I'll reconsider my&#160;!vote. Personally, I believe that the widespread conflation of Wikipedia's mission as an encyclopedia with its use as a news and magazine article archive is the most underestimated/underconsidered urgent problem facing the project (and its sister project, Wikinews). <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 18:31, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>comment</b> wikipedia isn't entirely for encyclopedic notability, think of all the actresses and actors on here. Shawn should be on here for the same reasons as Holloway and Smart, and then some. There is some "encyclopedic" notability in here however, it will be interesting to learn why his captivity went on for as long as it did. This is not so much a news article as it is an investigation into an extremely unusual kidnapping.</p>

<p><b>Keep and Enhance</b>-Trust me, it will be very easy to enhance this story in the coming days. But this is a notable article and stary, anyone who can't see that is blind.

<p><b>Comment</b> - I am in concurrence with Bwithh above. I am beginning to see the need for differentiating between Wikipedia and Wikinews. There's not much more to this boy (and I'm not downplaying the tragedy) than the fact that he was kidnapped and found years later. The brevity of the article demonstrates this. I do believe information like this should be available via the internet, and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_kidnappings.html" title="List of kidnappings">here</a>, but the proper place is Wikinews until this story can demonstrate long-term and lasting notability. Recommend anyone concerned open a Wikinews article on the event as one does not exist now. - <a href="../../../r/o/l/User%7ERollo44_3f3e.html" title="User:Rollo44">Rollo44</a> 20:14, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In regards crime victims, generally I look to see if either the case has created a change in law, had a substantial cultural influence, or there has been a significant book, film, play etc. about the case or the case has attracted <i>sustained</i>, <i>substantial</i> national media attention. The Elizabeth Smart case seems to pass these criteria. The Hornbeck case, I don't think so at the moment. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 21:01, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Strong keep</b>. Bwithh, you state exactly why this article should stay: "In the future there will be a significant call for an encyclopedia article on the topic."

Unless Wikipedia wants to be an all-inclusive (see: <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>) information source, I suspect that we'll eventually want to exclude main stream media articles as evidence of notability.

The trend here these days, appears to be toward admitting YouTube, MySpace, and personal blogs as evidence of notability. In the case at hand, I'd rather wait for an academician to write an article or a book on the psychological effects of long-term kidnapping on its survivors (or some such) before Wikipedia sees an article on this subject.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Elizabeth Smart has an article because she made international headlines..for about..a year. She also had a tv movie, and a bunch of other stuff related to her. That's why she gets an article. Shawn Hornbeck and Ben Ornby and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_J._Devlin_a8b0.html" title="Michael J. Devlin">Michael J. Devlin</a> should all probably be merged into an article about the kidnapping, if anything. (If Shawn's get deleted, Ben's should probably go as well. At least Shawn's article has sources, and all that wikijazz). I'm not going to properly vote keep, or delete, but I strongly oppose the comparison to Elizabeth Smart, and Natalie Holloway. There's no way these guys are anyway more notable, no offense. I think the story is sad and all, and glad they're okay, but still. Just because you feel bad for them, and are interested in the story, and because they made national (not international like E.Smart's and N.Holloway's) headlines for a week doesn't make them that notable. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheBlueFlamingo_4a4b.html" title="User:TheBlueFlamingo"><font face="Verdana"><font color="SteelBlue">theblueflamingo</font></font></a><sup><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheBlueFlamingo_0d80.html" title="User talk:TheBlueFlamingo">Speak</a></sup> 09:19, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> 1. They have made international news. Google news turns up hits from the UK, at least. 2. Natalie Holloway and Elizabeth Smart are famous, but they're not the minimum for an article; they're far above it. It doesn't even take fame to be article-worthy. Notability is a very low bar. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 09:22, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is a person who could become a crucial witness during the current investigation of the kidnapping suspect.

<li><b>Delete</b> Wikipedia is not wikinews, neither is it a crystal ball so arguing on possible future notability is moot. Is this person newsworthy? Sure. Is he encyclopedic? I don't belive so. I concur with Bwithh, in that that wikipedias purpose as an <i>encyclopedia</i> is being hurt by using it as a news outlet, tracking breaking news without regard to its historical relavance, for the simple reason that we cannot always judge historical impact until some time has passed, and putting everything that splashed on the front pages into wikipedia is counter to wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">basic policies</a> of not being a source of indiscriminate information/news outlet/memorial. When an event is current, it always appears more notable, which is why I belive the best thing to do in cases like this is <a href="../../../d/u/s/WP%7EDUST_e3db.html" title="WP:DUST">let the dust settle</a> before creating an article on someone - all living people too, so don't forget <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, most notably the "write conservatively" phrase. However, I have also found that if an article does get created, it is better to wait a short time before nominating it for afd, because, as the above debate shows, insults seem to fly becuase current events can inspire heated debate. However, an encyclopedia should be dispassionate, and more importantly, unhurried.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Any reasonable person with knowledge of the three major U.S. cable news channels would agree with absolute certainty that this case is going to be in the news for a very long time.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - Acknowledged he is in the public eye, but this is not encyclopedic. Unfortunately, kidnapping occurs all over the world, and it just so happened that this one boy landed in the public eye simply because of the length of his captor's hold on him. Please get rid of this article; this kid already has his name in the press- and if it's exposed that he's been molested or raped- it simply is not right to throw his name on some wiki article for the whole world to see. You want encyclopedic? Write about the trial of Michael Devlin, just don't exacerbate the emotional state of this boy! Consider this, in a few years after this has all blown over- people will hopefully remember the perpetrator, not the victimized, and Wikipedia should not be used as a proxy to expose victimized minors to the whole of society. The fact that were even considering posting the name of a potentially victimized minor is disgusting, and I was hoping that Wikipedia held itself to a higher standard. I agree with several posters- it's a current events news article- not an encyclopedic event. It's sad that were even considering leaving this up; imagine 15 years from now being Hornbeck (if he had been victimized) and having a Wikipedia article screaming: HEY I WAS RAPPED! Don't do this to a child...--71.194.128.49 08:22, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>71.194.128.49, you've been here a month and made valuable contributions to the project. However, removing content because someone in the article, even its subject, wouldn't want to be written about is an example of the <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slippery_slope.html" title="Slippery slope">slippery slope</a>. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#CENSORED" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not censored for content</a>, and an article must stand or fall by the same standard whether its subject would want it here or not. To assert that deletion is warranted based on speculation that Hornbeck is a <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape.html" title="Rape">rape</a> victim would set a dangerous precedent of removing content based on supposition about what the subject of the article would think of it, or about what we may later find out. This is the <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">biography of a living person</a>, but it is not a topic off-limits to this project. --<a href="../../../s/s/b/User%7ESsbohio_59da.html" title="User:Ssbohio">Ssbohio</a> 13:12, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The fact that the kid was gone for four years and had such an extreme amount of leeway in his daily activities makes this notable. He was allowed access to a computer, he had friends who visited, he was left alone for long hours at a time, etc. This was clearly an exceptional case from many angles. <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadHacktress_6282.html" title="User:MadHacktress">MadHacktress</a> 16:41, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>This boy has been all over the news. People know his name and why shouldn't they be able to look him up in an encylopedia and learn more about him? Like others have said, this is an event that is occuring right now, and with time the article can grow to be as long as Elizabeth Smart's. Give it some time. Unless Shawn Hornbeck himself objects to this article, I say keep it.

<li><b>Keep</b> Shawn's story is extremely compelling and a huge news event right now. But that doesn't mean it's going to fade away either. We're still intrigued by <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Smart_ac0a.html" title="Elizabeth Smart">Elizabeth Smart</a>'s story; I think it's going to be the same way with him. I also agree with the user above me who said people should be able to look up his name on Wikipedia and learn more about him. I don't think this article is hurting anyone, or the authorities' chances of convicting the man who allegedly abducted Shawn, so I think the article should stay up and be updated as the days and weeks go by. -- <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWild_Mountain_Thyme_eb52.html" title="User:Wild Mountain Thyme">Wild Mountain Thyme</a> 01:15, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Shawn was the victim of an abduction that has been covered in more media sources then can be counted nationally and internationally. The nominators primary reason for deletion is lack of notability.
