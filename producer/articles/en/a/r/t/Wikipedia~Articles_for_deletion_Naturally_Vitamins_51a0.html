<li><b>Delete</b>. I agree with the nominator about WP:CORP as it applies to this article. I'm neutral on the question of an article about Marlyn Nutraceuticals, if someone wanted to write on of those and then smerge this into it. As for the Hoovers link cited above, I don't know what it's meant to indicate, but it's giving me a "page not found" error. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 19:14, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Hoovers, a publication of Dunn &amp; Bradstreet, is the foremost aggregator of company lists and profiles. Marlyn Nutraceuticals does business as Naturally Vitamins and is listed in Hoovers, consequently meeting point 2 in the Criteria for Companies and Corporations. In the WP:CORP requirements, the Criteria for Companies and Corporations states, "A product or service is notable if it meets <i><b>any</b></i> of the following criteria".<small>—comment <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">added</a> by</small> Mrenzyme<sup>(<b>t</b>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mrenzyme_02f5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mrenzyme"><b>c</b></a>)</sup></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Point 1 of the Criteria for Companies and Corporations states, "The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself." Here are articles relating to Marlyn Nutraceuticals and Naturally Vitamins:</dd>

<li>Your second and third links are "media reprints of press releases", which are expressly disqualified by the passage in question, and the fourth link does not qualify as a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. The first article is legitimate, but too brief to be of much value, as it contains only two sentences. The revised Hoovers link (thank you for fixing it) seems to describe the parent company Marlyn Nutraceticals, rather than the subsidiary which is the subject of the article. I also believe that you are misinterpreting clause 2 of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> as applied to the Hoovers profile, as that section is meant to apply to printed statements of being "the Nth-largest manufacturer of Commodity X", or the "Nth-largest company in Country Y". There are more than 18 million company profiles in the Hoovers database, and as such, the distinction is not a particularly exclusive one. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 22:10, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In response to the point that articles 2 and 3 are PR reprints...yes, they are however I believe they should be considered relevant because they are not promotion pieces but rather verifiable facts. In regards to the link indicating that Marlyn Nutraceuticals received the Arizona Association of Industries Manufacturer of the Year award, AAI only publishes the most recent year. This year Intel and Armor Works were the recipients. While yes, the press release was generated by Marlyn, the award was provided by AAI and can be verified by contacting them. <a href="http://www.naturalproductsmarketplace.com/articles/571news.html" class="external text" title="http://www.naturalproductsmarketplace.com/articles/571news.html" rel="nofollow">Here is another link, not Marlyn's press release but a mention in a 3rd party publication regarding the same award</a></dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In response to the point 2 in the Criteria for Companies and Corporations, the criteria is that the company is "listed" in the ranking indices. Hoovers by it's nature is a ranking index and Marlyn is listed. Where a company falls within the listing or the number of companies in the index are not stated in Point 2, and I consequently I feel your point that Hoover's has 18 million companies listed is irrelevant. Please understand, I get your point, it's just not part of the criteria listed in WP:CORP.<small>—comment <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">added</a> by</small> Mrenzyme<sup>(<b>t</b>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mrenzyme_02f5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mrenzyme"><b>c</b></a>)</sup>

<li>You are correct in your assumption about link one and four; apologies for getting my wires crossed. In general, websites like that one are not considered reliable sources (See <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html#Using_online_and_self-published_sources" title="WP:RS">WP:RS#Using_online_and_self-published_sources</a>). NutraIngredients-USA.com is not peer-reviewed, it is not produced by an well-known independently-published journalist, its articles do not cite their own sources, and the degree and quality of editorial oversight are unclear. As such, it doesn't meet our guidelines for sources. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 13:39, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ok, I don't have any more arguments. Y'all are toughies.&#160;:) but I appreciate your purpose. Let me pose a question...I have noticed other companies in the nutraceutical market that have listings on Wikipedia. It appears they are listed in food-company-stub. Is it appropriate for the Naturally Vitamins page to be moved into that section? <small>—comment <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">added</a> by</small> Mrenzyme<sup>(<b>t</b>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mrenzyme_02f5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mrenzyme"><b>c</b></a>)</sup></li>
<li>Generally speaking, an article's categorization has no real effect on an AFD discussion; it's basically just an internal filing system. That said, it's certainly possible that the articles for some of those companies don't belong on Wikipedia either, and you're welcome to list them here for discussion if you feel that is the case. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 03:04, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
