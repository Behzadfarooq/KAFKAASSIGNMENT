<li><b>Comment</b> Some comments above claim that the information in the article is verifiable. However, as far as I can see, the only attributed source that might help with verification is the school website. The policy <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">WP:VERIFY</a> states "Articles should rely on credible, third-party sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy.", and the guideline <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> states "Caution should be used when using company or organization websites as sources.". Where are the third-party sources that back up the various claims in the article?

<li><b>Keep</b> because this is a perfectly acceptable article for a (Jewish) school of which there are thousands (of non-Jewish) similar ones listed on Wikipedia. Any Jewish school that has existed for almost fifty years already makes it notable. If this article were to be deleted then all the entries in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Category%7EConservative_Jewish_day_schools_49d5.html" title="Category:Conservative Jewish day schools">Category:Conservative Jewish day schools</a> or in all of <a href="../../../j/e/w/Category%7EJewish_day_schools_a8b5.html" title="Category:Jewish day schools">Category:Jewish day schools</a> should go which would be ludicrous.

<li><b>Comment</b>- I disagree entirely. If by your above argument you mean that we should have either no or extremely lax standards that we should hold articles containing information, that defeats the purpose of having a level of encyclopedicness to the project. If having a standard, however, means that some articles aren't up to it, perhaps that implies that the subject is not appropriate for this encyclopedic project. To address the second issue, notability of a subject can indeed vary from group to group, and please take notice that in the essay on <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>, the fundamental policy is cited that one must have been the subject of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">independant verifiable scrutiny</a>, which this subject cannot claim- its verifiable source (the NCES information) mentions it only in passing and cannot be claimed to be solely a study on this subject alone. I agree with you that many of the subjects in the Schools category have a shaky claim to inclusion. If you feel this is the case then I encourage you to go through the proper processes and nominate the questionable articles for deletion. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 14:25, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Schools have a far more inherent level of notability above and beyond the thousands of other article categories in Wikipedia. There is no inherent issue with the article or its contents. The failure to develop (and agree upon) objective criteria for schools has left this debate in the hands of deletionists who will vote to delete anything with which they are unfamiliar or uninterested.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I must disagree on strong terms with most of what you say. If you hold the opinion that this article is being included while inappropriate less-notable subject are not, then I remind you that the AFD process is every bit as available to those other subjects as it is to this one. Further, I would like to remind you, after reading your accusations of this article being "left in the hands of deletionists who will vote to delete anything with which they are unfamiliar or uninterested", and how this is "deletecruft", of one of the Wikipedia guidelines regarding <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a> of editors who disagree, and additionally the possibility that people who disagree with you might merely have different standards for what they perceive to be a subject about which an encyclopedic article may be written. There is a gulf of difference in the idea that there's some secret brotherhood of deletionists out to get all of the valuable articles, and the idea that a large portion of the editor community does not thing that a primary school with no claim to notability is not appropriate material for a Wikipedia article (see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, namely "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information.) --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 17:49, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This (admittedly apparently not-for-profit) business is announcing the availability of their services on Wikipedia. That's advertising.

<li>I guess I have to remind you yet again to assume good faith. Your constant assumption of bad faith and policy violation on the part of the authors of school related articles is troublesome, and frankly, you should know better. It is a patent assumption of bad faith to categorically state the author of an article about this school is somehow "...a business announcing the availability of services..." Since I am fairly certain that you are not suggesting that the school itself somehow wrote the article, I can only guess that you are talking about its' author. Please provide evidence that the author is "advertising" on behalf of the school, rather than simply creating an article about a school which is like THOUSANDS of others to be found on wikipedia. Unless you have such evidence, this accusation is offensive and uncivil. In this particular case, it also violates <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a>.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 07:12, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The intent of the author isn't really in question. The author may have been a school project member working down a list, a former student, a teacher at the school, a paid advertising agent, or the very unlikely result of a random letter generator. I really don't care. This is a business offering a service, and Wikipedia is under no obligation to offer them a venue to announce the availability of their service, regardless of who wrote the article. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 07:37, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
