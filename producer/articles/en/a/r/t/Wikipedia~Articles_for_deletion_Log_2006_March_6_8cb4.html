<li><b>Delete</b>; newsworthy as a candidate, but not of much <i>encyclopedic</i> value if we consider possible that the article will have to be deleted in few years. The article also seems to show problems of verifiability (how can we verify that he donates blood every 2 months? Who verified that?

<li><b>Comment:</b> I created this page because David asked me to and someone not affiliated with the campaign or David continues to edit it. David certainly does meet the second bullet point on <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> which by the way states "This is not intended to be an exclusionary list. Just because someone doesn't fall into one of these categories doesn't mean an article on the person should automatically be deleted." You can't make it more clear than that. Whoever you are, I'd appreciate it if you'd stop this witch hunt. If you have problems with David, he'd be happy to discuss them with you- davidgill@gill2006.com As for the name of the article, there already was an article titled David Gill, so I needed something to distinguish the two and MD is what came to mind. Any particulare reason it should be changed? As for verifing that Doc donates blood, I didn't even know that until he told me himself. If you really want me to, I can have him contact the blood bank and post the record on the website or something.jfrank
<ul>
<li>The article's current title is improperly formatted according to <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28people%29_db33.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (people)">Wikipedia naming conventions</a>, hence my suggestion of <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Gill_%28politician%29_6ac3.html" title="David Gill (politician)">David Gill (politician)</a>. If this AfD concludes with the article not being deleted, a <a href="../../../d/a/b/WP%7EDAB_f303.html" title="WP:DAB">disambiguation</a> page will likely be created at <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Gill_f426.html" title="David Gill">David Gill</a> to help direct readers to the appropriate article. As for the rest of your comment, I'm pretty sure that writing a candidate bio as a person involved in said candidate's campaign ranks rather highly on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_bad_article_ideas_6658.html" title="Wikipedia:List of bad article ideas">list of bad article ideas</a>. Perhaps you need to back off and allow for more objective users to evaluate the article and decide what is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> and what isn't. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesquire_e70c.html" title="User:Thesquire">Thesquire</a> <small>(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThesquire_8265.html" title="User talk:Thesquire">talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Thesquire_ea24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Thesquire">contribs</a>)</small> 05:30, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thank you for that. I'll definitely change the name! And I should clarify that I have no problem with others editing the page. What I <i>do</i> take issue with is the Johnson troll who started this whole thing in the first place. That is to whom my comment was refering. I'd venture to say that I know a lot more about TJ than his people know about David, but you won't see me or any of us editing Tim's page or unneccessarily flagging it. Can anyone tell me when we can expect a ruling on this? jfrank</li>

<p>I'm moving this from Prod to AfD because I think the band has at least a <i>case</i>, although not a strong one, but maybe I'm missing something. I wrote this article, but only in the process of researching the <i>real</i> <a href="../../../e/c/h/Echo_Star_Helstrom_77b7.html" title="Echo Star Helstrom">Echo Helstrom</a>, and I neither know nor care anything about the band. But they do have two albums out (albeit at least the first was self-published), they have received good reviews (but not, apparently, in really major mags), and they did do the music for a Netscape ad (wheeee). Basically, if there's anyone from Portland that knows anything about this band? Maybe they are better-known than they appear to be, or something. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 00:17, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><del><b>Delete</b>. Seems like a hoax, a parody of business jargon. I suspect the author is just trying to have fun tricking people into thinking that a bunch of gibberish has meaning.

<li><b>Comment</b> - The article <i>does</i> read like a parody of business/computer jargon, but it appears not to be a hoax. See, e.g. <a href="http://www.hicss.hawaii.edu/hicss_34/bestpapers34.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hicss.hawaii.edu/hicss_34/bestpapers34.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Moreover, the term gets quite a few (seemingly) relevant web hits.

<li>Wow, yeah, I guess you're right. Plus, if it was a joke, the author probably wouldn't have made a zillion edits to it. And if that paper is indeed real, it's not strictly OR either.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I've been watching this article since it was written, and it has only gotten worse. (Well, not entirely - for a while the term "thinklet" was never even defined.) This is apparently one guy's neologism, and the article was created by someone who attended a seminar where it was mentioned. The chance of expanding (yikes) or improving it appear minimal. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 00:39, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep, but extreme stubify or mark for complete rewrite</b>. I find that it is impossible to understand gibberish, but I verified that the Hawaii conference listed as a source does exist and did have presentations on this topic in 2004. So I don't think deleting is the answer. However, Wikipedia should aspire to significantly greater readability so we should somehow "send back" the article for a complete rewrite. By the way, I tried to read the first page of that 2004 presentation on thinklets, and while it is less gibberish than our article, I did not end up any wiser. I still have no idea what thinklets are, and hereby retreat licking my wounds from my attempt to <i>sofixit</i>. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp_7670.html" title="User:Martinp">Martinp</a> 04:01, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>merge</b></s>. Form 2 can be easily be rendered as form 1, by a simple renumbering. Define two sequences of cases: let <span class="texhtml"><i>c</i><i>a</i><i>s</i><i>e</i><sub><i>A</i></sub></span> the original cases and let <span class="texhtml"><i>c</i><i>a</i><i>s</i><i>e</i><sub><i>B</i></sub>(<i>n</i>) = <i>c</i><i>a</i><i>s</i><i>e</i><sub><i>A</i></sub>(<i>n</i> + 1)</span>, be a renumbered sequence. So the form 2 induction for <span class="texhtml"><i>c</i><i>a</i><i>s</i><i>e</i><sub><i>A</i></sub></span> just becomes a form 1 induction for <span class="texhtml"><i>c</i><i>a</i><i>s</i><i>e</i><sub><i>B</i></sub></span>, with an extra vaciously true case <span class="texhtml"><i>c</i><i>a</i><i>s</i><i>e</i><sub><i>B</i></sub>(0)</span>. In general induction arguments don't have to start at 1, if you can prove all cases up to <i>m</i> by other means and then prove &gt;<i>m</i> using induction then its just as good an argument. Its a shame we've had to go here, instead of reverting the merge notice, which imediatly led to and afd in retaliation, a discussion on the merge would have been more civil.--<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 13:22, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>The essence of Polya's example is <b>not erroneous proof</b>; the essense is the <b>form</b> of the argument. What is erroneous is there only because Polya wanted to divorce the form from specific cases, and also to set an exercise for students. But Polya's example illustrates the form perfectly.

<li><b>Delete</b> Firstly - I am not Krause - so this can't be considered vanity, perhaps blind admiration at best. Secondly you're all being very condescending and elitist. At no point does the article claim Mr. Krause has "re-established the Platonic school" or any other claims - if you actually read his work all he does is humble himself and does not even refer to himself as a philosopher but rather someone who is just repeating ancient wisdom. Mr. Krause makes no claims of accomplishing anything and all his works are dedicated to his teachers rather than himself, explaining to the reader that any thoughts must be attributed to them and them alone. Anyway, I wouldn't want this stub, which I was going to expand to include commentary on all his key points being in such a elitist environment so delete. <a href="../../../b/a/a/User%7EBaalhammon_3c8d.html" title="User:Baalhammon">Baalhammon</a> 6 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>After reading the above, I'll rephrase my vote: <b>Delete</b> Non-notable philospher. Having a blog does not make you notable. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 04:52, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Although Mr. Krause is not published yet does not make his thoughts any less legitimate, nor does his age. Young people have accomplished great things in the past (See: Alexander the Great). Attack the ideas, not the character. I'd like to again stress that I have no personal affiliation to Mr. Krause. What makes a philosopher notable anyway? The common man wouldn't know the name Nietzsche and of course wouldn't know the name Wittgenstein - but these are giants of philosophy. By another logic, Socrates, Epictetus and other Greeks didn't write down or publish their philosophy, and we consider them classical, if not crucial. Although there is a link to a personal blog on Krause's site, there is also academic essays and a philosophical treatise on ethics. <a href="../../../b/a/a/User%7EBaalhammon_3c8d.html" title="User:Baalhammon">Baalhammon</a> 04:52, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'll respond to only one of your questions, as it's the only one that matters here: <i>What makes a philosopher notable anyway?</i> To put it simply, a notable person is one that many people have heard of. It is not Wikipedia's task to publicize unknown people, but rather document notable people. Krause is not prominent, he is not well-known. The specific guidelines that Wikipedia recommends are at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a>. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 05:09, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> to be contrarian. I would like to perform an experiment of the contrary method of discouraging vanity articles: keeping them, locking their content so that the author can't delete them, and publicizing them so widely that the author is embarrassed into never ever doing it again. I doubt that will happen here, but it's worth a try. Reading the article was worth enough of a laugh to warrant something silly here.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Apparently my edit yesterday didn't come through. Tsuna zaka makes legitimate reference to notability, and it has it's own article on JA Wiki.

<dd>Er, I can't read Japanese, but the English version of Tsuna zaka makes no substantial claims to notability. It talks about the origin of the name, which is that of an ogre-slaying samurai, but that makes the samurai (slightly) notable, not the street. Or is every place named for a notable person automatically notable, too? <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 05:25, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The English version doesn't explain it very well. The ogre-slaying samurai is considered to have been born in the area of Tsuna zaka, which is why, I assume, the article was deemed worthy for JA. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshgavin_9ad7.html" title="User:Freshgavin"><font size="-2" color="white" style="background:blue">&#160;freshgavin</font></a><a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreshgavin_46e9.html" title="User talk:Freshgavin"><font size="-2" color="blue">ΓΛĿЌ&#160;</font></a> 05:44, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Notwithstanding the <i>opinion</i> of <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman">Brenneman</a>, there is extensive news coverage of this gang dating back to the early 90s and they do have an established presence in various states inclusing NC, CA and WI among others. If every serial killer qualifies for an article, based largely on the news coverage surrounding their crimes, why not gangs? They collectively kill a lot of people and are frequently in the news. They also have a far greater impact within defined ethnic communities.-- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 20:24, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think the point he's trying to make is that it is no use running around yelling "we have sources, we have sources!" if 1) you don't show us discussing the deletion what they are, and 2) if you don't show future readers of the article what they are. Slapping weblinks to one or more prime examples of these sources, on the other hand, is the metaphorical <i><b>Good Thing</b></i>. -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> 21:35, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - the only airstrip in the vicinity of Waikouaiti shown on the official LINZ mapping data is 234 Metres in length, and is approx 7 km south of the township. International Jet flights would have to be diverted to Invercargill, Queenstown or Christchurch, even Taieri airport at 700 Metres length wouldnt be suitable, and its only 13 kilometres north of Dunedin Airport. Now thats objectivity and diligence. However, if you are in a small aircraft running out of fuel and your pda finds this article, the lat long coordinates might be helpful.. Long 170 37' 18.8 Lat -45 38' 33.48. Personally I would would like to see all airstrips in NZ logged, but I'm picking theres some reason to establish a threshold... is it lack of funds and therefore server space / bandwidth? how is the threshold determined? <a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozasaur_fb9c.html" title="User:Mozasaur">moza</a> 14:14, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as complete bollocks. My uncle used to like in Waikouaiti, and I spent some time in the town last month. No airport - a small airstrip used by local farmers for topdressing flights, yes, but little more than that (BTW, Waikouait' has a population of 800). <i>Never</i> used as a redirection from Dunedin airport - nothing larger than a Cessna would be able to land there. As for linking to Sydney and Brisbane, well, work it out. It doesn't even link to Oamaru and Dunedin. As Moza says, Dunedin flights are diverted to Invercargill or Christchrch. Oh, just correct a couple of Moza's comments, BTW - it's closer to 50km from Momona (Dunedin airport). Momona has, to my knowledge never been closed through congestion, only through flooding or fog (though if Momona was out of action for those reasons, Taieri Aerodrome would be too). Perhaps the coordinates of the strip could be part of a List of airports and airstrips in New Zealand, but that's all that would be needed. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 23:48, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>1/ I believed that the discussion was to be on the articles' talk page, and <i>then</i> the vote moved <i>here</i>. Anyway, relax, 2/ I am a digital cartographer, I do have the official licensed data, I was diligent in my measurement, and it is only 13km to Taieri airport, from Momona, aka Dunedin Airport. The subject was diversion from Dunedin International. The Waikouaiti airstrip is close to 45km from Momona, but now we are wasting energy. Its clear now to all, and just process from here to end of story. 3/ Wikipedia has done well in recent testing for accuracy, compared with other information sources, but none of my pilot friends would need to use it for navigation, we use the latest released charts of course. I do mix up a bit of tongue in cheek, sorry. However, one of the primary activities in the cockpit of a single engine aircraft, is to scan and identify potential landing sites in case of engine failure. Vigilance and knowledge does save lives. 4/ I have driven through there many times, (but never spotted any planes, although one time there was a breath test bus in the middle of nowhere, and they told me of reports of red glows in the sky, aurora australis, my core passion) I spent a night in Waikouaiti back in 1993, on tour with the Jodi Vaughn and <a href="../../../e/d/d/Eddie_Low_7ed5.html" title="Eddie Low">Eddie Low</a>, true, maybe my pics could go on their articles, perhaps thats worth noting, lol guys. <a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozasaur_fb9c.html" title="User:Mozasaur">moza</a> 05:19, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't use the number of papers in my criteria for notability. I merely listed the number above for those, such as yourself, who feel it is important (since MathSciNet is only by subscription). Rather, I go by criteria on whether he would be considered notable by his peers. I rather suspect from reading the XSL attack page that his peers would consider him a good up and coming researcher but not particularly famous, and his future fame would seemingly depend on how this XSL attack turns out. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 00:13, 11 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think the issue is not really Courtois, but the standards for bios of academics. I think yours are too high. In my opinion it would be fine if every bio of a tenured full professor in a PhD-granting program at a research university, were kept. That doesn't mean we'll actually <i>get</i> a bio of every such person, just that they shouldn't be deleted. (BTW I don't think Courtois is a full prof yet, but he clearly meets that level of notability.) --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 00:54, 11 March 2006 (UTC)

I see no reason to weaken the coverage of boat builders at wikipedia as seen in <a href="../../../b/o/a/Category%7EBoat_builders_bdea.html" title="Category:Boat builders">category: boat builders</a>. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 12:49, 6 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Note</b> I strongly support an article on the boats and their designer/builder but this article is a stub of corporate history that basically says the company has been twice bankrupted. Therefore it should be judged on WP:CORP. If the article can be changed to reflect the story of the boats and their place in Washington State history I will gladly withdraw the nomination. As user:JJay has defended the article here and at prod perhaps the onus of improving the article should fall on him--<a href="../../../p/o/r/User%7EPorturology_8c86.html" title="User:Porturology">Porturology</a> 13:09, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm sure you are perfectly capable of improving articles to fit your personal criteria. I've added a reference now it's your turn. I would point out, though, that the history of the manufacture of the boats is intimately linked with the history of the company. You should also know that this was a publicly traded company, it's stock having been listed in 1959. By the 1990s its largest yachts were selling for upwards of $1million and its production was exported to Canada, Europe and Japan.

<dd>What makes them noteworthy? We're not talking the Crips or Bloods here. Existence does not equal notability. Nothing in the article is verified. Of your poorly presented "sources" we have something called "gangsorus" which I am not convinced is verifiable media coverage, an article from the Sacramento Bee with the line: "He worked as a cook at Burger King and ran with MOD (Masters of Destruction), a Hmong gang whose influence has spread from California to the Carolinas." and another local paper which merely mentions the name of this gang in a long list of gang names. The Sacramento Bee article is undated, but from quotes like "..is scheduled to return home by 2002" and the 1999 data in the included grapic we can also surmise that this is not recent media coverage. Please familiarize yourself with WP source, citation, general style and <i>especially</i> notability guidelines. I would also recommend you improve the article instead of blowing hot air on the AfD vote. The <i>indiscriminate</i> extension of the "Fresno Bulldog Gangs" <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wikipedia%7EWalled_garden_a64f.html" title="Wikipedia:Walled garden">walled garden</a> is not, IMO, a desirable road to go down. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><b><font style="verdana" color="#990000">D</font><font color="#669900">e</font><font color="#990000">izio</font></b></a> 16:53, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Now, now, no need to be rude. This really isn't that important an issue, surely? I have tried my (limited) best to improve the article already, as well as "blowing hot air", a phrase for which there seems to be little need. If you care so passionately about this, well, crikey, I'll just walk away. My understanding is that non-notability is a point of view issue and not necessarily grounds for deletion.<a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 17:28, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Non-notability is <b>exactly</b> the determiner of retention or deletion. Everything else including content, style, popularity, tastefulness etc. is secondary. If you thought the "blowing hot air" comment was rude, I apologise. Then again we are discussing an article about people who apparently commit forced rapes, violent thefts and lots more non kitten-and-bunny-stroking related activities. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><b><font style="verdana" color="#990000">D</font><font color="#669900">e</font><font color="#990000">izio</font></b></a> 17:38, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not entirely true. As I understand it, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_paper_aa2d.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not paper">Wikipedia is not paper</a>, and obscurity is not necessarily a deletion criterion.

In this case, a gang operating over several states, for whatever reason, seems to me a sufficient phenomenon to be worth recording.

<dd>Sweet. But what is not entirely true? I didn't say anything about obscurity and could not agree more that Wiki is not paper. I said "Non-notability is <b>exactly</b> the determiner of retention or deletion". That's a fact. An article can be about an obscure, tasteless or useless subject, as long as it passes the <i>notability</i> criteria. You've quoted <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> but I think you could give it another once over. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><b><font style="verdana" color="#990000">D</font><font color="#669900">e</font><font color="#990000">izio</font></b></a> 18:54, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I can't believe that I need to recommend this to an experienced editor such as yourself, but maybe you should check the Deletion policy? Non-notability is not a core determiner of retention or deletion, and, as the notability page establishes, it is controversial whether it should ever be such a criterion. Therefore in the case of a gang which has been the cause of multiple serious assaults (and is therefore notable to the person who created this article, researchers into Hmong immigrant experience, researchers into gangs at the turn of the millenium, etc), I'm surprised to see you mention it as your core reason for voting a certain way. That said, it seems a good compromise to <b>merge</b> and <b>redirect</b>. By the way, you might also want to take a wee glance at (<a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivil_1ef2.html" title="WP:Civil">WP:Civil</a>). Oh, and maybe think about the reasons why people might offer arguments and votes on an AfD without having the core knowledge necessary to improve an article.<a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 09:21, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I missed the meeting where "Non-notability is not a core determiner of retention or deletion" became policy, truly I did.

<li>Hmm. I would prefer it if people could back up their claims of notability with facts and sources JJ. That's all. The article doesn't really have any right now, you see. If they are "frequently in the news", why did Brenneman have so little luck in his googling? If your vote came from a new editor it would look like sockpuppety.

<li><b>Delete</b> while my usual hunches are based on "if I've heard of it somewhere else besides Wikipedia, it's probably notable", in this case the other site was somethingawful.com. =/ While even <i>that</i> doesn't make the thing too questionable, I think the lack of other stuff does.

<li><b>DO NOT DELETE</b>. I believe this information regarding Mr. McNeill is possibly the result of a project my eight year old son was doing for school. The project was on the unsung heroes of the entertainment industry. My son contacted the Discovery Channel with questions and they forwarded them to several of their producers, camera men, make-up artists, etc. Mr. McNeill was one of the individuals who received my son's questions and Mr. McNeill was more than willing to help him out with his report by providing his personal experiences and stories, not to mention some pictures and memorabilia from the Discovery Channel (my son is a big fan). The outlook that my son, with Mr. McNeill’s assistance, was able to give to his classmates challenged what many minors view as a glamorous entertainment industry. I believe information for Ryan McNeill is important for children who are aspiring members of the entertainment industry so they will not have a false impression of what TV/Movies/Magazines has given us, but also as a testament to never give up. --Abbryan 19:22, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm curious, what challenges did this person overcome which have been mentioned in this article? Fame too large for Oklahoma and free lance visionary don't seem particularly challenging, to me. <b>Delete</b>, vanity. Followup: artistdirect and allmusic never heard of him (though allmusic has basically-empty pages on Ryan McNeil and Ryan MacNeill), nor do they know The Danes. And we don't have an article on them, either. Ten Google hits for '"Ryan McNeill" "the danes"' Two Google hits for '"Ryan McNeill" "Debate Team"', both myspace pages. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 21:29, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>In the article he stated that "..his growing level of discontent took him on a dark path. One that would lead him to seedier parts of Dallas, TX and eventually land him in a minimum security detention center for advanced learners." He had not mentioned this to my son, but he told my son of some struggles with alcohol, drugs and sexual deviance. I was monitoring their correspondence out of protection for my son, but I did not get involved because I wanted him to grow through the experience. Mr. McNeill did not go into much detail regarding the alcohol, drugs and sexual deviances, which I appriciate due to the age of my son. At no time did I question the credibility of Mr. McNeill until this "Articles for deletion" was brought to my attention by his second grade teacher, who was so impressed by my son's report that she wanted to get more information on his sources. I assume it is possible that my son, not to mention his teacher and I, have been "Oprah-ed" by a possible James Frey wannabe. Possible, but not likely. Mr. McNeill was pleasant and helpful to my son. He did not have anything to gain, nor did he appear to have motives other than sharing his experiences to assist my son in earning an 'A', not to mention growing in knowledge. Has anyone attempted to contact Mr. McNeill personally? I prefer to honor his privacy due to his willingness to assist my son, but it is odd to me that the jury was quick to convict without a statement from the suspect.--Abbryan 01:10, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, I recognize the name and his history from his days with The Danes. The Danes toured the country and thousands and thousands have seen Mr. McNeil play - remember that the rule regarding the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> test is the following: "The fact an article doesn't meet guidelines on [the WP:MUSIC Page], does not necessarily mean it qualifies for deletion, as a mere claim of notability (even if contested) may avoid deletion under A7. Please note that the failure to meet any of these criteria does not mean an article must be deleted; likewise, the meeting of any of these criteria does not mean that an article must be kept. These are merely rules of thumb which some editors choose to keep in mind when deciding whether or not to keep an article that is on articles for deletion." Obviously, it looks like Mr. McNeil has several other fans besides me that recognize his success and contribution to the music and entertainment scene. Don't punish his achievements because they happened before such achievements were published on the Internet - today, with the Internet the way it is, the Danes would be all over it. 207.218.180.163 22:50, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> unless someone can actually prove that the tours were at all significant. Wikipedia isn't here to create notability, no matter how deserved that may be, it's here to reflect it. If there isn't any success or influence, there is nothing to reflect. A band that is only ever heard live by a thousand people total, but they all go out and form bands may well be notable. A band that plays to hundreds of thousands in total, but does it by being 'live music' in a range of local bars night after night for years isn't. It's like comparing a three-Michelin starred chef to a burger flipper and saying the flipper is more notable through sheer numbers fed. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 23:13, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I see no reason for this article until nominations have been announced. We don't have a confirmed host, no nominations -- the only thing we know for certain is that it'll be held at the Kodak Theatre.

<li><b>Keep</b> - The article for the 78th Academy Awards was created in January of 2005, OVER a year before the awards show, and there was no objection to it's creation. I don't see a problem in having this article, as long as crystalballism doesn't get stuffed into it (AKA: I think Chris Rock is gonna host again!). Even still, if it gets deleted once again, it'll just be re-created by someone who doesn't know. How soon is too soon? I think less than a year is fine. --<b><a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightdarkness_f41f.html" title="User:Lightdarkness"><font color="#666666">light</font></a><a href="../../../l/i/g/User%7ELightdarkness_f41f.html" title="User:Lightdarkness"><font color="#000000">darkness</font></a></b> <sup>(<a href="../../../l/i/g/User_talk%7ELightdarkness_7a78.html" title="User talk:Lightdarkness">talk</a>)</sup> 19:41, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I don't vote - <b>I decided to leave it to others</b>. My thoughts on the topic
<ul>
<li>On one hand, in principle, I like to think about Wikipedia as about one project with different languge version. In an ideal utopic Wikipedia, every article would be in all langugaes. Czech Wikipedia community allready voted twice (I did not participated in the votes), and the article survived. As the topic is mainly Czech related and he is considered notable enough on cs:, I'd respect such decision in almost all cases. Other point is I personaly also think Ross Hedvicek is Wikipedia notable Not by wide margin, but notable, mainly because of spamming and trolling fame. IMO in an ideal asymptotic Wikipedia he would have an article. (And we allready have articles about famous trolls such as <a href="../../../g/n/a/GNAA_29cf.html" title="GNAA">GNAA</a>) One of problems is that "fame" is mainly related to Czech language, and hard to reference in English.</li>
<li>On the other hand, pragmatically, the effort connected to maintaince of the article, constant attacks on Talk:, etc ... make the "cost" of the article overwhelmingly improportional to its "value".</li>
<li>so, why I'm nominating it? 1) It has been suggested by uninvolved ediotors coming through RfC request 2) If the ultimate destination of the article is deletion, better delete it now, before more effort and time is vasted. On the other hand, if the result of AfD would be keep, the article will probably exist permanently, and the effort makes at least marginal sense. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikimol_736e.html" title="User:Wikimol">Wikimol</a> 19:30, 6 March 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikimol_736e.html" title="User:Wikimol">Wikimol</a> 00:55, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Note: I attempted to summarize various claims of notability here. I'm inluding it here, as the presence of that information in the article is disputed / subject of an edit war. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikimol_736e.html" title="User:Wikimol">Wikimol</a> 19:51, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> because: (1) it is not <i>that</i> unique to have strong opinions on Czech politics as RH has, (2) maintenance of the article here is impossible (it is target of constant edit wars on Czech Wiki), (3) the article here edited by RH himself (user names YanYeoman, Ferdinand etc), (4) this vote already became proxy battlefield for the long war on Czech Wikipedia over Vít Zvánovec.<br />
I would compare this vote to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_James_Bowery_dd10.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/James Bowery">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/James Bowery</a> (aka Baldrson), except that Bowery actually had (technology related) claims to notability than mere being a troll.<br />

<dd>I slightly disagree with the above representation of the history of the page. As at least one side was quite unwilling to fight in revert war, the page was reverted little (compared to <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erika_Steinbach_7678.html" title="Erika Steinbach">real edit wars</a>). The dispute soon moved to Talk:. There, the disscussion is poisoned by personal attacks by Ross and attempts to divert the theme to some complains regarding Czech Wikipedia, but it does neet seem it was succesful. --<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikimol_736e.html" title="User:Wikimol">Wikimol</a> 00:05, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I just want to point out that the fact that somebody is not known outside one country is <i>not</i> a deletion argument. Wikipedia is global in scope; the English version uses English to convey that global knowledge. The problem with the current article is that it doesn't make a good case for how or why he is famous in Czechia or among Czechs, beyond the "internet community", whatever that is exactly supposed to mean (Usenet? Forums?), or even within that community. Has he, for instance, been mentioned or interviewed in mainstream Czech newspapers or other periodicals? <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 07:49, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The deletion process is designed to determine the consensus of opinion of Wikipedia editors; for this reason comments from users whose histories do not show experience with or contributions to Wikipedia are traditionally given less weight and may be discounted entirely.

<li><b>Keep</b>. There is absolutely no reason to delete this given that 2024 is part of the speculation and planning among potential bidders.

<li>I see your point, but there's no such information in the article...I reviewed the 2020 Olympics, and it actually had information in it. So I wouldn't vote against it.

<li><b>Keep</b> True, but that doesn't mean that the 2024 article <i>can't</i> have such information in it. Wikipedia isn't really in the spirit of <i>deleting articles because they aren't good enough</i>. Why not keep it as a stub, to encourage anyone with relevant information to put it there? I acknowledge that there must be some sort of limitation (as one could apply to same reasoning to justify the 2876 Olympics), but 2024 isn't all that far off. ~ <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooyabazooka_79a9.html" title="User:Booyabazooka">Booyabazooka</a>

<li>I think those are distinguishable, as one documents a rather ironclad astronomical prediction, in contrast to speculation about human or governmental intentions or hopes. Even when that speculation has been expressed in a verifiable source, I don't think it's substantial enough on which to base anything more than a news article, because its importance is far too ephemeral. Once the bids actually occur, who was maybe thinking about bidding at some point is too irrelevant to be documented in an encyclopedia. The other future year article, while a little crufty, still documents unchanging facts about what works of fiction have depicted about occurring in that year. I still think both of those are of little value, however, so I'd err on the side of deleting those as well if there is a genuine issue of inconsistency with this decision. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 18:53, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. It appears to me that the reasoning behind the <a href="../../../o/l/y/Wikipedia%7EOlympic_conventions_archive_8e57.html#Medal_counts_should_include_ONLY_medals_and_not_Top-8_placements." title="Wikipedia:Olympic conventions/archive">new policy</a> is essentially that a "medal count" should specifically count medals. However, this page does not claim to be a medal count; it clearly states that it is a diploma count. It looks to be properly-sourced and verifiable. It seems that the real question is whether a page titled "diploma count" should be subjected to a policy which is specifically tailored to pages titled "medal count." Though it should be noted that the diploma count appears to be constructed specifically to flaunt the new policy. - <a href="../../../r/y/n/User%7ERynne_b8d8.html" title="User:Rynne">Rynne</a> 23:30, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I got the impression from that debate that a diploma count would be welcome to a good portion of the users there, so long as it was separate from a medal count. I don't think there was a consensus about whether or not it would be okay to start a new article about it, but it certainly doesn't see to violate policy. I'd like to hear from someone more involved before I make a judgment. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickelShoe_2d9b.html" title="User:NickelShoe">NickelShoe</a> 23:39, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - this states clearly that it's a diploma count, not a medal count, and states exactly why eight (because that's the places that get diplomas). If these are genuinely being handed out by the IOC (which I believe they are), and the standings are readily available and verifiable (which they are), then what exactly is the problem? The previous discussion was specifically about medal tables - this isn't a medal table, so the previous discussion does not necessarily hold. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 23:55, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: By the Olympic Charter, the first, second, and third place medalists recieve both medals and diplomas (<a href="http://www.sport.gov.gr/2/24/243/2431/24314/243144/paper8.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sport.gov.gr/2/24/243/2431/24314/243144/paper8.html" rel="nofollow">source</a>).

I cannot believe that after a concensus was already reached (see <a href="../../../o/l/y/Wikipedia%7EOlympic_conventions_6e97.html" title="Wikipedia:Olympic conventions">Wikipedia:Olympic conventions</a>) that we are revisiting this issue. Those that support this so-called "diploma count" should have been present at the Olympic conventions debate, which I may add, was well publicized and well marked on Wikipedia for all interested parties to participate in. Most articles on the Olympic Games were marked with a template mentioning this conventions discussion and many participated. As far as I'm concerned and as far as the record is concerned, Wikipedia has already decided upon the appropriate templates for medal counts and this type of count was found inappropriate.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. This was my original post for a vote on top-8 count templates. <i>I noticed that the 2006 Winter Olympics medal count not only has medals won by each national team but also includes "Top-8 placements" (fourth through eighth places). I believe the article is named "medal count" for a reason. These tables are not named "honorable mention count." Medal counts are for medals, period. --Caponer 03:02, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</i>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The issue here is that in regards to the page in question, "diploma counts" are not "medal counts". However, WikiProject Sports Olympics does specify "medal counts" are to be used in general Olympic articles, so this debate would seem to have no influence on any article except this particular one. I don't think anyone is suggesting the guidelines set up in the WikiProject and <a href="../../../o/l/y/Wikipedia%7EOlympic_conventions_6e97.html" title="Wikipedia:Olympic conventions">Wikipedia:Olympic conventions</a> should be changed; we're just trying to figure how they apply to this specific page. - <a href="../../../r/y/n/User%7ERynne_b8d8.html" title="User:Rynne">Rynne</a> 01:53, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Aparently you don't get the picture. The Olympic conventions page <b>is just a guideline</b>, as you explicitely stated above. I've been saying that all along; if you don't believe it should be followed, don't follow it. This debate is about whether or not this page should be deleted, and after seeing the overwhelming amount of evidence against having this page, you should be sure that a DELETE vote would be best. What should there be 2 tables for anyway?

<li><b>Comment</b>: "Insulting" has nothing to do with anything. I've got lots of insults for <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wayne_Gacy_2452.html" title="John Wayne Gacy">John Wayne Gacy</a> but that doesn't mean he's not notable. My point is that this table doesn't offer any useful information. This doesn't even give a hint to how high 8th place is in some cases. In the Alpine Skiing article mentioned below, 8th place doesn't look so bad because 60 people were involved. In hockey and curling, 8th place is actually 3rd or 4th from last! To me, this list simply looks like a way to get an olympic mention for Moldova. I also don't see where the concept of diploma gets much coverage in the world - I'm reasonably knowledgeable about sports and I've never even heard of the concept. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 11:57, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: so first you compared olympic athletes to blondes with halitosis, and now you're comparing them to a serial killer? take it easy.. i'm just reminding you to be nice, that's all. Anyway, I'd never heard of the concept either until i came across this table.. but that's certainly not justification for deleting it. are you disputing the notability of the table? since the olympics are such a high-profile event, i would think that even <i>qualifying</i> for them is a notable feat.. <a href="../../../m/l/m/User%7EMlm42_1189.html" title="User:Mlm42">Mlm42</a> 14:36, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Come on, are you reading every 3rd word of what I write? In my first statement, I was trying to simply make a point that showing the total of all athletes from Iceland who came in 7th from the Olympics sounds like useless statistic-cruft to me. I wasn't comparing the athletes, I was comparing the usefulness of the data presented (sheesh). Then you accused me of being insulting so my second statement was saying that, not only wasn't I trying to be insulting of the athletes themselves but that, even if I <i>was</i> being insulting, that has nothing to do with notability - i.e. I think you're confusing two separate concepts (sheesh again). If I'm insulting anything, it's how little the data in this table is actually showing. I don't mind the lists that show who came in 48th in Alpine Skiing because you're right, just making the Olympics is noteworthy. But that's not what this list is showing - it's showing a giant total of all of the 7th-place finishers grouped by country. Not interesting. Is there some big study I'm not aware of that's relating the number of 7th-place finishers from Scandinavia to the phases of Jupiter? I don't think a list of people from Hungary whose name begins with J would be very interesting either - that doesn't mean I hate all people from Hungary whose name starts with J. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 16:07, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>yikes, sorry.. i know you meant no harm; i guess i was just put off by your 'who cares' attitude towards to athletes. no hard feelings.. and i know insults are separate from notability, but that doesn't mean i can't address them. as for notability, a tally of medals for each country is clearly a very notable table; and although a tally of these lesser known diplomas is less notable, i still feel it's enough to stay. but i suppose that's what this vote is supposed to decide. <a href="../../../m/l/m/User%7EMlm42_1189.html" title="User:Mlm42">Mlm42</a> 16:40, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No, because those pages are just for information about the specific evnent....at those pages, it is beneficial to have a through 8th place count. but on a main page, it is not necessary to have two or more pages. Can someone give me a valid reason for why 2 or more tables would be productive and benefit the wikipedia viewing community.

The supposed "policy" referred to in the nomination has no force, and the WikiProject discussed above, regardless of consensus it might or might not have reached, is at best a suggestion.

On that count, I'm not sure how notable 4-8th place finishes are, but clearly some people keep track of them.

<dd>Jared, I don't understand what you've got against this table.. is it offensive to you in some way? I personally like it because it gives country comparisons more depth - and in particular, if you count fourth place finishes, Canada beats the USA.. being Canadian, this makes me smile; but i can understand an American possibly wanting to gloss over this fact - which probably shouldn't be done on wikipedia.. and i mean, yes, there are two tables.. in fact, the information in one table is entirely contained within the other (which suggests to get rid of the smaller one! but that would be silly).. so although aesthetically it may be nice to have no duplication, i don't see a problem with sacrificing some aesthetic value for knowledge.. this is an encyclopedia, after all. <a href="../../../m/l/m/User%7EMlm42_1189.html" title="User:Mlm42">Mlm42</a> 21:26, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have just looked at all of the comments and we're just about split between keep and delete. I think that the main reason for the Keep votes is because the table is a nice suppliment to the main one; and I agree that is a tad interesting to look at. But what I'm trying to put across is that one table should be enough. People should come to Wikipedia knowing that they will get one type of medal count for each past, present, and future games; this will lessen their confusion. Further, while it would be possible to put up for this and all future games, the diploma count is blatently shown on all pages like <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speed_skating_at_the_2006_Winter_Olympics_-_Men%27s_500_metres_d581.html" title="Speed skating at the 2006 Winter Olympics - Men's 500 metres">Speed_skating_at_the_2006_Winter_Olympics_-_Men's_500_metres</a>, which <i>should</i> be the place for the more specific counts. I hope you realize that I am not opposed to the counts I proposed for deletion, I just don't think they have a place in Wikipedia. Might I suggest a link to a page that shows one of these counts? <a href="../../../j/p/0/User%7EJP06035_fdfe.html" title="User:JP06035">Jared</a> 13:46, 11 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I feel a little strange arguing about this, because what I disagree with most is your philosophy of wikipedia. I think people should come to wikipedia with some question they want answered, and then become pleasantly surprised when they get more than what they asked for. I certainly hope there aren't too many people out there thinking "i hope this article has only the information i'm looking for, and nothing more".. that wouldn't be in the encyclopedic spirit. I mean, it's nice if articles fit together in a beautiful and consistent way, but our primary goal should be providing relevant, quality information. and since you probably won't find a table like this elsewhere, I think wikipedia is <i>exactly</i> the place for it.. it's verifiable content, and as i mentioned, makes country comparisons a lot easier.. say, for example, you wanted a list of all countries that had fourth place finishers; without this table, how would you do it? you'd either have to go through every single country page, or every single sport page - that's a lot of work! a lot of work that is already done for us with this table.. and if that isn't a reason to keep, then i don't know what is.. <a href="../../../m/l/m/User%7EMlm42_1189.html" title="User:Mlm42">Mlm42</a> 16:41, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep.</b> I've gone back and forth on whether or not to even vote or comment on this issue. I've decided to vote for keep because I feel that if someone is willing to create the page, than it's worthwhile to have. We have country pages that have top 10 lists in addition to their medal counts, it's definitely worthwhile to hear. A fourth place finish is often brought up as it's just outside of the medal count. <a href="../../../s/r/e/User%7ESreed1234_8435.html" title="User:Sreed1234">Sue Anne</a> 06:29, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>A company which is in the same building as monster.com, DEC's former headquarters. And those are the <i>big</i> claims to notability. Of the 500-odd Googles for "Support Fusion" software, the majority are for something else. Private company, no names of major customers, no details of turnover, no evdence presented of significance or innovation.

<p>Support Fusion is in the same facility as Monster and it is DEC's former headquarters, this is not a claim it is a fact. If for some reason this is offensive to someone we can remove it, but it is true. If a more detailed listing of products and customers are required we can do that as well. Please do not down play our company because this article is not completely populated yet. We are a valid entity and while our presence on the web is not dominate as of this time it is growing rapidly. If you search Google for Support Fusion we are the first hit, so I am not sure what the reference above is suggesting. --&#160;<a href="../../../j/c/u/User%7EJcuoco_ba16.html" title="User:Jcuoco">Jcuoco</a>&#160;<small>(<a href="../../../j/c/u/User_talk%7EJcuoco_da8d.html" title="User talk:Jcuoco">Talk</a>)</small></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> What the reference above is suggesting is that your company is not, at this time, notable, and your only current claim to fame is being in the same building as some notable companies. The guideline for Wikipedia (<a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>) is to document companies that <u>are</u> notable, not advertise companies which hope to be. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 16:08, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I understand, but that line was not meant to give our company notability, but to merely give notaility to the location. Since that appears to be a problem, that line has been removed. I find it interesting how you can pass judgement on something when you know so little about it. This article has been out there for a very short period of time and has not even been expanded yet. <a href="../../../j/c/u/User%7EJcuoco_ba16.html" title="User:Jcuoco">Jcuoco</a></li>

<dd>I am sorry you take this personally (I should have predicted that I guess) - the point was that if the article <i>leads</i> with that, it does not bode well for the rest of it.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm sorry, but you are correct, it is taken personally. If you have ever started something from scratch you would as well. When you have been working hard to create a company and a customer base and then have some anonymous person tell you that it is not notable, what do you expect? I think your criteria for putting companies on Wikipedia should be more black and white. Maybe don't allow any Private companies or only allow companies with revenue over a certain dollar amount. I just find it frustrating to have someone on a free site make a subjective opinion on something and virtually eliminate your entry based on that. <a href="../../../j/c/u/User%7EJcuoco_ba16.html" title="User:Jcuoco">Jcuoco</a></li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I am sorry if you feel the label of "not notable" is in some way a disparagement of the quality of your company or the work you have put into it. It is not. It is simply an opinion that your company is not well-known or prominent. I also work for a software development company with many excellent offerings and several very well-known clients. I recognize, however, that we are not prominent, though we hope to be someday. We are not listed in Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>Your reference to Wikipedia as a "free site" might seem to imply that you view it as some sort of bulletin board. It is not, nor is it a directory, or a vehicle for advertising or self-promotion. It is, in fact, intended to be an encyclopedia. I feel that the standards for inclusion are fairly clear. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 04:37, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree that the recipe has no place here. The prevalance of weblogs makes googling for this an impossibility, however, so I find myself unable to vote.

<p>These were tagged with {{importance}} on the 1st and watchlisted. A bot has just visited them, which realerted me to their existence, but otherwise they've not been touched. I nominate these with a heavy heart, as a lot of work has gone into them - although sceptical editors who analyse user contributions and edit histories might not be so generous, especially given that some haven't even aired yet! I have only nominated the episodes and not <a href="../../../d/e/c/Declassified.html" title="Declassified">Declassified</a>.</p>
<p>The nomination: A list of TV show episodes and an article for each episode. <i>Some of these have not even been broadcast yet</i>. Of those which have been broadcast, it's <i>way too early</i> to assess if they are to be considered notable in their genre, and no such assertion has been made. Of the others, they're non verifiable. <b>Strong delete all</b>.</p>

<li>Darren Hayday comments: I am the person (human being) that started this page &amp; I have since read the smaller print to what can &amp; what can't be written. I agree that I shouldn't have written it. I thought that being an elected Councillor, doing voluntary charity work, helping the less fortunate and having the great honour of being my home-town Mayor was an achievement, especially living in days that people are turned off by playing a role in politics and caring about there local community. Also because I am a young guy, I would very much like to encourage other young people to get more involved in politics and to help in their local community.</li>

<dd>I can understand about the business part – I could have been asked to remove it. I am also proud of my ancestors that helped to form my own political ambitions. However, I don’t agree that my whole site is to be removed by a bigot who is against my own sexuality &amp; choice of politics. This was only marked for deletion because I dared to write a stub on Sir Nigel Crisps. Why should my whole site be removed because of that? I enjoy making research and helping to grow Wikipedia – why should you have the right to stop that? I will take out all references to my own business activities and the site will stay, do you agree with that? <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 217.41.241.203 (<a href="../../../2/1/7/User_talk%7E217.41.241.203.html" title="User talk:217.41.241.203">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_217.41.241.203_a897.html" title="Special:Contributions/217.41.241.203">contribs</a>) 03:42, 10 March 2006.</small></dd>
