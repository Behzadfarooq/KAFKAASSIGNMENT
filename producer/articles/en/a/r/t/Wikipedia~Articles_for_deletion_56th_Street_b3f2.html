I mean, there aren't any other 56th Streets, are there? What we have here is a streetcruft article filled with a painful amount of trivia (including notes on where traffic lights are) on a road in a minor suburb. Mention a little of it in the Tsawwassen article, but this is ridiculous. I believe even the most inclusive guidelines for road articles don't include things like this. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 15:01, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

No secondary road is twice to three times as notable as the town it traverses; yet here is a 56th Street article twice to three times as long as the article about the town it runs through.

<p><b>Comment</b>, do you people really think that someone would have the patience and time to write a lengthy and detailed article about just any old street, unless it was an important 'landmark'? I see no reason for people to want this article to be deleted. The author of the article is clearly trying to illustrate the importance of a street which is considered to be of some significance in Tsawwassen, British Columbia. No one should judge this article simply because they have never heard of it nor seen it. I'm sure there are many of you who don't know what the Blarney Stone is, but if I told you it was a mere rock that was of historical and mythical value to the people of Ireland would <b>you</b> all vote for that article to be deleted? <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 03:04, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Counter-Comment</b>, I realize that many people define their sense of space through their local street system. However, this does not make sreets places in themselves. The vast majority are no-man's-land in which no life can exist on them for very long. Yes, some streets have grown culturally important and evolve a life of their own and these deserve <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadway.html" title="Broadway">articles</a>. (But) secondly, streets are not notable because what they are associated with. Would I be notable if I had Bill Gates and Michael Jordan living on either side of me? Are streets notable because of a notable business or landmark that exists on their flanks? Thirdly, nobody goes to a street. Streets are the means to achieve an end, and not an end it itself. If you told me that every sinlge citizen of that town used that street twice a day, I would say "Hey, that street should be mentioned in the <b>town's</b> article." If you can muster enough information on the street (that is relevant, on-topic and not duplicated in the town's article) to make the town's article uncomfortably long, then it would justify its own article. The point I'm making? The contents of this article should be moved to the town's article because it is locally important (in terms of access and infrastructure) but means nothing to the rest of the world. Btw, I thought the Blarney Stone was just a great pub in <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gastown.html" title="Gastown">Gastown</a>. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMaclean25_1193.html" title="User:Maclean25">maclean25</a> 05:36, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

Point Roberts is quite interesting because of it's special status, and 56th street is important to that hamlet. However, it is not that important to the people of Tsawwassen. <b>Rename</b> it also to something less ambiguous. It's a minor road, all the information can be included in the Point Roberts article. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 00:32, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> if references added before end of VfD. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 23:31, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I cannot believe there is any debate on this. A random street in a random town with a few random facts that will not be kept current through the years anyway. One person's obsession that contains information that even a monagraph on the town would probably not mention. This is not encyclopedic. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 06:51, August 27, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Street provides the only land access through Canada, to part of the USA called Point Roberts, unattached to the USA mainland. That lone should prove significance.--<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimon.Pole_8471.html" title="User:Simon.Pole">Simon.Pole</a> 10:51, 27 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Not really. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 03:42, August 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Main road through a large town, but, especially, as per all those who've pointed out about Point Roberts.</li>
