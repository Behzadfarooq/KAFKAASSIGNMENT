<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with deleting non-notable and newfangled cocktails, but this cocktail is fairly old, well-documented and well-known. The article discusses not only the recipe but the history.

<li><b>Strong keep.</b> Notable cocktails usually get kept. I'm rather surprised by the delete votes. Hell, even non-notable cocktails get kept.

Also check out the AfD for <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garlic_chutney.html" title="Garlic chutney">Garlic chutney</a> below. I don't see how garlic chutney is more worthy than the venerable old fashioned. Erik the Rude 17:41, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> That's a terrible reason to keep something. Many times a well-meaning person will undertake a project to write articles about a number of related things, such as cocktails and card games. Then when somebody lists one of them for deletion, somebody inevitably cites "precedent." That's not a precedent on a free encyclopedia. When such articles have undergone review and have been determined keepable, <i>that's</i> a precedent. If there are other articles that are non-notable, they need to be deleted too. <a href="../../../a/p/l/User%7EAplomado_dba5.html" title="User:Aplomado">Aplomado</a>20:58, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Keep</b>. One of the most famous cocktails.

<li>You have a point, sir. So I did as you asked.

<li><b>Comment/Delete</b> I was the one who listed this, though an anon replaced my original rationale with the above. After speedy, prod, and advert tags were added, someone then changed the content to not be copyvio, and removed all three tags. Therefore the copyvio speedy tag no longer belongs (as the anon's statements above state, it never did, hence my non-reversion of it), and when someone else re-added the tags on top of the AfD one (I had already applied the advert tag) I removed the prod because you're not supposed to re-prod, hence this AfD. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorgan_Wick_96a0.html" title="User:Morgan Wick">Morgan Wick</a> 01:26, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> as a neologism. <b>A redirect is inappropriate</b> because no one is going to type or link to "chigger (slang)" when looking for mites. The <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chigger.html" title="Chigger">chigger</a> article already has information about the mites. Also, according to the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chigger.html" title="Chigger">chigger</a> article, it refers to more than one type of arthropod, so a redirect would be inaccurate unless disambiguation was added to the top of the other article - "chigger (slang)" redirects here, for other uses, see <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chigoe_flea.html" title="Chigoe flea">chigoe flea</a>. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 03:10, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> as non-notable unless evidence of importance is provided, like revenue and number of employees. Like porn actors, MLM companies have inflated Google results because of search engine spamming and also because of promotion/complaints/lawsuits by employees. There is some evidence that it is a scam - complaints, lawsuits and the fact that extract from the melaleuca tree has no proven health benefits.

<li>Good question. The people (including you) who have made recommendations so far can alter their recommendation if they think the page is now worth keeping, or can leave their "vote" unchanged. As things stand, the consensus is still to delete. The reversion I did only addresses the immediate copyvio problems, it doesn't do anything to resolve the question about notability.

<li><b>Comment</b>: What is so notable about garlic chutney that it deserves its own article, rather than a subsection in the main chutney article? Does it have particular cultural significance? Does it vary much depending on where it comes from? Is it actually quite different from all the other chutneys? If so, then the article should be expanded to explain this, and if not then I would suggest it should be merged, just like anything that makes a stub on its own but fleshes out another article if used as a subsection. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConMan_d21d.html" title="User:ConMan">Confusing Manifestation</a> 14:40, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is the same argument used in defense of the other <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artcell.html" title="Artcell">Artcell</a> album. The band has established its notability. A separate article for this album is the only logical location for detailed information on the album itself as well ast track listings. Both <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Bowie_5100.html" title="David Bowie">David Bowie</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rod_Stewart_ba9d.html" title="Rod Stewart">Rod Stewart</a> has separate articles for 22 of his albums. Rod also has seperate articles for several of his <i>singles</i>. To use a less-popular example, the band <a href="../../../i/c/e/Iced_Earth_3a79.html" title="Iced Earth">Iced Earth</a> has 7 articles on its albums, many of them stubby tracklistings like this one. So, the precedent has been set that if a band is notable enough for an article, so are its albums. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">Adambiswanger1</a> 04:52, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

If the article had more about the album than just a track listing, then I'd be inclined to keep - on the basis that once the notability of a band has been established, there is no harm in having an article per album, provided the article actually contains useful content. <a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPaddles_deb2.html" title="User:Paddles">Paddles</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../p/a/d/User_talk%7EPaddles_d91c.html" title="User talk:Paddles">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Paddles_cfed.html" title="Special:Contributions/Paddles">C</a></sub> 09:53, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>As the article currently has information on label, where it was recorded, producers, musicians, and other worthwhile information, does this mean that you're more inclined to keep? --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 14:51, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's a fair question. Currently I'd say no, because it's nothing more than the equivalent of a credits roll on a TV program.

<li>Well, given that the additional information is merely credits apparently mostly copied from the liner notes, no, especially if none of the people/places/things mentioned in said credits is notable enough for their own article (if, say, Mick Jagger or George Martin had had a hand in making the album, my vote would shift to Weak Delete or maybe even Weak Keep). <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConMan_d21d.html" title="User:ConMan">Confusing Manifestation</a> 15:11, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The band, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artcell.html" title="Artcell">Artcell</a>, has established its notability.

<li><b>Keep</b>, and the answer is <i>yes</i>; it is pretty standard practice that albums by performers meeting the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criteria are suitable material for standalone articles.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:22, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Notable band, so the album is also notable. Merging album info, even if there is little else beside production notes and track listings, would lead to long, unwieldy band articles.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The first progressive rock band in a country of about 140 million people? That sounds notable to me. Again, I've never heard of them, probably will never get one of their songs BUT BUT BUT to use my own preferences to make AfD decisions would fail to work as part of the WikiProject Countering Systemic Bias: <a href="../../../c/s/b/WP%7ECSB_93c9.html" title="WP:CSB">WP:CSB</a>. I think that a comparable band in the US (or Japan or Germany or Brazil) would not have its albums submitted to an AfD discussion because each of these countries, more so than Bangladesh, has a certain inherent apparent notability among many people in the world....but that's systemic bias. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua"><font color="black"><i><b>Inter</b></i></font><font color="blue"><b>lingua</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../i/n/t/User_talk%7EInterlingua_8ebe.html" title="User talk:Interlingua">talk</a></sup> 02:26, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I've added the track list -- Annabelle Chvostek herself emailed it to me. As it was a cassette release and not CD print, it was fairly limited distribution. She says she's preparing to release these trackes on iTunes (which she's already done with some of her other albums), and is considering a CD re-release of this album. Does the existence of the track list remove the incentive for deletion? (I'm still working on getting album "cover art". If the person who bought this cassette from her years ago in Montreal still has it, could you scan it an upload the file?) --<a href="../../../p/m/c/User%7EPmc_0a22.html" title="User:Pmc">ghoti</a> 01:03, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, after some research, "difficult" is an understatement. The casino opened late 2005, so it's close to impossible at this point. -→<a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuchanan-Hermit_699c.html" title="User:Buchanan-Hermit"><font color="blue">Buchanan-Hermit</font></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="darkgreen">™</font></a>/<a href="../../../b/u/c/User_talk%7EBuchanan-Hermit_6a2c.html" title="User talk:Buchanan-Hermit"><font color="red" size="1">?!</font></a> 07:23, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

I'd suggest adding to this article, but it doesn't seem like it's going to be deleted this time around. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielrocks123_a894.html" title="User:Danielrocks123">Danielrocks123</a> (<a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDanielrocks123_3980.html" title="User talk:Danielrocks123">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Danielrocks123_5c74.html" title="Special:Contributions/Danielrocks123">contribs</a>).</small>

<dd>Daily attendance and what parts are popular have never been included in casino articles that I have seen. What is generally allowed for a new casino is a list of activities that provides ideas on where to expand the article over time. But at some point I stongly beleive that this section needs to be dropped when the rest of the article is in good shape. Given that the current article is almost past a stub, not much needs to be done other then filling in the blanks, like in the infobox. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 22:55, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> and improve - this is actually a notable, though theologically errant, interpretation of scripture. There are a great many cults who claim that their cult is the only True Christian (tm) group. So you take the year your cult was founded, subtract 1260 from it, find some magic event that happened in that year, say that this event started the great tribulation and that your cult is ending it. But at any rate, though this is a poorly written article about the subject, it is notable, it is not date setting, and it is not the product of one person's imagination. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 13:45, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>A deletion of this page was proposed because of only 61 hits on the Google search engine. However, the summer camp now caters to hundreds of campers and merits its own page, explaining to people what the camp is and/or does.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>This page is not an attempt to spam or advertise the camp. I have used Wikipedia for almost as long as it has been around, and I have seen article of far less relevance been allowed to stay.

<dd>Ancient Treasure Hunters is currently in midst of talks with television networks to create a reality series based on the camp. In fact, NBC has created a reality series called 'Treasure Hunters' and this has increased exposure of our camp becuase of people typing in the terms 'treasure hunters' into their various search engines.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>We have received numerous emails requesting a short description or explanation fo the camp, and since I have always turned to Wikipedia as a valuable source of information, I feel that the same ability should be made available, that people can search their encyclopedia which can explain what the camp represents.--<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshua_Weiss_6390.html" title="User:Joshua Weiss">Joshua</a> 07:17, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You posted your reply in less than 8 minutes from the time that I posted my statement claiming that you can find no other sources to back up my claims. What vast sources and resources did you try to use in those 8 minutes? Are you a 12 year veteran of the camping and summer camp industries, and as such have a vast working knowledge of the summer camp industry, including historical literature from conventions and/or industry statistics from trade publications? Because if you are not, then I am not certain what credibility your statement holds, or why exactly you should even think that you have the ability to verify it. And of course, because you are not the above, what right do you have to even make a statement or have an opinion on this article's deletion? (no harshness intended)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Reply to your 1: The relevance is, that because our summer camp program bears such a similar name to the reality series, people are getting confused between the two. We want to make sure that when a person searches an encyclopedic source for the term Ancient Treasure Hunters, that they do not think that we are the NBC specific reality series.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Reply to your 2: I have been involved with the camping and summer camp industries for over a decade. I have attended trade shows, subscribe to industry publications, have close ties with many travel related summer camps and travel agencies all over the planet. I know the attendance histories of over a dozen travel related summer camps, and I also know their average daily inquiries - by date. By comparison to theirs and our own historical statistics, our inquiries have increased by almost 40%. This is a tremendous surge.</dd>

<dd>Reply to your 3: Our website does explain it better, and in much more detail. You can view it yourself to see what depth we go in to.

Your long reply, despite its length, has not addressed this crucial question at all. If the answer to this question is "no", then well, it shows that no one else cares about your summer camp program, even if all the info about it is true. So why should we?

<p>aeropagitica - I will add information about the summer camp program to help show what is notable about the camp. Please understand that the reason it was originally kept brief, was because I did not want anyone to think that this was spam, or some kind of self glorification. But now that I am more familiar with Wikipedia's way, I will add information that shows why the program is unique. --<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshua_Weiss_6390.html" title="User:Joshua Weiss">Joshua</a> 19:26, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Mr Stephen - the camp and summer camping industry is not your typical industry and statistics, articles are not yet as common on the internet. Camps do not get much press, and they don't put out many press releases. Clients are usually obtained by targeted direct mail pieces, and this will explain why you will not see much in the way of 'reviews' of camps. However, you may note that we are a member of the National Camp Association (www.summercamp.org).--<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshua_Weiss_6390.html" title="User:Joshua Weiss">Joshua</a> 19:26, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Kimchi - a. 'ad hominem' - I was not attacking anyone. In fact, I even put in afterwards '(no harshness intended)' to avoid anyone thinking that. I stated the facts, that only someone who is knowledgable in the camping and summer camping industries would have the ability to make the statements he was making. b. I do believe that there are those besides Wikipedia who would think that our camp is worth writing about. In January for instance, Hadley Lewis of the Boston Parents Guide wrote an article about our summer camp program. c. I was not trying to make it as multiple votes. I have never defended an article before, so I did not realize I am not supposed to be doing that - I thought it was more like a paragraph header, sorry. --<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshua_Weiss_6390.html" title="User:Joshua Weiss">Joshua</a> 19:26, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Weregerbil - Google is a search engine. Unless there are public articles such as press releases, etc..., (which is common in different industries) there is not much for Google, Yahoo or any other search engine to link on to besides the website. As I mentioned earlier, the summer camping industry does not attract its clientel that way, and therefore there will not be many articles showing, if any. This is why summer camps will typically pay for advertising click-throughs on search engines. However, because people turn to the internet for definitions and explanations of things, (even summer camps), particularly Wikipedia, we wanted there to be a reliable source to explain what the organization does. --<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshua_Weiss_6390.html" title="User:Joshua Weiss">Joshua</a> 19:26, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Furthermore - I would hope that as admins, there is never any 'funny stuff' going on, such as just simply asking other admins or sysops or whatevers to come in and put in a 'delete' vote as some sort of comrodery between admins. As if to say 'you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours'. Remember that this is not the Gestapo, you are supposed to be at a high standard, and not to take advantage of your positions. For instance - Wickethewok it states on your user page that you contribute mostly to music articles, suggesting that that is where your speciality resides. Why then, are people without the necessary background and information in the summer camp industry voting on a topic that they know nothing about? Without the relevant education in the industry, isn't is much like a medical doctor walking in to a court room to act as a litigator? --<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshua_Weiss_6390.html" title="User:Joshua Weiss">Joshua</a> 19:26, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Starionwolf - This article is not an attempt to do any of what you listed. As stated earlier, we have been inundated with requests recently, and we thought that since people go to Wikipedia anyway for information (parents actually have said on the phone 'yeah, I checked Wikipedia to see what your program is, but I couldn't find anything about it there') we thought that it does merit an article. --<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshua_Weiss_6390.html" title="User:Joshua Weiss">Joshua</a> 19:29, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - no evidence of notability.

<p>BigDT - This was the first season of the camp under the name Ancient Treasure Hunters. Previously, we have been simply called an 'Archaeology Camp'. We chose this 'new face' when the decision was made by the owners of the camp to expand and broaden the reach and goals of the company. (During the year, the company owners go on their own expeditions all over the planet and aid and assist in the recovery of 'buried treasure'. We bring students/campers with us on these expeditions as well. These same students usually end up becoming campers in our archaeology camp. Hence, we have never really needed to go 'big' on the marketing angle. Now, the company's ambitions include getting a reality series for the expedition and camp angles of the business, we are in the midst of publishing a book on the topic titled 'Ancient Treasure Hunters' - or some variation if the editors end up changing it, and more. We conglomerated everything into one name, face, image etc... called Ancient Treasure Hunters. We have also worked hard - the website is the result - on the marketing angle to attract more clientel.--<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshua_Weiss_6390.html" title="User:Joshua Weiss">Joshua</a> 05:29, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

There are no forums, no discussion groups, and internet searching is at a minimum. U can't just keep on arguing the same point over and over again just because its easy to say! And, it's not self promotion just because it was written by an employee! And he gave u the other source secondary verifiable source - the National Camp Association!

<li>KEEP* I am not familiar with the summer camp industry, and I am definitely not well versed in the policies and procedures of Wikipedia. I can say one thing with confidence though: I am rapidly losing respect and interest in Wikipedia. It seems to me that ATH is a revolutionary, refreshing, educational and yes - fun summer camp.

<p>The reason I am adding this page is to jump infront of media bad mouthing&gt; There are at least a couple thousand people who have expressed intrest in this African American figure.</p>

An article is "important" enough to be included in Wikipedia if any one of the following is true:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is evidence that a reasonable number of people are, were or might be concurrently interested in the subject (eg. it is at least well-known in a community).</li>
<li>It is an expansion (longer than a stub) upon an established subject.</li>
<li>Discussion on the article's talk page establishes its importance.</li>
</ol>
<p>If an article is "important" according to the above then there's no reason to delete it on the basis of it being:</p>
<ol>
<li>of insufficient importance, fame or relevance, or</li>
<li>currently small or a stub, or</li>
<li>obscure. (Detailed obscure topics hurt no-one because it's hard to find them by accident, and Wikipedia isn't paper.)</li>

<dd>Quote of WP:VANITY by Akadam: <i>Does lack of fame make a vanity article? An article should not be dismissed as "vanity" simply because the subject is not famous. There is currently no consensus about what degree of recognition is required to justify a unique article being created in Wikipedia (although consensus exists regarding particular kinds of article, for instance see <a href="../../../i/n/c/Template%7EIncGuide_0522.html" title="Template:IncGuide">Template:IncGuide</a>). Borderline cases are frequently nominated for deletion and discussed on <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>. Lack of fame is not the same as vanity.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Furthermore, an article is not "vanity" simply because it was written by its subject; indeed, it can also be vanity if written by a fan, or close relationship. Articles about existing books, movies, games, and businesses can be "vanity" depending on the amount of recognition - e.g. a homemade movie or game, a self-published book, or a fanfic story is not generally considered encyclopedic. In general, the content is kept to salient material and not overtly promotional.'</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The key rule is to not write about yourself, nor about the things you've done or created. If they are encyclopedic, somebody else will notice them and write an article about them.</i></dd>

<li>This is my second post on this page. N Siegel posted on my Talk pages asking me to reconsider my opinion. I've <i>twice</i> re-read the article this morning and my opinion is unchanged. I cannot see why anyone outside of this person's university would have an iota of interest in him. I have a number of questions and comments that I believe are pertinent to the notability question:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li><i>why</i> was he invited to speak at a "Humanitarian of the Year" event. Is he, in fact, a humanitarian? If so, spell it out... prove his notability!</li>
<li>what is so "uncanny" about his sporting achievements? If we listed everyone who broke a couple of school and college sports records, Wikipedia would overwhelmed.</li>
<li>what is so notable about getting involved with local politics? Or even national politics? Do you want an article for every intern, every fundraiser, every camp-follower?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>Before I let this issue go let me address those concerns, (I assure you this is in no way a ploy for sympathy, the sheer fact that I have had this much difficulty confirming this young mans reputation is beyond me. He disserves better then this.)</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Israel is a prolific writer and his written many speeches for some esteemed clinics. He was invited to the event as a speaker because he comes from a broken home, and has a reputation a progressive young black. He’s 20 right now.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2. According to the record he is one of the one of most progressive throwers in his schools years… I don’t know…. Whatever, somebody told me to add it because the kid does this and he does a lot of other activates. Israel is a pretty good guy and I think it deserves mention… whatever..</li>
</ul>

<li>3Israel is not involved in politics he is a very powerful behinds the scene man in Brooklyn… I’ve asked him the specifics and he said he couldn’t tell me, but he’s everywhere and if you ask everyone knows him. They compare him to a young Karl Rove… I have a picture of him with Cindy Sheehan in Texas…if you’d like it let me know…</li>

<p>I suppose your all right the kid is a young progress black and he will pop up in the future, the purpose was to get this out before his next campaign so maybe he might get some of the reputation he disserves… but you guys run Wikipedia and I’m just a web-designer… I guess we’ll just wait tell he’s not young anymore….

<li><b>Comment</b> - age isn't the defining factor. As has been said umpteen times already, it's <i>notability</i> that is the key.

One example is <a href="../../../i/l/o/Ilona_Mitrecey_9d2c.html" title="Ilona Mitrecey">this</a> 13 year old. And if Wikipedia had existed in the 1930s, <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shirley_Temple_f4b9.html" title="Shirley Temple">this</a> kid would have got in at 5.

<li><b>Don't delete</b> Do a Google on Kinga and Chopin or Kinga AND Hitchhiking, and you get 10,100 hits. She was seldomly known by her surname, and the "middle" name is actually a nickname. She hasn't re-invented the world, but her book won a prize and her photos were fabulous. In my opinion, dying while doing what you are passionate about is enough to make one notable.

<li><b>Neutral</b>: There's only a handful of <i>unique</i> English-language Google hits for "Kinga Freespirit". I have a hunch though that there may be more in Polish. Any chance of getting some assistance here from someone who speaks the language? There is also a corresponding article in the polish wikipedia (<a href="http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinga|http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinga" class="external autonumber" title="http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinga|http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinga" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>). Is there anything noteworthy there? How about the prize the article claims she won - the "Kolos", and the claim of her interview in National Geographic -- is there any truth to those, and if so are they notable enough? I do also agree with Williamb's comment above --<a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbsolutDan_8213.html" title="User:AbsolutDan">AbsolutDan</a> <a href="../../../a/b/s/User_talk%7EAbsolutDan_d238.html" title="User talk:AbsolutDan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 19:42, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - After reading the deletion policy, i see that the main issue this entry has is the fact that Ms. Choszcz is dead. I only discovered her work today, but i have been struck by her unquestioning belief that people are intrinsically good. I have also been impressed with her insistence on returning an exploited child to her family in Ghana shortly before she died. Ms. Chozcz was an author, photographer, and humanitarian, who i believe deserves her place in Wikipedia history. --judyb <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.218.42.170 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.218.42.170_0369.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.218.42.170">contribs</a>) 00:15, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<p>The original version of this article was slapped with a speedy tag by me because it was a direct copy from this organization's website (with "All Rights Reserved".) After it was deleted, it was recreated and elevated to the status of... Vanity "advertising". I left the article for a while to see if it could be improved, but after a week, I remain unconcvinced that this emergency contact system has taken hold to the extent the article says it has. (The external links I've looked at don't seem relevant.) Is this notable or not?

<p>I think this deserves at least some discussion, so I'm putting it on AfD rather than proposed deletion. While looking through my old contribs for entries that still had "(top)" on them, I found this one; the article hasn't been touched since June 2005. I think it's vanity and an advertisement, because even though it receives <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=shopperpedia&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=shopperpedia&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">33100 google hits</a>, many of them are wikipedia related, and some of the results are quite strange and look like blatant SEO (like <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=shopperpedia&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=90&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=shopperpedia&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=90&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">this page</a>. The wiki isn't very active, see it's <a href="http://www.shopperpedia.com/Special:Recentchanges?hideminor=0&amp;hideliu=0&amp;hidebots=1&amp;days=30&amp;limit=500" class="external text" title="http://www.shopperpedia.com/Special:Recentchanges?hideminor=0&amp;hideliu=0&amp;hidebots=1&amp;days=30&amp;limit=500" rel="nofollow">recent changes for the last 30 days</a> and its <a href="http://www.shopperpedia.com/Special:Statistics" class="external text" title="http://www.shopperpedia.com/Special:Statistics" rel="nofollow">statistics</a>. I am also unsure of what to do about the <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=shopperpedia+site%3Awikipedia.org&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=shopperpedia+site%3Awikipedia.org&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">many mentions of shopperpedia on other language wikipedias</a>.

<li><b>Please keep it!</b> - The site provides a valuable online graphics editor. If you read through the help pages and try to use it more, you will find out that it does provide valuable features.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> You are aware that google filters out hits for a single domain where there are lots of them? If you do a search on BeatPick and go to the 25th page with hits on them, you'll get a message that only 248 are returned because the others come from similar domains. But, yes okay, the 98% might be a bit overstated.-- <a href="../../../k/o/f/User%7EKoffieyahoo_12ee.html" title="User:Koffieyahoo">Koffieyahoo</a> 02:43, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If you guys would have taken the time to actually READ the description of the cartoon on Newgrounds, you'll clearly see it has a 3rd place award. I'm not exacly sure what that whole "biggest claim" remark is supposed to mean. Whether it's just some feeble scoff to get a quick chuckle, or ignorance induced by not <b>reading details</b>, one thing remains: This article <b>has</b> proper citations. Two of the people lampooned in MODTAS (John Romero and Tom Hall) have spoken to the animators via e-mail, and have mentioned the cartoon on the front pages of their websites.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>There's no need for <b>anyone</b> to claim the content of the article is all bogus material. Nobody in the right mind would actually take the time to create an entire Wikipedia article just to lie about getting respect from some video game creators.</dd>

<p>This article is basically a list of jokes. UNC = "University of Nice Chicks". NFL = "No Fun League". Ha ha. Funny. Then, there's a list of radio callsigns. For example, WWNY = "We're Whining Northern Yokels" and WJAR = "We're Jerks All Right".

If somebody can point me to an equivalent then please do. Unless you have tried to 'do internet/mobile video' yourself you may not fully appreciate how ground breaking this software is. It was recently described as a classic example of a 'disruptive' technology.

But to answer your question, if he is unwilling for them to be speedy deleted, then they all have to come through AFD. They can come through together in a single nomination - just tag each article with {{<a href="../../../a/f/d/Template%7EAfd1_cc96.html" title="Template:Afd1">afd1</a>}} and change the AFD link to be the link to the common nomination. HOWEVER - I would suggest only nominating the ones that are nothing but redlinks together.

<p>This article qualifies as a vanity page. It's a life story that's most likely fictional, culminating in this 'Jan van den Berg' becoming an employee of a company called Firstkontaktdesign. The only link in the article points to an unfinished homepage, and the website of Firstkontaktdesign reveals it as an insignificant (6 employees) graphic design company. Googling "Firstkontaktdesign" AND "Jan van den Berg" yields just 2 hits. I was scanning the list of articles requiring quick translation, but for the lack of importance of this page to anybody besides Jan van den Berg himself, I recommend deletion instead. --<a href="../../../i/v/o/User%7EIvo_van_der_Horst_6ab5.html" title="User:Ivo van der Horst">Ivo van der Horst</a> 12:41, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> In the interest of full disclosure, Thinkin' Lincoln is my comic (though I did not create this article). Nevertheless, it has been linked to by a number of other fairly big web comics, including <i><a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinosaur_Comics_f693.html" title="Dinosaur Comics">Dinosaur Comics</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../w/o/n/Wondermark.html" title="Wondermark">Wondermark</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../w/h/i/Whispered_Apologies_6d59.html" title="Whispered Apologies">Whispered Apologies</a></i>, and <i>Reprographics</i>. It also gets 15 or 16 thousand visits per month, and there are over 230 individual strips. This seems to me to be about as notable as a number of other comics that are allowed to remain on Wikipedia. —<a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerDeathRobot_f4ad.html" title="User:KillerDeathRobot">KillerDeathRobot</a></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I realize that I am biased, as the comic's creator, but I have been looking at other comics that are not slated for deletion, and there are quite a few that I have never heard of.

<li>So I lied, and I'm posting again. I added some more external links to the main entry. Anyway, my previous point was that in the context of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Webcomics_eab2.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Webcomics">Webcomics Wikiproject</a>, which purportedly seeks "to build a comprehensive and detailed guide to webcomics on Wikipedia," a webcomic like mine seems notable enough.

This seems to be a unique product in being a tea-flavored liqueur, and is thus comparable to the Chinese <i>chajiu</i>. It's exactly the kind of thing Wikipedia is useful for documenting, which can be very difficult to find elsewhere. Either we want to document liqueurs in a complete way, or we want to ignore certain flavors of liqueur, only concentrating on the most popular ones such as Kahlua. The latter mode does not makes sense to me. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 07:12, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Does every real product get its own article? Does a guy who made a small Pokemon video game and sells it through his website get its own article? Clearly, that would be a "real product in the real world", yet Wikipedia consesus has found that such products do not necessarily merit encyclopedic articles. Basically, the loose requirements for products seem to be that it either garners press attention/reviews or that it must be an otherwise pervasive item. This product does not seem to meet either requirement. Existance is simply not enough to merit an article. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 16:36, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>strawman, this isn't some guy with a website, this is a commercial product. It is not unusual for hand-crafted artsian products like this to be sold in small batches, it is why certain wines cost so much - there are beers from Germany that are produced locally and by a single producer in relativly low numbers and they may have no audience outside 30-miles from where they are produced but they still notable. I'm not sure the people voting here know a lot about how specialized artisian food products work. As the website says: <i>Qi Tea Liqueur is distributed in Northern California by Artisan Wines &amp; Spirits</i> .. so I guess if it's not mass prodcued by Budweiser or Coors then it's not fit for Wikipedia, because this is a Mega-Corp only encyclopedia. -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 16:53, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>On the contrary. Non-notable products (small-run or otherwise) are not legit on Wikipedia, by policy or consensus.

<dd>Notability includes as one of its criteria being the most notable exponent of a style. This liqueur is the most notable commercially available liqueur with its primary flavor being tea. Following through with your threats to remove all mention of this liqueur from Wikipedia now prevents our readers (including those particularly interested in various types of liqueurs) from knowing about this tea-flavored liqueur. It's as if it didn't exist--and our readers will be led to believe that there is no commercially available liqueur with a tea flavor. Please think twice about this. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 00:42, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So every time someone throws a new ingredient into a bottle, the product becomes notable? And by the way, Wikipedia is not the only source of information.

<li>Here is a proposal. Keep the Qi_(spirit) page, but do not put a link to Qi_(spirit) on the <a href="../../../q/i/_/Qi_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Qi (disambiguation)">Qi_(disambiguation)</a> page (I already removed it). The rationale is that very few people who search on Qi want information about a liqueur. I think one could even argue that Qi-searchers generally tend, by nature, not to find the evidence of notability to be very compelling for liqueurs, and as a result they might reasonably keep nominating Qi_(spirit) as an article for deletion (if a link existed on the <a href="../../../q/i/_/Qi_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Qi (disambiguation)">Qi_(disambiguation)</a> page). However, a different group of Wikipedia users is interested in liqueurs, and for these people, the evidence of notability is much more compelling. To help these users find the page on Qi_(spirit), we would keep a link to it at<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_liqueurs.html" title="List of liqueurs">List_of_liqueurs</a>. Thoughts? Could this be a consensus position? --BTB 02:46, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't agree. If it's notable enough, then it should be linked from the disambiguation page.

If anything about these spoilers can be said, it could be said on the <a href="../../../s/m/a/Smackdown%21.html" title="Smackdown!">Smackdown!</a> article. <a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a> 20:10, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I was picturing wrestlers with <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spoiler_%28automotive%29.html" title="Spoiler (automotive)">aerodynamic wings</a> on their backs. Since that's not the case, I'd suggest a <b>merge</b> and <b>redirect</b> to the main <a href="../../../s/m/a/Smackdown%21.html" title="Smackdown!">Smackdown!</a> article, though I wouldn't be opposed to deleting this outright. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElkman_f6c6.html" title="User:Elkman">Elkman</a> 21:05, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Don't delete this article. It is still a work in progress and the Smackdown spoiler is a major part of WWE Smackdown! for the simple fact that many wrestling fans read the Spoiler before Smackdown! and FYI The Smackdown Spoiler only appears on non WWE websites and nowhere in my article do I imply the Smackdown Spoiler! is syndicated. I know there are various different websites with their on Smackdown Spoilers and I will specify that in the article. All I need is a few days to gather all my information. I even have the years that the Smackdown Spoiler was read on the WWE website by Lucas from 2000-2001. Hey, if you absolutely feel that you have to delete this article then go ahead but I will be putting it right back up with more information.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by EasyAttack (<a href="../../../e/a/s/User_talk%7EEasyAttack_28ae.html" title="User talk:EasyAttack">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_EasyAttack_4663.html" title="Special:Contributions/EasyAttack">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: You can put your data on the main Smackdown! article, there's no need for a separate page.

<li><b>Against Deletion</b>, This person is a Rabbi, Author, Historian, Radio Host, Museum Curator, Scholar. While many outside the Orthodox and even many within the community may not have heard of him or know much about him, this is a very small, but bona fide and notable personage and should definately not be deleted. <a href="../../../j/j/2/User%7EJJ211219_f70f.html" title="User:JJ211219">JJ211219</a> 17:49, 12 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So are members of my immediate family, JJ, (one is a Rabbi, a Doctor, a historian, a scholar, a published author of both books and tape series, and a speaker who has been flown around the US and world at various times to speak and officiate at various religious events), that does not make him notable either. I am most definitely part of the Orthodox community, and I have heard in passing of this Lubavitcher break-off, and among everyone I know, in the grand scheme of Orthodox and Chasidic tradition, it is considered an ephemeral and passing event. The fact that someone is important in their immediate circle does not imply wiki-notability. Please look here <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> and see that even if he has 100 chasidim, that will not make him notable. The average professor has more than 100 students every year, and still fails notability. Even house bands can have 100 groupies and still fail (and be speedied). If this person gains a following of tens of thousands, publishes sichos or sefarim, and begins to get mentioned by the Moetzes or the Agudah or the like, then you may have something. As of now Adin Steinsaltz and Shmuel Butman have more followers, and you see neither of them here. Steinsaltz actually <b>would</b> be notable in my opinion based on the popularity of his <i>Shas</i>. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 18:06, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The song most definitely does have a life of its own. The jazz giant <a href="../../../m/i/l/Miles_Davis_4d69.html" title="Miles Davis">Miles Davis</a> has recorded it on several occasions and it was a staple of his stage show for many years. It has been recorded by others jazz and non-jazz as an instrumental and as a song. The chord structure is appealing to jazzmen as a base for improvisation. Perhaps there is a musicologist out there who can explain why this is so. The lyric too is worthy of study. It is basically monosyllabic, wheras <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Loesser_b447.html" title="Frank Loesser">Frank Loesser</a> is usually polysyllabic. There is a need on Wikipedia for quality articles about quality songs, and this is certainly one. <a href="../../../s/w/e/User%7ESweetalkinguy_4970.html" title="User:Sweetalkinguy">Guy</a> 23:04, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think all of the songs that Fiona Apple has recorded are quality, but I also know that not all of them deserve articles. <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtraordinary_Machine_f897.html" title="User:Extraordinary Machine">Extraordinary Machine</a> 23:56, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But surely the variety of artistes making recordings of particular songs suggests the songs each to be worthy of an article regardless of the quality of the particular song? (Look at all the ghastly versions of <i><a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Way_%28song%29_a4af.html" title="My Way (song)">My Way</a></i> which has an article). An encyclopaedia needs to be all-inclusive, then people will turn to it for reference. If there are gaps then people will not use it as a reliable source of first choice, and that defeats the object of having an encyclopaedia in the first place. In my opinion this is a problem with Wikipedia coverage of popular song and songwriters, particularly those working between 1920 and 1950 and the stuff they wrote. Even those not on the pop music mainstream since then are not uniformly well treated. If the Frank Loesser article was as good as those for <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Collins_af82.html" title="Phil Collins">Phil Collins</a> or <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stevie_Wonder_c1f2.html" title="Stevie Wonder">Stevie Wonder</a> for example, then it would undoubtedly take in this particular song, but I still think the song merits a stand-alone article, as it is a nodal point between jazz and Broadway, Miles Davis and Frank Loesser, Hollywood and various singers. <a href="../../../g/u/y/Guys_and_Dolls_da75.html" title="Guys and Dolls">Guys and Dolls</a> is for many people one of the most important musicals written, ditto Miles Davis (to say nothing of sidekick <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Coltrane_0f9b.html" title="John Coltrane">John Coltrane</a>) in the canon of jazz. <a href="../../../s/w/e/User%7ESweetalkinguy_4970.html" title="User:Sweetalkinguy">Guy</a> 02:42, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I know what you mean and I think you are making some excellent points; I just didn't agree with the statement "There is a need on Wikipedia for quality articles about quality songs". <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtraordinary_Machine_f897.html" title="User:Extraordinary Machine">Extraordinary Machine</a> 11:49, 14 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Point taken, EM, that was me with my politician's hat on. There is a hierarchy here, and there will be many users with their own particular interests focused at different levels. A generalist will look at the Broadway/Hollywood musical and will need a brief resume of the major creators and their shows. This will lead to more detailed discussions of individuals which will include biography and career highlights and discuss the major milestones. Then the topic becomes more specialised, and discussion will highlight individual shows and projects, focusing on the material (songs and book), discussion of the plot, the personalities involved, why it worked/failed and other relevant issues. For many shows, different productions are worth separate articles, <i>Guys and Dolls</i> is certainly one, <i>My Fair Lady</i> is another. My own personal view is that all shows of this magnitude ought to be considered at some depth. The perfect illustration of what I mean is the magisterial book by <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Jay_Lerner_30ba.html" title="Alan Jay Lerner">Alan Jay Lerner</a> entitled <i>The Musical Theatre: A Celebration</i> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0070372322</a>) which is now out of print, but easily available. The question then arises as to who is going to do this, I am capable, but I have to earn a living, which limits my time. And then there are the individual songs. Not all need an article each, but the stand-out ones do, for <i>Guys and Dolls</i>, <i>If I Were A Bell</i> is a prime example, along with <i>Luck Be a Lady</i>, <i>Sit Down, You're Rocking the Boat</i> and possibly the title song. <i>If I Were A Bell</i> is sung in the show by Sister Sarah, the Salvationist. The lyric builds in intensity until the final verse: "Ask me how do I feel, ask me now that we're fondly caressing, Well, if I were a salad I know I'd be splashing my dressing". Is this eroticism, or what? Perhaps I ought to write it up more fully in the article. This show, these songs, this writer are all among my favourites. On a wider point, under the heading of completeness and comprehensiveness which I raised earlier, I think Wikipedia should have an individual article at least for every song which has topped the Billboard charts and the UK equivalent. I agree that some of these articles would be very thin, but doing this would create a resource which would be widely used in the industry and the spin-off from this would be of great benefit to the Wikipedia project as a whole. <a href="../../../s/w/e/User%7ESweetalkinguy_4970.html" title="User:Sweetalkinguy">Guy</a> 01:55, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Page was originally tagged for speedy, but I objected to the tag on the talk page since the article did assert notability. A third person replaced the speedy with prod with the reason that the subject was nn. I don't think prod is appropriate in this case because the creator did object to the speedy on the talk page, so even though he didn't remove the prod it seems there is controversy over the proposal. Thus, I submit the page for AFD for procedural reasons and <b>abstain</b> from comment. <a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a> 17:44, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I speedied this one. IGN is a neato website, but the editor biographies it has spawned in Wikipedia all represent one-hit wonders with no other claim to notability than their work with IGN. In short, these people are not notable in and of themselves (as their bios make clear). I suggest merging their bios into the <a href="../../../i/g/n/IGN_e112.html" title="IGN">IGN</a> article (itself suffering from poor quality) pending developments in their individual careers that rate them worthy of their own biography. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 17:53, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>From my proposed deletion, which was removed: "This was split off from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Prisoner_016e.html" title="The Prisoner">The Prisoner</a> because the trivia was getting longer than the main article.

<li><b>Keep</b>. No merge because there was a reason why it was split off in the first place. It should be shortened. There is amble verifiable evidence of The Prisoner having a wide influence on pop culture, not the least of which is The Matrix. Heck, even the Simpsons has paid tribute to the show.

<li>I think you forgot to mention that the reason it was split off is that this indiscriminate list of information would hurt <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Prisoner_016e.html" title="The Prisoner">The Prisoner</a>'s chances of becoming a featured article. If it doesn't belong in a featured article, I don't see how it belongs in its own stand-alone article. While <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Prisoner_016e.html" title="The Prisoner">The Prisoner</a> is worthy of an article, a list of every time it's been mentioned in a TV show or other media really isn't, in my opinion. I don't think this information merits its own article. It should have been kept in the main article and been trimmed down or simply deleted before the FA review. Dumping the not-so-good portions of an article into the rest of Wikipedia just to make the main article look better is a bad idea. What was wrong with just getting rid of it? Good editing involves erasing and trimming, too. Erik the Rude 18:58, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> There's waaaaaaaaay too much done on "trivial references in popular culture" or "appearances in popular media" sections in Wikipedia. The likes of Simpsons/Family Guy etc etc are the worst offenders (remember these are shows which have one of their main roles is to make references to other media/pop culture). Much or most of such sections/lists are entirely banal fancruft to the point of non-notability (true trivia). Seeing <i>yet another</i> screenshot of a reference made to a person in a Simpsons episode in a Wikipedia article about that person is in my all-time top ten worst Wikipedia experiences <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 23:18, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> the notable references in this so-called article with the main article. While a lot of these references are interesting, most of them are just ridiculous. The Battlestar Galactica entry is not a reference but a mere coincidence, while the Matrix entry is mostly speculation into the common symbology between the two works.

<li>My source was mere cynicism and the fact that the entry was not cited. Actually, by sheer coincidence I was reading that huge 2003 interview with Ron Moore today, and I noticed that he said the following: "She's named Number 6 because at that point I was discovering, for the first time, The Prisoner on DVD – which I had never seen. And I was just in love with The Prisoner, so I decided to name her Number 6." So you're right. But this reveals an even bigger problem with this list: none of the entries on this page are cited, and nothing is immediately verifiable. That's not very encyclopedic. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrash_cdf3.html" title="User:Brash">Brash</a> 04:44, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>I was suggesting merging, not deleting.

<li><b>Delete</b>; if there's anything in the article that's of genuine significance and isn't in the main article, then it can be merged. I agree completely with the nominator, Bwithh, <i>et al.</i> — Wikipedia is submerging under the weight of trivial fancruft. We're surely not trying to include everything that can be said about everything, nor to reproduce every Internet fansite; we're supposed to be writing an encyclopædia. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 10:00, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Could someone please explain to me why we need a large entry in Wikipedia concerning when and how The Prisoner has been mentioned in other television shows and other media? I haven't seen a single reasonable argument to keep this stuff. Is every instance of a Wikipedia-worthy subject being mentioned on TV automatically worth recording for posterity? To me, this level of obsessive interest in trivia is harmful and counterproductive to the Wikipedia project. Erik the Rude 07:42, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Wat do you mean by verifiable sources? Like would my grandma and some old guy at a retirement home be verifable? or do u mean a website and a book? btw i didn't make these articles, my cousin who had my password did, but i know they're somewhat not fake. he definately just stole the book things as sources. If you go to Mubote's contributions or something, you'll see that there are good articles and bad ones. I made the good ones with sources and stuff. so do i just have to find a website and/or book?</p>

<li>Yes, those would help. (The book and/or website, not the other ones.)

<p>I'm not sure that this is an encyclopedic article. Essentially, this article is a listing of one person's opinion of who the top 1000 scientists of all time are. The fact that this person also wrote a book on the subject changes nothing. Wikipedia is not <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">an indiscriminate collection of information</a>. The book itself seems borderline notable ... there are few, if any google hits outside of Wikipedia and book resellers. Even so, if this were an actual article about the book, that would be one thing, but this "article" is just a list of scientists. It would be like changing <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_Eleventh_Edition_8e5e.html" title="Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition">Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition</a> to just be a listing of articles contained in the encyclopedia.

<li><b>Keep</b>Any list like this is bound to evoke some controversy.But all in all I feel this is a worthy effort whereby one can come across names of great scientists.As the talk page indicates even the Nobel list can evoke controversy.And this is not a single person's opinion and appears to have been given a seal of approval by the the President of the British Soceity for History of Science who certainly would be in a position to know the worth.And how on earth can one assess supposed importance?The list essentially is about great scientists who have been granted the seal of approval by their successoors and/or peers(<a href="../../../v/r/_/User%7EVr_7b83.html" title="User:Vr">Vr</a> 06:37, 13 June 2006 (UTC))</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I have gone through the article carefully and consulted several colleagues at the JNU,Delhi where I am a research fellow.I think I shall be prepared to reconsider my vote if I could be convinced that artcle cannot be considered encyclopedic.Surely in a biographical encyclopedia we should expect material of this nature.In the JNU library,there are three books in the reference section on scientists.The first of course is the magnum opus which goes into 8 volumes and contains 8000 names.The second is the biographical encyclopedia produced by Oxford University Press which is updated every year and this book is the most recent addition.It was reviewed in September 2005 by Indian National Science Academy in favourable terms.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this book competes with the Oxford Press book.The difference here is that the latter is compiled by an editorial board of five while this is a result of feedback from 80 universities worldwide.Moreover the Oxford book contains about 3000 names.And the book has been accepted as an encyclopedia in the two reviews I came across.That is what I suspect prompted Gene Nygard to create this article.</p>
<p>As far as it being a closed list goes,I think any list which is the outcome of research is bound to be closed-i.e. membership of the Royal Society of London and National Academy of Sciences.As far as I know,this is the first effort to involve international dimension.And while the omissions are noteworthy,I came across some very interesting names which I have not come across in any other book eg.David Alter who does not find a place in either the 8 volumes or the Oxford book.After getting to know about him,I am convinced that his contribution was in no way less noteworthy than Heisenberg.</p>
<p>And surely a book that finds a place in the JNULibrary,Royal Society and Royal Institution Libraries(as it appears on the talk page)and Stanford Library at least has some merit.(Delhite 06:05, 14 June 2006 (UTC))</p>

<dd>Your argument equally supports rewriting it into an article <i>about</i> the book without the list being included in the article.

<ul>
<li>I would be more than interested to be advised about the norms.I have a feeling that any article which provides menaningful information of sufficient interest to a sizable number should merit inclusion.The criticism that it does not have some familiar names is balanced by the fact that some very notable names have been thrown up which do not strike the air of familiarity eg.David Alter about whom I knew nothing until I perused through the article and made enquiries.And the compairision with the Nobel List I think is not a true comparision.As the talk page would suggest,even the Nobel List omits worthies like Edison and Tesla.</li>
</ul>
<p>The relevant question should be how does a lay person or a student of science get to know which scientist,both past and present,is highly regarded by his peers.Nobel Prizes came into being only in 1901 and one can legitimately raise seroius questions about them being all inclusive(Mathematics has been excluded)and credible when Tesla and Edison have been omitted.Membership of AAAS nad NAS suffer from same disabilities as does the Fellowship of Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and Royal Society of London.One does have to rely on the biographical encyclopedias available-and in my view,this effort is certainly noteworthy.I do not agree with moving the list elsewhere and keep the bit about teh book-people are bound to be curious about the names(Delhite 05:42, 16 June 2006 (UTC))</p>

<p>Perhaps it has been awhile since you were in Scouts! Your decision of "whether we need this" is based on your self admitted and limited exposure to what is going on in Scouting today.</p>
<p>Our boys are in it right now and are the ones who posted this as part of thier communications and Citizenship merit badges. We posted the lyrics to the song ourselves and don't mind at all if folks borrow, edit, or modify thier own versions of it in any way.</p>

<p>The fact that you did find some google hits on this shows at least that it does deserve to exist</p>
<p>Wikipedia is a modern online encyclopedia and therefore by its very nature should live up to its true nature and include these type of pop-culture references, which under the Scouting world this classifies.</p>
<p>Keep an open mind and allow these boys to establish their home on Wikipedia and take part in this online experience. People are shut down far too quickly for creative thought these days and this is one of those times to expand the horizons and embrace the purpose for which this was created.</p>
<p>There is a Wikipedia reference on how to do the "Macarena Dance" and this is no different, it just applies to a Scout culture and not a club culture. Remove this page and then you must remove the Macarena one as well and the hundreds of other just like it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.225.215.5 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.225.215.5_913f.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.225.215.5">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Thinking about it, I might as well put the detailed argument here instead.</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>It's pushing the boundary of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. Specifically: "It introduces an analysis or synthesis of established facts, ideas, opinions, or arguments in a way that builds a particular case favored by the editor." The editor, admittedly, only advances his thesis indirectly, and that thesis might be summarised as "existing metrics of 'computer user satisfaction' are inadequate", but I still feel this is getting closer to the OR line than we should.</li>
<li>As the article stands, it's of very marginal interest - it just discusses various scholarly metrics for 'user satisfaction', without addressing the substance of those metrics.</li>
<li>No other articles link to it, and it's not, at present, categorized.</li>
<li>It needs a great deal of work to bring it in line with <a href="../../../1/s/p/WP%7E1SP_77c6.html" title="WP:1SP">WP:1SP</a>. In particular, it contains large numbers of <a href="../../../a/w/w/WP%7EAWW_3219.html" title="WP:AWW">weasel words</a> - "according to several scholars", "some scholars suggest", etc., and generally has the tone of an essay rather than an encyclopedia article. This, admittedly, is something that could be fixed by radical editing, but I personally do not believe that it's worth it. See 2 above.</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. It's hard to read, sounds like an article that summarizes (so it isn't OR) rather than a good encyclopedia entry.

<li><b>Keep</b> Hello, I'm the original author of the entry. Yes, it is <a href="../../../e/-/w/E-wrestling.html" title="E-wrestling">E-wrestling</a>, but as that article states, most last a few months at best. XHF has lasted five years. We've had over 400 members, and I was doing this article as a surprise to the people who frequent the website as I am one of the runners of it. My comp crashed when I had half the article done and was uninspired to re-write it for awhile afterward and just kept up the skeleton, and for that I'm sorry. But I have let people know it exists so we can get more information on it done quickly. While we may be in the <a href="../../../e/-/w/E-wrestling.html" title="E-wrestling">E-wrestling</a> genre, we are the largest E-fed on the internet, and for us to not be notable in said genre would be like saying that D&amp;D or Warhammer are not notable in the Table Top Roleplaying genre simply because they are a type of outlet for it. Thank you for your time. --hardcore247 09:18, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> In accordance with what the author stated, I would further that the info will very soon be updated. As for it being non notable, I would have to raise the argument in the same manner as the author. It is a significance amongst the E-Wrestling community, and therefore is notable within it own realm of information. If you allow the artical on E-Wrestling themselves, why not have a significant subject/example of one? If it would befit it better, perhaps add the XHF article as a reference of example to the E-Wrestling Atrical itself. I realize that in the end it is far from my decision, but these are my reasons for keeping it, and would like for them to be considered. FrankClassic 16:54, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> In my honest opinion, it actually helps the people that are searching up professional wrestling here because it serves a point that we are a strong community with a bunch of nice and really talented people that know the factor of what pro wrestling really is, that's one of the reasons why this E-wrestling stuff is around. Sure, it needs editing up big time like you said but once it's fully complete, you'll realize the value of it. Good day. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFaded_a3d1.html" title="User:Faded">Faded</a> 13:01 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I concur with the people who say we must keep this entry. It will help people looking for a succesful and fun e-fed. We have articles on cartoons and other fictional things. This is basically a story. Do we delete entrys on The Catcher and The Rye? No. Albeit, the XHF isn't a book. But still, we shouldn't delete it as it would help certain people looking for certain things.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Article is about a non-notable organization, was initially created by someone affiliated with it, and the majority of "Keep" votes here seems to be coming from people with an obvious interest in having the article stay. The article is, in my opinion, a vanity page. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartey_c24f.html" title="User:Martey">Martey</a> 10:53, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I wrote this article some time ago, and it survived an existing call for deletion as the band were deemed to be noteworthy - they have played several national tours and also have a CD which is sold in independent record shops up and down the UK. They are well-known and respected on both the underground rock scene and in their native Newcastle, and have been reviewed in *<a href="http://www.kerrang.com" class="external text" title="http://www.kerrang.com" rel="nofollow">Kerrang!</a> magazine, a rather well-known publication. Google searches bring up much more than MySpace and CD listings if you look around, and they have been reviewed and have fans in countries as far afield as Russia - look *<a href="http://www.http://musicreporters.ru/reviews/1124729205-2.html" class="external text" title="http://www.http://musicreporters.ru/reviews/1124729205-2.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. 09:44, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> Still not convinced of band's notability. If you can present me with verifiable information about their tour or find a copy of an article on kerrang on their website (I did a searcin on kerrang.com and found nothing). If such information is found, I may withdraw my nom, but as it stands I still doubt that this band passes <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. <a href="../../../d/s/p/User%7EDspserpico_ef61.html" title="User:Dspserpico">Dspserpico</a> 17:03, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> Kerrang don't publish their reviews online - search for another more famous band on the site and all you'll find is news on them, no reviews. However, if you want proof that they've been reviewed in Kerrang, look *<a href="http://www.captainsof.com/release_capt025.php" class="external text" title="http://www.captainsof.com/release_capt025.php" rel="nofollow">here</a> (go to the bottom of the page), and *<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/leicester/content/articles/2005/04/06/peace_burial_at_sea_shakespeares_head_feature.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/leicester/content/articles/2005/04/06/peace_burial_at_sea_shakespeares_head_feature.shtml" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and if you go *<a href="http://www.captainsof.com/artist_pbas.php" class="external text" title="http://www.captainsof.com/artist_pbas.php" rel="nofollow">here</a> and go to the bottom of the page, you'll find their press pack for download which has their TWO entire Kerrang reviews in it (one album review, one live review). As for tours, they've been playing up and down the country for years now, and have toured with the very noteworthy 65daysofstatic, as mentioned *<a href="http://www.captainsof.com/release_capt025.php" class="external text" title="http://www.captainsof.com/release_capt025.php" rel="nofollow">here</a>. If you Google "Peace Burial At Sea live" you'll find details of some of the many gigs they've played. I could go on about this and produce further evidence of their "noteworthiness", but it's getting late and I want to go to bed. Basically, if Wikipedia's music pages are here only to document top 40 pop music and extremely well-known artists, then of course PBAS shouldn't be on here (and neither presumably should thousands of others). I personally think this would be a massive shame, because unlike other encyclopedias, Wikipedia has the opportunity to "pick up" things that more prestigious, academically researched tomes are simply unable to, and as such can provide a much better cross-section of popular culture. I'll leave it up to the rest of you to decide the fate of this article. 22:59, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
