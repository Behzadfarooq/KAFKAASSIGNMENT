<p>The article contained this statement:</p>

<dd>Laffer is believed to have derived this mathematical equation on a napkin, now affectionately depicted by economists as the "napkin of eponymity."</dd>
</dl>
<p>I've removed it, as no citation was given (either for the alleged napkin derivation or for the "affectionate" depiction by economists).

<dd><i>Wikipedia</i> needs citations (see <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">Wikipedia:Cite sources</a>) — the criterion for inclusion in Wikipedia is not truth, but verifiability. A reference to one of the interviews with Lawrence Kudlow that you mention would be adequate, although an interview with Laffer himself would be ideal. A typical recounting seems to be:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"Useful economists are rare, so we should be grateful to Art Laffer. In 1974, dining with two ambitious young politicians called Cheney and Rumsfeld, he drew a curve on a napkin to show that since 100pc tax raises no money, there must be an optimum rate to maximise revenue. He guessed it might be quite low, since high rates destroy incentives and encourage evasion." ("The Art of maximising tax revenue - less equals more", <i>Daily Telegraph</i> p. O32, 17 May 2005).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, there seems to be some dispute about whether Rumsfeld was present: <a href="http://www.yorktownpatriot.com/printer_78.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.yorktownpatriot.com/printer_78.shtml" rel="nofollow">Sketching the Laffer Curve</a>. <a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/Taxes/bg1765.cfm#pgfId-1121173" class="external text" title="http://www.heritage.org/Research/Taxes/bg1765.cfm#pgfId-1121173" rel="nofollow">This page</a> by Laffer cites the original story as coming from Jude Wanniski, "Taxes, Revenues, and the `Laffer Curve,'" <i>The Public Interest</i>, Winter 1978 — Laffer attributes the "Laffer Curve" term to Wanninsky. (Interestingly, <i>Laffer</i> claims here that Rumsfeld <i>was</i> present, but he says that he doesn't remember the details of that evening. Laffer also questions the story, saying: "My only question about Wanniski's version of the story is that the restaurant used cloth napkins and my mother had raised me not to desecrate nice things.")</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I haven't been able to find any usages of "the napkin of eponymity" however, so it's not clear to me yet whether this is really a common phrase.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is a good example of why references are useful, by the way — not only did the original Wikipedia sentence leave out interesting details like the presence of Cheney et al., it also seems to have gotten it somewhat wrong: the napkin doesn't seem to be where Laffer came up with the idea (he says in the article above that he used it in classes etc. all the time previously, and he attributes the idea to others in any case), but rather where he first presented it to important policy makers. I'll update the article based on the above references shortly. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevenj_40e5.html" title="User:Stevenj">—Steven G. Johnson</a> 15:55, August 22, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>All right. I've also never heard the term <i>napkin of eponymity</i>. It looks like that part of the sentence was garbage, but maybe the term is known by supply-siders. The story tells about a napkin though. That's for sure. <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawrence_Kudlow_590f.html" title="Lawrence Kudlow">Lawrence Kudlow</a> was interviewed by <i>The American Spectator</i> (whatever that is). Here's part of the March 2001 interview archived on the Web site of Kudlow's company at <a href="http://www.kudlow.com/pdfs/American%20Spectator.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.kudlow.com/pdfs/American%20Spectator.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.kudlow.com/pdfs/American%20Spectator.pdf</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Kudlow: I don't know if it's fair to call O'Neill a Ford guy, but most of them are more free-market oriented today than they were 25 years ago. They've changed because they've seen how it can work. I think it's true for Cheney, true for Rumsfeld, true for O'Neill. They are, pardon the phrase, more conservative now. Although you know the Laffer Curve was launched in the Ford White House.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>TAS: I thought it was launched on a cocktail napkin.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Kudlow: Yeah, but it was a Ford Administration cocktail napkin. Arthur Laffer was in Rumsfeld's office with Cheney in 1975. Laffer was a paid consultant. At cocktails, he drew the curve for them to explain how dropping tax rates from the prohibitive range would expand revenues. They couldn't convince Alan Greenspan, who was chairman of the Council, or Bill Simon, who was treasury secretary. So Ford never went with it. He had a tax rebate instead, an anti-recessionary "stimulus" like Jimmy Carter's. It lasted two quarters, pumped up the economy and evaporated. The economy sagged right down again.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>As you see, Kudlow gives another year (1975 instead of 1974). Kudlow's a Laffer curve enthusiast, so he should know what he's talking about, but maybe the whole thing is just gossip. What I think, nonetheless, is that, no matter how gossipy or untrue the story is, it should be mentioned on the article, at least by warning the reader or by mentioning the different versions of the story. This legend about Laffer's napkin is well-known among supply-siders. That's why it should be mentioned. 2004-12-29T22:45Z 19:24, August 22, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>What I think is the whole story's too fuzzy. I don't know what to believe, but, anyway, it's an entertaining story, and it gives the reader an impression of what supply-siders gossip about. At least it shows they're enthusiasts and they've got enough imagination to make up a whole story about a napkin in a cocktail party or wherever it was. 2004-12-29T22:45Z 19:31, August 22, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Note that Kudlow's account is second-hand. Wanniski's and Laffer's accounts are both first-hand, and they both give 1974 as the date. (Also note that it is easy to mix up a year in a spoken interview, so I would think in any case that a written account would be more accurate.) Anyway, details of this anecdote belong more in <a href="../../../l/a/f/Laffer_curve.html" title="Laffer curve">Laffer curve</a> than here, which is why I put a brief summary here and more details there. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevenj_40e5.html" title="User:Stevenj">—Steven G.

<p>Using Microsoft Word's Word Count feature, I find that this article contains 4991 words (includes mark-ups and formatting, etc), with 4452 words -- about 89% -- taken up by the publication list. This is ludicrous, since this amount of text, what with all the quoting, either should be expunged/ruthlessly pared or moved to Wikiquote. A quick skim shows that little of the extensive quoted material has much information value, either as history, original thought, or illustrations of work/character, so I'm on the side of "ruthless paring".

<dd>Um, there's no space limitation here, and a good source of information about a person is their own words.
