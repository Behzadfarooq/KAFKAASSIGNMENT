<li>Yes indeed you did. That is because you searched without quotes and therefore got hits for every page in which those 4 words appear in any order. Or put another way, I just searched for <i>rock 4 flag umbrella</i> and got over a million results.--<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 03:29, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Not quite. Order is actually part of Google's algorithm for finding and sorting search results --<a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunnerMike89_d5f6.html" title="User:GunnerMike89">GunnerMike89</a> 03:33, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Did I say differently? Your citation of 500,000 results, as if that means something relevant to this subject, was what was referred to and my point stands. The number is irrelevant and a search for those exact words returns no relevant hits. The fact that the ordering algorithm sorts results to the top, and none of the links in the first few pages are to this fictitious thing <i>also proves the point</i>, though there is no reason to search in this untargeted manner unless you wish to cite a large number that doesn't tell you anything about how often the actual thing searched for appears online.--<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 04:03, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, you did say differently. You stated that without quotes you get hits for "every page in which those 4 words appear in any order". This is not true. The order of those words creates different results, not only a different sorting order.<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=4+flag+rock+umbrella&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=4+flag+rock+umbrella&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[4]</a><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=rock+4+flag+umbrella&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=rock+4+flag+umbrella&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> Of course, since no common phrases can be created by rearranging the words <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock.html" title="Rock">rock</a>, <a href="../../../4/_/_/4.html" title="4">4</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag.html" title="Flag">flag</a>, and <a href="../../../u/m/b/Umbrella.html" title="Umbrella">umbrella</a>, there will not be a great difference in search results.

<ul>
<li>I would like to remind you both that we are not here to discuss how to search on Google, nor are we here to discuss the results of different combinations. GunnerMike89, the point that Fuhgettaboutit was making was that searching for the terms sans quotes will indeed look for pages with any or all of the search terms in it, ergo your massive result. Search for the term "Top gun mach 2" without quotes results in thousands of results; putting it in quotes results in precisely four, and putting a more refined search (+"Top gun mach 2" +Ontario +band) results in precisely zero. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 17:58, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your "refined" search method is fatally flawed, and negates your argument. For example, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Holocaust+of+Nazi+Germany%22+%2B%22World+War+Two%22+%2B%22extermination+camps%22+%2BRacism&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Holocaust+of+Nazi+Germany%22+%2B%22World+War+Two%22+%2B%22extermination+camps%22+%2BRacism&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">this reasonable search</a> would "prove" that the Holocaust did not occur. I'm sure you <s>were</s> weren't implying that the atrocities of the Holocaust did not happen, but I think Google, while an excellent search tool, should not be used to prove or disprove the accuracy of an article. --<a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunnerMike89_d5f6.html" title="User:GunnerMike89">GunnerMike89</a> 18:41, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You know, it figures that sooner or later, <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godwin%27s_Law_5a9a.html" title="Godwin's Law">Godwin's Law</a> would rear its head here. Put a fork in it, the argument is done. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 19:59, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I would like to point out that the band's name, according to the article itself, is actually "TopGun: Mach 2" and searching Google for this results in a blocked user's page, and the administrator's noticeboard. Bwahaha! <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalad_Days_cbd9.html" title="User:Salad Days">Salad Days</a> 22:31, 30 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Another failed argument attempt. The <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi.html" title="Nazi">Nazis</a> were not mentioned, nor was an attempt at comparison made. Remember how Iran made news recently when it held that Holocaust convention, where they <i>evaluated</i> the likeliness of the Holocaust occurring? The organizers were largely Islamic fundamentalists, right wing maybe but certainly not Nazis. Therefore I reject your attempted use of Godwin's Law, please come up with a valid response. -- <a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunnerMike89_d5f6.html" title="User:GunnerMike89">GunnerMike89</a> 21:27, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - the only two proponents of this article thus far consist of two people - one of whom is attempting to distort what he pulls up as evidence to the point of being untruthful (case in point, stating that he didn't say anything about Nazis in response to my citing of Godwin, which was in response to his...well, mentioning nazis by way of a bogotified google search), the other who was blatantly vandalizing the AfD.

<li>I think that my analysis of the "evidence" that the Delete proponents present has distinctly proven the inaccuracy of their arguments. For example, their twisting of the Google search engine, etc. Let's get some input from Canadian members. They'll inform you of the significance and notability of TopGun: Mach 2. --<a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunnerMike89_d5f6.html" title="User:GunnerMike89">GunnerMike89</a> 01:37, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would recommend against closing this after only two days; finding <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> third-party coverage can sometimes take a couple days. Plus, keeping this for a few more days should prevent any reason to recreate the article on the grounds that there wasn't enough discussion, etc. (and then the page can be speedied without any worries, assuming the page is deleted).
