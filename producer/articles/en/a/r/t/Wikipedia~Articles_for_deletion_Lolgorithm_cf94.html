<li>The word is now commonly used in code written by Teesside students, which is not publishable because of licensing issues. However, the term has also been used verbally (and possibly within source code) by certain games company employees, generally those employed by companies with strong University of Teesside connections. (Blitz Games, Fusion Digital, Halch, and Mere Mortals are a few examples.) The article would benefit from an explanation of its current (and previous) usage, rather than a description of how it was coined. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 80.5.70.231 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_80.5.70.231_d524.html" title="Special:Contributions/80.5.70.231">contribs</a>) 2006-01-17 23:51:29 UTC.</small>

<li>I would not be at all surprised if the word was to be found in various open source projects. Lord knows I've seen evidence of Lolgorithms in action judging by the way some of them run.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I work for a respected mobile-phone games company in London, having left Teesside two years ago and obviously I have many contacts from my time there, namely one of the 'creators' of the Lolgorithm. The term is now used in many of the programming circles i frequent both verbally and in code ( namely comments) and I fail to see how anyone can conceivably 'prove' its existance when it is used in copyrighted code. This doesn't alter the fact that it exists in (albeit) small programming circles and it demonstratably will become increasingly more widespread. I feel that many of the negative comments displayed here are from people that have no link to the industry that has coined the phrase and therefore will never use it. I feel that these aforementioned views carry no more weight than unsubstaniated claims either. I suspect that I will come under scrutiny as I cannot explititly use the company name without prior permission I would quite happily give details to contact myself, so as to supply 'evidence' of this phrases extended use.<small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 80.229.49.63 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_80.229.49.63_9a35.html" title="Special:Contributions/80.229.49.63">contribs</a>) , and is the user's only edit.</small>

<li><b>Keep</b> This word is gaining a rapid expansion in the field of Computer Graphics and Games programming, it is an underground word that is gaining an increasingly popular status by software companies around the world. While tangable evidence of this word is difficult to provide, for the aforementioned reasons, a simple survey of use of the word found several members of the United Kingdom games industry are aware of the word's existance, and use it in verbal discourse and written source code on a daily basis. While legal licencing issues make verfiying this word difficult, as it has such a wide scope across all aspects of Software Development, there is an absolute guarantee that the use of this word will become exponentially more prevalent in the future. Keep this word! It has received a warm welcome from the software and graphics industries, and deserves the same treatment here!<small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> AlistairParr (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AlistairParr_2bc7.html" title="Special:Contributions/AlistairParr">contribs</a>) , who is the author of the article.</small>

<li><b>Keep</b> I have come across this word numerous times while working in the games industry. I've noticed the word has become very much common place and has spread mainly via word of mouth and through working code. I would personally like this word to stick, although not known globably, it has become a valuable means of describing ones code which is notably messy and funny while producing unexpected, yet pleasing results. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 81.104.80.71 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.104.80.71_183d.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.104.80.71">contribs</a>) 16:34, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</small>

<li>Keep - For an encyclopedia that freely includes nonsense, fictional articles concerning such topics as Gundam and Zoids this article seems by comparison to be a far more worthy contribution. Deleting articles and then inviting users to write them again due to their own good will is a disgraceful manner in which to act. This article should be kept and all discussion pertaining to its removal ceased or expunged.

<li><b>Keep</b> This word is used widely by tutors and supervisors all over the United Kingdom when they refer to the work of their underlings. It's a slang term, and not easily verified, as it will not be written in formal reports, papers, or other. The only type of paper that would have this published would be a general socialogical paper discussing how supervisors and leaders discard their work as not "industry standard".

</li>
<li>Keep* Many of my friends at University use this word frequently to describe comical outcomes from programming errors. This may not be a word in the dictionary but it is still used by many people. The word bug for instance, to describe odd errors, is not a proper word, as it describes a small insect like creature, but was coined when a moth caused a computer problem back in the days of the beginning of computing, but now it is as commonplace a word as any. Maybe someday this word will too acheive this status.

<li><b>Keep</b> I've recently find out about the existance of this term and the great programming practice about it - to give the source code a new, better, funny look. Since that day I intend to use this practice resp. the lolgorithms intensively in all my source code with the hope that others will do it as well! Thank you for developing one of the most interesting programming instruments I've ever saw!
