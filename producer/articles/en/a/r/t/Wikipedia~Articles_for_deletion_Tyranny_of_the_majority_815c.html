<li><b>Delete</b>, agreed there is no policy on it. Perhaps a non-policy page about the phrase might be appropriate (the search kept sending me to <a href="../../../o/n/_/On_Liberty_7773.html" title="On Liberty">On Liberty</a> by JS Mill), but as a policy page this definitely is not appropriate. Dot six has had plenty of opportunities to make his minority views known, and to write them as parts of existing articles reflecting alternative viewpoints to the mainstream in those articles. Instead he/she has generally attempted to REMOVE viewpoints other than his own, leaving no discussion. In my opinion, that is just a different kind of tyranny--of the minority. <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhiteC_f18a.html" title="User:WhiteC">WhiteC</a> 20:21, 29 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Must <b>keep,</b> there is no alternative, if Wikipedia is to be true to it's basic principles consistently throughout. As I understand it, a basic Wikipedia principle is that dispute resolution concerning content is not telling the other side anything like, "You are outnumbered here, and the majority rules, so get lost" it is principled <a href="../../../n/e/g/Wikipedia%7ENegotiation_07d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Negotiation">negotiation</a>, aka consensus decision making (find a solution which meets the legitimate interests of <b>both</b> sides). As this principle is explained by <a href="../../../n/e/g/Wikipedia%7ENegotiation_07d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Negotiation">Wikipedia</a>, quote, "Principled Negotiation is a cooperative process whereby participants try to find a solution which meets the legitimate interests of both parties, which in the context of Wikipedia usually involves appropriate mention of all points of view in an article thus improving the quality of the article. Compromising or 'splitting the difference' is generally inappropriate if it means departure from generally recognized points of view, both of which need to be included to achieve <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>. --<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.182.157.6.html" title="User:67.182.157.6">67.182.157.6</a> 02:42, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Please be familiar with the policies of <a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">not biting the newcomers</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiquette_3717.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiquette">Wikiquette</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">no personal attacks</a>, and <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivility_f107.html" title="Wikipedia:Civility">civility</a> before adding a comment.</li>
</ul>
<p>That makes the ad hominem personal attack comments of Rhobite, Asbestos, WhiteC, et al above totally inappropriate here, and each of those writers should take it upon himself to edit them out, if they are principled individuals interested in honoring Wikipedia policy. The policy is <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">comment on CONTENT, not on the contributor</a>.</p>
<p>Such comments about the contributor are in the nature of poisoning the well.</p>
<p>This sort of "reasoning" involves trying to discredit what a person writes by presenting unfavorable information (be it true or false) about the person. This "argument" has the following form:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unfavorable information (be it true or false) about person A is presented.</li>
<li>Therefore ANYTHING person A writes or has written is suspect, and should be deleted, even if the thing written quotes Wikipedia policy, and serves as a reasonable <a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpansion_fc03.html" title="Template:Expansion">expansion</a> of that policy.</li>
</ol>
<p>This sort of "reasoning" is obviously fallacious. The person making such an attack is hoping that the unfavorable information will bias listeners against the person in question and hence that they will reject anything he or she writes or has written. However, merely presenting unfavorable information about a person (even if it is true) hardly counts as valid argument against any statements he or she might make. So, Poisoning the Well, a form of argument ad Homimem, is reasonably summarily dismissed as <a href="../../../i/n/f/Informal_logic.html" title="Informal logic">logical fallacy</a>. --172.192.207.229 20:01, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>DotSix, I purposely did not mention that you were involved in an RfC. That said, I did think it necessary to mention your exploits at <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, as it provides background for the reasoning behind this page you created. Although we have an important principle on Wikipedia to assume good faith, a user's intentions cannot be ignored. If this were created by someone who had already made many good contributions to the encyclopedia, I'd give them the benefit of the doubt for a while and see what they were going to do with the page (though, if they left it in the state this one is in, I'd either recommend they did something positive with it or I'd propose it for VfD anyway — I don't have double-standards). In this case, however, it is clear, from my point of view, that this page was not created in good faith but rather was created as a rhetorical device for your arguments on Truth-related pages and the RfC. Also, as an aside, you keep quoting <a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers</a> as a shield behind which you can protect yourself from criticism. You have been around here since April, so you would need a fairly long-view of time to consider to still consider you a newcommer. Not bothering to make a user account isn't the same thing as being new. — <a href="../../../a/s/b/User%7EAsbestos_b405.html" title="User:Asbestos">Asbestos</a> | <a href="../../../a/s/b/User_talk%7EAsbestos_af4a.html" title="User talk:Asbestos"><font color="#808080">Talk</font></a> 09:53, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I like to think of wikipedia as a community of fellow inquirers always seeking to resolve disputes by seeing the other disputant's point of view ... and the refusal to do that, the reliance upon numbers as a substitute, deserves some sort of derogatory label, surely! Since we're not an advanced enough species to have invented that gun yet. Also, please note that I've been around since March 2004, made thousands of contributions, and accordingly this vote can't be written off as that of anyone's sock puppet. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristofurio_ba82.html" title="User:Christofurio">Christofurio</a> 23:29, August 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Okay, fine. Though I disagree that the arguments here are ad hominem, here is a further justification of my delete vote. This article has two parts:
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>A description of Tyranny of the Majority and its relation to Wikipedia policies</li>
<li>A commentary on another Wikipedia policy (here the NPOV rule)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The first is invalid here because any information on applying Tyranny of the Majority ideas should be in the policy section that it covers (for example, don't talk about the VfD policy, rather, add this to it). However, you are unable to do so because others do not agree with your assessment. Also, because "Tyranny of the Majority" is not a Wikipedia policy, is not meant to be a policy, and is in fact intended as a contrast to an existing policy, it does not deserve its own page, especially not in the Wikipedia namespace.</li>
<li>The second is invalid here because it is a POV commentary, and therefore belongs on the Talk page of the relevant policy, in this case the NPOV, in an attempt to change such a policy. However, you are again unable to do this, because the people on said page are unwilling to agree with you for one reason or another.</li>
<li>If you wish to have an article discussing your interpretation, you are welcome to put it in your user space. you can direct people there as an explanation of your beliefs. But it is undeserving of its own article. There you go. Not at all ad hominem.
