<p>This is the second nomination; the first, 2 months ago, was for homophobia etc. This page has none of that content; rather, it is not noteable per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> as the band has not yet released an album, etc. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_e06e.html" title="User:Col tom">Colonel Tom</a> 02:58, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>It's being considered for deletion because your band is not yet well-known enough to get an encyclopedia article. Please read <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> which explains which bands get an article. When you have two albums released by a major label or very well-known independent label, you get an article, for instance. Even then it's considered better to wait for other people to make the article about you, then fix any inaccuracies.

<li>The band has not released any albums or singles, been signed by anyone, or even had any gigs apart from performing in school. Furthermore, not only does the article explicitly state that they play in the garage of one of the member's parents, the article even has photographs of all of the band members in said garage. This article therefore fails to satisfy any of the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criteria. However, failing to satisfy the notability criteria isn't the only problem. The article is <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>, comprising an obviously firsthand account of the band's history. The place for this is the band's own web site, not Wikipedia. (Ironically, the band has its own web site, but the images are broken and the text is in white on a white background.) <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 04:25, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Who's the one saying we haven't played anywhere except school? That's all it says in the history thing. But we have played at many gigs. 3 battle of the bands in 2004, 4 in 2005. We played at push up in the western suburbs. also that image is not in a garage. the ones of us playing are in a garage, but the image of all of us is in an abanodened place where we thought it would be cool to take photos in, and make them look official possibly giving us some credibility. the problem with our site is that all the links are linked to live.com.au but the host moved to music.net.au, they have reset all passwords and thus anyone owning a site with them is unable to access. thus i cannot fix the links until the host resets everyones pw back to normal. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThoughtless_Band_8349.html" title="User:Thoughtless Band">Thoughtless Band</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/o/User_talk%7EThoughtless_Band_f9ca.html" title="User talk:Thoughtless Band">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Thoughtless_Band_2ae8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Thoughtless Band">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>Well I spent a lot of effort on this page, and now all of a sudden its going to be scrapped.

It's an <i>encyclopaedia</i>. Everything here must have been <i>published somewhere else first</i> and have been <i>already acknowledged by people and accepted into the corpus of human knowledge</i>. If you want to publish a firsthand, previously unpublished, account of your band that incorporates stuff that nobody else knew before, your <i>own</i> web site is the place to do it. You <a href="../../../n/e/w/MediaWiki%7ENewarticletext_2d8e.html" title="MediaWiki:Newarticletext">were warned</a> about this <i>before</i> you started the work that you did.
