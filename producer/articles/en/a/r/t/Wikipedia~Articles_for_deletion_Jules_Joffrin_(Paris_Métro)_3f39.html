<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> into an article on the Paris Metro. I don't have a problem with this having an article on its own, Paris is notable as a city, thus many things in the city will be notable, including its metro system. Any article on its metro system should describe the stations, so the only question is, is it better to have that in one page, or several? I sort of prefer the latter, but I can live with either. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 02:36, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That's a good suggestion MM, I concur, merging the page into the subway system article would work well.

<dd>This article is a stub, but a discussion of the engineering, architecture and history of this station, particularly if someone can provide one or more photographs, could get fairly large. The advantage of having articles on each station is to allow better indexing and categorization, so that a link from another article would point directly to the station's article, not to a lengthy combined article on the entire subway line (this one is on Line 12) which many used would find difficult to navigate. This is why when an article gets longer than about 30 k, editors should try to split it up into several useful sub-articles. Given the precedent that exists for other subway stations, in Paris and elsewhere, I would invite the nominator to withdraw his nomination. --<a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEastmain_2651.html" title="User:Eastmain">Eastmain</a> 04:13, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> While it may be true that subway stations can, generally speaking, be considered notable, this article contains, in addition to no sources or references other than a map which does not contain the facts cited in the article, no assertion whatsoever of this <i>particular</i> subway station's notability. Being named after a notable person is NOT enough to assert notability. Somewhat trivially, but relevantly, I could name my house after Martin Luther King. Houses, especially historical ones, can be notable, as can places named after notable people, but my house, even if it was so named, would nonetheless fail to be notable in any way. Even if my house was in New York City, for example, or another notable city, even that additional fact would fail to make the house itself notable. So it is, I think, with subway stations. If the information in this article is to be merged with an article about the various stations in the Paris subway system, I would have no problem with its inclusion in WP. However, no sourced statements have shown any assertion of enough notability to stand as an article alone, and I continue to argue for <b>Deletion</b>. <a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEchuck215_5075.html" title="User:Echuck215">Charlie</a> 06:56, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

However, and perhaps more significantly, the article cites no sources whatsoever to assert its notability. Note that this also means that the article, as it stands, fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, because it should, under the policy, "contain only material that has been published by reliable sources."

<dd>Unfortunately, I think part of the problem is that most of the information on this subway station is likely to be in French, not that there are no sources whatsoever.

<dd>Excuse me, but I did not say that there were no problems getting sources, since I did clearly say that the problem would be that those sources are French, but I believe it's obviously not an unsurmountable problem. All it will take is finding someone who reads both French and English. Since I'm not one of them, I don't feel I'll try to do it myself. But that doesn't change the fact that there are likely to be sources. It is a subway station, they are hardly undocumented. I don't know why that's so hard to realize, and that instead of calling for deletion, you would be better off calling for sourcing. Then, for example, someone who owns <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0738852481" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0738852481" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> might be inclined to look it up, and report its contents for us. Since I don't own the book though, and the relevant section is protected, I can't cite it myself. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 01:46, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> We can argue about notability until we are blue in the face, and probably get nowhere. However, none of those above arguing for "keep" seem to take seriously the first, and probably stronger, claim of the nominator: that the article is <i>completely</i> unsourced, and so fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>! Take, for example, this, from the article: "The station opened in 1912." Suppose someone came along, and edited this to read "The station opened in 1913." Not being knowlegable about the topic myself, I cannot honestly decide which is correct. And without any sources cited, on what grounds could one argue that it must be changed back to 1912? Additionally, it has been suggested that the problem is that the sources are in french, not that they do not exist. This is a fine point: but the article still needs to cite existant sources, and no one has provided <i>any,</i> in french or otherwise. I do not claim that it is impossible to find sources for the article, and so it must be deleted. I claim that it is against policy that the article remain on WP without sources, and <i>so far,</i> none are forthcoming. If this changes, so will my <b>delete</b> opinion. <a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEchuck215_5075.html" title="User:Echuck215">Charlie</a> 00:22, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Actually, it easily passes <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>. (I was puzzled that the nominator chose that is the crux of their argument to delete). The first sentence of WP:V states "Verifiable" in this context means that any reader should be able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source." The source currently cited is a map provided by the actual Chemin de Fer Métropolitain de Paris <a href="http://www.ratp.info/Proxi/proxi.php?lang=FRA&amp;Profil=RATP&amp;xCenter=600574&amp;yCenter=2432690&amp;nom_station=Jules%20Joffrin" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ratp.info/Proxi/proxi.php?lang=FRA&amp;Profil=RATP&amp;xCenter=600574&amp;yCenter=2432690&amp;nom_station=Jules%20Joffrin" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> (for the Paris Metro challenged, that's the government body that operates the Metro - I consider that a very reliable source on their own stations).

<li>You misundestand me. I do not argue that it is not verifiable that the station <i>exists,</i> but merely that the information in the article (such as that it opened in 1912) is not verified in the article. <a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEchuck215_5075.html" title="User:Echuck215">Charlie</a> 00:48, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's not really a reason to delete the article, but rather should spur an attempt to find sources with the caveat that unsourced material may be deleted from the text. Oakshade's argument on the relevance of verifiability is spot on.

<li>Ugh? You're muddling the concepts of deletion here. The station is inherently verifiable from the fact that it is on the RATP map. Sure, delete any unsourced material from the article you want, but the bottom line is that the station is verifiable. This is essentially a notability discussion -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_202a.html" title="User:Samir (The Scope)"><b>Samir</b> <small>धर्म</small></a> 08:19, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you are determined to have this discussion center around the notability of the station, then so be it. The only arguments that have been presented for this stations notability are: 1) it is named after a notable person, 2) other subway stations have been determined notable, and 3) It is in a notable city. As I have argued above, none of these arguments successfully establishes the notability of the subject, and WP guidelines call for independent sources to verify notability. <a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEchuck215_5075.html" title="User:Echuck215">Charlie</a> 01:01, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Actually, I think you misunderstood me. While a given station may not be much, I do think that Wikipedia, in order to be complete, should have information on them, since we are clearly going to have information on the New York City subway system. While I might have chosen to present the information in a list for each subway line, it seems that some people have already done a fairly extensive job of presenting them with their own individual articles. Since I don't think these articles shouldn't have their own article, I do not disagree with this choice. It seems well-done and informative, and you'd actually have to work to convince me otherwise, not just assert it. If anything, I'd like these articles expanded, including things like VR pictures of each station. That would be very interesting. So really, I don't think you agree with me at all. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 15:10, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's sourced, the article seems as notable as an article on a musical album, and deleting it would ruin the completion in that section. Using the succession box, I just "rode" from terminus to terminus on Line 12 (more enjoyable than you'd think, but perhaps I'm terribly bored). Messing up that completion, especially considering that this is a good article in the hierarchy of the Paris Metro articles, is just silly. <a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamionOWA_5283.html" title="User:DamionOWA">DamionOWA</a> 08:11, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
