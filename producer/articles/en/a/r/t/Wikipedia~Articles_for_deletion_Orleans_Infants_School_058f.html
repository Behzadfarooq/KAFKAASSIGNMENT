<p>There seems to be no hint of notability attached to this preschool, other than the fact that <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeilRickards_ebdc.html" title="User:NeilRickards">User:NeilRickards</a> attended it. He created the stub, and it hasn't been edited for over a month - so it's had plenty of time to grow - and, if every user creates a stub for their preschool, this is just going to spiral out of hand. <s>Non-encyclopaedic, so it should be <b>deleted</b></s> (see below for the reasons I altered my vote). <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">Jasonglchu</a> 13:34, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. For people not acquainted with the UK education system, please take note that this is not a preschool. It is subject to inspections by the same agency that inspects all schools and it teaches the national curriculum. The last OFSTED inspection examined and praised teaching quality with respect to "mathematics and the reading, speaking and listening aspects of English." This particular school didn't do so well, apparently, teaching kids to write--this was based on the national SAT tests at age 7. It may teach children aged 4-7, but that is the age at which British children start attending school and learning to read, write and do mathematics. It's a serious teaching institution, not a nursery school. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 22:59, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>I agree; further readers please note that I have withdrawn my assertion for deletion, and changed to a <b>weak keep</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Reasonable stub. One month really isn't enough for organic growth, you need six months to a year. I don't see the problem with people recording infant's schools, or why things should "spiral out of control" if people made articles about them. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 14:48, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Tony, on this VfD entry (and several others), you have voted to keep. Might I ask why? I understand one of your reasons is that you feel as though it is acceptable to include minor entries because <i>Wikipedia is not paper</i>. I'm claiming that, even though Wikipedia does have virtually unlimited room to grow, its goal is still to be an encyclopaedic reference work. As such, non-notable entries, such as this one, must not be allowed to flourish. This school (and the other that you and I have voted on) is non-notable, has no listed well-known alumni, and seems to be just another minor educational facility. This is one step away from allowing every principal, teacher, or tutor to have their own wikipedia entry, which, I gather, is generally frowned upon. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">Jasonglchu</a> 15:13, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Okay. I see somewhat where you're coming from, after reading <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a>. I still feel as though this article (and the others currently up for deletion) fails to meet the established criteria in that article, specifically that further NPOV information cannot be gathered. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">Jasonglchu</a> 15:26, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a> in general recommends merging because these schools rarely seem to get deleted. Schools are public entities so it's very, very easy to acquire public neutral about them and present it in a neutral manner. For instance I added a link to the OFSTED report for one school and may do the same for this one. Schools appear in the local press, in political campaigns, and as premises for polling stations and the like.</li>
<li>And if this were to be merged,it should probably be merged to <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richmond_on_Thames_29ba.html" title="Richmond on Thames">Richmond on Thames</a>, which is the Local Education Authority. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 16:17, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>In the United States (and presumably some other countries) children are often sent to a <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preschool.html" title="Preschool">preschool</a> the year before public school begins.

<li>Then this isn't a preschool. It's an infant school teaching the national syllabus, monitored by OFSTED and subject to quality control. We have nursery schools for children younger than four but mostly they're glorified childcare facilities. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 22:59, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Searching the deletion archives for 2003, I find no records of any deletion discussions relating to elementary schools. None. The earliest elementary/junior school deletion debate I can find is in May, 2004, barely a year ago. The result was deletion, A grand total of eight editors, including the nominator, were involved in the discussion.</li>
<li>The next elementary up for deletion was Meriwether Lewis Elementary School in July last year, just eleven months ago. A grand total of twelve editors were involved in that discussion and the result was delete but this was complicated by a copyright issue.</li>
<li>Dodd middle school, listed the very next day, barely scraped a result that the closer interpreted as "rough consensus [to delete] (10 delete, 5 keep, 2 anon votes)". Clearly there is no truth to any claim that there has been near unanimity on the question of elementary schools for years. Wikipedia simply hasn't been considering the issue for long enough for that to be true, and the figures, such as they exist, are far from suggestive of unanimity. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 22:53, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>What does "fourteen displayed hits" mean? Surely you're not relying on google to tell you all there is to know about a school! If an article contains unverifiable information, the solution to this problem is to remove the information. Deleting the article is not necessary in such cases. Could you explain why you think infant schools (this is not a preschool) are not encyclopedic? In what significant operational way do they differ from high schools, which also have teachers, pupils, sports teams, premises, curricula and community links? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 22:53, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don;t think high schools are encyclopedic, either, but at least most of those years are remembered by students--for most people earlier grades are mostly a blur.

<dd>Also, for the record, it may be apples and oranges, but I am bothered more by excessive microscopic fictional bits than schools, and even more by inclusion of 'current events'[Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28policy%29#Unusual_transclusion_issue_not_covered_by_policy] than either schools or fictional bits. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 07:11, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That page says "<b>If</b> {emphasis added} St. Stephenâ€™s School is over-subscribed, priority will be given as follows:", then criteria number <b>six</b> is "Children at Orleans Infants School, with priority given first to those in public care, then on the grounds of proximity."

<li><b>Comment</b>. That's an interesting argument (though I question whether a random page function is more important than content). As a test, I hit random page fifty times. I got one school article. Clearly schools are not a problem for Wikipedia's random page function, even if one were to agree with the proposition that all school articles are "fluff". --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 16:12, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I used to use it to find cleanup candidates. Of course lots of school articles are in need of cleanup, so arguably only getting one school out of fifty clicks (and it was a fairly well written articles at that) is a BAD thing. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 16:45, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>It's there for finding something interesting that you otherwise won't find. If there would be a one-line substub for each preschool in the world like that one all useful content in Wikipedia would be outnumbered. People are wasting time on wikifying these articles, but no one reads them, because there's nothing to read. Everyone who has any relation to that school knows everything in that article already. Everyone other just doesn't care. What's the purpose of it's existance? <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue"><font style="background: black" face="Courier" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;Grue&#160;</b></font></a> 16:55, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>You've made two statements for which you provide no evidence:
<ol>
<li>"People are wasting time on wikifying these articles, but no one reads them, because there's nothing to read"</li>
<li>"Everyone who has any relation to that school knows everything in that article already. Everyone other just doesn't care."</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Once you get beyond these evidence-free statements I don't think there's a lot to the anti-school argument.</li>
<li>Schools are of intense interest to many people, particularly parents. The sheer amount of online information about each school in my country is quite formidable. Nearly every school is inspected once every five years and the inspection reports are online. This is an inherently encyclopedic piece of information. With schools on Wikipedia we can (and are in the process of) map every single US public school to the related school district and municipality. This enhances the articles on the municipalities themselves. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 17:20, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Both one of my great-aunts and one of my great-great aunts lived more than 100 years--does that automatically make them notable/encyclopedic? <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 07:11, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Sigh. I really wish I did not care so much about wikipedia, because then I could just sit back and laugh at the irony that all the trivial information being bandied about from pokemon to preschools will ultimately doom the project to a level of triviality approaching that of many of its articles. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 03:52, Jun 13, 2005 (UTC)
