<li><s><b>Save all</b>.</s> First of all, good work for whoever added this as an AfD, you did it incorrectly. It was previously nominated for deletion, and obviously it was kept. Because you repeated the process instead of making it a 2nd article for deletion, that record is now gone. To address individual points... First, you can't delete something for being "Fancruft". <a href="../../../f/a/n/WP%7EFancruft_4a77.html" title="WP:Fancruft">WP:Fancruft</a> is an opinion essay, not a guideline or policy, and the sources it cites such as <a href="../../../i/m/p/WP%7EImportance_ffbd.html" title="WP:Importance">WP:Importance</a> are frequently only <i>proposed</i> thus not universally agreed upon. If you want to delete the articles for being Fancruft, first you have to get Fancruft established as a reason for deletion; until then, your argument is without merit. As far as the "Original research, no references, and highly unencyclopedic." accusition goes, they're false. There is no original research; stats and background histoy of the units can be found in technical game manuals, the games themselves, or else online. While it is true that about half of the pages in question do not have external sources listed, you should keep in mind that these articles are currently undergoing overhauls by <a href="../../../a/w/e/User%7EAwesome_Username_1f96.html" title="User:Awesome Username">Awesome Username</a> and myself, being worked on daily to improve quality and add sources. As far as being "highly unencyclopedic" I'd like to point out that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_paper_encyclopedia" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia</a>. "This means that there is no practical limit to the number of topics we can cover other than verifiability and the other points presented on this page." The information being presenting in these articles can be verified, and the articles don't violate any of the other <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENot_9dd0.html" title="Wikipedia:Not">Wikipedia:Not</a> guidelines. No, we're not providing How-To's so don't wave that around either. Back to nomintating this for deletion, you have utterly no basis for it. The category with criteria for deleting it would most likely include: Is not suitable for Wikipedia (already addressed, doesn't violate anything); Original research, including the coining of neologisms (no original research is presented); Vanity page (obviously not applicable); Advertising or other spam (not applicable either); and Completely idiosyncratic non-topic (N/A as well). If the quality, sources, and sizes of the articles are problems, then put in the appropriate templates to bring attention to them so they may be addressed (although chances are I will fix up all the articles eventually anyway). If you don't think that the articles themselves are information worthy of being on Wikipedia, I'd ask what the defining line between permissible and non-permissible is; I for one have spent hours at a time reading about the various weapons, vehicles, characters, etc in works of fiction such as games and movies, and I find it hard to believe that nobody else does. I will point out that for "minor characters" in works of fiction the general guideline seems to be to combine them into one article called "List of minor characters in ____" but this wouldn't work so well for Homeworld stuff: First of all, the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Ships_of_Homeworld_dcdd.html" title="Ships of Homeworld">Ships of Homeworld</a> article (equivalent to a list of minor characters) is already quite long, if every article were to be a length such as <a href="../../../k/u/s/Kushan_Scout_8f7c.html" title="Kushan Scout">Kushan Scout</a>, <a href="../../../k/u/s/Kushan_Mothership_af6a.html" title="Kushan Mothership">Kushan Mothership</a>, and <a href="../../../k/h/a/Kharakid_Scaffold_1e1d.html" title="Kharakid Scaffold">Kharakid Scaffold</a> then as you can imagine the page would become quite large, certainly more than the &lt; 30 KB target size. Although I suppose that's really not an issue, as you didn't propose merging, and you want to delete the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Ships_of_Homeworld_dcdd.html" title="Ships of Homeworld">Ships of Homeworld</a> page entirely. Really, I don't know what you're trying to accomplish or what point you're trying to make. There are articles entirely dedicated listing the names of TV show episodes, for example, and I actually do use those regularly. Lists can be quite useful. "Non-notable minor characters (and places, concepts, etc.) in a work of fiction should be merged with short descriptions into a 'List of characters.' This list should reside in the article relating to the work itself, unless either becomes long, in which case a separate article for the list is good practice. The list(s) should contain all characters, races, places, etc. from the work of fiction, with links to those that have their own articles." So you see, we actually are following Wikipedia guidelines here... for more reasons why keeping "cruft" articles can be useful, I point you to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Individual_Counter-Strike_maps_3142.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Individual Counter-Strike maps">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Individual Counter-Strike maps</a>. --<a href="../../../t/w/i/User%7ETwile_6fe4.html" title="User:Twile">Twile</a> 17:05, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't see how these articles are not relevant to the game. The articles subjects are objects found in Homeworld games. Furthermore, the articles were created to serve the player of Homeworld computer games.

<li>These articles are absolutely not game guides. If they were, we would've included sections like "Tips for usage" and such. The only such information provided is in the Roles section of the template, which more or less says what the ship is used for (Anti-fighter defense, for instance). Take a look at <a href="../../../k/u/s/Kushan_Heavy_Corvette_d3ac.html" title="Kushan Heavy Corvette">Kushan Heavy Corvette</a> to see what I mean. Eventually all the articles will be akin to that, providing a brief historical background, technical details, etc. The articles were <b>not</b> "created to serve the player of Homeworld computer games" as you put it; the Game of the Year Edition of Homeworld (which has been retailing for 5-6 years, thus the only one that someone might realistically come across) comes with a strategy guide telling how to use everything. A player would be better suited reading the provided material for "how to" and "game guide" content. Let me put it this way: If there's an article on cheese, does it mean you should nominate it for deletion because it's a recipie? No. Even if it talks about how cheese is used in cooking, unless it provides recipies that are aimed at instructing how to specifically use cheese, it's not a "how to" article on cheese. --<a href="../../../t/w/i/User%7ETwile_6fe4.html" title="User:Twile">Twile</a> 18:19, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

For the smaller ship articles, mainly things that aren't Mothership-class, I can see how the conclusion reached for one would be the same for all of them, and I'd rather not have to defend every one of them constantly. However, for things like the Kushan Mothership and Somtaaw Explorer, those are some of THE big ships in the game, the equivalent of Major Characters in a work of Fiction. Those do get their own Wikipedia article regardless of whether you think a minor character should or not.

Maybe they should be merged together into sections- a page for fighters, a page for corvettes, etc. But the impression that I'm getting is that most of the people here are not looking at the articles, they're just reading the opinions of others written here and voting "delete per nom" or per above.

<li><b>Transwiki</b>. I'm revising my stance. Everything up until now, to me, seemed to indicate that such a thing as these articles were entirely permissible on Wikipedia; however, the in-universe stuff is something I can't contest. While it would be nice for Wikipedia to be a one-stop shop for all your information needs, if the relevance of that information in regards to the here and now must be stated, there really isn't much for the majority of the Homeworld series ships. Here's what I propose: Leave the articles alone. Every one of them. Especially significant ships, such as the Flagships of the various races, and the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Ships_of_Homeworld_dcdd.html" title="Ships of Homeworld">Ships of Homeworld</a> article, will be left more or less as they are now. I will oversee the transfer of information from Wikipedia to the Encyclopedia Hiigara wiki, and change all Homeworld-ship-related Wiki links to point to the new pages there instead. Likewise, on the Ships of Homeworld page, the links will be changed to point to the new pages on the alternate Wiki. Current articles, such as <a href="../../../k/u/s/Kushan_Scout_8f7c.html" title="Kushan Scout">Kushan Scout</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somtaaw_Recon_d2c6.html" title="Somtaaw Recon">Somtaaw Recon</a>, which cannot be meaningfully be changed to reflect an outside-universe opinion, will become redirects to the Ships of Homeworld page. This way, the information that I and others have poured over for hours will not be lost, and will find a place where people won't complain about its relevance.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - The problem is that, upon further inspection, many of the articles in question do not fit with Wikipedia's Writing About Fiction policies. They would have to be kept if they had information told from an "outsider" perspective, such as commenting on how a certain ship design was inspired by a particular real life aircraft, or how the <a href="../../../k/u/s/Kushan_Mothership_af6a.html" title="Kushan Mothership">Kushan Mothership</a> appears on the game box of <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeworld.html" title="Homeworld">Homeworld</a>, or things along those lines. Wikipedia doesn't let you write about Fiction from an inside perspective (talking about the article from the perspective of being inside the series) or from an outside perspective if you're giving advice, such as recipies or game guides or FAQs. I do think Wikipedia has made an error with this policy, because although it's good to have an outside perspective for some things, if you require that you limit the sorts of articles you can have, and the intelligent, useful linking. For example, while most of the information about the <a href="../../../c/r/y/Cryo_Trays_0b9b.html" title="Cryo Trays">Cryo Trays</a> is in-game and shouldn't be there according to present guidelines, if you were reading about <a href="../../../c/r/y/Cryogenics.html" title="Cryogenics">Cryogenics</a> and wanted to see some examples of where it was in fiction, it might be interesting or useful to see how multiple places implemented it. If the article were limited to "This is a large orbital tray holding cryogenically frozen people" it would be of utterly no use, whereas the "gamecruft" material that people seem to hate so ferverently might be useful to the individual interested in Cryogenics. --<a href="../../../t/w/i/User%7ETwile_6fe4.html" title="User:Twile">Twile</a> 16:28, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep and/or condense</b>. Deleting all these articles at once seems like an overtly hostile gesture. Furthermore, it establishes a dangerous precedent. If we were to delete all in-depth articles from video games, that would require us to delete most of the articles in <a href="../../../h/a/l/Half-Life_2_3a2a.html" title="Half-Life 2">Half-Life 2</a>'s entry, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Elder_Scrolls_f72c.html" title="The Elder Scrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a>' entry, and so forth. Really, that seems a bit overstepping, don't you think? 72.234.85.122's comments above more or less get at this. However, taking Wikipedia's Writing About Fiction policy into account (I disagree with its current iteration, but we'll save that for another time), these articles could use some condensing, or perhaps being merged into one of those "big list" articles on a faction basis. More importantly, that bit about 'Outsider perspective' or what have you should be satisfied. Simply deleting them because they don't quite fit a specific policy, especially when said articles are well-written, quite useful, and wholly salvageable, strikes me as being thick-headed, and Wikipedia cannot abide thick-headedness.24.161.191.234 19:08, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

If we disagree on what is appropriate content thats fine, but I assure you I haven't nor will I never nominate anything because I "personally dislike" it. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 19:43, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I thought we'd gone over this before. There is NO original research, the information can be obtained from reading manuals or playing the game. If that's original research, then so is reading <i>anything</i> or watching, say, a movie. Furthermore the information is verifiable, as it's not original. Yes, it's not all cited, but it can and will be cited eventually, and might I point out that a great number of Wikipedia articles lack citations and those aren't instantly AfD. Thus your only point is what's "Encyclopedic" which is a highly debatable point. I'm willing to admit that many of these articles do not conform to the Writing About Fiction guideline (which I again feel is highly flawed, "Luke, I <i>am</i> your father" is an important bit of information that can't be conveyed easily or at all from an outside-universe perspective), however, I won't stand by while you restate incorrect grounds for deletion. Don't tell people to assume good faith either; it's not exactly good faith to nominate articles for deletion because they have fixable shortcomings. Tag them for improvement, citations, etc instead of automatically trying to get them deleted by the hundreds. If you don't try to see them improved first, it looks like you're aggressively deleting them for the sake of deleting them, not because of what they actually are or may become. Factoring in your past attitudes towards game "cruft" related articles, it doesn't look like <i>you're</i> assuming good faith, and that you just have a vendetta against such articles. Since you <a href="../../../t/w/i/User_talk%7ETwile_5d9e.html#Impressed" title="User talk:Twile">hold me in high regards</a> why not humor me and consider revising <i>your</i> ideas based on the input of others? --<a href="../../../t/w/i/User%7ETwile_6fe4.html" title="User:Twile">Twile</a> 14:39, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
