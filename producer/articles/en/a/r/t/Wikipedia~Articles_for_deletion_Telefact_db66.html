<li><i>Do Not Delete</i> Telefact is a valuable part of the University of Pittsburgh. If other organizations have articles (see Friday Night Improvs or The Pitt News) this deserves one as well. Telefact is a nationally used service (NOT a campus help line) that attracts hundreds of callers per day and hundreds of thousands per year and is 100% unique in the services it offers. Completely unmatched nationwide.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, changes have been made and the sources we have have been cited. The article is no longer in violation of any citation policies. I don't see a reason why this article should be deleted.</p>

<li><i>Do Not Delete</i>* This article does not advertise, it is a unique service, and the whole thing is not for profit. To call this a student "help line" is definitely a misnomer. This request for deletion stems from a petty grudge an established wikipedian has against someone or something at the service itself. Sources can be worked on, but deleting something that has logged 1.6 million calls in a 16 year history and is used by thousands in PA, OH, NY, NJ an elsewhere seems a bit unneccesary. -- Jeff Harr, 12:30 EST, 4 August 2006 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.163.202.113 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.163.202.113_cc00.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.163.202.113">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> - As I said on my talk page, this certainly is not personal; because I attended the University of Pittsburgh, I have used Telefact for a number of years in both Pittsbugh and New York City. Additionally, I also have been friends with a number of Telefact employees in years past. I do find Telefact useful, but I don't believe Telefact passes Wikipedia's notability standards for <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28organizations%29_0596.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (organizations)">organizations</a>. If you can demonstrate that Telefact is notable enough to have an article, I think that's great. But that means you need to cite some sources. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> 04:57, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>- Like I said above, sources are being worked on (two have been added). Telefact has been featured in at least three major Pittsburgh newspaper articles and was featured in a nationally broadcast special on NPR radio in the late 1990's. It has had over 1.6 million callers. I didn't expect it to be such an issue over something seemingly insignificant. However, since the issue has come up, it is being addressed. Notablity, even as addressed in the article that was linked above, is highly subjective. 1.6 million users of a service, national useage, and the fact that it is 100% unique in its scope (no other service nationwide is similar) justifies its notability.

<li><b>Comment</b>- Many more sources have been put up on the Telefact page. I point back to that "notability" page to make a couple more points: <i>A topic has notability if it is known outside a narrow interest group or constituency, or should be because of its particular importance or impact.</i> Telefact is known outside a narrow interest group. 48 callers per hour and 1.6 million callers in 15 years spanning the whole country is proof of this. <i>Many editors also believe that it is fair test of whether a subject has achieved sufficient external notice to ensure that it can be covered from a neutral point of view based on verifiable information from reliable sources</i> NPR and Motley Fool, among newspapers and alumni magazine articles is sufficient external notice. As is 1.6 million callers. Lastly, I bring up the point "Wikipedia is not paper." Just because something is not household knowledge, it is ridiculous to preclude its inclusion in Wikipedia, especially when it is a unique service, passes external source tests, and has a wide base of users that span the country.

<li><b>Comment</b>- NPR not a notable news source? That's a new one. A major tech and business site, a magazine with nationwide readership? I will also be adding sources from major city newspapers. To say it fails any notability tests is laughable. It's not a vanity site either, hence the fact that the service is NOT promoted. The phone number is not even listed, for instance. The article covers only facts about the service and does not deal with excess promotion. According to Wikipedia's own guidelines: <i>An article should not be dismissed as "vanity" simply because the subject is not famous.</i> And even here, a serivce with nationwide useage has every right to have a short article on Wikipedia. I'm just very disappointed because I feel like some more expereinced Wikipedia members are ignoring facts and policy just to remove a harmless article that is covers a unique service, contains verifiable information, and is not in any violation. 24.3.59.222 13:16, 4 August 2006 (UTC) --Chris Szymansky

<li><b>Delete</b>. NPR itself is a valid source, but the requirements state that it must be <i>non-trivial</i> coverage. This is a tiny blurb, probably used as filler between stories.

<li><b>Comment</b>- It was a featured story on NPR. That is non-trivial coverage broadcast nationwide that Telefact was featured on. And how exactly is the article spam? It does not even feature the service's phone number. The service has seen no noticeable increase in calls since its been listed on Wikipedia, nor is that the goal of having an article here. The article is there simply as a contribution to Wikipedia (which seems to enjoy articles about things that are far more obscure than Telefact). Even if there was no press coverage, the 1.6 million calls the service has recieved proves its notability. That should not be overlooked. 24.3.59.222 14:05, 4 August 2006 (UTC) -Chris Szymansky</li>

<dd>The service was mentioned in a tiny blurb on NPR, ten years ago. It's sandwiched between software tech support and wild ponies. That seems pretty trivial to me. I didn't say it was spam, just not notable. By the way, the number of calls a number receives (just like the number of hits a website receives) is not a factor in deciding notability. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 14:12, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I disagree that useage statistics do not prove notability. Surely if a website would recieve millions of hits, it would be notable. The same goes for this service. That said, I've put my points out there. I will add a few more sources (Pittsburgh newspapers) but as a whole, I'm done arguing over something so trivial.24.3.59.222 14:39, 4 August 2006 (UTC) --Chris Szymansky
