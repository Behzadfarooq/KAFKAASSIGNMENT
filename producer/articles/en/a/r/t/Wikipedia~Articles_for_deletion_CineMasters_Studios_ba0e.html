<p>Dammit. Well, I thought they were good films... Perhaps we could hit Hollywood one day, if only you people would give us a chance. And about "it may grow in notability"- having it on Wikipedia is just another way to make it more notable.TheVortex</p>

<dd>Vortex, take it easy. For starters, you are wrong about Wikipedia being a place to get known. This site's traffic isn't as good as MySpace. If you get a MySpace account in the "film" section I guarantee you about 200 hits a day and you get to add embeded video. It's the best promotion you could get besides getting to interact with other filmmakers than can help you in the future. This wikipedia BS gets only a quarter of the traffic you could achieve in MySpace. So don't sweat it.BrandNew21 03:30, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>: I am sure they are good films. The trick to breaking into the industry though is to continue to make films, continue to show them at festivals, and to continue to network with as many other people as possible. Posting advertisements on Wikipedia will not further your film career. User accounts are never deleted.

<li><b>KEEP</b>: If i'm not mistaken. Isn't wikipedia the effort to sum all human knowledge? This guy is making films, he exists, he is human. Ok. So then why are we denying him the right to exist in wikipedia? because the wiki users are all so afraid that the guy could make a buck if people get to find him here and read about it?. People, wake up, you know what wikipedia is? wikipedia is what wikipedia is not. Exactly. Why you deny this guy the right to make an article about his production company? because its not important enough yet? wait a second, who has the authority to say this guy isn't important yet? If someone gets to see this guy's films and then wants to know a little bit more about him then they MIGHT turn to wikipedia and look for him.... but oh no... they won't because you guys THINK that you have the authority to get rid of him. Wikipedia IS NOT a reliable source of information because of people like YOU. So stop trying to make it one, this is just a site to let people give definitions to things in the world, not to qualify you and him and them according if they are important enough. So get off his back and let him keep the freaking article.BrandNew21 03:41, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
