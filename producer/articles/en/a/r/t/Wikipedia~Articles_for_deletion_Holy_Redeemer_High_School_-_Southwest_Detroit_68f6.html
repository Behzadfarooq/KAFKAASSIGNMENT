<li><b>delete</b> I fail to understand why this topic is sufficiently significant to feature in wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/e/n/User%7ESenordingdong_b1d0.html" title="User:Senordingdong">Senordingdong</a> 21:57, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This article deals with a closed high school, but a school's encyclopedic notability does not vanish when it closes. The decision to close the school is best understood in the context of demographic change, declining church attendance, and the financial pressures on Roman Catholic dioceses related to lawsuits over sexual abuse. --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 22:37, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><s>*<b>Delete</b></s> While I agree with Truthbringer that notability does not vanish when an institution closes this school did not have any notability in the first place. The only argument that can be made for notability is the age of the school but even then it barely goes back to the 1880s. I was unable to find any record of notable almuni or any other particulary notable event or matter associated with the school. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 01:37, 18 September 2006 (UTC) Now changing to <b>Weak keep</b> the age of the school might confer notability. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 01:37, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> The article needs to be reworked, but the text and desciption that is already there demonstrate notability. I fail to see how the lack of notable graduates makes the school any less notable; as if schools have an obligation to turn out notables to justify their existence. Nor is it clear that a school that survived for 120 years should be any less notable because it could "only" date itself back to the early 1880s. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 02:59, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, no excuse to deprive interested readers of this much encylopedic information. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 03:33, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> for posterity for the reasons described at <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_Schools_46ba.html" title="User:Silensor/Schools">User:Silensor/Schools</a>. John R. Mulroy attended this school, and based on <a href="http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060821/NEWS06/608210362" class="external text" title="http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060821/NEWS06/608210362" rel="nofollow">this story</a> we may want to incorporate that fact into the article. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_a49f.html" title="User:Silensor">Silensor</a> 03:47, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> School is clearly notable and been around for over 100 years.<a href="../../../b/a/g/User%7EBagginator_6459.html" title="User:Bagginator">Bagginator</a> 05:24, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> sourced, encyclopaedic, meets common law standards. No rational whatsoever has been presented for deletion. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:04, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Again, the presented argument is a lack of notability. It might help if you actually responded to the issues actually brought up rather than just assert that they didn't exist. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 18:16, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Arguments that are false upon their face don't really count as arguments in any viable way. Saying <i>This claims to be an encyclopaedia article, but is actually a cheese sandwich</i> would also be difficult to count as an argument for deletion, even though it has the form thereof. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:23, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually that would still be an argument and you said "no rational" given that multiple other people think this is a rational including the nom who is a respected user it might behoove you to explain how this argument is so bad that it doesn't even merity being addressed. If you could explain it would be appreciated. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 18:31, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not really. While yelling <i>Is too</i> - <i>Is not</i> might be also termed an argument, I would hope it's clear from context I mean a line of reasoning based upon facts - none of <b>those</b> have been offered to support deletion. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:37, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Excuse me? Notability is not a magic default state. Are you going to explain what is notable about the article or not? You asserted that it was based on data in the article. If so, please point to it. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 18:41, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're excused. I haven't said anything about notability being default, rather than it's been establish (please read the article to discover this). Notability isn't subjective - <i>I don't like this sourced, encyclopaedic article, so I'm going to accuse it of being non-notable</i> is <b>not</b> a criterion for deletion. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:46, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Notability not being subjective is irrelevant since there is no claim that anything here is notable. Don't confuse a lack of subjectivity with magically making everything notable. In any event, most of the people who say this isn't notable have objective notabillity criteria). Given this it might be nice for you to explain what is objectively notable about this article? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 18:51, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you'll check the article, you'll find that it has mutliple, indepedant reliable sources - thus it is objectively notable. The standards of notability are notability are not personal standards, they're standards we apply evenly across wikipedia. Multiple sources of third party coverage from reliable, independant sources is notable - and this is not <i>my</i> standards, but Wikipedia's standards. Nobody can objectively claim this school isn't notable - only subjective claims can be made to that effect (and subjective claims are useless in this context) <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 11:38, 19 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The use of the multiple independent sources standard is something used in certain guidelines. However, there are serious issues using it with schools. As I have already pointed out, newspapers love to puff-pieces on schools. Thus, it isn't a real assertion of notability. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 01:37, 21 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The multiple independent sources standard applies just about everywhere - although other litmus-style tests are occasionally used, it's clearly the most important test, and is used ubiquitiously. Where specific guidelines exist, there can be higher standards - though that's essentially to prevent spamming. Whether newspapers print "puff-pieces" on schools is something I really don't know (nor do I really care). Personal standards of notability go against <i>everything</i> this encyclopaedia stands for. If some publisher has found something worth publishing (better:multiple publishers) then that's a far more <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> acceptable criterion for retention, the converse for deletion. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:35, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> — It appears to satisfy the proposed <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> guidelines and more than meets my personal criteria for high school notability.
