<dd>Articles about cities, towns and villages, no matter how tiny, don't have to assert notability. All they have to do is assert that the hamlet <i>exists</i>. Some of us feel that the logical implication is that municipal functions of these towns - such as schools - are extended the same privilege. Until a definite policy or guideline exists, it means neither deletionists nor inclusionists are right or wrong - yet. But the lack of a guideline means there is no basis for calling for this article's deletion. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighfructosecornsyrup_c20f.html" title="User:Highfructosecornsyrup">Highfructosecornsyrup</a> 15:54, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Some of us, on the other hand, feel that "cities, towns, and villages" should have to assert some manner of notability, same as everything else does (though for incorporated cities and larger towns, this wouldn't be very hard). But there are tons of "municipal functions and locations"-if we broadly exempt that, we run the risk of having "Office 22G in the municipal courthouse of Noplace, Nowhere", so long as something confirms its existence. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 16:12, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Cities, towns, and villages <i>do</i> assert some manner of notability; they are notable by virtue of being permanent, distinct human communities; likewise, independent countries are notable by virtue of being independent countries (or do they need to assert notability to?). IMO, schools are notable <i>insofar as</i> they are permanent core institutions of permanent human communities. In most cases, including the present one, "X is a (public/parochial/..) school in Y" is essentially equivalent to saying that "X is a permanent core institution of the permanent human community Y. It plays a key role in Y's performing the most basic function of human society, viz. education." How can that not be seen as a claim of notability? -- <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisviva_a3c2.html" title="User:Visviva">Visviva</a> 01:45, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

Also, WP:DP explicitly states that an article being a stub is not, in and of itself, reason for deletion. Finally, at <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a> there is a proposed policy in development--I would suggest we hold off on this (and any other school articles anyone may wish to nominate) until that policy is finalized and adopted, unless there is a policy specifically requiring the deletion of the given school--otherwise, we risk removing content that may turn out to be explicitly acceptable according to a broader community consensus. <a href="../../../k/u/k/User%7EKukini_322a.html" title="User:Kukini">Kukini</a> 15:29, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, that's not accurate. Many of those debates have led to "no consensus, defaults to keep" more than anything else. Furthermore, the majority of voices for keeping come from a small set of editors. Finally, not only have occasional schools in the past been deleted but if you look at current trends deletion has picked up massively in the last month or so. It is therefore inaccurate to claim that there is "massive community consensus" (these comments were made by <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">User:JoshuaZ</a>)</dd>
