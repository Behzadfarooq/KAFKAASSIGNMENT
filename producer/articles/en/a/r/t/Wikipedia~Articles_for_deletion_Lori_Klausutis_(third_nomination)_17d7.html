<p>The result was <b>Delete</b> - the main thrust of the arguments from those arguing to keep is that she is notable enough to have an article (I know there are other arguments but I'm summarizing) and that the circumstances surrounding her death confer that notability. Although that is obviously (from the sheer volume of argument below) debatable it is secondary to the policy of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. This article, while cited, cannot be regarded as having a neutral point of view - look at the <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Scarborough_6f36.html" title="Joe Scarborough">Joe Scarborough</a> article to see the incident is covered in a far more balanced way - and since no attempt has been made to remove bias during the course of the AFD it must deleted under that policy. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 11:58, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

Article seems to be created for the sole purpose of disparaging Joe Scarborough. I don’t care for Scarborough, but having this article gives undue weight to a story which has been thoroughly discredited, and as such violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Undue weight</a> -- there is no investigation of Scarborough, and the Coroner said Klausutis did not die under suspicious circumstances – its inclusion here is sensationalist and tabloidic, not encyclopedic.

<p><b>History</b> Okay, to clarify on the deletion history of the article, it was nominated for deletion twice in the past for different reasons than it is being nominated for this time. The <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Lori_Klausutis_ff43.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lori Klausutis">first time</a>, the result was delete, because it was a useless and possibly POV redirect to <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Scarborough_6f36.html" title="Joe Scarborough">Joe Scarborough</a>. The <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Lori_Klausutis-2_13a9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lori Klausutis-2">second time</a>, the main reason was lack of notability, and the result of the debate was no consensus. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armedblowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">mail</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Armedblowfish_14be.html" title="Special:Contributions/Armedblowfish">contribs</a>) 23:56, 14 October 2006 (UTC), 00:12, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Reply</b>: Absolutely, which is why this one is <b>not</b> eligible. Give me a break, it may be misguided, but it's not an attack page. Further, I find the nom's arguments to be wholly unpersuasive and irritating in tone; nom seems to view AFD as a POV battleground and routinely spams to friendlies on votes. This one, for example, was pre-discussed among a little group of early voters. That last said, and I've been wanting to comment on this longstanding abuse of the AFD process for a long time, this person has no notability beyond Scarborough. So, there ought to be about 3 lines in his article mentioning the hubbub. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 18:49, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

You are quite prolific enough by yourself without imaginary socks, anyway. The repeated behavior of the nom here is the problem, not you.

<li>Sure, you knew what I thought, because <b>you</b> had asked me to nominate it for AFD and I refused. That's not the point, but it is indicative. I am here participating because of private communications <b>off</b> the talk page; a one-off or two is no big deal, but it's becoming systemic at least with this nom. The point is that there has recently been a tremendous amount of pre-discussion of AFD's among politically like-minded editors, crucially this is <b>off</b> the article talk pages. These voters are quickly informed of the nom's and swarm in to create a snowball before disinterested editors ever have a look. I don't like it. If an article truly deserves to go, it will go without a lot of lobbying and spamming and otherwise un-wiki techniques. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 23:23, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Notable with 862 Google hits and numerous newspaper articles. The story also had a bearing on Katherine Harris's present senate race, per the article. A healthy woman in her 20's, working in a congressman's office, was found dead from a whack on the head, and the medical examiner decided she fainted from an undiagnosed heart problem (she was a runner) and fell and hit her head on the desk? The Florida papers raised serious questions about the lack of openness in failure to release the records of the investigation, and about the medical examiner's past. Keep this along with the Chandra Levy article. Many of the Delete votes have the apparent subtext that nothing casting doubt on right-wing media figures is allowed in Wikipedia, a policy I have not been able to find in the rulebook. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 21:47, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The fact that the article has led you to believe that it "casts doubt" on a right-wing figure is exactly why it should be deleted.

<dd><b>Comment</b> In fairness to Scarborough, especially given that Katherine Harris reportedly brought this up in her campaign, if it is shown to be a tragic but non-notable death unrelated to Scarborough, the facts that show that to be so should be laid out somewhere, and it seems too much space would be required in the Scarborough article for an adequate treatment, which it does not have at present. For comparison, the death of Marilyn Monroe (certainly notable) was officially ruled to be suicide by drug overdose, but there is another long article <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_of_Marilyn_Monroe_bfdb.html" title="Death of Marilyn Monroe">Death of Marilyn Monroe</a> about it being suspicious and possibly due to murder, far more tabloid than anything in this article. The <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vince_Foster_7429.html" title="Vince Foster">Vince Foster</a> article bandies about tabloid theories that he was murdered by the Clintons, despite official findings of suicide, so there are precedents that a coroner's ruling does not prevent conspiracy theories being discussed in a NPOV way on Wikipedia.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 07:31, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Wikipedia is not dredging anything for political gain, Wikipedia is reporting on the existence of an individual whose death has been dredged for political gain by others - and it is that which makes her sufficiently noteworthy for an article - an article which debunks the myth that any competent authority has suggested that her death was anything other than an accident. <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_a828.html" title="User:BD2412"><font style="background:gold"><i><b>bd2412</b></i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_4cc0.html" title="User talk:BD2412"><b>T</b></a> 18:03, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree with Fred Bauder that "She is only notable because her death was used by unscrupulous mud-slingers as fodder for scurrilous aspersions." I don't see that as relevant, though. The statement concedes her notability. There are lots of people who become notable for bad reasons. They're still notable. (There's apparently been no attempt to delete our article about a fairly run-of-the-mill criminal named <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willie_Horton_c2c6.html" title="Willie Horton">Willie Horton</a>, who became notable only because his story was used by others for political purposes.) As for merger, I think that would be much more <i>unfair</i> to Scarborough, because giving this much information about the incident in his bio article would be undue weight. The one paragraph it has in his article now is about right, with a link to this article for anyone who wants to see the details (details that largely support Scarborough's position). I don't agree with the nom's argument that the presence of this article is undue weight, because that concept refers to space allocation within a more general article.

<dd>Wikipedia is already the conduit for scurrilous but notable aspersions, such as George W. Bush's deliberate lies about Saddam Hussein, or the Smear Boat Vets' deliberate lies about John Kerry. My view is that we report notable aspersions, whether they're valid or scurrilous. If your view is that we suppress information about notable but scurrilous aspersions, then you'd have Wikipedia editors deciding what's scurrilous.

<dd>That is not a rationale for keeping <b>this</b> article. It is a rationale for <u>writing an article</u> about the exploitation of the poor woman's death for political gain. We have to be very clear that the article text must reflect the topic of the article. Mrs K's life was non notable except to her loved ones. Her death per se was not notable either. The <u>use</u> and abuse some people made of her death is notable, and worthy of consideration for an article. But it is absolutely wrong to put this into an article "about Mrs K", because it is not about her. So, yes, report notable and verifiable aspersions and controversies, provided such is encyclopaedic reporting not journalistic pap, and create as many relevant articles as you wish. But this article is not the article to do it with. It has genuinely no notability and should go forthwith. Write the article about the way Mrs K's untimely death was exploited by various parties, and, provided it meets the guidelines here, there will be support for that article except from politically blinded folks.

<li>Her death had nothing to do with scarborough either. It was "unscrupulous mud-slingers" trying to link the two. The mudslingers are adequately covered in Scarborough's article and elsewhere. But repeating their "scurrilous aspersions" such as details about the coroner's or Scarboroughs marital status or even mentioning Chandra Levy as comparison is beneath encyclopedic and puts Wikipeida in the role of "mud slinger". Stopping false light libel is not censoship. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 17:40, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Utterly absurd rational for nominating this for deletion, part of a long series of suspect AfD noms. Undue weight is an invalid rationale as has been pointed out, policy states: "None of this is to say that tiny-minority views cannot receive as much attention as we can give them on pages specifically devoted to them." The undue weight provision would apply were this subject treated at this length in the Joe Scarborough article, where it would overwhelm the rest of the article. This article is sourced and deals with a subject discussed in the mainstream media by many, including Scarborough himself. We delete articles that libel the subject, we don't delete articles because we fear that sourced, verified facts might cause someone, somewhere to get the wrong idea about someone. It is not an "attack" or a "smear" (and is insulting to the editors who believe that such information should stay in Wikipedia to claim that it is such) and in fact the article flat out exonerates Scarborough from any wrongdoing - as it should - as he was not even in the state at the time. When <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katherine_Harris_bc1c.html" title="Katherine Harris">Katherine Harris</a> wanted to use the death to attempt to smear Scarborough, as was widely reported in the media, it was universally regarded as a desperate, undignified act by a rudderless and failing campaign. Everyone who hears this - except <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Moore_f401.html" title="Michael Moore">Michael Moore</a> - seems to think better of Scarborough, not worse. So it's bizarre for us to treat this matter as some sort of insidious thought virus that makes everyone think Scarborough is some evildoer. And it would be bizarre for us to delete something that's been reported on plenty of times in plenty of contexts (the original incident, the Imus show, Moore's attack, Katherine Harris, etc.) and would meet no objections regarding notability were the matter not politically charged. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 17:52, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Here's what <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> said about the creation of the Lori Klausutis article in April of this year: "The Klausutis article (and I have no idea why you are bringing it up here) is a direct consequence of your edit warring on the Joe Scarborough article. I'd prefer the information be in the JS article myself, but I don't feel like arguing about it for another year.

<li>What's your point? You've nominated it for deletion, not for merging, and the article has expanded to the point where a seperate article is probably warranted to avoid the "undue weight" problem. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 18:11, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
<li>The information that exonerates scarborough (as if he needed to be exonerated) is already in the scarborough article. The information is covered adequately there. There is no reason to maintain a biography on a non-notable person that died from natural causes in order to keep alive vague, unsubstantiated claims of wrongdoing. "Undue weight" in this context is that 80% of the article about this person's <i>life</i> is about what happened after her death and how it related to a person we cannot even establish that she knew in any way other than being employed in a remote office. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 18:23, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The "reason" to maintain it is the same reason we maintain anything, as a historical record of notable events. There is sufficient media coverage in multiple contexts to justify the article. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 18:32, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not according to <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a>. See above. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorton_devonshire_9599.html" title="User:Morton devonshire">Morton devonshire</a> 18:36, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then Jimbo and I will have to disagree on the matter. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 18:38, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Yes, Jimbo Wales is the creator of Wikipedia, and if he wants to delete it, he can. But he voted. and his vote was solely in reaction to vote above his. There should at very least be a mention of this somewhere on the 'pedia, even if it's stuck in the Scarborough article. But it seems she merits her own article. It's not like we're making an article about the band who played for the local high-school talent show; she <b>does</b> have notability. -<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">(talk)</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">(contribs)</a></sup> 18:43, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>So, Gamaliel see this article as having merit because there is something awry with the person who nominated it? Doesn't matter who nominated it, doesn't matter if the nominator is the devil incarnate, we have a community that judges, not a nominator. It is very simple, this article is biographical. It contains stuff that is about something else entirely. That stuff has to go. Once that stuff is deleted there is nothing remotely notable in the article because it is about an ordinary lady who died in her office. Deeply unfortunate, horrible for her family, and not notable for anyone in the world except them. The scandal after her death is absolutely nothing to do with her biography, except that, should an article be written about the scandal <u>and</u> should her biographical article survive, it merits a wikilink in a one line statement along the lines of "Certain parties attempted to make political capital about the [[death of Mrs K]]. How hard can it possibly be to grasp that an article must be about the "thing in the title" and not about some other stuff? The other stuff goes in its own article. If you feel strongly enough about it, write the other article. The let this one die in peace. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 19:20, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Most of the delete-sayers (that is, the few who aren't simply saying "non-notable" and leaving) seem to be of the opinion that Klausutis doesn't need an article because she did nothing notable apart from dying, and garnering media attention after death. Seems to me this is sufficient, but consider some of these articles on Wikipedia: <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_McConville_c148.html" title="Jean McConville">Jean McConville</a> was a housewife whose only notability was that the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army_cef2.html" title="Provisional Irish Republican Army">IRA</a> killed her. <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Tibble_26b1.html" title="Stephen Tibble">Stephen Tibble</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_McCabe_a7da.html" title="Jerry McCabe">Jerry McCabe</a> were cops whose only claim to fame is, again, being killed by the IRA. <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gillian_Clark_98cb.html" title="Gillian Clark">Gillian Clark</a> is apparently notable only for being killed in Iraq. <a href="../../../r/a/c/Rachel_Levy_095b.html" title="Rachel Levy">Rachel Levy</a> was a child whose only notability comes from being a victim of a bomber in Jerusalem. <a href="../../../b/e/h/Behnaz_Mozakka_b1b4.html" title="Behnaz Mozakka">Behnaz Mozakka</a> died in the London subway bombings.

<dd>Wikipedia is filled with articles that should be deleted or merged. My problem with this one is its use to attack another person by innuendo.

<dd>Notice the key words "relative lack of media coverage" from the Lori Klausutis article. It is not our job to make media coverage where there is none.
