<li>Good day! While we respect your considerably well-bolded and logically sourced right to practice any religion that strikes your fancy, it should be noted that said right doesn't extend to other people's/group's/etcetera's websites. Additionally, as has been noted, Wikipedia is not a soapbox. Nor is it a country, a planet, a galaxy, or a universe - it is an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a> (link provided for clarification), and thus an innapropriate place to <i>practice</i> religion. Now, if your belief system was notable, which we invite you to prove, we'd be more than happy to mention it. Until then, I invite you to surf around and become familiar with wikipedia, what warrants inclusion, and community norms and standards. Have a wikiwiki day! --Jeffrey O. Gustafson - <i><a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffrey_O._Gustafson_Contributions_507d.html" title="User:Jeffrey O. Gustafson/Contributions">Shazaam!</a></i> - <a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffrey_O._Gustafson_ae0f.html" title="User talk:Jeffrey O. Gustafson">&lt;*&gt;</a> 14:05, 25 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thank you for your well wishes. on your argument that Wikipedia is not a place to <i><b>practice</b></i> religion, well, that depends on what the definition of <i><b>practice</b></i> is. We started this article so that we may share our ideas with the world, wikipedia's the easiest ways since most of the world's media is biased to some degree. Since wikipedia's mission is to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">share knowledge with a neutral point of view</a> then we have the right to share our beliefs with the world as much as anyone do. Adding to that, Internetism adheres to the sharing of knowledge which is a way we <i><b>practice</b></i> our religion; and since wikipedia's and our interests do not conflict, we shouldn't have any problems then, with the support of the <b>1st Amendment's</b> guarantee of freedom of expression.
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia's mission is to also present articles about <i>notable</i> subjects. This has nothing to do with the first amendment - you want people to know about Internetism or whatever, put up your own website. You have failed to prove notability. --Jeffrey O. Gustafson - <i><a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffrey_O._Gustafson_Contributions_507d.html" title="User:Jeffrey O.

<li>Ironically for 60.48.75.108's argument, there is no evidence (presented by the article or otherwise) that people are actually exercising their freedom of religion in this way. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox_7923.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a soapbox">Wikipedia is not a soapbox</a>. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:20, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: In response to the previous argument, the creator of the article in question, 60.48.75.108 (hereinafter refered to as "<b>Bundein</b>"), is a devout practitioner of the religious belief under presecution.

<li><b>Delete</b>. And if the First Amendment arguments are put forward seriously -- I can't tell if they're kidding -- it's worth rereading the text.

<li>The First Amendment only applies to the Federal government. "Congress shall make no law..." Similar restrictions apply to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. As for the UN declaration, it is only "binding" on those governments that are members of the UN, not the citizens of those governments. Even then, it's not binding in that there is no legal recourse for failure to comply (although there certainly can be disastrous political and international relations fallout). <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 16:38, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Not wishing to prolong this obvious troll of a discussion any further, I suggest you actually spend some time learning how International Law and the United States Constitution work before suggesting that I (a private citizen) can violate your right to freedom of speech. <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 13:07, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
