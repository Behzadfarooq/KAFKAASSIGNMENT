<p>The result was a mess. Spare us another trip to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a>, having separate sections and a combined section creates confusion for admins to whether to delete, keep, etc. Please organise some prior discussion first, and consider nominating the articles separately for deletion instead.

<p>A blanket deletion nomination for all of the articles in <a href="../../../c/o/s/Category%7ECosmic_Era_vehicles_0cf9.html" title="Category:Cosmic Era vehicles">Category:Cosmic Era vehicles</a> (except <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missile_truck.html" title="Missile truck">Missile truck</a>, listed seperately). Please review each article <i>individually</i> and place comments under them.

<li><strike><b>Delete/Merge most</b> I'd keep the Skygrasper article since it is one of the featured air/spacecraft in the series and is pilotted by main characters. The problem with Gundam shows is that the weaponry is at least as important as the main characters and should be treated as such. (Actually, a case could be made that the mecha is more notable than the main characters due to liscensing of models and the industry that revolves around them. There are magazines dedicated to these fictional machines. Japan is a very odd place.) I'd say merge a lot of the other articles into the spacecraft and vehicles articles. Remember, we're supposed to delete as a last resort. Expanding and improving is preferred.</strike> <b>Strong Keep</b> per below. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 12:27, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I <i>have</i> read all of these articles (and contributed to most of them). Mass deletion of a large chunk of articles is non-kosher, anyway. While the articles have problems, a mass deletion is not a good answer, especially when two of the articles targeted for deletion are articles that many of the above could logically be condensed into. It's my opinion that whenever massive groups of articles are targeted for deletion (several <i>hundred</i> Gundam articles have been nominated in the last 48 hours), it's an indication that somebody who has never bothered to acquaint themselves with the subject of those articles has decided that said articles are unimportant. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceberg3k_a804.html" title="User:Iceberg3k">Iceberg3k</a> 14:38, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>ALL of the information in the above articles is unverifiable (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>). ALL of these articles are fancruft. ALL of the above articles are apparent original research. There's nothing wrong with a mass nomination of articles that are essentially of the same subject with the exact same concerns for verifiability and encyclopedic nature. The nominator made it clear that one could vote separately upon each article. I haven't, because I have the same concerns with all of them. You assert that one needs to be acquainted with the cartoon to understand the importance of these articles. In my mind, that's a blatant admission that this is pure <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">fancruft</a>. The articles themselves should illustrate their importance; one should not have to be an indoctrinated fan in order to derive benefit from it. <a href="../../../j/g/a/User%7EJGardner_e1b0.html" title="User:JGardner">JGardner</a> 18:14, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>It may not be policy (there's no need to scream, by the way), but it's an excellent essay. These articles are about extreme minutiae and there is little claim to be made that they are suitable for an encyclopedia. As you'll note, <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">WP:CRUFT</a> points out that fancruft dumps are rarely <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">suitably referenced</a> and are generally brimming with <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. In the case of the articles under debate today, there is not a single source cited in any article, with the exception of two very dishonestly misrepresented sources (each describes a deity, but the articles cite them for a claim that the fictional vehicles were named for those deities). <span style="font-family:serif;">—<a href="../../../p/t/k/User%7EPtkfgs_cda3.html" title="User:Ptkfgs">ptk</a>✰<a href="../../../p/t/k/User_talk%7EPtkfgs_c4c2.html" title="User talk:Ptkfgs">fgs</a></span> 18:55, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Furthermore, you're deliberately twisting my words. It's not necessary to be acquainted with Gundam for the articles to be useful (though it helps, and there are a several articles here that could stand to be merged, as they don't have enough information for a standalone article). However, there are over 100 articles being blanket-nominated for deletion, and many of those do have enough valid information to stand alone as articles in their own right. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceberg3k_a804.html" title="User:Iceberg3k">Iceberg3k</a> 18:44, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

I am being civil enough to tell you what is the problem of you claim here. Articles without sources listed in the page does not provide grounds for deletion, it only provide grounds for adding a tag of references needed or citation needed. Viewing everything you do not know as unverifiable is technically ignorance. Since you have ignored there might be, and have, sources. My English is not that good and cannot think of a better word to use. I am against keeping most of the articles, thus I am not defending them at all, I am just stating your opinion of them being needed to delete just because they have no sources listed does not have enough grounds to back up the argument. On the other hand, <a href="../../../i/i/n/WP%7EIINFO_2579.html" title="WP:IINFO">WP:IINFO</a> is, to a certain extend, a strong enough argument. Yet nobody can say what is important and what is not, since it is purely POV, and rubbish of one person can be treasured by many. I have no use in knowing how a specific kind of animal living in a remoted area that I will never go is like, but there are people who would be dying to know the info. There are people who need the infomation on what they are, we can find sources for it, and therefore wiki should provide it, as long as it does not violate copyright. The method of providing the information could be discussed and having a page for each and everyone of them may not be the best solution, but it is how it was done and thus a better method should be proposed. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 17:51, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The existence of a <i>need</i> for this information, which is a dubious claim at best, does not merit inclusion. Beyond that, the existence of verifiable information is not a <i>de facto</i> indicator of notability. My house has a tax record, a building permit, and an address, and thus is verifiable. We can all agree, though, that my house is not a notable building. I support the compromise of merging the less-important items to a list and purging them of original research or non-encyclopedic content, but this all-or-nothing argument that keeps getting dug up doesn't help a damn thing.

<dd><b>Reply</b>: Oh dear, of course not. If people actually paid attention to policies, the only existing Gundam articles would be lists, main character articles and the Gundam article itself. Of course, we have to compromise and only delete the <i>really</i> bad articles. To answer your question in a kinder manner: No. No one can.

<dd>I see that people keep misusing <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>. From 1~7, only 7 can vaguely be used to say that these articles should not exsist. However, the spec and such are not plot summary, and thus is out of the scope of WP:NOT#IINFO. There are information out there in wiki that is of no use to me, but is useful to a lot of other people, and there must be information that is useful to a lot of fans but not to any others. For example, I do not really need to know the <a href="../../../t/a/s/Tasmanian_Devil_ed94.html" title="Tasmanian Devil">Tasmanian Devil</a> can face tumours that prevent them from eating, but it is just interesting to read different articles to learn new things, fictional or not. Yes, I do not want a page to be just plot summary, but the <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> approved the article <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anakin_Skywalker_c92f.html" title="Anakin Skywalker">Anakin Skywalker</a>, and used it as a reference to a good article on fictional characters. The page contains <b>no</b> information on how the character impacted the real world. The article <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horses_of_Middle-earth_f5a2.html" title="Horses of Middle-earth">Horses of Middle-earth</a> is also another good example of what could be included in wiki. They have no impact on the real world, <i>but they are still there used as an example <b>on wiki policy pages.</b></i> Thus it is concluded that wiki policy(ies) does not state, or encourage the deletion of articles that does not have <b>any</b> impact on the real world. Stop using the argument <i>It does not have an impact on the real world so it must be violating <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> and should be deleted.</i> it is proven to be incorrect, by examples listed by wikipedia notability criteria guideline(the WP:FICT). <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 06:25, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../a/n/a/Anakin_Skywalker_c92f.html" title="Anakin Skywalker">Anakin Skywalker</a> contains information on how the character impacts the real world from top to bottom, which is why <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> points it out as a good article. The second sentence of the article is "In <a href="../../../r/e/v/Star_Wars_Episode_III%7E_Revenge_of_the_Sith_4ecb.html" title="Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith">Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith</a>...". The Anakin article is not a biography of a fictional person and the effect he has on a fictional universe, it is a description of a character and the effect he has on a series of movies. This is the difference between an encyclopedia of the real world, with out-of-universe description of real world things (animals, movies, anime) and an encyclopedia of the fictional world, with in-universe descriptions of fictonal things (spaceships, robots, sith lords). These articles only establish notabilty in the fictional universe, and use sources that take an in-universe perspective, and are organized in a way incompatible with ever fixing them. <a href="../../../b/c/o/User%7EBCoates_04d2.html" title="User:BCoates">BCoates</a> 08:16, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>From what you pointed out, one can only prove that it is a better written article, not an argument of why any article not written that way should be deleted becuase technically, all articles could be written in that format. Also, do not ignore <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horses_of_Middle-earth_f5a2.html" title="Horses of Middle-earth">Horses of Middle-earth</a> as an example. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 09:03, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><a href="../../../h/o/r/Horses_of_Middle-earth_f5a2.html" title="Horses of Middle-earth">Horses of Middle-earth</a> is only mentioned on policy pages as a good example of accumulating a bunch of entries that don't deserve articles into a single one. The individual horses don't have pages. I'm for keeping and improving the equivalent <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warships_and_spacecraft_of_the_Cosmic_Era_e7ca.html" title="Warships and spacecraft of the Cosmic Era">Warships and spacecraft of the Cosmic Era</a>. It's possible the individual articles could be rewritten in an out-of-universe style and still be non-empty, but there's no evidince of it. If the merged-together article becomes so full of relevant information that individual vehicles need to be split off again, they can be. <a href="../../../b/c/o/User%7EBCoates_04d2.html" title="User:BCoates">BCoates</a> 09:48, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also from <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>, <i>Wikipedia articles on works of fiction should contain real-world context and sourced analysis, offering detail on a work's achievements, impact or historical significance...</i> The people saying the ships must have RL impact are relying on this, not on <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> (at least I am). <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 16:57, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Strong Keep</b>/ <b>Possible Merge</b>. A lot are useful, and merging may result in "explosion" (especially image) or lengthy articles. Important vehicle should be placed on different page (Such as Skygrasper, Takemikazuchi, etc). Minor vehicle like Guul, is possible to be merged. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDraconins_da4e.html" title="User:Draconins">Draconins</a> 12:30, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Addition</b>. I have seen that many only consider TV Series/OVA version as their point of view. Please understand that Gundam SEED (and Destiny) has official novels and mangas, too. Even some details not mentioned in TV series and movies, occurs in novel or manga. I know that some differences do occur, even between the TV series and movies. Some even mentioned that they never got screen time while they are actually do (Such as: Cruisers type vessels (in one with fleet of Takemikazuchi or carrier), Compton class land battleship (operation Angel down) ). Lesseps class land battleship is even important ones in one of Gundam SEED manga! <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDraconins_da4e.html" title="User:Draconins">Draconins</a> 12:50, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Addition(Again)</b>. I see <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a> had listed good sources, they are japanese though. However, for non-japanese literate , try to see the official site here: [<a href="http://www.gundamofficial.com/worlds/ce/seed/mechanics/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gundamofficial.com/worlds/ce/seed/mechanics/index.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] and[<a href="http://www.gundamofficial.com/worlds/ce/destiny/mechanics/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gundamofficial.com/worlds/ce/destiny/mechanics/index.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>]. Click on the images for more infos. May take time to load. Even Aegis class is put there.... They only list brief pages though. For Destiny, they are still incomplete, for japanese literate, you may need to see official japanese site&#160;:[<a href="http://www.gundam-seed-d.net/01cool/mechanics/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gundam-seed-d.net/01cool/mechanics/index.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>], they separate article per episode group and factions. It may also take time to load. Just remember, the sources I mentioned only talk about the tv series. AFAIK, the only official list I found about other mechas is only in Japanese.

<dd>The sources need to have stronger focus. From what it looks like, each source has a page (or two) for each article (with a bit of background and facts) and nothing more. That does not warrant the existence of a separate article for each one. The so-called "real world impact" is for the articles as <b>a whole</b>, not each article.

<dd>I believe those model kits were part of a series of Gundam and mecha-related model kits. Once again, this shows that they have elevated importance in Gundam, but because they are part of a series of Gundam-related kits, they have no individual importance. Of course, they could be very high selling (or other things like that) but there's no evidence of this. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEmulatorGuy_9ad3.html" title="User:TheEmulatorGuy">TheEmulatorGuy</a> 05:45, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, but they are not. For the same series of model kits, the first one contains only Strike Gundam and Strike Rouge (as a different colouring) as anything related to Skygrasper and is a separted model. The second series contains <i>Ace Combat</i>, <i>Yukikaze</i> both are <b>not</b> Gundam or even produced by companies related to Gundam. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 06:59, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We don't seem to have much on the other page, but this one seems to be a lot easier. Other than Skygrasper, all the others are pretty much keep the first 2 and merge(or delete) the others. Can anyone confirm the situation just so that we can move on to actually merging them? <s>I will go and change the Skygrasper page now to modify it</s> I have modified the Skygrasper page to show more real world impact and hope that by tomorrow we can get rid of most of the other pages. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 06:11, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would say go ahead. Some people voted for a straight keep all, but they don't seem to be citing any relivant guidelines. Most are agreeing that a merge is in order.--<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 12:28, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I decide to start merging some vessels because, no major changes happened before and since I edited some vessels of cosmic era. See <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Warships_and_Spacecrafts_of_Cosmic_Era_%28Gundam%29_c2ca.html" title="Minor Warships and Spacecrafts of Cosmic Era (Gundam)">Minor Warships and Spacecrafts of Cosmic Era (Gundam)</a>. Though, I am against merging Takemikazuchi and Tarawa into them since IMHO, it is important enough. For others, just wait... I got my hand full... currently. For all <b>keepers</b>, please pray that my boss does not scold me for this... (just joking... -_- ). Any suggestions are welcome. I really need your comment on Takemikazuchi and Tarawa matter. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDraconins_da4e.html" title="User:Draconins">Draconins</a> 13:13, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>(Added)oops, I also forgot I also against merging Vosgulov and Lesseps. Those need your comment also... <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDraconins_da4e.html" title="User:Draconins">Draconins</a> 14:28, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I am kinda against those 2 have separate pages, yet. Even Captain Todaka's page is being evaluated to be deleted(and I am going to support that). Takemikazuchi appeared in, like, 3 episodes? Destiny units are still too new to have any impact on anything, and really, I think I am pretty knowledgeable on the sources, and I cannot find anything about them that is really notable, not even in the series itself. (not even the mechanical files give more than half page worth of them.) <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 13:46, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> Same argument. Lesseps, maybe arguable. They appeared in GSA series, too, thus can have maybe an extra line saying the design inspirated the author of GSA. However, I still don't think it is important enough, just yet. Also, most of the plot summary actually should go and will make the whole article shorter, and thus even less desire on keeping it as a separated article. Not going to hurt if it is merged for now, if any more sources pop up to support the Lessep, like having a model kit or appearing in Super Robot Wars or anything like that, I will say split it back out. All the sources now are still too oriented towards Gundam Seed series and there really are not much to tell for now. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 17:07, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b> This discussion marks an important advance in the repeated discussions of such objects--put them in groups: not a particular type of warship, but warships.

<li><i>Update</i> due to the discussion being inactive for more than 24 hours after my suggestion, I am going to merge the ones that no one is fighting for a keep. I am going to leave Takemikazuchi, Tarawa, Vosgulov and Lesseps alone for maybe 2 more days and see if anyone coming up showing their importance countering my argument above. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 08:56, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i>Update</i>, complete merging all vessel AfD-ed above, except Takemikazuchi, Tarawa, Vosgulov and Lesseps (I will decide in 2 days, will be merged if nobody except me against the merging).
