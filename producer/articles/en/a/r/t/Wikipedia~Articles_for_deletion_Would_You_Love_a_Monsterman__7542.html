And you may be right that there are Wikipedia articles for non-notable songs by J-Lo, et al. If you give me a llst of those articles you believe are non-notable, on my talk page, I'd be happy to investigate and probably nominate them for deletion too.

<li>Given your recent nominations, I would advise you to take such care yourself.

<li>Blogs are not reliable sources for the purposes of notability. The tartareandesire link is not <i>about</i> the song, so it doesn't much help. The rockdetector link isn't <i>about</i> the song either. The metalspheres.de link is good, the language doesn't matter. This is one reliable source for notability. The notability requirements call for multiple sources. Are there any more? —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 09:03, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I disagree where it comes to blogs. As a general rule, yes they probably don't count. In the case of popular culture, however, particularly where 50% of the post deals with the single in question, I would argue that they are frequently the only source we have for a great many things. In the case of the average single in this day and age, the music press tend to concern themselves with the fact that it has been released, saving a review or whatever for the album, so the fact that this single has generated any publicity in and of itself seems to be a point in its favour. Obviously if there's a bit of policy I'm missing here, I'll be happy to be shown it. The tartareandesire link is included because it demonstrates that the song was a milestone for the band (first single release). Yes, it does this in a sentence and a half, but the point is that it does it. I'd argue that the first instance of something is probably going to be notable more often than not. Likewise, the rockdetector link (which I'll agree is probably the weakest of the bunch) is important because it explains that the song (despite being relatively old) is deemed sufficiently important to be on the American release of a new album. Yes, there's only one source there which talks about the song and nothing else (although there's another source which spends half its time doing the same thing), but what the other sources do is underline the importance of the song as well - the fact that they do so briefly is neither here nor there, when what they actually say is considered. If all they were were tracklistings, I'd agree with you entirely. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 09:23, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, I'm happy to give policy. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html#The_primary_notability_criterion" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability#The primary notability criterion</a>: "<i>A topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself. ... "Reliable", as explained in the reliability guidelines, requires the source to have a certain level of editorial integrity in order to allow for a verifiable evaluation of the topic's notability. ... "Non-triviality" is an evaluation of the depth of content contained in the published work, exclusive of mere directory entry information, and of how directly it addresses the subject.</i>" <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>: "<i>blogs are largely not acceptable as sources</i>". Blogs aren't acceptable because they aren't editorially reviewed. Passing mentions aren't acceptable because you can probably find hundreds of such mentions for everyhting that is non-notable. One might reasonably expect that a first single by a notable band to be notable, however, if it is notable then it will have multiple independent sources talking primarily about it. This doesn't, yet, although it's halfway there with that German website. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 10:55, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Again, I think we're only in subtle disagreement. I still maintain that the first single by a notable band is a notable event. The lack of coverage is due to the relative recent vintage of the band. Additionally, I would draw your attention to the word "largely" in all of this. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 20:37, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Again, the chart listing doesn't mean anything as far as <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is concerned, the tracklisting is not notability and the rockdetector link you added does not focus on this song as its primary topic.

<ul>
<li>Why is a number 1 single not automatically notable? It's not like it can do much more than reaching the top of the charts. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 09:23, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Because you can't write an article from this. The point of gathering reliable sources is so that you can write a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> article. You can't write an article from raw data. "'Would You Love a Monsterman?' was a number 1 song in Finland" would be all the article could ever say. A stub that can never be expanded must be merged back into its parent article. If the song is notable enough to pass our notability requirements using multiple third party repliable sources, then that gives us sources to work from to write the article such that it will satisfy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> as well. But without the sources for <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, there's never even a hope of fulfilling <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. That's why "number 1 single" means nothing. It would allow as much content as could be written about any other number 1 single in history... nothing at all, without further sources. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 10:43, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A fair point in the abstract, however it slightly mis-states the situation. What we know about the song is the following: It is by a particular band, it is to be found on a particular album, it was released as a single (the first single the band ever released, as a matter of fact), it achieved a certain place in the Finnish charts and may well have achieved other placings elsewhere (my guess is that it didn't, but I didn't look particularly hard), it has a video which consists of various things occurring, it either will be or is on the American release of the band's latest album (I'm unclear whether the album's out in the States yet), and the lyrics are about certain things. Every single one of those things can be verified, and at least two of them (being the first single the band released and achieving the distinction of topping the charts) are pretty impressive achievements. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 10:49, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>That it's by Lordi and was on a particular album is already communicated by the article <a href="../../../g/e/t/Get_Heavy_0651.html" title="Get Heavy">Get Heavy</a>, that it was the single off that album can be communicated at that article and that it was the first single can be communicated at <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lordi.html" title="Lordi">Lordi</a>, all very trivially. No reason yet for a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wp%7Econtent_fork.html" title="Wp:content fork">wp:content fork</a>. That it reached a certain place on the charts seems better suited to the <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lordi.html" title="Lordi">Lordi</a> article, since this is notability directly for the band, the video can be on the album page and it is already on the band page, still no reason to content fork.

All one needs is a copy of the lyrics to establish what the song's about. If the songwriter's been interviewed and has gone on record as saying there's a deeper meaning as well, then all the better, but not all songs have deeper meanings and neither do all songwriters say as much. I also think you're putting the cart before the horse on this one. Something must be verifiable in order to be notable, not the other way around. There's verifiability (whether you believe that the information is better positioned in the band's article or not, personally I think a number 1 single gets its own article), and from that verifiability comes notability. To use the old hackneyed analogy, I verifiably exist, but from that verifiability comes no notability (yet). A head of state, on the other hand, verifiably exists and from that verifiability comes his or her notability. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:17, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>If a songwriter has been interviewed and explained what the song was about, then that quote can be included. But art is way too subjective for us to be deciding that here. Wikipedia is not for artistic criticism, and deciding the meaning of lyrics is always original research. We would absolutely have to have reliable sources for that. Regarding your example of a head of state, why are they verifiable? Because much has been written about them. Why was so much written? Because they are notable. If something is notable, it will become verifiable, usually quite quickly. But anyway, it's not me who demands notability for verifiability. This is Wikipedia's stance: <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html#Rationale_for_requiring_a_level_of_notability" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability#Rationale for requiring a level of notability</a> says "<i>In order to have a verifiable article, a topic must be notable enough that the information about it will have been researched, checked, and evaluated through publication in independent reliable sources.</i>" I don't think that's putting the cart before the horse at all, I think it's quite sensible. But you may disagree, so I'm just making clear that it's not a requirement that I made up. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 12:28, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><i>...art is way too subjective for us to be deciding that here. Wikipedia is not for artistic criticism, and deciding the meaning of lyrics is always original research</i>: No. Not always. There are two levels to any song or text that can be talked about. The first level is the simple question of "what do the lyrics say?" For that, all we need is a copy of them. The second level is the question of "what else might it all mean?" For that, we need interviews with the songwriter, academic analysis and whathaveyou. If we were talking about Bob Dylan or someone like that, I'd grant that we'd have problems in figuring out anything about it. As it is, we don't. It won't be as strong an analysis as it could be, but it'll be something. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 20:37, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>We can't just repeat the lyrics without breaking copyright law. The only way to bring the lyrics into this is to go under <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a>, but to do that we need to subject the lyrics to critical analysis. Any critical analysis strong enough to support fair use would inevitably be a violation of <a href="../../../o/r/i/Wp%7Eoriginal_research.html" title="Wp:original research">wp:original research</a> without reliable sources such as the band talking about the meaning of the song. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 22:57, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I didn't say we would just repeat the lyrics, did I? What we do is we link to them as an external link or a reference (depending on how picky people want to be with "fact" templates). Having done that, one can then write sentences such as "The lyrics deal with XYZ" with something approaching impunity. Without having the lyrics in front of me, I can't say what they're about, but it could potentially be that the lyrics are clearly full of references to "Beauty and the Beast" (they may not be, I'm just blue-skying here), in which case we can say as much. If Mr Lordi later goes on record as saying that the lyrics were inspired by his experiences being bullied at school, that's well and good, but the simplest and most basic level of "what the song is about" can be answered just by looking at the lyrics. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 23:24, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Number 1 hit singles by notable bands are unquestionably notable, even if the available sources warrant only a stub article. See my comments on this user's other Lordi nominations - deleting articles about no. 1 singles by major bands is very clearly <i>not</i> what AfD should be about, even if the notability guidelines can somehow be interpreted to say otherwise (so change the guidelines!) Fortunately, I do not need to mention <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> here as the nominator has already done so, neatly side-stepping any <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> concerns. <a href="../../../a/d/o/User%7EAdorableRuffian_c1ea.html" title="User:AdorableRuffian">AdorableRuffian</a> 21:19, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Actually one of the requirements of stubs is that they need to be able to grow. If there's not enough reliable sources out there to grow an article beyond a stub, then the stub cannot be kept and it must be merged elsewhere. Your accusation that I am making a point is a violation of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> unless you can demonstrate it to be true. You can't. What "point" would I be making? What exactly do you think I'm up to, here? I just found some flimsy articles that were unsourced and non-notable, so I nominated them for deletion. My only "point" is that non-notable articles should be deleted. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 12:28, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I was simply replying to your invocation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> earlier, which I felt was bordering on uncivil in itself. I accept that these were good faith nominations, however I do not know why you insist on pushing strict and subjective interpretations of guidelines (as if they were immutable and set in stone) and then replying back and disparaging the views of every single editor who disagrees with your opinion. AfD should not be a one-man show - we all have our views as to whether articles like this should be on the wiki, and all such opinions are equally valid (the more the merrier). Even if stubs <i>need</i> to be able to grow (something I don't necessarily agree with - many stub articles are valid and useful as they are) they do not need to grow <i>right now</i> - more sources may be found at a later date by someone who has read the article and wishes to expand it. One of the many good things about Wikipedia is that articles can start off as stubs and grow at their own pace. (A deleted article, of course, cannot grow at all.) <a href="../../../a/d/o/User%7EAdorableRuffian_c1ea.html" title="User:AdorableRuffian">AdorableRuffian</a> 18:58, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I offered to assist in deletions of other songs and gave that user a genuine warning: someone who recently said "<i>If their songs don't deserve Wikipedia entries, then neither do Jennifer Lopez', Hilary Duff's or any other ultra-popular American group</i>" and then began nominating those performers' songs for deletion <i>very likely would</i> be accused of making a point. I thought that user should be apprised of this ahead of time. How is that incivil? Your point about stubs is a good one. They do need to be able to grow, but if there's a reasonable expectation that they will grow later, that would be a good argument for keeping them. I haven't seen indication that this is likely to grow, though. If we're already past its peak of popularity, there probably isn't going to be much else written about it in the future. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 22:57, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Given that the song was released in Finland in 2002 and may only have been released more widely in the last few months (and given that the band only achieved worldwide fame less than a year ago), is it possible that calling this "a stub that never grows" is slightly premature?
