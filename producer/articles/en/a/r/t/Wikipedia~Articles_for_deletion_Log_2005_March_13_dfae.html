<li><b>Merge</b> into the relevent University student's union article after cutting out all the ego claims (typical politicans). This probably leaves about one line. If any similar Labour or Lib Dem articles are skulking around, get them too. Preferably expand with as full a list of the other clubs as relevent. I also dropped their claim to be 'the dominant force on campus' from the main University page because it's very, very hard to believe and I couldn't find any evidence to support it (googling for the Union president finds him supporting the NUS president, which doesn't sound very right wing to me). <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 14:19, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Basing judgments on SU Officers; endorsments for NUS Presidents is very dodgy - a few years ago one of the previous prominent Conservatives in the SU publicly endorsed the left-wing candidate for NUS President. Furthermore the current SU President, from recollection, was elected on massive transfers. The ability to win (or even the readiness to contest) SU elections should not be a measure - at Kent everything possible has always been done to make the elections as unpolitical as possible. I wouldn't merge this into the SU page - individual socities are very distinct from the union and that would not be the best place to locate the page. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimrollpickering_f409.html" title="User:Timrollpickering">Timrollpickering</a> 16:13, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> <b>Advertising and Spam</b> The article was created by Wikipedia user Daniel C.Boyer on June 18,2004. A Google Search will generate substantial hits and traffic, yet this is not the original Paris Surrealist Group (or Surrealist Group in Paris, whatever you want to call it) under the direction of the late Andre Breton who died in 1966. There are numerous credible reference sources that state as fact, that the real Paris Surrealist Group disbanded in 1969 (see "Revolutiuon of the Mind" by Mark Pollizotti) and (What is Surrealism by Andre Breton). This GPMS (Groupe de Paris du Mouvement Surr√©aliste) is a commercial enterprise run by the friends of the original 1966 group that sell literature and publications to libraries in Paris, as indicated on their home page from their website. <b>Note: the home page of their website, sells catalogues, publications, etc, for 15 Euros.</b> The creation of the article is intended for <b>promotion</b>. Also, links on there site lead to numerous essays by friends and collegues, as well as exhibitions in Prague back in 1999, yet, I cannot find any other substantial reference sources that acknowledge the Prague 1999 as an International Surrealism exhibit. On record the last official International Surrealism Exhibit (the real thing) was in 1965, see Sarane Alexandrian's, "Surrealist Art".<a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClassicjupiter2_96b9.html" title="User:Classicjupiter2">Classicjupiter2</a> 01:40, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Classicjupiter2 is nothing more than an anti-surrealist liar. He knows full well that there was a 1976 World Surrealist Exhibition in Chicago; he will find some reason to say that this is not a "real" surrealist exhibit, but it will be based on POV. None of what he says is relevant to VfD, and I am suspicious that an analysis of anonymous POVs will reveal that one of them writing in the same highly idiosyncratic (even Wigdoresque) way is responsible for the not-very-relevant note on price. Yet whether or not they sell publications (Classicjupiter2 is surely aware that the original Paris Surrealist Group and its members sold publications) is a POV question relating, perhaps, to the purity of surrealism; all these questions are POV issues to be discussed in the text of the article but not grounds for deletion. Should be delisted from VfD as Classicjupiter doesn't bring up anything but his POV dislike for the group. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C.

<li>Hi, no please don't delete this! it's not an organisation or an advertisement or anything. it is this imaginary country that a group of harvard undergrads established a few years ago - think of it like the onion magazine and is not intended for commercial purposes. it would mean a lot to us if you didn't delete the post. thanks. seh. <i>...posted at 02:53, 2005 Mar 13 by User:129.67.43.241 (the same IP as that used to create the article)</i>

<li>Uh... sorry, in that statement you said exactly why it must be <b>Deleted</b>: "It is this imaginary country that a group of harvard unergrads established a few years ago". If anything, I'd place it as a website: <a href="http://www.shakalistan.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.shakalistan.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.shakalistan.org/</a>. Now, I don't mean any offense here, but if all there is to it is a bit under 40 people... It's not notable enough for an encyclopedia. It's not an issue of free expression or anything else, but rather an issue of: is it well enough known that people on the other side of the world might look for it? That's how I'm viewing this... It's interesting, yes, but... not really well known enough to go on here. This is a place to go AFTER you're very well known, not when you've just been running something for less than three years... Ok, time's not a major factor but...

<p>I am very sorry to hear all this about my entry. I was hoping that other people would add their gangs and clans to the list. I only know of about 4 other gangs and clans and I added them to the list to the best of my knowledge.</p>
<p>Can someone make me a suggestion of how to improve my page rather than just saying delete or atleast give me more to go on please.</p>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Bad title. Not suitable topic for a whole article and not useful as a redirect.

There have been <i>very few</i> (commendably few) cases of SAT questions where the wrong answer was scored as correct, and they've been national news. I would be inclined to think such questions <i>are</i> notable enough for a section within <a href="../../../s/a/t/SAT_684e.html" title="SAT">SAT</a>, perhaps "Disputed questions," but any such items would certainly need to include the actual question text, <i>suitably-sourced</i> authoritative opinions about the right answer, and an indication of whether the ETS acknowledged an error. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 14:31, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>???? I would have said that there are no right <b>triangles</b> on a cube. There are eight corners, each of which consists of three edges at right angles to each other. The three edges at a corner form three right angles. It's been too long since I took geometry to remember whether there's a definition of the phrase "distinct" in regard to angle.</li>
<li>The three right angles are distinct in that none of them are congruent with either of the other two. That makes a case for 24 distinct right angles.</li>
<li>On the other hand, each right angle shares each of its sides with one of the other right angles, so in a sense none of them are <i>fully</i> distinct. So you can make a case for 0.</li>
<li>If you ask "if you pair edges into right angles, never using each edge more than once, how many right angles can you construct?" since there are 12 edges and each right angle consumes two of them the maximum is 6. To actually construct them <i>seems</i> to be a little bit of a puzzle; I've managed to find six, but it's surprisingly asymmetrical.</li>
<li><b>Triangles</b>... there aren't any triangles in a cube unless you draw some diagonal lines between the vertexes. I have an idea that the question must have contained a diagram. However, I don't want to try to reverse-engineer what the diagram might have looked like, or the wording of the question, based solely on the information that the right answer is supposed to be 12. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 22:16, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The word is used in Japanese (<a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=%E3%83%89%E3%83%AA%E3%83%89%E3%83%AA&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;sa=N&amp;imgsz=small|medium|large|xlarge" class="external text" title="http://images.google.com/images?q=%E3%83%89%E3%83%AA%E3%83%89%E3%83%AA&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;sa=N&amp;imgsz=small|medium|large|xlarge" rel="nofollow">image search</a>), so it would be helpful to be able to look it up in wiktionary. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 01:35, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Can you confirm that the definition is correct, though? While it certainly looks reasonable, I'm hesitant to transwiki without some kind of confirmation; it's not in any of the dictionaries I have handy, and my Japanese is so out of practice as to make searching through the google hits impractical.

<dd>I don't see how this could redirect to Sniper. This article is about a character class in a medieval-fantasy game -- no one looking for that is helped by reading about high-powered rifles, terrorism and SWAT teams.

<dd>It should be redirected because Sniper (Archer) is really just a subcatagory of <a href="../../../s/n/i/Sniper.html" title="Sniper">sniper</a>. People looking for information on Fire Emblem probably wouldn't look under this name. If you absolutely wanted an article on this, it would probably go under Sniper (Fire Emblem).

<dd>Sniper (Archer) is a subcategory of Archer in Fire Emblem, not Sniper. The article is misnamed, mis-capitalized, and ambiguous. No one is going to search for this name, no one is going to link to this name, and there's no Fire Emblem articles to direct it to, other than <a href="../../../f/i/r/Fire_Emblem_c2aa.html" title="Fire Emblem">Fire Emblem</a> itself.

<li><b>Merge</b>--probably best at SAR. I think this is the more common way of handling instances when both u/c and l/c uses exist, probably at least partially because most searches outside Wikipedia are NOT case-dependent, so it is NOT valid to assume that just because the user typed lowercase letters that they are looking for a word instead of an initialism. It's also more convenient to have 'em all on one page. For example, <a href="../../../a/a/_/AA_3b98.html" title="AA">AA</a> serves both the word "Aa" and the initialism "AA". <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 04:40, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)

This VfD is a case in point. The whole set of Creationism pages have been ravaged by what the Frenchman called "les chiens" (the dogs) who replace quotes, paraphrases, and citations to prominent scholars by the "dog's" own personal research. Evolutionists and creationists alike have ripped out scholarly citations from creationism pages--not to be replaced by better scholarly citations but rather with the Wikipedia editor's own uncited personal research. As I read it, the User:FACTS page sets forth an incredible idea! --that the creationism pages would be assembled <i>only</i> from a balanced presentation of what the scholars have actually written with zero personal research. 8)) So of course, "les chiens" are here to make sure that that cannot happen on Wikipedia. 8)) ---<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERednblu_9100.html" title="User:Rednblu">Rednblu</a> | <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERednblu_c10b.html" title="User talk:Rednblu">Talk</a> 22:36, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

Without good rules, they would be at each others' throats. 8)) I would guess that the rules on the User:FACTS page will have to evolve much more if this project is to succeed. 8)) ---<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERednblu_9100.html" title="User:Rednblu">Rednblu</a> | <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERednblu_c10b.html" title="User talk:Rednblu">Talk</a> 05:53, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Currently, Wikipedia does not have <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> rules and policy explicit enough to deal with the personal research on the Creationism pages. As I read the rules on User:FACTS, every editor's statement--if questioned--must be backed up with a quotation, paraphrase, and citation to what an actual scholar has written. This is quite different from the MainSpace where both you and I have allowed bigoted editors to remove whole sections of paraphrase, quotation, and citation to what scholars actually wrote when they replace the whole page with uncited drivel of personal research. Think about it. In my opinion, the most important product of this experimental space would be a set of rules and policy tested and proven to be adequate for keeping personal research out of the Creationism pages. ---<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERednblu_9100.html" title="User:Rednblu">Rednblu</a> | <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERednblu_c10b.html" title="User talk:Rednblu">Talk</a> 20:30, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

But it certainly an unfair use of "force" for any administrator to delete that sandbox to prevent the experiment. ---<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERednblu_9100.html" title="User:Rednblu">Rednblu</a> | <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERednblu_c10b.html" title="User talk:Rednblu">Talk</a> 13:45, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>The point is that several people are shouting angry arguments at one another, and there are several processes of dealing with that involving the community (e.g. RfM, RfC, RfA). I've also seen some accusations of vandalistic POV-pushing. This is not something that VfD ordinarily deals with. RfC primarily gets things to the attention of the community (and that has precedent), which was my point. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 12:05, Mar 18, 2005 (UTC)

Am I right? Now I can see a lot of value in getting disputants together in a place where they can shout angry arguments at one another--because it is better that most of the angry shouting be drained into one cesspool. In contrast, the important issue that this VfD page buries is a fundamental flaw in the Wikipedia rules. And the User:FACTS environment is only a System Development Environment (SDE) where "developers" who abide by the evolving SDE rules can work together in prototyping rules that actually produce <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> pages on Creationism. <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> pages on Creationism are obviously impossible in the MainSpace pages.

The project is an OPEN SANDBOX designed to experiment in a place where the egos aren't as hot, and where we can work FREE of systemic bias. Goethean has "essentially" redefined the project as "starting a mini-wiki" when all it is is an effort to develop procedures, rules, and ultimately npov articles in an environment free of the ideological free-for-all we have on the main pages.

<p>I don't understand the dispute here, being relatively new to Wikipedia. However, it's beyond me why polite articulate explanations of Creationism, and some of its corollaries can't be articulated by Creationists and improved by other Creationists, so that we can all go somewhere to read their best construction of the world and understanding of the facts (facts too are made, en fran√ßais = faire, to make, as in factory). You can't take the human and the bias utterly out of the process of facting. A lot more can be said about this, but the question of bias applies to all of us and all viewpoints, there are no facts without values impinging upon their selection and their ordering and their existence as mental units. So, if this present quarrel has anything to do with outlawing articles on Creationism by Creationists subject to contraints of politeness, articulateness, and improvement by increasing Creationist expertise: then we're just letting some other bias run roughshod over this particular bias with a smaller community of consensus. But, not knowing precisely what is the issue here, what section of Wiki is the proper place for the entries, why people seem to be stripping authority references from Creationist articles (appropriateness may require a fine line between an apologist's rant and a PhDbiologist's argument against evolution from one original simple lifeform on planet Earth, etc., and not knowing yet what a "Project" is, I would at this stage vote against deletion of the FACTS (whatever it is).

<dd>You, sir, have done a great deal to reestablish my faith in the human race:). Points all well made:). The goal of the project is simple -- to work on policies, procedures, and model pages that will represent creationism concisely, accurately, and in an npov fashion. the reason it is necessary is this: "due to the highly controversial and emotional nature of the topic, the main pages suffer from a great deal of ideological grandstanding, personal research, and outright vandalism by both sides, which makes high quality npov articles absolutely impossible under the current state of affairs. A number of individuals have realized that more detailed and articulated guidelines are necessary if this insanity is ever to end, and model pages can serve as sandboxes on which to develop those policies and see how they work, without being subject to the unending nonsense on the mainpages. Thanks for your consideration, and given your clearly very broad-minded outlook on the issues, I'd look forward to working with you on the project if you'd be willing. <a href="../../../u/n/g/User%7EUngtss_3d2c.html" title="User:Ungtss">Ungtss</a> 01:26, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)

Nobody disputes that <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> would be good for the Creationism pages. What is in dispute is your claims to be trying for NPOV at all. You have consistently tried to -- not just slightly but severely -- skew the articles toward what you believe at the expense of all other opinions. When you finally lost out on these changes because other editors would no longer let you get away with it, and consensus clearly and firmly showed you that your way is not acceptable, you and some like-minded people decide to do a run-around the normal process and make your own rules so you can change articles as a political action committee.

<p>Article is nothing more than a combination of original research and poor sourcing. Half of the sources are in Spanish and therefore it is impossible for many Wikipedians to verify the contents of them, and the others are of dubious credibility. This and the fact that the article is attempting to argue a point, namely that forces are at work in Venezuela to hatch a coup against Chavez, even when none of the sources explicitly state this leads me to conclude that this article is nothing more than original research.

As for this bizarre idea that sources not written in English make the article original research, an article about South America that probes events in some depth is <i>obviously</i> going to use sources in Spanish. Of course not all readers will be able to verify them, but that doesn't mean that no one can, which is a very different thing. The vast vast majority of readers of any article don't check up on the sources and don't need to, as long as someone does it there isn't a problem. And anyway, if sources have to be written in the same language as the article in order to be valid I'd be interested to know how you think the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lingala.html" title="Lingala">Lingala</a> or <a href="../../../i/n/u/Inuktitut.html" title="Inuktitut">Inuktitut</a> or <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walloon.html" title="Walloon">Walloon</a> editions of our noble project are ever going to produce comprehensive encyclopedias! ‚Äî <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> <a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">(Talk)</a> 04:42, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: "Half of the sources are in Spanish and therefore it is impossible for many Wikipedians to verify the contents of them" should <i>never</i> be an excuse for rejecting something.

<p>This is a case study in poor RC patrol.

The page was subsequently moved to Anstey (anatomy) to reflect the "new" content. Google proves that this is nonsense: anstey and perineum are never mentioned in proximity.

<p>The whole article is an elaborate explanation of why some Indian philosopher was completely non-notable. And that would make it a VfD candidate even if it wasn't smelling hoaxy. From the article: <i>His philosophies, to say the least, are considered very controversial and were never popular while he was alive. For this reason, he is not mentioned in any modern publications or web sites.</i> Riiiight. <a href="../../../r/l/_/User%7ERl_43ae.html" title="User:Rl">Rl</a> 20:39, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps you believe that it sounds hoaxy, but I can assure you that to the best of my knowledge, I am telling the truth. I added the sentence on how he is not popular because of the preface of his book (<i>Philosophy of a Man</i>), which talked about his unpopularity. The sentence about him not being mentioned is the result of a very long Google search that I did. If someone finds a page on him, then I urge them to remove the part about him not being mentioned.

<li>Retroactive, please <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cite your sources</a>. We need more references here. For example, where was this 1967 interview published. And where can we find information on <i>Philosophy of a Man</i>. <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> 21:55, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The only source I have is a very old copy of <i>Philosophy of a Man</i>. I asked my father, who had it, where it was from, and he can't remember. Many of the pages are missing from this book, including the title page, so I cannot determine which company published it. A search of the Internet, which I performed, found no relevant results as to this book and the author. This can be seen in the portion of the article where I wrote that Amit Singh did not appear on the web or in any modern publications. However, my information about the 1967 interview and the rest of the article comes from the battered copy of his book that I have. I am sorry that I cannot be of much help to others in verifying the truth of my statements apart from saying that they are true. If the lack of easily accessible information makes my article moot, then I urge you to delete it. Retroactive 22:21, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)

I can't find Amit Singh in the correct context anywhere on Google, and none of Amazon.com, the Harvard University Hollis catalog, nor the University of Toronto library catalog list either <i>Philosophy of a Man</i> or <i>Ek manus</i>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This may sound strange coming from the author of the article, but I believe it should be deleted. As many have pointed out, Singh was not at all notable, so it wouldn't make much sense to include him in a Wikipedia article. Secondly, I can't scan or photograph the book because I don't have a scanner or digital camera, so there is no way for others to verify its existence. Third of all, <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> has pointed out the lack of the book in any database on the Internet. Either the book I have contains completely false information (as it doesn't appear on any of these sites or databases) or it is not notable to that extent. Either way, it should be deleted in favor of articles with more useful content. To finish, I saw the other website of philosophy. That, to the best of my knowledge, is just a coincidence. The Singh book that I have says that he is dead, so how could he run a web page? Retroactive 04:50, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>One of the criteria for Speedy Delete is "Any page which is requested for deletion by the original author, provided the author reasonably explains that it was created by mistake, and the page was edited only by its author."

<li>I'm not sure if it would fit under the Speedy Deletion criteria, seeing as I intended to create the article. However, the comments of many posted here have caused me to doubt the legitimacy of the book. Therefore, I say that it should be deleted. Retroactive 13:52, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The subject looks real, and so do some of the editors involved. If it was about a topic I had some knowledge of, I'd definitely prefer such a bad article over having to start from a blank page. It seems to be a better start than most stubs I've seen. My main concern is that the article might be worse than just bad: wrong. And <i>that</i> would be bad indeed.

There aren't many Google hits for the term Karkarthar (56 hits) and most seem to be on Indian matrimonial or "find-a-bride" services.

<li>It seems that other people can get at least some meaningful information from this article. Why can't you? Or rather, why don't you bother trying? It's obvious that the editors are trying hard to write a meaningful article, but are having great difficulties doing so. We need to give more help to them, not cast scorn on their efforts.

<li><b>Keep</b>, but with a drastic rewrite. This is an encyclopedic topic, but many forms of Christianity have a habit of misusing the word "cult" to describe any group whose doctrine is at variance with their idea of Christianity. This definition is inherently POV, and therefore if the article is rewritten can't be used. I would suggest a stub along the lines of "Christian cults are those groups a) whose doctrine is based in some way on traditional Christian doctrine and b) are known to employ the mind-control tactics ascribed to <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cults.html" title="Cults">cults</a>. The term is also used by some Christians, particularly conservative or evangelical denominations, to describe any group whose doctrine they claim to be an aberrant or incorrect form of Christianity." I'd make the change myself, but the VfD note directs us not to make such changes. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 02:19, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>Sure you can. Constructive edits during VfD are fine. In fact the notice used to encourage them. You just shouldn't "blank, merge, or move this article" or tinker with the VfD notice itself.

<li>Then that's what I did. And in some ways, you're right -- it is a Christian-vs-Christian thing. As far as Christians defining who's a Member Of The Tribe or not, sometimes they have a point, sometimes they don't, but anyone who calls the UUs a cult is abusing the term beyond any reasonable definition of the term. Anyway, it should now be quite a bit less POV.

<li><s><b>Delete.</b></s> This is probably an accurate expression of the point of view of The Christian Apologetics and Research Ministry (CARM), but we don't have an article on them, and I don't think they are an organization so notable that their particular POV needs to be documented by WIkipedia. One <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/61/97/C0799700.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bartleby.com/61/97/C0799700.html" rel="nofollow">dictionary definition for "cult"</a> is "A religion or religious sect generally considered to be extremist or false, with its followers often living in an unconventional manner under the guidance of an authoritarian, charismatic leader." To me, and I think to most people, that obviously does not fit the <i>present-day</i> Christian Scientists, Jehovah's Witnesses, LDS Church (Mormons), practitioners of Transcendental meditation, Unitarians, or probably others on the list I'm not familiar with. So, this is a private definition of the word "cult." (Actually it strikes me as being some sort of doctrinal blacklist, a Christian-against-Christian thing. Very unpleasant). <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 02:33, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep, needs work</b> is my vote on <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a>'s version. I think the article in its present form does have serious problems. The present article is actually a (IMHO valid!) <b>POV critique</b> of the way the phrase is used by CARM and friends, and worse yet is a <i>disguised critique.</i> The present article says, in effect, Christian cult <i>ought</i> to mean thus-and-such; if it did it would include thus-and-such groups; and some unspecified Christian authorities "extend" this definition in a way that is as being overly slanted and inflammatory outside some unspecified conservative circles. So, <b>is it factual</b> that there is a well-established phrase "Christian cults" whose meaning can be deduced from the meanings of the word "Christian" and "cult," and that CARM and friends have extended that meaning? Who gets to define the phrase? Not Wikipedia; we should limit ourselves to reporting how other define it. But this is really for the article's Talk page... <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:59, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Okay, I see what you're saying, but I still defend the rewrite as the common Christian definition seems to be, by and large, a deceptive one. My experience with Christian use of the word "cult" indicates that those who do use the word in the original sense of this article don't really care about the distinction between "destructive cult" and "heresy" -- they conflate two very different (though sometimes overlapping) categories for rhetorical purposes. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 22:12, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Moon was born to parents who adhered to Confucianism until their conversion to Presbyterianism in 1930. Moon claims that in 1935 Jesus appeared to him on a mountain in Korea and told him to finish the work of establishing God‚Äôs kingdom on earth. By 1945 he had written down the precepts of his new system in the book, Divine Principles. He went to North Korea to preach and was imprisoned in 1946. In April of 1948 he was again sentenced to longer 5 year sentence in Hungnam. In 1950 he was liberated from the prison by the Americans involved in the Korean War. On May 1, 1954, in Seoul, Moon founded the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity. In 1958 he sent missionaries to Japan and in 1959 to America. Moon moved to the United States in 1971. He has been invited to the White house and spoken to Congress." <a href="http://www.carm.org/list/moonies.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.carm.org/list/moonies.htm" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></dd>

Worst of all, they did not specify the "dangers".

This is not a mere list of cracked programs, it also has the exact ZIP file name and such of the cracks themselves.

<ul>
<li>There is a nominal difference between linking directly to a piece of software which circumvents copy protection (such as DeCSS) and a text-based list of file names. There has never been a law against listing names of ZIP files, don't be absurd. ‚Äî<a href="../../../r/a/d/RaD_Man_2e7f.html" title="RaD Man"><b>RaD Man</b></a> (<i>talk</i>) 01:10, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>It seems to me that the <a href="../../../d/m/c/DMCA_bb76.html" title="DMCA">DMCA</a> could potentially be interpreted that way. I don't see a huge difference between "Click here to download the crack for WinPieStudio4.01" and "The name of the file you need to crack WinPieStudio4.01 is wps4crac.zip". Anyone smart enough to know what cracking a program is also knows how to use Google to find wps4crac.zip, so the fact that it isn't a clickable link is moot. At the very least, it's a legal grey area into which Wikipedia should not tread unless there's a clear consensus that we're to start disseminating warez cracking info (and I'd like to hear some copyright lawyers weigh in on the topic too). <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 01:56, Mar 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think Starblind has a good point about the legal issue. This is borderline illegal, including in the USA, and WP should be very careful about that (we don't list BitTorrent files either).

<li>This is not "borderline illegal". What law does this "borderline violate"? It's not illegal to make a list of robberies, or a list of money launderers, or anything else. This is no different.
