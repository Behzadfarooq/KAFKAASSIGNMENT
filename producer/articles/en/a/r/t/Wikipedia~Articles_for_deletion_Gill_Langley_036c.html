<li>That you were patrolling new articles is not the point. You shouldn't be responding so rapidly. Stubs need time to grow. And why on earth would Langley's material need to appear in peer-reviewed journals? Are we now to go around deleting all living bios of people not published in peer-reviewed journals? Please reconsider your approach to this. You're a new editor.

<li>Here's the <a href="../../../r/e/s/Research_Defence_Society_c3cb.html" title="Research Defence Society">Research Defence Society</a> discussing Langley's notability, and a recent television interview she gave: "Gill Langley is from the Dr Hadwen Trust (an anti-vivisection organisation which funds non-animal methods of research) and is also scientific adviser to the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection. She stated in a television interview last week that she was "looking forward to an open debate, but it hasn’t started yet". This is an astonishing statement from someone who gave evidence twice to the House of Lords committee, sat on the Animal Procedures Committee for eight years, and has been involved in dozens of debates, workshops, interview, reports, committees and investigations into animal research." <a href="http://www.rdsblog.info/index.php/category/Debate/P15/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rdsblog.info/index.php/category/Debate/P15/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:26, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Looks like a premature nomination. Langley gets almost 15,000 Google hits, a not inconsequential number, and she's also mentioned over 40 times in works on books.google.com. The article is significantly improved since the first stub was put up, giving ample indication of notability, and mention in many different sources. I recommmend that the initial voters re-examine their votes in light of the state of the current article. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 20:26, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>SlimVirgin did not "vote solicit", she asked me to look at the article and AfD, and told me her reasoning as to why she thought it should be kept. I looked at it, did a little research of my own (I noted, for example, that Langley has been interviewed for 1/2 hour on BBC TV as well <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/asguru/generalstudies/tvtimecodes.shtml#drugs06" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/asguru/generalstudies/tvtimecodes.shtml#drugs06" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>), and decided that the article should be kept. Is asking for third-party opinions on Wikipedia now something to be frowned upon? I have had literally hundreds of requests on my Talk: page from dozens of editors asking me to look at situations. It used to be something that was applauded. What <i>is</i> frowned upon is <a href="../../../h/a/r/Wikipedia%7EHarassment_9843.html" title="Wikipedia:Harassment">Wikipedia:Harassment</a>; I would classify watchlisting someone's Talk: page , and then using the posts there to make <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">bad faith</a> accusations regarding their actions on various articles, as falling under that policy. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 21:06, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Has she had any public recognition? Sitting on a committee doesn't confer intrinsic notability, neiother does appearing in an interview on TV. Has her work been cited anywhere? Her name comes up just three times in what are arguably the three leading British newspapers. Her book "Vegan Nutrition" has a sales rank near 500000 on Amazon.co.uk, "Animal Experimentation: The Consensus Changes" has long been out of print. What I am asking here is: would anyone outside the circle of Animal Rights activism ever have heard of Gill? I'd say no.

<dd><i>The Scientist</i> doesn't exactly command great respect. In <i>Nature</i> (the leading British science journal) Gill is mentioned twice (as spokeswoman for the Hadwen Trust), saying that not enough is being done to replace animal testing. I see no evidence (in <i>Nature</i> again) that her report has been cited anywhere. The "Union for the Abolition of Vivisection" on the other hand is mentioned often. I'm a bit reminded of the <a href="../../../l/u/m/Lumber_Cartel_bb26.html" title="Lumber Cartel">Lumber Cartel</a>. It's a running joke amongst antispam activists - I certainly have heard of it - but outside that narrow circle the joke is unknown, and I'm not convinced that that particular meme needs its entry on Wikipedia.

<dd>Sorry, I mistyped: <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Scientist_4920.html" title="New Scientist">New Scientist</a>. If you mean her recent report, it has only just been published, so people will need time to respond to it in full. When you say getting noticed for giving testimony, I'm not sure what you mean. I'm very confused by this, because there are so many (possibly hundreds of thousands) of articles about people and issues less notable, and less well referenced, than this one. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:57, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The editorial part of <i>Nature</i> commands great respect amoungst scientists as a reliable source for news on science and science policy, especially European issues. I've said it already: what I doubt is the assertion that Gill is "highly regarded by all sides of the debate" as she is mentioned in <i>Nature</i> merely twice, and only as a spokesperson for an organization. Also note that unlike <i>Nature</i>, the <i>New Scientist</i> is a popular journal. Until we see the "Next of Kin" report mentioned in notable journals we must assume that the publication went unnoticed. Remember that Wikipedia isn't a vehicle to advance worthy causes, it is a record of notable causes. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zak_7805.html" title="User:Dr Zak">Dr Zak</a> 00:29, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think you and the nominator have misunderstood this article and, with respect, Wikipedia. This is not an article about an eminent scientist <i>qua</i> research scientist who is writing in peer-reviewed journals and working for a university. This is an article about a zoologist and writer, who has become an expert in an unusual field (where peer-reviewed articles are rarely, if ever, written), and who has succeeded in gaining respect from all sides of the debate, which is exceedingly rare in this area. However, I think the article speaks for itself, so I won't say any more about it, except that I'm somewhat bewildered, and very disappointed in certain people on this page. I have never viewed myself as an inclusionist, but if this is what deletionism causes, then I may indeed have to cross the floor. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 01:22, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

Anything important in animal testing would be reported there; it's such an important issue that affects so many scientist.

I came across this because I've been arguing (politely, of course) with the author elsewhere and looked up her contributions, and the individual is clearly notable. I'd suggest those who voted to delete before she had the chance to weigh in be asked to reconsider given her response and the article today. <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Musing_a114.html" title="User:A Musing">Sam</a> 21:45, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Editors will be interested in reading the talk page of the article that clearly breaches <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. My factual addition 'The Next of Kin report into what is a contentious subject has, however, not yet been peer reviewed nor subject to critical analysis' has been reverted. Let me be clear; yes I am a scientist but no I have no strong position on animal rights. Despite accusations against me, and adolescent jokes, I base my case on the facts not personalities. This article is pivotal. This is an article for a lobbying body that has a clear (though obviously legitimate) agenda. For such an article to have merit it most certainly requires peer review to establish its neutrality and scientific merit (on which I express no view). Dr Langley is obviously well established in committee circles but what is needed is evidence as to what she has actually done e.g. peer reviewed papers, academic positions attained (e.g. professor not research fellow), generating new knowledge etc. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 21:49, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - my edit has been reverted again without any talk page discussion. I am not prepared to engage in a fruitless edit war so I have simply put an npov tag on the page. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 22:09, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I'm going to place myself firmly in the "this is bizarre" camp. Something truly odd is going on here. This article could serve as a template for how to create new articles and what topics they can cover. And not peer-reviewed? Ummm... I think maybe a foreword by <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jane_Goodall_49a7.html" title="Jane Goodall">Jane Goodall</a> would constitute a peer review, perhaps the best review on the face of the planet. Yeesh. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIronDuke_6228.html" title="User:IronDuke"><font color="green">IronDuke</font></a> 03:09, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> as per IronDuke and others. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerovingian_a210.html" title="User:Merovingian">M</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green"><b>e</b></font></a><a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerovingian_a210.html" title="User:Merovingian">rovingian</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/r/User_talk%7EMerovingian_28b5.html" title="User talk:Merovingian">T</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Merovingian_5415.html" title="Special:Contributions/Merovingian">C</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Merovingian_82cb.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Merovingian">@</a>) 08:05, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> per IronDuke. This is rather strange. She appears to be a notable activist, add to that the unusual factor that she's a former animal researcher, and she's easily notable enough for a WP article. If we delete this we'd probably have to delete 2/3 of the bios in WP. Wrote an important report for an important activist group which was cited in New Scientist, was interviewed by the BBC... there's <i>plenty</i> here to call her notable enough for a WP article. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 19:41, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> per SlimVirgin and IronDuke. The article has been fleshed out from its stub state and there are many items in the article that would make her notable in the world of Animal Rights Activism. As a whole that category needs a little more attention (especially from a POV slant) and this article is a quality example of a NPOV bio in that category. It would be a shame to lose. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne27</a> 15:01, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
