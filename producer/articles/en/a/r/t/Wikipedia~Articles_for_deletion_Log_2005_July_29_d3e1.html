<li>Borderline, but leaning delete at present: "Attendant fame" is one of the things we don't measure (being the kid or ex-lover of a celebrity doesn't make you a celebrity). If the fellow is so substantial, and I'm sure he is, he must have actually <i>argued some significant cases</i> or won some substantial claims. These would make him worthy of a biographical stub, IMO.

<li><b>Keep</b> valuable resource started by contributor with a long history of developing significant articles. Wikipedia has enormous numbers of lists (and a glossary is a list with a more specialized name and function) that organize information in ways that other articles do not. History of Japan is too long and organized by period. <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 01:58, July 29, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - I am not sure why this fails to work. While I am afraid that it might get too long in the future, we still have to see this for a while.

<p>This is unencyclopedic, poorly titled, and conjectural, not to mention bald-faced vanity. If this information belongs on Wikipedia at all, it should be integrated into the <a href="../../../s/e/t/SETI_0570.html" title="SETI">SETI</a> article. <a href="../../../b/i/n/User%7EBinadot_5292.html" title="User:Binadot">Binadot</a> 02:17, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Okay, this is clearly a case of inept academic vanity. The author of this page is User:24.44.208.18, who appears to be the same as <a href="../../../c/n/m/User%7ECnmirose_3392.html" title="User:Cnmirose">User:Cnmirose</a>. Cnmirose openly admits to being <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Rose_661a.html" title="Christopher Rose">Christopher Rose</a> (yeah, he created an article about himself in the Wikipedia namespace), a (non-notable) professor who wrote a (non-notable) article entitled "ET Might Write, Not Radiate", which is the subject of the article in question. When I placed a VFD notice on the article, he removed it, commenting "DO NOT delete". He doesn't seem to understand our policy on vanity. You'd think a professor would know better. <a href="../../../b/i/n/User%7EBinadot_5292.html" title="User:Binadot">Binadot</a> 02:37, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I guess I do not understand Wiki conventions. I created the entries (for myself and Gregory Wright) on the (mistaken?) assumption that links to authors was reasonable (see, for instance, the link to <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Freitas_7fc8.html" title="Robert Freitas">Robert Freitas</a> which appears in the <a href="../../../s/e/t/SETI_0570.html" title="SETI">SETI</a> article where my original edits were inserted). However, I agree that the entry was certainly "non-encyclopedic." And though the "(non-notable) professor" comment is certainly true,&#160;:) I must admit I'm a bit confused about the "(non notable) paper" comment -- the work appeared on the cover of <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nature_Magazine_3180.html" title="Nature Magazine">Nature Magazine</a>. Regardless, thank you for the education, though I must say Binadot's tone seems a tad strident (I did not realize that someone else had put up a request for deletion -- I thought *I* had mistakenly tried to delete the wrong entry -- so there was no intention to subvert the wiki process). Cheers -- Chris Rose <a href="../../../c/n/m/User%7ECnmirose_3392.html" title="User:Cnmirose">Chris</a> 03:45, 29 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Merely because an article has been in a notable publication doesn't mean that the article itself is inherently notable. The <i>contents</i> may be notable, and I think in this case they <i>are</i>, but they don't require a separate article. I'd dump the contents into <a href="../../../s/e/t/SETI_0570.html" title="SETI">SETI</a>, perhaps into a new subsection. Sorry to come down on you so hard, but we have a strong policy on vanity, for obvious reasons. If a topic is notable, we'd prefer it to be documented by an impartial third party. I would have been more relaxed about things if the VFD notice hadn't been removed, and if I hadn't discovered the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Rose_661a.html" title="Christopher Rose">Christopher Rose</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_Wright_61ee.html" title="Gregory Wright">Gregory Wright</a> articles. <a href="../../../b/i/n/User%7EBinadot_5292.html" title="User:Binadot">Binadot</a> 03:48, 29 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Thanks -- consider me educated&#160;:) Is there a way to <b>expedite the removal of the three pages <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Rose_661a.html" title="Christopher Rose">Christopher Rose</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_Wright_61ee.html" title="Gregory Wright">Gregory Wright</a> and ET Might Write, Not Radiate</b> (as well as the misspelled version which caused me to mistakenly delete your vfd ET Might Wright, Not Radiate -- if I had a dime for every time I've done that mispelling, I could probably buy myself coffee for a week&#160;:) ). I *AM* the sole author, I've removed the links in the SETI article I edited, and I now understand that such entries cannot be taken lightly. So I'm all for an expedited removal schedule. Also, since you seem knowledgeable about wiki-matters, if you could take a peek at my additions in the "Probe" section -- just search <a href="../../../s/e/t/SETI_0570.html" title="SETI">SETI</a> for my name -- and advise, that would be really helpful. I also have a question -- how do entries like <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Freitas_7fc8.html" title="Robert Freitas">Robert Freitas</a> get posted/written? Let's just say that the notability quotient you implicitly cite is not high for that page.&#160;:) However, I have no objection to it since for someone looking for work in the area, his stuff is useful. Hence, if such pages for Greg and me would be helpful to folks, it would be useful to know how to get them written. Of course, cites to our home pages in the SETI article at appropriate places would probably be just as good or better.

<li>Well, it is expandable, but only if someone from Rochester with a bit of knowledge of this place happens to stumble over your article. "The Little" by name in Rochester will be instantly recognized by anyone in the area (and by not a few people in Hollywood in the art cinema circuit). Considering the original wikipedian's entry for the stub with the clues "now an art house multiplex" (The Little has 9 screens now if memory serves), "oldest active movie theaters" (The Little was founded in 1928, cinema houses don't get much older than that, or last this long), and "built specifically to show films" (which The Little was) it seems clear he meant The Little in Rochester. I know of no other cinemas that match all of those credentials. I've gone ahead and updated the entry to a more appropriate stub with a bit of information, some basic history, and some links (and all of this material is my own writing, no worries about copyright). Give it a go-over and decide if you still want to vote it for deletion. Also, this is my first Wikipedia entry, so check and let me know if I'm breaking any etiquette. I would also be willing to bet that if asked, the management at The Little would consent to a direct import of their history from their website into this article. Do check out the history link, it's quite interesting. EvilNight 17:18, 4 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Touched up the language a bit. Also, the Little Theatre was mentioned twice by name in the article for <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rochester%2C_NY_2a51.html" title="Rochester, NY">Rochester, NY</a>, so I changed the names to internal links pointing to this article.

<li><b>Comment</b> I guess I do not understand Wiki conventions. I created the entries (for myself and Gregory Wright) on the (mistaken?) assumption that links to authors was reasonable (see, for instance, the link to <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Freitas_7fc8.html" title="Robert Freitas">Robert Freitas</a> which appears in the <a href="../../../s/e/t/SETI_0570.html" title="SETI">SETI</a> article where my original edits were inserted). However, I agree that the entry was certainly "non-encyclopedic." And though the "(non-notable) professor" comment is certainly true,&#160;:) I must admit I'm a bit confused about the "(non notable) paper" comment -- the work appeared on the cover of <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nature_Magazine_3180.html" title="Nature Magazine">Nature Magazine</a>. Regardless, thank you for the education, though I must say your tone seems a tad strident (I did not realize that someone else had put up a request for deletion -- I thought *I* had mistakely tried to delete the wrong entry -- so there was no intention to subvert the wiki process).

<li>I would certainly agree that many athletes deserve articles, such as Joe Namath, Brett Favre, O.J. Simpson, Dan Warner, Larry "Bird" Johnson, Joe DiMaggio, Sidd Finch, etc. I just don't agree that every pro player in history from every major sport belongs in the encyclopedia -- that will inevitably result in thousands and thousands of articles on people almost no one has ever heard of.

<p><b>I vote myself for deletion!</b></p>
<ul>
<li>My friend Ben, whose been helping me with the site, left me an odd notice today: the Wikipedia article on "WikiDating" is being deleted. I am flattered someone thought it was worth mentioning, but it still is very new, and when 1.5 MediaWiki stablizes, I plan to upgrade &amp; haven't decided yet if its worth borging in a bunch of age code vs. just asking people to be honest: and of course, there's still the issue of deletions there and the like. Right now, its still very much an experiment &amp; the best support I could ask would be word-of-mouth: instead of provoking the pro-deletion factions I've been made aware of that defend this site. This didn't need to be added to their list: maybe in a few years, if I still run it, it'll be "worthy" of even their support to mention here.</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b>. There was no consensus to delete or to transwiki. A couple of votes were discounted because the editors are either too new or have too few article edits. I expect at least one month and 100 edits total at the time of voting, with a decent proportion of those being article edits. angrydruid had only three edits in all, Firefox made his first edit a day or two before voting here. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 15:08, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

Whereas that article is clearly useful in its discussion and listing of the standard 5 XML and 252 HTML/XHTML <a href="../../../c/h/a/Character_entity_reference.html" title="Character entity reference">character entity references</a>, this new article merely contains the first 10 thousand <a href="../../../n/u/m/Numeric_character_reference.html" title="Numeric character reference">numeric character references</a> out of a potential 1.1 million. Nearly any <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Character_Set_b9f5.html" title="Universal Character Set">Universal Character Set</a> code point, aside from an unassigned or otherwise disallowed handful, can be referenced in this way.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no need for this kind of list,</li>
<li>its cutoff is arbitrary,</li>
<li>its formatting is poor and makes no use of existing character table templates and formats (see ongoing discussion in <a href="../../../i/s/o/Talk%7EISO_8859-1_e47b.html#Character_table_format" title="Talk:ISO 8859-1">Talk:ISO 8859-1#Character table format</a>),</li>
<li>its length is too great,</li>

<li>and most importantly, there were similar "Table of Unicode characters" articles (with similar charts and arbitrary cutoffs) that existed up until a month or two ago, but have since been deleted. See <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Various_Unicode-related_pages_265c.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Various Unicode-related pages">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Various Unicode-related pages</a>. — <a href="../../../m/j/b/User%7EMjb_eccd.html" title="User:Mjb">mjb</a> 07:50, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>transwiki to WS</b>. <u><b>The precedent is NOT delete</b></u> (<b><a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Various_Unicode-related_pages_265c.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Various Unicode-related pages">RTFVFD</a></b>). Its cutoff is <b>not arbitrary</b>. I checked the next few thousand, and none of them appear to have been used yet. In any case, where in the article is it suggested that the list is complete? Poor formatting is no reason to delete an article, it's a reason to post a cleanup tag at most. You delete an article based on content, not formatting. Claiming there is no need for it is also not a valid complaint, since your opinion of a need is subjective. The fact that such lists already exist on the internet, and even on Wikipedia as you have pointed out, indicate a need for the list. What do you mean noone can render the characters in it? If you can see the characters in your browser, you can render them (so already we've found one use for the list). Another invalid complaint. Also, the <b>precedent is NOT delete</b> but to keep or transwiki. In any case, following precedent is only an excuse to be lazy, when other possible suggestions, such as splitting the article, would also work, but require minimal brain power. Claiming that the growth of the list is a bad thing is invalid as well, since <b><a href="../../../w/w/p/WP%7EWWPIN_7fe4.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_paper_encyclopedia" title="WP:WWPIN">Wikipedia is not paper</a></b>. Claiming that the XML/HTML article is useful whereas this is not is also invalid, since this article simply requires expansion of content, so you should put in a request for expansion, or more easily <b>wait a while</b> (the article just started!).&#160;:) &#160;<span class="plainlinks"><small><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><font color="#000000"><b>BRIAN</b></font></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="#555555">0918</font></a></small>&#160; 21:27, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</span>

<li><span class="plainlinks">Note that the comment above is by the person who created/generated the article in question. Re: formatting, inconsequential cosmetic details are not the issue; rather, it is the content. A numeric character reference is not necessarily going to correspond to a renderable glyph (even with an extremely capable browser and all fonts), because not all characters are 'graphic', and some are only usable in combination. That is, while it is reasonable to say "<code>&amp;#169;</code> is <code>©</code>", it is not reasonable to say "<code>&amp;#65530;</code> is …<i>some replacement glyph for unrenderable 'interlinear annotation separator' character</i>", so the purpose of the table is in question. What exactly is it trying to show? Also, the nature of the numeric character references is such that they are really just another set of labels for UCS code points, just like the 'U+' notation. If there is no consensus on the value of a table that has nothing but code points (listed in U+, decimal, or hexadecimal) and browser-dependent glyph-rendering attempts, regardless of how the table is split up, then the value of a table that differs only by virtue of prefixing each code point with "<code>&amp;#</code>" and following it with "<code>;</code>" is equally dubious. In other words, the new table is nothing more than a minor cosmetic reformatting of the deleted/Wikisourced articles, which were not-very-well-thought-out attempts to automatically generate information found in ISO/IEC 10646 and <i>The Unicode Standard</i>. If they don't belong on Wikipedia, then this one doesn't, either. I suggest following up on the discussion in <a href="../../../i/s/o/Talk%7EISO_8859-1_e47b.html" title="Talk:ISO 8859-1">Talk:ISO 8859-1</a> where various ideas for where and how to best present character info in general are being floated. — <a href="../../../m/j/b/User%7EMjb_eccd.html" title="User:Mjb">mjb</a> 22:30, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</span>

<p><b>Vote: Keep</b>: It's a very interesting product that appears to be genuine and in production/development. The article is discussing a new technology that could benefit a lot of computer users, thus it has encyclopediac integrity and merit. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardbooth_bdaa.html" title="User:Richardbooth">Richardbooth</a> 01:12, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Advertisement</b>. The article is nothing but an ad for a product that doesn't even exist yet. As for the novelty value of the described product, keyboards with programmable LCD keytops were already available many (15?) years ago. <a href="../../../n/a/d/User%7ENaddy_8480.html" title="User:Naddy">Naddy</a> 11:41, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Vote: keep</b>.</p>
<p>Artemy Lebedev studio may have not well been known outside of Russia, but it is a very solid manufacturer. I genuinely do not believe that the studio would publish an article on something they did not actually work on. I think the "vaporware" claims, at least as far as accusations of publicity frauds, are not justified.</p>
<p>As for the argument that it is a prototype, I have seen hundreds of entries in Wikipedia about concept ideas by other companies, including car manufacturers like GM or Ford, or not-yet-released software, including those who already HAVE proved themselves vaporware (ahem <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_Nukem_Forever_0d65.html" title="Duke Nukem Forever">Duke Nukem Forever</a>. Why don't we go and delete that?</p>
<p>I think the article should be given a chance. It perhaps should be modified, more directly emphasizing the fact that no physical keyboard exists, and/or warn about dangers of vaporware. But simply deleting an interesting article about an informative concept design is displaying bias and triggerhappyness. (<a href="../../../e/l/v/User%7EElvarg_4b5f.html" title="User:Elvarg">Elvarg</a> 18:38, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Vote: delete</b>. It is only an artist's concept, and only vaporware. It should not be even mentioned as a 'product' or 'prototype', because it does not exist in physical form. If it is kept, it should be in a "Future Keyboard Artist's Concepts" section.</p>
<p><b>Vote: keep</b>. This product very innovative, good idea, and current "event". Maybe vaporvare, but I don't think so.</p>
<p><b>Vote: keep</b>: If it is in advertising style, let's change it. It's an interesting idea (albeit not entirely new), and the article gave useful information (for example: I didn't realise the pictures were cg renderings). The article on <a href="../../../c/o/c/Coca-cola.html" title="Coca-cola">coca-cola</a> isn't considered an advert, and other future devices exist on WP, so lets keep this interesting technology page, albeit tweaked a little for encyc. style. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMat-C_07e7.html" title="User:Mat-C">Mat-C</a> 11:45, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Vote: keep</b>: This is arguably an advertisement, but could easily be edited to broaden its scope. The advertisement is continued in a number of places on Wikipedia, including two mentions to itself on the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_keyboard.html" title="Computer keyboard">Computer Keyboard</a> page (an image <i>and</i> a link at the bottom), so these should perhaps be removed.

<p><b>Vote: Delete</b>: What is the point of this article? It doesn't seem apropriate to have an article about a single product (not a broader technology) that doesn't exist yet, and therefore has not historical or cultural importance. While I agree that this could be of technological interest, if that is the point of this article, then a broader article about the technology itself, not an individual product would be the right way to go.</p>

<p>or maybe it’s two different users living in the same geographical location, heck the geographical location that tUIASE is based out of, which is (if must know) the city of Gold Coast. (yes we really are a Hoax and want to corrupt the world, over throw the US government, steal some nukes and hold the world hostage, and that is sarcasm for those who are a stranger to it) sorry if you have not heard of us. We clearly must not exist if you don’t know about us, because you are so all knowing and worldly that you know everyone and everything that exists in this world. Heck you “know” that if two IP addresses look the similar they must be exactly the same, just like how the countries Australia and Austria look the same and are therefore the same place. IP that look similar could not possibly from the same city and it’s totally illogical that a organization that based a given location would have it members living close by. Clearly IP from the same ISP must be from the same person, because only have one customer and that is how to survive the cut throat world of capitalism. 34 million users of AOL is really the one person, either the other 33,999,999 users are an arbitrary statistics or its just the same person signed up to several accounts take your pick since you dictate how the world is run. You are all commanding that if you say it’s not notable then it be, its impossible for be ignorant of anything. Why don’t you run the CIA they could really use some of your knowledge. <small>(Unsigned comment by 60.226.145.51 (<a href="../../../6/0/2E/User_talk%7E60.226.145.51.html" title="User talk:60.226.145.51">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_60.226.145.51_8191.html" title="Special:Contributions/60.226.145.51">contribs</a>), only edits involve this article)</small></p>

<dd>For fear of getting into a conversation I'm not particularly interested in, I didn't state that the two were the same, I expressed the possibility. I stated that they were likely to be the same ISP, which I stand by (which would indicate a physical proximity although in the case of major ISP's like AOL, this is not always the case). Neither has anyone stated that you are "for fact" a hoax. The matter that your organisation is not notable enough to warrant a page of the encyclopedia. A simple google search or a quick reference to othe encyclopedias gives good grounds for that comment. If you are of another opinion and feel that the organisation is of sufficent notariety, please feel free to post links to references on the Talk:The United Intellectual Ambassadors for the Southern End, tUIASE - <a href="../../../u/s/r/User%7EUsrnme_h8er_fa7c.html" title="User:Usrnme h8er">Usrnme h8er</a> 15:32, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>So tell me. What's this confirmed information doing in it's own article titled "Prior Speculation"?

<li><b>Merge</b> with the main article on the book. The bits of information about what Rowling officially released on her web site or said during conventions are fact, not speculation, and I find it interesting to compare these bits of information against what was finally in the book. - <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_Kendig_b38d.html" title="User:Brian Kendig">Brian Kendig</a> 01:17, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> (obviously). I'd have moved it to somewhere else instead of "prior speculation", except what would you call it? "Prior revelations"? "prior hints"? Just because "speculation" has evil scary anti-wiki connotations doesn't mean it shouldn't be used where it is appropriate, and seeing as it survived VfD, I don't see how the new title suddenly makes it turn nonencyclopedic in a puff of magic smoke. I mean, could I have in theory completely reversed the original decision into a consensus to delete had I renamed it Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (List of Original Vain Fancrufty Speculative Research Links)? Wicked awesome, I'll keep that trick in mind next time I want to get rid of a page. --<a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAceMyth_ce06.html" title="User:AceMyth">AceMyth</a> 04:57, July 31, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. I believe that it is a good article to keep, but even if I didn't, it's still been kept by a previous VfD, and that verdict should hold. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315"><font color="red">ral</font></a><a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315"><font color="green">315</font></a> 20:54, August 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge the important bits and delete</b>. I agree that the material here is interesting and relevant for showing, say twenty years from now, some history of this book's impact on Harry Potter fans (and a witness to how strong a hold the book series had on some). It should first be put as it is in the main article (so that people can use the history to see that revision when this article is deleted). Immediately after, a revision should be made so that the main article contains a section of a few paragraphs concerning the speculation the book generated. — <a href="../../../o/l/a/User%7EOlathe_6582.html" title="User:Olathe">Olathe</a> 06:33, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The Harry Potter phenomenon has become so large these days that it is fascinating to look at the amount of spin-off it generates- including predictions, hoax 'insider' info etc. Predictions were a very real part of life in the run-up to to the book and as such deserve to be immortalised. 192.250.97.6 10:02, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Dual Ignition Keep</b> - honestly, what is with all this nonsense about types of 'keep' or 'delete'? Aside from that, I really do think this page should be kept.

<dd>I have just taken my own advice and browsed some pages regarding the deletion process. Turns out that "Merge", "Redirect" etc. are actually considered variants of "Keep" (though obviously if there is a reasonable amount of calls to Merge, Redirect, Rename or any such action the admin might decide it to constitute a rough consensus and the result will differ accordingly). I can see the logic behind this in the sense that somebody voting to merge, if the vote depended on them, would probably rather have the content stay at its own page than deleted altogether. Of course many voters are aware that their votes are subject to interpretation and therefore clarify their priorities (e.g. a merge vote of the sort you described would be something to the extent of "<b>Merge</b>, failing that <b>Delete</b>.") --<a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAceMyth_ce06.html" title="User:AceMyth">AceMyth</a> 13:41, July 31, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well with this one I think any delete votes should be ignored as this should not have been allowed to be Vfd'ed again after only 2 days.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b> (no consensus).

<p>This list is unmaintainable. Currently has little actual content. I also assume that the user means <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_games.html" title="Video games">video games</a>, but that's not obvious from the title.

<li><b>Keep</b> for now: Maybe if it was a list that had languished in obscurity for months, but not a nominee eight minutes after creation. There might be some worthwhile variation of this, maybe List of commercial computer and video games released for free which would contain some very notable entries (America's Army, Tribes 1 and 2, and GTA 1 and 2 off the top of my head). <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENifboy_11a5.html" title="User:Nifboy">Nifboy</a> 23:11, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Unless the mandate of this list is declared up front I can't see the reason to keep it. It is currently poorly defined; in fact the addition of chess, draughts, etc. makes the list far more confused. Presumably there are any number of games that are not protected by copyright, if that's what is meant by "public domain", and the list is therefore unmaintainable. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlowerparty_4b7e.html" title="User:Flowerparty">Flowerparty</a> <sup><a href="../../../f/l/o/User_talk%7EFlowerparty_6764.html" title="User talk:Flowerparty">talk</a></sup> 23:56, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Page is about a non-existent subject. Following the IMDB link leads to an entry where the subject appears only as character not an actor. I believe the other telly programmes mentioned to be fictitous too. Also check out this story on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/offtheball/illinformer/?2005/05/16" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/offtheball/illinformer/?2005/05/16" rel="nofollow">BBC Radio Scotland</a> which throws more doubt.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bob Flaps certainly is a character in "The Big Tease" (1999) but I can't find any references to any of the details of his television career or sad demise. A hoax I think. <b>delete</b> The BBC Radio Scotland link above ties him to Iron Balls McGinty, and the two pages have a remarkably similar initial history. As Mr. Ginty, a man of legendarily steely body parts, is also a character from a movie, "The Jerk" (1979), maybe he should be VfD as well? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliggy_825f.html" title="User:Sliggy">Sliggy</a> 17:40, July 29, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It would be an awkward merge vote, seeing as it would have to merge with at least four articles (persecution of Jews, Christians, pagans, and <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_and_other_religions.html" title="Islam and other religions">Islam and other religions</a>), don't you think? I would be in favor of making this a dab with links to the various articles, but as for the content of it, I don't know how much needs to be merged with said articles, since the stated topic of the article is <i>historical persecution</i>, and the other mentioned articles don't seem to be exceptionally lacking in that regard.--<a href="../../../d/n/i/User%7EDNicholls_483e.html" title="User:DNicholls">DNicholls</a> 23:40, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_persecution_by_Christians_a939.html" title="Historical persecution by Christians">Historical persecution by Christians</a> was a consensus keep, so the VFD couldn't be reopened for at least 6 months. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 08:23, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'd also like to know why this was nominated so soon after the closing of the previous VfD.

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, because nothing substantial has happened in the, oh, 24 hours since this was last discussed. Let it sit for a month, and you still think it doesn't deserve an article, then re-nominate it. In the meantime, why not work to eliminate the POV with brilliant prose?

<li><b>Keep</b>. "Persecution by" makes as much sense as "persecution of," and the two can coexist well. Obviously, should be limited to religious persecution. POV problems, which this article will obviously attract, can be worked out in the normal fashion. Aside from this, however, it's simply foolish to renominate so quickly -- the implication is that the nominator is not trying to resolve the issue through discussion, but to keep voting until the desired result emerges, whether by a lenient closing admin, a few of the previous keep voters being on vacation this week, or what have you. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherparham_ee3b.html" title="User:Christopherparham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopherparham_f0e0.html" title="User talk:Christopherparham">(talk)</a> 05:00, 2005 July 30 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, agreed there is no policy on it. Perhaps a non-policy page about the phrase might be appropriate (the search kept sending me to <a href="../../../o/n/_/On_Liberty_7773.html" title="On Liberty">On Liberty</a> by JS Mill), but as a policy page this definitely is not appropriate. Dot six has had plenty of opportunities to make his minority views known, and to write them as parts of existing articles reflecting alternative viewpoints to the mainstream in those articles. Instead he/she has generally attempted to REMOVE viewpoints other than his own, leaving no discussion.

<li>Must <b>keep,</b> there is no alternative, if Wikipedia is to be true to it's basic principles consistently throughout. As I understand it, a basic Wikipedia principle is that dispute resolution concerning content is not telling the other side anything like, "You are outnumbered here, and the majority rules, so get lost" it is principled <a href="../../../n/e/g/Wikipedia%7ENegotiation_07d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Negotiation">negotiation</a>, aka consensus decision making (find a solution which meets the legitimate interests of <b>both</b> sides). As this principle is explained by <a href="../../../n/e/g/Wikipedia%7ENegotiation_07d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Negotiation">Wikipedia</a>, quote, "Principled Negotiation is a cooperative process whereby participants try to find a solution which meets the legitimate interests of both parties, which in the context of Wikipedia usually involves appropriate mention of all points of view in an article thus improving the quality of the article. Compromising or 'splitting the difference' is generally inappropriate if it means departure from generally recognized points of view, both of which need to be included to achieve <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>. --<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User%7E67.182.157.6.html" title="User:67.182.157.6">67.182.157.6</a> 02:42, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>That makes the ad hominem personal attack comments of Rhobite, Asbestos, WhiteC, et al above totally inappropriate here, and each of those writers should take it upon himself to edit them out, if they are principled individuals interested in honoring Wikipedia policy. The policy is <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">comment on CONTENT, not on the contributor</a>.</p>
<p>Such comments about the contributor are in the nature of poisoning the well.</p>
<p>This sort of "reasoning" involves trying to discredit what a person writes by presenting unfavorable information (be it true or false) about the person. This "argument" has the following form:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unfavorable information (be it true or false) about person A is presented.</li>
<li>Therefore ANYTHING person A writes or has written is suspect, and should be deleted, even if the thing written quotes Wikipedia policy, and serves as a reasonable <a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpansion_fc03.html" title="Template:Expansion">expansion</a> of that policy.</li>
</ol>
<p>This sort of "reasoning" is obviously fallacious. The person making such an attack is hoping that the unfavorable information will bias listeners against the person in question and hence that they will reject anything he or she writes or has written. However, merely presenting unfavorable information about a person (even if it is true) hardly counts as valid argument against any statements he or she might make. So, Poisoning the Well, a form of argument ad Homimem, is reasonably summarily dismissed as <a href="../../../i/n/f/Informal_logic.html" title="Informal logic">logical fallacy</a>. --172.192.207.229 20:01, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>DotSix, I purposely did not mention that you were involved in an RfC. That said, I did think it necessary to mention your exploits at <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, as it provides background for the reasoning behind this page you created. Although we have an important principle on Wikipedia to assume good faith, a user's intentions cannot be ignored. If this were created by someone who had already made many good contributions to the encyclopedia, I'd give them the benefit of the doubt for a while and see what they were going to do with the page (though, if they left it in the state this one is in, I'd either recommend they did something positive with it or I'd propose it for VfD anyway — I don't have double-standards). In this case, however, it is clear, from my point of view, that this page was not created in good faith but rather was created as a rhetorical device for your arguments on Truth-related pages and the RfC. Also, as an aside, you keep quoting <a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers</a> as a shield behind which you can protect yourself from criticism.

Since we're not an advanced enough species to have invented that gun yet. Also, please note that I've been around since March 2004, made thousands of contributions, and accordingly this vote can't be written off as that of anyone's sock puppet. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristofurio_ba82.html" title="User:Christofurio">Christofurio</a> 23:29, August 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Okay, fine. Though I disagree that the arguments here are ad hominem, here is a further justification of my delete vote. This article has two parts:
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>A description of Tyranny of the Majority and its relation to Wikipedia policies</li>
<li>A commentary on another Wikipedia policy (here the NPOV rule)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The first is invalid here because any information on applying Tyranny of the Majority ideas should be in the policy section that it covers (for example, don't talk about the VfD policy, rather, add this to it). However, you are unable to do so because others do not agree with your assessment. Also, because "Tyranny of the Majority" is not a Wikipedia policy, is not meant to be a policy, and is in fact intended as a contrast to an existing policy, it does not deserve its own page, especially not in the Wikipedia namespace.</li>
<li>The second is invalid here because it is a POV commentary, and therefore belongs on the Talk page of the relevant policy, in this case the NPOV, in an attempt to change such a policy. However, you are again unable to do this, because the people on said page are unwilling to agree with you for one reason or another.</li>
<li>If you wish to have an article discussing your interpretation, you are welcome to put it in your user space. you can direct people there as an explanation of your beliefs. But it is undeserving of its own article. There you go. Not at all ad hominem.

<p>At first glance, it seems like this is a real organization, but on further examination, it is pure vanity/soapbox/original research. Please see talk page for details. The user that created this page (<a href="../../../m/p/l/User%7EMPLX_3a0d.html" title="User:MPLX">MPLX</a>) also created other extremely questionable pages, including: John Lilburne Research Institute and Province of the Carolanas, and is responsible for inserting original research produced by this "Federation" in several articles, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hugo_Black&amp;oldid=12075203" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hugo_Black&amp;oldid=12075203" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> (see "Influence of John Lilburne" section, which has since been deleted). --<a href="../../../j/w/1/User%7EJW1805_0d7f.html" title="User:JW1805">JW1805</a> 19:51, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I (MPLX) left Wikipedia some months ago after running into the onslaught of the ill-informed Christian right wing. Although I am not monitoring Wikipedia and do not have any intention of rejoining Wikipedia due to the small cabal of noisy and ill-informed (as opposed to uninformed) people who love deleting stuff, I have been pressed to add this comment due to the sudden interest in deleting a few of the articles that I contributed to. (I have written about many topics.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It would appear that someone has it their head to sever any ties between John Lilburne and the foundation of American law. This led to a constant barrage of negative comments on the Hugo Black article. Now I see that the idea is to claim that "Carolana" is a misspelling of "Carolina" and to go further and claim that the article about Carolana is a hoax. To this end both Dr. Kenneth Brown of the University of Houston and Dr. Eric Gilder of the University of Sibiu have also been smeared as being not noteworthy and at worst as the creators of vanity and even hoax articles. Such rants by the few lunatics who have gained a noisy control over Wikipedia are one reason why I left Wikipedia and why Wikipedia is in danger of becoming the refuge of right-wing idiots.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It would seem that a handful of people are trolling with the intent to delete anything that they may disagree with. I noticed the same approach was used on the subject of copyright law within articles dealing with the subject of recorded music and broadcasting which I also contributed to. Now I see that all broadcasts by 4FWS have been tagged as not worthy because they were on "pirate" radio stations - even though several were on licensed stations. However, everything is being smeared and tarnished to make it appear that everything and anything that I contributed to was either a hoax, a work of vanity or unnoteworthy. I also created the history of the development of the jet fighter, but I have not as yet (and probably won't bother) checked to see if those entries are also being targeted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is unfortunate to say the least because I thought that Wikipedia had merit, but when I discovered that a mere handful of dedicated zealots could take it over and put their own stamp of ideological approval on it - I left.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Before making more claims that Carolana never existed I would suggest that you perform a little serious research. Unfortunately the zealots have decided that they are a jack of all subjects (and master of none), and because they have never heard something before it means that the subject is either a hoax or a vanity creation by someone else. How pathetic for Wikipedia!</dd>

Your repeated comments "I don't like to see Wikipedia used to disseminate fraudulent information (Province of the Carolanas)" reveals some sort of malicious intent that you harbor towards this subject in particular. Your quotations are all faked - made up - fraudulent - your comments about the Province of the Carolanas are absurd (since it well documented within the British Museum and UK Board of Trade collections, as well as numerous university libraries.) I would suggest that before jumping up and down again in a rant that you perform a little careful research. Not everything that is to be known is on the Internet! Books still exist and perhaps you should take time in reading a few of them on this subject. Obviously I made the correct decision months ago to abandon my interest in Wikipedia 66.90.217.49 02:17, 3 August 2005 (UTC) (the former MPLX)</dd>

<dd>Because that is NOT what the article says. First of all there were TWO ships. The first was to become the home of "Wonderful Radio London International" (WRLI) and a sister station known as "Voice of the Free Gospel" (VFG). The history of that venture is well documented all over the Internet on offshore radio sites and in the book and CD "The Wonderful Radio London Story". The second ship was the vessel claimed to be the MV Sarah by Alan Weiner of "Radio Newyork International" fame. The history of that vessel is also well documented. There was a criminal complaint lodged against Weiner (all of this is well documented on other Internet sites). So your statement is silly. As for this the current cabal who wish to delete, they are very small in number when compared to the Wikipedia registered contributors. but alas they are noisy and determined and have an agenda. That is the reason why I quit. I did check yesterday and found that someone noted my absence but wished that I would put in for admin due to the many contributions that I made on many topics. However, my mind was made up when I ran into cabal who want to remove things that they disagree with. I tried to shut down the Sealand topic because it was silly, but due to a number of noisy supporters it remains alive. Wikipedia I discovered has built into itself some fatal flaws that make its encyclopedia subject to manipulation by a handful of zealots - so I quit. 24.155.161.121 02:52, 5 August 2005 (UTC) (former MPLX)
<dl>
<dd>According to the article (that you wrote) the entity known as the "Four Freedoms Federation" NEVER purchased any ship. So, my statements are correct, you have two sections about talking about buying a ship, but it never actualy happend.

<dd>The problem, the big problem with this brigade that wants to delete is that it has its own agenda aside from the article. Your statement is proof of this. Nowhere in the article does it say what you are claiming. In the first instance it refers to WRLI/VFG which was documented by many media sources at the time and it is a part of at least two books which have nothing to do with me! On an Internet web site the name of the ship is mentioned. I left it out of the article because I felt that it was not necessary to explaining what this organization was all about. In the second instance there is a line which says: "However, due to complications involving the actual registration of the ship and the inability of the seller to provide proof of legal ownership, this plan also faltered." That statement does NOT say what you claim that it says. In fact there are other Wikipedia articles relating to other subjects which deal specifically with the subject of this ship. The fact is that this vessel gained worldwide attention because of its strange history which was too complicated to go into in the article under discussion. You picked the instance to fight over and clearly you are not only wrong in your rendition but you are clearly motivated to portray a false reading of the article in an effort to remove it. I have now been accused of creating at least three hoax articles and faking information by a little band of people - while at the same time having been previously praised for having created so many articles and having made contributions to many existing articles and at least on one occasion being informed that I should put my hat in the ring for admin! However, I have already withdrawn active input to Wikipedia due to the kind of nonsense which is presently taking place with the VfD issue over at least 4 articles: this one; John Lilburne Research Institute; Eric Gilder (professor); Province of the Carolanas - which someone concluded was a misspelling of Carolina! So much for the informed deletionist squad since Carolina was created AFTER the Carolana venture involving Sir Robert Heath who worked for the beheaded King Charles I! Obviously there is some question as to whether Sir Robert like Dr. Gilder is also a made up character! Really, this entire charade is pathetic and the only reason that I am taking the time to respond is to at least create some kind of record that the deletionists are a destructive bunch who obviously have decided to shape Wikipedia according to their own beliefs. For proof I could point to a string of really non-noteworthy articles which I attempted to tone down or even remove but could not because a number of people wanted them to stay. I had no agenda other than to contribute information across a broad spectrum of topics which were all related in some way by topic. But the little smear campaign is trying to suggest that either a) they were all a hoax, b) they were unnoteworthy or c) they are about me and therefore vanity (!?!). As shown by the ship examples above, it is obvious that facts will not stand in the way of those who want to delete. 66.90.218.47 06:34, 5 August 2005 (UTC) (the former MPLX)

<dd>Honestly, your arguments make no sense:
<ul>
<li>So you're saying that the "Four Freedoms Federation" DID purchase ships and did use them to broadcast radio? Because that's not what the article says. (Maybe I'm misreading it, it is a bit incoherent).</li>
<li>No one is saying that Heath never existed. But "Carolana" is, in fact, an alternate spelling of "Carolina". Please see the actual Heath patent <a href="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/heath.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/heath.htm" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. Both terms are used interchangably. (Incidently, the phrase "Province of the Carolanas" is not found in this document).</li>
<li>No one is saying that "Dr. Gilder" doesn't exist. Just that he is an obscure academic, and not notable enough for inclusion in an encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../j/w/1/User%7EJW1805_0d7f.html" title="User:JW1805">JW1805</a> 16:39, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The point of redirects is to assist users who look up a topic using a slightly different name than the one used in Wikipedia. Not the same name. As it stands now, any user who enters "negotiation" and presses Go will be taken to the topic Negotiation.

<li>Maybe I should explain my comment more carefully. First, the article is a redirect, which is a very common thing in wikipedia. Many pages have redirect shortcuts; for instance, this page can be reached at <a href="../../../v/f/d/VfD_4d7f.html" title="VfD">VfD</a>, <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion</a>, <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVfD_d394.html" title="WP:VfD">WP:VfD</a>, <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">WP:VFD</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Votes for Deletion</a>, and perhaps more. Almost always, the redirect articles have very similar names to the target article, such as abbreviating the namespace Wikipedia to WP. But most importantly, the correct place to suggest a redirect page for deletion is <a href="../../../r/f/d/RfD_39ed.html" title="RfD">RfD</a>, not this page. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange">Brighterorange</a> 01:19, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy keep</b>, can you see the difference between <a href="../../../n/e/g/Wp%7Enegotiation.html" title="Wp:negotiation">Wp:negotiation</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/g/Wikipedia%7ENegotiation_07d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Negotiation">Wikipedia:negotiation</a>? And a redirect page wouldn't be much use if it redirected into some completely different article, now, would it? - ulayiti <small>(talk)</small> 00:48, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I just reviewed the Wikipedia FAQ for "How do I delete a page". There is no mention of RfD, nor is there any suggestion that different kinds of pages should be deleted in different ways. If those directions are not accurate, then please edit them. I think both people voting to keep have missed the point of the anonymous editor. He is not saying that Redirect pages are unusual, nor is he saying that <a href="../../../n/e/g/Wp%7Enegotiation.html" title="Wp:negotiation">Wp:negotiation</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/g/Wikipedia%7ENegotiation_07d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Negotiation">Wikipedia:negotiation</a> are the same page. (And he is certainly not saying that the page should redirect to a "completely different article". He wants it deleted, not changed.) He is saying that this particular redirect page serves no purpose. As he said, anyone who does a "Go" on "negotiation" is going to end up at <a href="../../../n/e/g/Wikipedia%7ENegotiation_07d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Negotiation">Wikipedia:negotiation</a> anyway. He might be wrong but neither of your "keep" voters is responding to his point or explaining <i>where</i> he is wrong.--<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENathan_Ladd_432f.html" title="User:Nathan Ladd">Nate Ladd</a> 05:23, July 30, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, the anonymous commenter misunderstands. Anyone who does 'go' on <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negotiation.html" title="Negotiation">negotiation</a> will end up at the wikipedia article <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negotiation.html" title="Negotiation">negotiation</a>. This is about a page in the Wikipedia: namespace, which is for discussion <i>about</i> Wikipedia. "wp:" is a standard abbreviation for that and often used in redirects and shortcuts—it's as simple as that. So, to summarize: he is wrong about 'go'; this is a very standard kind of redirect shortcut, and like other redirect shortcuts it is or may be useful; and the <a href="../../../r/f/d/RfD_39ed.html" title="RfD">standards</a> for keeping redirects are very permissive. Also, I believe nominating something in the improper place is certainly grounds for a speedy unlisting. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange">Brighterorange</a> 14:51, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>It might be so, but someone might link to <a href="../../../n/e/g/Wp%7Enegotiation.html" title="Wp:negotiation">wp:negotiation</a> on a talk page for example, as it's quicker to type than <a href="../../../n/e/g/Wikipedia%7ENegotiation_07d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Negotiation">Wikipedia:negotiation</a>. That's why the redirect is necessary. - ulayiti <small>(talk)</small> 07:47, 30 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wait a minute. No one would write "wp.negotiation" in place of "Wikipedia.negotiation" unless they thought these were synonyms. If they are synonyms, then IF wp.negotiation DID NOT EXIST, wouldn't wp.negotiation take them to <a href="../../../n/e/g/Wikipedia%7ENegotiation_07d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Negotiation">Wikipedia:negotiation</a>? On the other hand, if they are not synonyms why would anyone who wanted to link to <a href="../../../n/e/g/Wikipedia%7ENegotiation_07d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Negotiation">Wikipedia:negotiation</a> write <a href="../../../n/e/g/Wp%7Enegotiation.html" title="Wp:negotiation">wp:negotiation</a> just because it is shorter? --<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENathan_Ladd_432f.html" title="User:Nathan Ladd">Nate Ladd</a> 18:29, July 30, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sure, that's what redirects do. They exist exactly for the reason of linking synonyms. <a href="../../../n/e/g/Wp%7Enegotiation.html" title="Wp:negotiation">Wp:negotiation</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/g/Wikipedia%7ENegotiation_07d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Negotiation">Wikipedia:negotiation</a> are synonyms, and one will take you to the other one <i>because</i> there's a redirect between them. If the redirect <a href="../../../n/e/g/Wp%7Enegotiation.html" title="Wp:negotiation">Wp:negotiation</a> did not exist, going to that page would take you nowhere, since it wouldn't have the redirect. That's why the redirect shouldn't be deleted. - ulayiti <small>(talk)</small> 10:56, 31 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>I think I understand you better. You are using "redirect" to mean "page containing a redirect tag". I thought you were using it to mean "redirect tag". --<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENathan_Ladd_432f.html" title="User:Nathan Ladd">Nate Ladd</a> 21:27, July 31, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>People use shortcuts all the time. As I mentioned, VfD has several shortcuts, including <a href="../../../v/f/d/Wp%7Evfd.html" title="Wp:vfd">wp:vfd</a>. They aren't just used for linking, for instance, I have a browser shortcut that takes me to a wikipedia article, and (for example) <a href="../../../v/f/d/Wp%7Evfd.html" title="Wp:vfd">wp:vfd</a> is much shorter than <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_Deletion_fa1b.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for Deletion">Wikipedia:Votes for Deletion</a>. This redirect is <i>totally standard</i> in that sense. I'll take a look at the FAQ to mention RfD; it is precisely the place to discuss this kind of issue. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange">Brighterorange</a> 14:51, 31 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I looked at the FAQ, particularly <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>, and it says to bring redirects to <a href="../../../r/f/d/RfD_39ed.html" title="RfD">RfD</a> (actually, it says to not worry about it because redirects are cheap).

<li><b>Comment</b>: What exactly is the point of this VfD debate? The page is an important redirect to an important policy page, and yet some people seem willing to delete it <i>without any reason whatsoever</i> except that they haven't been informed of the existence of RfD. Dear person, <i>that is no reason to delete a very useful redirect to an entirely unrelated policy page</i>. - ulayiti <small>(talk)</small> 21:38, 31 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think the debate is over and the page will be kept. While it was going on, it had the same point as any other debate on whether or not a page should be deleted. No one at any time said "delete this page because I haven't been in formed of the existence of RfD". Rather, a <i>side issue</i> that arose in the course of the discussion was that there is a weakness in Wiki documentation of how to delete pages.
<ul>
<li>Yeah, but such issues should be addressed on the appropriate talk pages, such as <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia_talk%7EDeletion_policy_ab70.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Deletion policy">Wikipedia talk:Deletion policy</a>, and not on some obscure VfD debate. And anyhow, that's the way I interpreted your vote, because you gave no reason as to why the page should be deleted, and instead talked about the RfD. - ulayiti <small>(talk)</small> 22:47, 31 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think it's worthwhile to be educational, especially in a behind-the-scenes place like VfD, since people who wind up nominating pages for deletion are likely to become active editors. But, apologies for cluttering VfD. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange">Brighterorange</a> 17:15, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> I think the unsigned entry is right. Martin-Löf may have given "evident" a stipulated meaning in his paper, but that doesn't make it a concept from logic. "Evident" is an epistemological or perceptual term or perhaps even a psychological term. But it does not have some specific meaning in logic, accepted by the community of logicians. Compare with such terms as "quantifier", "truth table", "logical constant", "premise", "inference", "proof", "validity", "soundness", "consistency", and "completeness". These are genuinely "concepts from logic". (By the way, it is premature -to put it mildly- to call an article that is only 9 years old from the first issue of a minor journal "seminal". Maybe in another 20 years we can look back and decide that it was seminal, but there's no justification for such a judgement now.) --<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENathan_Ladd_432f.html" title="User:Nathan Ladd">Nate Ladd</a> 05:58, July 30, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Having now read the Martin-Löf article, I'm more convinced than ever. The article is about the <i>epistemology</i> of laws of logic as distinct from being about logic itself. Moreover, he uses "evident" as an epistemological concept. In fact he <i>equates</i> it with the granddaddy of all epistemological concepts: "known". --<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENathan_Ladd_432f.html" title="User:Nathan Ladd">Nate Ladd</a> 06:47, July 30, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Disagreement</b> - Would you like to know why it's not as widely known as, say... 8-bit theater? It's because I'm highly against spamming my readers with advertisements. Because I don't advertise on my site, nor do I myself ask advertisements to be posted on other sites, it won't be as well known as a site that spams it's existance into every orifice of the web. Remember... some things that don't spamvertise you constantly may not be all that bad. And given I have over 500 comics to date, I can safely say that this site is already doing better than many others out there. And an added note... given many of the major Metroid information databases link to me (Metroid Database, Metroid Source, Metroid Galaxy, several lesser-known ones) of their own free will, that should count for something. - Kabutroid <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 205.239.196.6 (<a href="../../../2/0/5/User_talk%7E205.239.196.6.html" title="User talk:205.239.196.6">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_205.239.196.6_9e96.html" title="Special:Contributions/205.239.196.6">contribs</a>) 12:18, 3 August 2005.</small></li>
<li><b>Disagreement</b> - You're right. Planet Zebeth is not a notable sprite comic, it's one of the damn best ones out there, and the only one worth my time to read. Admittedly, the first few strips did suck, but if you read past 100 at least they get pretty damn funny. Kabutroid is also one of the coolest people I've ever talked to. There are few who can compare with him on his juggling skills, also (Life, not eggs). He IS late with the updates sometimes, but if I were in his position, I'd be updating ONCE weekly, not three times. And I have virtually no life! So please withdraw your vote for deletion, as it has no logic behind it. Maybe some misdirected emotion concerning the author, but other than that I can't think of what you might have against the comic.

For those asking to delete it... how often have you SEARCHED for a Metroid sprite comic? Guess what... Planet Zebeth is the largest, longest running one online. EDIT: Oh, and would you like to know WHY it doesn't have an Alexa rating? It used to. However, I'm in the midst of changing from kabutroid.com to zebeth.com. Because any mention I give of the site anywhere (such as a message board signature, etc) is now listed as Zebeth.com, Alexa has dropped it's status of kabutroid.com, since it's significantly less used now. When the conversion from kabutroid.com to zebeth.com is complete, and all sites linking to Planet Zebeth use zebeth.com, Alexa will once again list it with a rating. - Kabutroid <small>(Unsigned vote by 205.239.196.6 (<a href="../../../2/0/5/User_talk%7E205.239.196.6.html" title="User talk:205.239.196.6">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_205.239.196.6_9e96.html" title="Special:Contributions/205.239.196.6">contribs</a>))</small></li>

It's one of the best sprite comics online. -Neon Ninja <i>(Vote by 208.186.52.34)</i> --<i><a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllen3_f7ae.html" title="User:Allen3">Allen3</a></i>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllen3_35fb.html" title="User talk:Allen3">talk</a></sup> 22:17, August 8, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as mentioned above, why do you all want it gone <i>purely</i> because you've never heard of it? For all you know I could've never heard of, say, Albert Einstein. Should his entry be removed from here then? Seriously, just "non-notable" or "unknown" is <i>not</i> a good reason to remove it. Isn't this place to give explanations on things that aren't known very well?

<li><b>Keep</b> As Kabs himself said, how many Metroid sprite comics have you actually *seen*? There aren't that many out there, and even fewer good ones. Few sprite comics, period, have run for as long as this one has. Have you checked ProjectComics? Zebeth is listed as #4 out of several hundred, and has consistently been in the top ten there. This despite the fact that the "vote" button on the home page is pretty well-hidden. The site gets nearly 2000 unique hits per day, and has accumulated over a million. I see no reason not to keep it. Indeed, I see no actual reason to *remove* it--there are lesser-known sprite comics that have their own entries in Wikipedia. Is Wikipedia really in *this* much need of pruning? I think not.

<li><b>Keep</b> A comic based on a massive fan base, that helps to feed said fanbase, thusly keeping it alive. I know many of the readers would not still be interesated in the games if it was not for this comic; This, I believe, makes it notable. Also, with it's wide range of characters, plot twists, sub-plots, etc. there needs to be a place for people who have never read it to keep track of what's going on, and for those who do to let the world know what it is. Again, I shall use Albert Einstein: During his lifetime, was he all that notable? No. For the most part, he was just a guy, doing what he had to to live. So, following that, how can you call something "non-notable" when it hasn;t been given the chance yet to become notable? <i>(unsigned vote by 216.138.232.17)</i> --<i><a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllen3_f7ae.html" title="User:Allen3">Allen3</a></i>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllen3_35fb.html" title="User talk:Allen3">talk</a></sup> 22:17, August 8, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b> Not that I expect you'll read it or heed it, but let me make a point here for the people who are no doubt being directed here from this web site. "Never heard of it" isn't (really) an issue for notability. Consider, instead, whether you think a sprite comic would end up in an encyclopedia. I suggest you read <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, remember also that Wikipedia is not a webguide, and consider a more appropriate place for this entry, such as Everything2. Chances are, if a researcher isn't likely to ever search for you, you aren't notable. Furthemore, unless you're the absolute exemplar of sprite comics, with a truly massive fan base (such as <a href="../../../8/-/b/8-bit_Theatre_fcec.html" title="8-bit Theatre">8-bit Theatre</a>) or significant age (<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_and_George_ebc6.html" title="Bob and George">Bob and George</a>) and preferably both, you really don't belong, because a researcher would be looking for general information on sprite comics, not information on your comic in specific or information on Metroid sprite comics (and if they were, you should make your comic an external link from the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metroid.html" title="Metroid">Metroid</a> page). In general, this means that sprite comics are, like Internet forums, personal web sites, and other such things, by default non-notable. You're making the claim for notability; back it up with some Alexa rankings that come close to or match the exemplars, provide something that is extremely important (for instance, "first sprite comic to be featured on CNN," "first sprite comic to be talked about in the media by a major public figure," or "first sprite comic to have a video game based on it, not the other way around"), or realize that you just don't fit in here. <i>Subjective quality is not a concern in this vote,</i> unless you can claim you were the first sprite comic to be discussed in a journal of literary criticism or the like. Yeah, I'm mergist/exclusionist -- especially where sockpuppets who delete their IP signatures are concerned. *shrug* --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreelanceWizard_69ce.html" title="User:FreelanceWizard">FreelanceWizard</a> 20:34, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment.</b> Kabutroid - Actually, I was the second Metroid comic strip to exist online. The FIRST one was about 10 comics long, and no longer exists online. And as well, I'm the largest, longest running Metroid comic strip in existance. Thusly, if anyone wanted to do any kind of research on Metroid or Metroid fans or the like, they would most likely want to know about Planet Zebeth. And above I gave explanations for the Alexa ranking. However, if NONE of those points count for anything, then I would be glad to just add a link from the Metroid wiki. Given you've said that this is data-based as opposed to vote based, I'll remove my request for people to vote. And I apologize if it appears I'm deleting an IP signature, but I have absolutely no clue how that even gets there to begin with. I'm clicking "edit page", and adding my comments.
<ul>
<li>I didn't mean you when I was talking about deleting signatures. Some of the people who are coming here and voting are, however, doing so, and that shows bad faith (after all, if you stand by what you're saying, why wouldn't you want people to know who you are?). This vote is, I should note, not a democracy (I think <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> describes that), but rather one in which a consensus among Wikipedians is sought with input from others. People from your web site who have never edited here before will, in all probability, have their votes ignored, and it will seem like bad faith on your part to actively drive people here (<a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>). Anyway, I do want to mention something about Metroid fan research. I think a topic like Metroid fan phenomena might not be a bad article, given that it's one of the oldest game franchises around; I think similar ones for Mario Bros. and Sonic might not be bad topics either. A discussion of your site in such an article would be beneficial, but that's because it's part of a notable thing, but is not, IMHO, in and of itself notable. I can further support my argument in that regard by citing this page, where a common argument is that it's the "best" and longest running Metroid sprite comic. Are Metroid sprite comics notable on their own for that reason? I don't think so. However, are they notable as part of a discussion on the fan community of Metroid or sprite comics in general? Definitely. Admittedly, however, this is just my point of view, and there are others. The "vision" of what WP should be is not quite so clear as one might at first surmise.&#160;;) --<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreelanceWizard_69ce.html" title="User:FreelanceWizard">FreelanceWizard</a> 22:26, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

I'm going to need promotion by more than one guy to decide he's notable. --<a href="../../../e/t/a/User%7EEtacar11_a365.html" title="User:Etacar11"><font face="Courier"><font color="#66CD00">Etacar11</font></font></a> 22:29, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b> or <b>merge</b>. There is no consensus for deletion, and I am not quite sure as to how to merge this into two different articles. (What type of redirect should be left behind?) Therefore I will just keep the article as it is right now, and if anyone figures out <i>how</i> to merge this, they can go ahead and do it. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 08:47, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> as per <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_Votes_for_deletion_e10e.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to Votes for deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to Votes for deletion</a>, a merge vote means: "Keep and merge the content into Example, leaving a redirect afterwards".

I know because I just came to Wikipedia specifically to find out about whoever writes Ghastly's, and to research the authors of some other web comics (although its a bit sparce here. So it seems that the page is useful. The page should follow the Wikipedia standard formatting and style more closely. Perhaps there should even be two articles, one on the Comic, and one on the author's life, particularly his comics career. This would seem more in line with other entertainment media represented on wikip.

<p>I am the one who "dumped" the article. I am no expert in the field, just someone who has had first-hand experience with the application process for US institutions (and succeeded - starting this month I'll be studying at Amherst).<br />
It is not taken from a brochure, it is my own writing, submitted as public content, and I do not pretend it to be exhaustive. I just wanted to create a free resource to which anyone who has gone through these experience could contribute in order to help students from foreign countries, especially from developing countries who are trying to get a scholarship in the US. The intent of this guide is not to convince anyone to come to the US to study, just to provide some information in the subject. It would be counter-productive to start discussing here whether foreign students studying in the US is a good thing or not, but I suppose you can see why some people think of it as the former.<br />
I understand that Wikipedia is not a how-to guide, and if this rule will be enforced, then so be it. However, I urge you to see the difference between a "how to build your own bookshelves" guide and such a guide whishing to provide information to high-school students from all over the World which may otherwise not be available to them.<br />
Just one more thing, I hope that with the contribution of more international students this resource will get as exhaustive as possible and all errors be corrected - that is why I thought wikipedia to be the most suitable medium for such an undertaking<br />
Yours sincerely,<br />
Bogdan State<br />

<p>You should put this information on your own wiki then. The title of the article certainly doesn't fit in the wikipedia guidelines. Again, as drini mentioned, wikipedia is not a webspace provider. I have no problem with the content of the article, it just isn't encyclopedic. <a href="../../../m/r/m/User%7EMrmcgibby_5326.html" title="User:Mrmcgibby">Mrmcgibby</a> 17:57, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK, got the point - I saved the source code on my computer and have nothing against deleting it from Wikipedia. This project will be in my own wiki in order for it not to violate Wikipedia policies. My problem was not with your observation that it is not encyclopedic, but rather such qualifications as "dumped" and the fact that it seemed to be advertising for anything.</p>
