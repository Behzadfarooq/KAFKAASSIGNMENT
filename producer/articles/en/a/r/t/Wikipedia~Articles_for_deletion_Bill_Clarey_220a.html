<li>Wow, I didn't even hear about this news until I read it here, and I'm a pretty big Daily Show fan. Anyway, <b>Merge</b> into <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Show_9046.html" title="Daily Show">Daily Show</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clarey_e5c7.html" title="Bill Clarey">Bill Clarey</a> isn't notable as a standalone biography but the suicide of an intern is probably notable on the show's page. --<b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde Weys</a></b> <sub><a href="../../../c/y/d/User_talk%7ECyde_0e22.html" title="User talk:Cyde">talk</a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left: -16px; margin-right: -16px;"><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cyde_0b5a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cyde">contribs</a></span></sup> 15:29, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Keep it, as tonight's show was dedicated to him, so it's helpful to have a page to find when searching.</li>
<li>After watching the show I searched his name and the article came up. It was informing, as I did not know who he was or what had happened when John Stewart dedicated the show to him.</li>
<li>Agreed, keep it. I saw the show was dedicated to him tonight and immediately did a wikipedia search for him.</li>
<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> as per Cyde. I'm sure lots of people are going to be curious as to who he is after the Daily Show's dedication to him on the 13th; however, sadly, he isn't notable on his own. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Love_22fe.html" title="User:Chris Love">Chris Love</a> 04:42, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> I think we should redirect this to The Daily Show's page, or keep the article at least for a week, as it will be very useful to people searching for his name after the Daily Show airing. --<a href="../../../f/u/c/User%7EFuchikoma_7a7a.html" title="User:Fuchikoma">User:fuchikoma</a></li>
<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> Agreed, nice to be able to find something about him after seeing tonight's episode. (With the Howard Stern interview it will likely be reaired) --<a href="../../../d/u/o/User%7EDuozmo_c666.html" title="User:Duozmo">Duozmo</a></li>
<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> Yes, heard about it when the show was cancelled and again in the epilogue when I watched it this evening. If it could be determined why then perhaps a link to the right article on causes of suicide might be worth adding. --Clem Holloman</li>
<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> Agreed also, I immediately searched for it when i saw the show, keep for a week then relate to daily show page --null</li>
<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> I also searched for his name after watching the show, agree with keep for a week then redirect to Daily Show. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMac4drew_13fb.html" title="User:Mac4drew">Mac4drew</a> 12:47, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge and redirect after the interest has died down</b> Say, a few days to a week.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. If he killed himself as a result of something happening on the show, that would be notable, but we have no information as to this. If he killed himself due to problems from his own life, then sorry, it's not particular noteworthy. <a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="font-family:Verdana; font-weight: bold; color: #33C;">howcheng</span></a> <small>[ <a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHowcheng_f4d4.html" title="User talk:Howcheng">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Howcheng_7e82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Howcheng">c</a> • <a href="http://www.howcheng.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.howcheng.com/" rel="nofollow">w</a> • <a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><i><b><span style="color:#0C0">e</span></b></i></a> ]</small> 17:53, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> He may not be notable on his own, but is certainly part of the history of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daily_Show_00d8.html" title="The Daily Show">The Daily Show</a>. I, too, came to Wikipedia to find out who he was after watching The Daily Show of December 13. <a href="../../../h/a/a/User%7EHaakon_f760.html" title="User:Haakon">Haakon</a> 19:37, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep it</b> I came looking after the dedication and found my answer. Appreciate it's existence, sort of an obituary as well. Wouldn't fit as well as a merge, but should be a link from the Daily Show page.</li>
<li><b>Keep it</b> The detail in the article is difficult to find elsewhere. I, for one, am curious to know why he died. Based on the article and his interests and the "Moment of Zen" dedicated to him, I wonder if he was gay. It's interesting that the show dedicated to his death also said some positive things about South Africa's decision to allow gay couples to marry. I caution that I have no knowledge of Bill Clarey's sexual orientation, but gay suicides of young people are very common, and if it does turn out to be the case, it could be a public reminder of this. (Matthew Sheppard's death initially was not focusd on his sexual orientation either.) In any event, I'd keep it, with a link to and from the Daily Show. And I, for one, will check it periodically to see if anyone comes forward with additional information.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It's obviously useful to a lot of people (such as myself) looking for more information on this guy after seeing the Daily Show dedication. Wikipedia was the first source I looked to. The fact that this article is here, that this many people are interested in reading it, is enough evidence that it's of some pertinence and use.

<li><b>Keep</b> as notable. If people are really concerned about this, merge is somewhere in a few months or renominate for AfD. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 23:24, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep or Merge</b> This can be considered a notable time in TDS history. I believe that this is the first time that they cancelled a scheduled show for any reason. Jon dedicated a Moment of Zen to the man, for chrissake. He never does that for anyone unless he wants to offend them. Keep it or merge it in.
