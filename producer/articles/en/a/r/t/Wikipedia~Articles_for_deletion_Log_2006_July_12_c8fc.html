<li><b>Keep</b> per Arker. It's a computer programming language from the late 1970s/early 80s, which in and of itself is fairly important. It even predates <a href="../../../s/i/s/SISAL_6849.html" title="SISAL">SISAL</a> as a dataflow language. Notability is not just popularity (and shouldn't be, given the degenerate state of the zeitgeist in modern Western Culture); it's also about impact on history, and as an early stage in dataflow processing research, its impact is deserving of note. The <a href="../../../f/l/i/Flipped_SU%285%29_3a1f.html" title="Flipped SU(5)">Flipped SU(5)</a> is probably not known outside a narrow interest group or constituency (that of physicists and mathematicians), yet it is important to the evolution of grand unification theory. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 12:02, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep if expanded</b> to provide sufficient <i>context</i> for those unfamiliar with the field. The stub we have at present merely tells us that it's something called "Chris And John's Own LanguagE" that was written by two people at a college: well, that could be anything from a foundation of modern computer science right through to a toy language invented by a couple of students one lunchbreak and never implemented!<br />
CAJOLE is not mentioned at all in the article on <a href="../../../d/a/t/Dataflow_language.html" title="Dataflow language">dataflow languages</a>, so it's not easy for someone without specialist knowledge to judge how significant a language it actually was in their development. If it had "impact" that was "deserving of note", then surely it wouldn't be that difficult to add at least a couple of sentences mentioning that fact. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 13:06, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> It has been over a month. The article has not improved. It is still one massive quote, with the rest being heavily based on another web page. It still doesn't satisfactorily meet WP:V, as there are no credible sources given (the only semi-credible source is the Discovery channel documentary, but their criteria for inclusion is incredibly lax nowadays). All sources that can be found reference the Discovery channel documentary. It violates <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> for those reasons, though it may also fail to establish notability. -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">Talk</a> | 00:16, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>As it currently stands there is not enough about this published anywhere reputable to possible satisfy WP:V. Mentioning something once in a <i>Discovery</i> documentary about UFOs is not quite good enough for me, if there is nothing else on this available. If everything dubious and unverifiable was removed, it would be a stub of an entry ("<i>Fast Walker</i> is the name given to an object by UFO watchers which they claim to be travelling at high speed towards Earth, and the nature of which to this day has remained unidentified. The UFO theorists claim that the object was detected in 1984 by a U.S. Defense satellite used to normally detect military threats heading towards the U.S.A, but unfortunately we have no way of verifying this claim at all. In fact, this entire article is based on one fringe website which itself looks like a second-hand account of a short segment of a <i>Discovery</i> episode on UFOs, taken out of context.") The entire "mystery" of it exists because there is a complete dearth of knowledge available, which I think is a good sign that it is not notable or verfiable enough for WP. <b>Delete, or stub-ify</b>. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 00:50, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Very Weak keep</b> A fascinating story; unfortunately, the only good references I've been able to find are from "unexplained mysteries" types of sites and whatnot. I found <a href="http://members.fortunecity.com/prisyura1/dsp.html" class="external text" title="http://members.fortunecity.com/prisyura1/dsp.html" rel="nofollow">this old copy of an Omni article</a>, a magazine I loved as a kid though now I'm not sure how reliable of a source it would be considered. However, I did a Google search on "site:gov fastwalker" and found an official-looking Word document with the following quote:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>1. How do we integrate Hotwalker, Jaywalker, Fastwalker, Skywalker worldwide test range monitoring, and space infrastructure attack characterization capabilities?</i></dd>
<dd><i>2. How do we perform IR multi-stage correlation, sensor cross-cueing in the Space Surveillance Network, and multi-source fusion of space tracks using IR and radar?</i></dd>
<dd>I also found <a href="http://www.mors.org/publications/abstracts/72nd_abs.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.mors.org/publications/abstracts/72nd_abs.pdf" rel="nofollow">this pdf document</a> that mentions the same terms in a similar context. This suggests that "fastwalker" is indeed a term used in military space surveillance, and perhaps not invented by UFO buffs. However, for the article to qualify as a "keep," I think we'd have to remove the unverified account of the UFO incident (or at the very least mention that the sources are dubious). Unfortunately, that wouldn't leave much of an article. <b><a href="../../../o/h/n/User%7EOhnoitsjamie_fc14.html" title="User:Ohnoitsjamie">OhNo<font color="#D47C14">itsJamie</font></a> <a href="../../../o/h/n/User_talk%7EOhnoitsjamie_2359.html" title="User talk:Ohnoitsjamie"><sup>Talk</sup></a></b> 21:17, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>, right, it would pretty much just leave a dicdef or "technical manual" style page. I already said my concerns with the Omni article in the other thread: Omni got to the point where they were putting in various crazed theories every month without much in the way of editorial review or skepticism.

<p>The result was that no valid conclusion regarding <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus</a> can be drawn from the debate as it exists. This is not a "no consensus" closing, and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_binding_decisions_c105.html" title="Wikipedia:No binding decisions">no precedent should be drawn</a> from this nomination.</p>
<p>In the absence of clear policy of factual outcomes, the outcome is determined by <i>vox populi</i>. But a deletion discussion is a <i>sampling excercise</i> to determine consensus, not a <a href="../../../c/e/n/Census.html" title="Census">census</a>. Anything that skews this sampling is a <a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_thing.html" title="Bad thing">bad thing</a>. There is a clear line between drawing attention to a debate and <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Republic_0fa6.html" title="Free Republic">freeping</a> and that line was clearly crossed in this case. Let there be no mistake: This is behavior that is not tolerated.</p>
<p>However, having examined the interactions on the talk pages at <i>great</i> length, it is impossible to determine what effect this outcome has had on the debate. While the majority of those contacted did not comment, the effects of a message on a talk page are often felt far beyond those who comment directly. Thus this debate is broken beyond repair.</p>
<p>With regards to the arguments raised regarding maintenance and red links, it should be noted that <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)</a> states clearly <i>Ideally each entry on the list should have a Wikipedia article...</i> The current list violates the policy on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, however these flaws are correctable. Sources are a necesarry <b>but not sufficient</b> condition for inclusion however.</p>
<p>The most positive outcome would be that the tremendous energy devoted to this deletion debate be refocused on attempting to make this list first conform to all policies and guidelines, and then considering a renomination for deletion if required.</p>

<dd>Or being on a list in a publication with notoriety. Which seems to have been the case here. I see that The Grappler is dealing with this at this moment. If others can then be added when their article gets written, or when they get mentioned in another article (in that case the person who puts the name in, should provide a short bibliographical note), I think notability will not be a problem. --<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Gerwazy_8ca1.html" title="User:Pan Gerwazy">Pan Gerwazy</a> 23:13, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tango_%28music%29.html" title="Tango (music)">Tango</a> is a popular form of music in the Spanish-speaking world. A tango singer is as definable as a pop singer or an opera singer or a rock singer, or any other type of vocalist that you can think of. Let's not crumble in the face of a trick task, which would be defining "tango singer". Also, we need to come to terms with the fact that lists can and will exist peacefully on Wikipedia. See <a href="../../../c/l/s/WP%7ECLS_1606.html" title="WP:CLS">WP:CLS</a>. Lists are good. People like them. People learn from them. They are accepted.

<dd>The membership criteria is essentially "they deserve an article". There's a lot of red links but that is basically because this entire subject seems to have been completely forgotten about. Unfortunately, the upshot of "they deserve an article" is that the real notability concerns are decided by <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, but it's inappropriate either to copy and paste that entire definition of notability or to give a link into Wikipedia space. As a compromise what I've done is moved the list to "List of notable tango singers" and put in a scary hidden comment (you'll only see it in <b>edit mode</b>) that basically says "put in a referenced assertion of notability, or your entry will be removed from the list". In this kind of list that's the best that can be done - that doesn't mean it's a write-off. It certainly seems to pass the criteria on <a href="../../../c/l/s/WP%7ECLS_1606.html" title="WP:CLS">WP:CLS</a> which are the ones that really matter here.

<li>Correct! It is NOT simply a vote, and therefore Tobias's votestacking and the folk who turned up as a result of it, needs to be discounted. You haven't addressed my concerns to my satisfaction, far from it. Correct again, the questions that face this list are the same that face others, but this particular list and its creators, fail to address them successfully. This list would be marginally notable and marginally encyclopedic, even if thoroughly sourced, which it is not. (most lists are not, I comment delete on most lists, but not all) Your argumentatively replying to every comment is not going to work, I don't think.

<li>I don't wish to offend anyone, and I'm sorry if you object to my watchlisting this page. The fact is that no matter what, if I suspect that someone has submitted an uninformed opinion, I am going to very civilly and maturely challenge it. That's my right- in fact I consider it my duty. If I wasn't so weary from writing out my rationale so many times, I'd be happy to tell you again. I realize that I'm half-obsessing on this AfD, but do you have any specific concerns that you would like me to address so that we can call this process a consensus and not an instance of votestacking? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 17:35, 13 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Go mark (with a reply that the comment is from a votestacked person) all the comments that are from people Tobias notified, that would address one of my concerns, and help the closing admin out a lot (that admin can then evaluate if the comment is just a flippant driveby or a comment that adds to the discussion in a significant way and should be counted toward consensus). The other concern really boils down to this, why is this list on a very obscure topic encyclopedic? Lists of random things are not. Why wouldn't a category do the trick instead? Easier to maintain and a better approach. I only support lists when a clear case is made that the list transcends what a category can do. (for example this one: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_European_Union_member_states_by_political_system_f6fc.html" title="List of European Union member states by political system">List_of_European_Union_member_states_by_political_system</a> which adds a lot of information beyond a mere list, it's really an article in disguise) Further, almost every person on this tango singer list is redlinked, meaning that their notability is not even known, much less established satisfactorily (I don't consider the cited sources as verifiable enough to confer notability, sorry) This list, on further reflection, smacks of OR in that the list composers are deciding who is notable and who isn't. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 18:19, 13 July 2006 (UTC) PS I take no offense at your watchlisting an AfD, I do that too! My issue is that you shouldn't repeat the same points to try to rebut.
<ul>
<li>Honestly I don't think that the closing admin needs any help, because at the moment it seems to be quite on the side of "keep". That was a long comment with many points, so I'll just state a few unrelated sentences.
<ol>
<li>Tango is <i>not</i> obscure in Latin America.</li>
<li>Redlinks allow for the creation of other articles</li>
<li>An expert in Tango music can decide which names are too obscure. Or we could just use google.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Now as far as your votestacking allegations go, I see a slight bit happening with Tobias alerting fellow editors, but I see no problem with alerting all contributors to the page, which is what I did. Hence the raison d'etre of {{adw|pagename}}. Oh and one more thing. I am very consciously making the same points over and over because, well, they're true. Unless they are addressed by the other party to my satisfaction, I'm not going to stop my line of attack. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 18:34, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>My comment was placed because Tobias alerted me. So what? Does it count any less? Are my opinions less important because I didn't have the page in my watchlist and I only found out by an alert user? Tobias was just letting people that potentially cared about the article that they should express their opinions. Mine must have been good enough for two other editors to cite it for their own votes. <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebastiankessel_8c89.html" title="User:Sebastiankessel">Sebastian Kessel</a> <sup><i><a href="../../../s/e/b/User_talk%7ESebastiankessel_cf55.html" title="User talk:Sebastiankessel">Talk</a></i></sup> 18:27, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>My worst fears about this AfD are coming true. Everyone who voted "keep" will now have to explain how and why they came here. Adam alerted me, I had no idea he was in favour of or against deletion reading his warning. I just feel passionate about this page because when I had finished my <a href="../../../p/y/o/Pyotr_Leshchenko_5a53.html" title="Pyotr Leshchenko">Pyotr Leshchenko</a> article, I was glad to find this list, because I knew that putting him in the tango musician category would be too controversial for some Argentine tango purists (=an ambiguous expression, I know). On the active end, no, I did NOT invite anyone here, even though there may be a few people here who already wrote on my talk page (and definitely NOT about tango). Pure coincidence. I did not want to vote on the other AfD, but as more people there switched to here when the outcome became doubtful, I decided to have a second look there and Mikka convinced me. --<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Gerwazy_8ca1.html" title="User:Pan Gerwazy">Pan Gerwazy</a> 20:23, 14 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>No one accused Adam of votestacking. His polite request was fine. Tobias's request to come and defend, was however not. That's the whole point of refraining from internal spamming. Had Tobias not spammed people with a request to come and "defend", no one would be questioning the keep votes at all. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 23:02, 14 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>From what I can see, Tobias didn't seem to "spam," he notified users that ought to be notified about this. It doesn't look like many of them came, anyhow. (I was not one of those users, by the way.) <a href="../../../s/y/p/User%7ESyphonbyte_a97f.html" title="User:Syphonbyte">syphonbyte</a> 00:54, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think the policy is he should not have used the word "defendernos", except on the Argentina project page. However, we all know that such notifications are usually only sent to people who the notifier knows will vote his way. Of course it is only a survey I am now talking about, but have a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Battle_of_Deir_Yassin/Requested_move" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Battle_of_Deir_Yassin/Requested_move" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> where a user managed to get seven oppose votes in one night against a revert of a name change he did while he was in a period banning him from amongst other things, renames of articles. Of course he did not tell anyone he contacted to vote "oppose" but do you really think he contacted anyone he did not know for sure would vote "oppose" (and on a subject like that one, it is rather easy to know)? And as for what happened here, as<a href="../../../s/y/p/User%7ESyphonbyte_a97f.html" title="User:Syphonbyte">syphonbyte</a> said, the Argentinians are conspicuous by their absence. --<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Gerwazy_8ca1.html" title="User:Pan Gerwazy">Pan Gerwazy</a> 17:33, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Update: I have meanwhile advertised this at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Tango_%28dance%29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Tango_%28dance%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Tango_%28dance%29</a>. I think what I say there, is non-committed enough. As for the Deir Yasin controversy, someone has intervened and it does not look like Wikipedia will make the news as a Deir Yassin Denial site. Yet. I also think I know how Alex Bakharev got here. There was a minor scuffle at <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chechnya.html" title="Chechnya">Chechnya</a> over the External References there. After I reverted a Russian's POV renaming of Alex's names for the groups of references he created, I got a funny remark on my talk page. Alex is an administrator by the way, and I suppose he followed my talk page to see if other remarks would be made after the revert and his invitation to me to further rename the groups. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APan_Gerwazy&amp;diff=62467293&amp;oldid=62247747" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APan_Gerwazy&amp;diff=62467293&amp;oldid=62247747" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> --<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Gerwazy_8ca1.html" title="User:Pan Gerwazy">Pan Gerwazy</a> 16:31, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> List criteria is too vague for my liking, but more worringly, there may be copyright problems here, as the majority of the article is copying the information from two lists found on other websites, which I don't believe we should do.

<dd>It's okay, you can chill about the copyrights. A list is copyright but the fact that somebody exists on a list is not. That's one of the reasons that our "list of missing encyclopedia articles" contains a bunch of encyclopedia indexes mixed together. Some of the individual indexes would be copyright, but the collective one is not so. Those lists may be reconstructable from the data, but what is presented is a new list that isn't a simple reproduction of any of the others. The Turkish and Russian tango singers on the list are a guarantee of that. If you don't think "notable" is a strong enough inclusion criteria then where would you set Wikipedia's article inclusion guidelines? All of the articles <i>clearly</i> meet the demands of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> for their work in this field. <b>Please view the page in edit mode</b> where this necessity is reiterated to editors. It would be a violation of <a href="../../../s/e/l/WP%7ESELF_e41e.html" title="WP:SELF">WP:SELF</a> to inform readers that "in this context, <i>notable"</i> means that <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> is fulfilled", and that is such a long document there's absolutely no point summarizing it. But seriously, isn't the fact that a reliable source has classified them or identified them as a notable tango singer enough? I suspect you'd probably drop in horror at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_notable_brain_tumor_patients.html" title="List of notable brain tumor patients">List of notable brain tumor patients</a> which is actually a <a href="../../../f/l/_/WP%7EFL_362d.html" title="WP:FL">featured list</a>! Additionally, as the summaries get filled in, ultimately there'll be no need to assert notability from the fact that they are in the list... or rather there <i>will</i> be, because that list is just an index to a series of articles, and precisely those articles from this index will appear as the references for those individuals, but it maybe won't be so obvious as using the flat "appears on this list" template. Besides, what if I renamed those source list references to "this person has a biography on todotango.com" and "This person has had recordings of their singing published (Source: their appearance in the tango.info database)"? Since tango.info only has one url to access the singers' database, that's the only one that would be cited anyway... I hope you see the ridiculousness of the situation? I know Tobias isn't the most popular editor, and yes, it wasn't his greatest ever idea to go messaging, but he certainly didn't contact me. I am here - and I put all that work into this article - because I was surprised (in fact, at turns, outraged) at this nomination, and believe it goes firmly against the guidelines at <a href="../../../c/l/s/WP%7ECLS_1606.html" title="WP:CLS">WP:CLS</a>. I imagine Tobias was absolutely furious. Being unpopular is one thing, then having an AFD brought against a pretty solid article (although in the state it was in at the time it was nominated, I can understand the decision to bring to AFD... but would rather that the nominator had reviewed <a href="../../../c/l/s/WP%7ECLS_1606.html" title="WP:CLS">WP:CLS</a> thoroughly since that was what was implicitly invoked, and would be genuinely surprised if the nominator had not then chosen to send this to cleanup) must have felt like getting spat on. That's probably why he has got so defensive and engaged in methods that are now ticking other people off. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 08:56, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> "A list is copyright but the fact that somebody exists on a list is not", that I would agree with, as per my original comment. But there is a big difference between mentioning in a specific article that the subject is on a list, and having an article which lists everyone on that list. The latter is reproducing the list, in my view, whereas the former is not. The list of missing encyclopedia articles is a little different, as it is a list of facts, but a list of notable singers is a subjective list and as such is covered differently. With regards to your ridiculous situation, the fact that the bulk of the article comes from just one or two references (and uses the entirety - not a sample - of those references) only increases my copyright concern. If the goal of this list is to have an article for each one (and remember WP:MUSIC is a guideline, it is possible for a singer to "pass" WP:MUSIC and still be deleted in an afd), then it would appear to be covered by a category and possibly this list would be more appropiate as To-do items in project music.

<li><b>Additional Comment</b> Also, if one of those lists comes from a wikipedian's own web site, then even if it was PD'd, I would have concerns about an editor creating articles which use his own web site as the primary reference, as there could be difficulties with OR, as it would be a list of notable singers - where notable is defined by one of the wikipedians editing the article.

The subject is the same but that's it. As for the statement: "But nothing has changed since the original nomination." I completly disagree, and must tell you that that the first nomination was alltoo soon after creation and as such didn't had the time to develope (improve) properly. Since then the article has been improved by a enormous extent. Well, looking at the history of the article you will find that I spent a lot of time improving it, and I would certainly not have done it, if I didn't think that it is a worthy subject. No, I am not the author, but I found and read the comic exactly because I found a good article in Wikipedia and quite sincerly I think that is one of the notions of Wikipedia: Good articles = check the subject out.

<li><b>Delete</b> - "Has some history"? <i>I</i> have some history and clearly exist also, but I hardly think that qualifies me for notability.

<li><b>Comment</b> I can see that noone is atacking the quality of the article itself, so I hope that we can all agree that the article is good enough. What we appear to disagree is if the subject the (the webcomic itself) is "worthy" enough to have an article in Wikipedia. Well, I think that the author made a genuine (very rare) effort to create a quite "logical and believable" universe (it never stops being sci-fi of course). Unlike way too may Sci-Fi universes and other webcomics, the author created a really detailed background for his setting, look in here: <a href="http://www.well-of-souls.com/outsider/insider.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.well-of-souls.com/outsider/insider.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, and "you" must agree that the storyline is quite advanced (way too many others are overly simplistic and present the old Good/Evil Hollywood kitsh: Evil is stupid, Good is smart - like in Star Wars: the Empire was completly incompetent, beginning with Palpatine himself&#160;:). The art is very good, alltough clearly not brilliant, while the art of the overwhelming majoriy of other webcomics are simply bad, but really really bad. If all these things don't make this particular webcomic "worthy" enough, I must ask you all: Which webcomic is worthy then? Only those who appear in magazines and are thereby "notorious"? Isn't that a bit of circular reasoning? So it doesn't appear in books and magazines specialized in webcomics? Well, against that there is no argument - I can only wonder about the quality of such magazines. If this was a book or a game (computer or otherwise) instead of a webcomic this proposal would not even take place. I will end with this: read first the comic from the beginning at <a href="http://www.well-of-souls.com/outsider/outsider000.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.well-of-souls.com/outsider/outsider000.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> to the end, for Chris'sake, compare it with other webcomics, and only then cast your vote. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlamarande_9677.html" title="User:Flamarande">Flamarande</a> 14:57, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

But the article does not fail in any of the flaws you present. It isn't biased, it is easily verifiable (simply go to the site) and I challenge you to show me any original research whatsoever.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I have done some research into how notable this comic is. Most of the online reviews of Outsider appeared in 2001-2002, and are unfortunately no longer accessible. The Outsider was nominated in 2002 for Best Science Fiction Webcomic by the Cartoonist's Choice Awards website (<a href="http://www.ccawards.com/2002.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ccawards.com/2002.htm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>) (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021014134010/ccawards.com/nominations.html" class="external text" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20021014134010/ccawards.com/nominations.html" rel="nofollow">the site was down few hours ago and the nomination can be confirmed in Internat Archive if it happens again</a>). Also, we should note the history and the trends: there were few upates in 2005, which caused the comic rank to plummet down. I can't figure out if Alexa can give me exact details of the rank few years back, but a rough estimate based on the graph suggest it was around 100,000. Also, if you look at the current trend, it seems the fans are flocking back as new pages have been released over the past few weeks. The reach, rank and daily views are increasing at about 50% per three months, so in about a year if this keeps up this comic will be as popular as the 'top dogs' mentioned earlier.--<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font color="green">Talk</font></a></sup> 16:45, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - Thanks for coming up with some research and proper reasoning, I'm sure it'll help others. I'd just like to offer some of my own thoughts on the <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_Cartoonist%27s_Choice_Awards_888a.html" title="Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards">Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards</a>. The bottom line is, I don't think these are notable awards (I haven't nominated winners for deletion, but have done for nominees which didn't win). The thing is, there are just so many categories and nominees, from some afds on Wikipedia, I'm not even sure if the webcomic crowd respect this award. For example, I just took 2 random redlinks on the WCCA article and googled them, I chose "Four Toon Tellers" and "The Tenth Life of Pishio" because I thought they'd be unique names. A google search shows around 70 and 60 unique links for them respectively. Of course, I've not actually looked into these 2 comics, but it's just preliminery stuff. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 00:02, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Note that the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> guideline suggests a webcomic may be notable if it "has won a well known and independent award."

<li><b>Comment:</b> I at least tried to establish notability via the third party publication of one of his comics. Another popular story about him is that he influenced the <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> comicbook by launching a number of severe rants and sending hate mail to the comicbook's authors. However, I couldn't find any verification of said tale. If true, it would make him notable.

<li><b>Question</b> - Can I just clear this up.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I wouldn't go so far as to say "perpetual failure" - he's just one of the (unfortunately large) number of members of the fandom who have a much higher opinion of their own creative talents than most other people do, and is rather more vocal about it than others. Not in the same league of notoriety as, say, Dennis "Quozl" Falk or Bart "Nekobe" Bervoets, neither of whom (thankfully) have articles here. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 09:53, 14 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>He's also not a "perpetual failure" as his art studio does actually make money and all indications seem to say he's actually grown up considerably since his early days on the web. He's even been known to go on the POE forum and talk with those who don't like him. For whatever reason, he's simply gained more noteriety in several large fandoms (Sailor Moon and Sonic, specifically) than most fanfic and fanart creators ever do. Given the size and longevity of the reaction to him (the POE forum is still active and I've found many forum posts about him that are recent), he doesn't seem to be a simple "flash in the pan" notorious figure, but a person almost being used as a textbook/historical example today. That's the best argument for notability I can think of. Whether that's good enough to keep his own article, I don't know. One reason I made it was to see what the consensus might be. I also found an email about the Gonterman writing to <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Penders_a625.html" title="Ken Penders">Ken Penders</a> <a href="http://www.commuterbarnacle.com/gonterman/repas.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.commuterbarnacle.com/gonterman/repas.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>, but it hardly counts as a reliable source, unfortunately.</dd>
<dd>Can we have a consensus on whether he qualifies as an <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_phenomena.html" title="Internet phenomena">Internet phenomena</a>?

<li><b>Neutral</b> - I moved most of this stuff out of the main Kiyosaki article. I agree it is pretty crap. The biggest advantage I see in it now is it stops people filling the main article up with this stuff (particularly Sloth Monkey, who wrote most of what's seen here). I think Kiyosaki is a famous (or perhaps infamous) enough figure to justify this page existing if it's made more neutral, but I have no great hopes of that happening. If you do delete it, please dont cut and paste it back into the main Kiyosaki article, I already condensed most of the information into a blurb there. <a href="../../../t/a/s/User%7ETastyCakes_4007.html" title="User:TastyCakes">TastyCakes</a> 05:47, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am outraged! I cannot believe that this article would be attacked by so much misconception and arbitration! Well thank goodness Wikipedia isn't a democracy; they do things based on policy and what is right. So let's review the policies and the purported violations of such:</p>
<p>- <a href="../../../a/d/s/WP%7EADS_2ee6.html" title="WP:ADS">WP:ADS</a> - This article is NOT an advertisement! If a person exists and they are known to be teaching certain things to people (such as the case with Robert Kiyosaki), then it is NOT an ADVERTISEMENT to simply TELL people about what this person is teaching in an article they are choosing to read because they want to know about what he is teaching. It is the sharing of factual information. Factual? Yes. It is a FACT that Robert Kiyosaki teaches these things. This article does NOT claim that what Kiyosaki teaches is fact. It simply states what he believes!!</p>
<p>- <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> - As stated before, this is factual information. It is a fact that Robert Kiyosaki believes and teaches these things. It is NOT claimed in this article that any of the things which he believes or teaches are factual themselves. He may very well believe things which are wrong and he may very well give bad advice. THAT is up to the reader to decide for themselves. And nowhere in this article does it imply whether or not you should believe the things that Kiyosaki teaches. It simply states WHAT he teaches; not the validity of such. As a matter of fact, Kiyosaki is constantly QUOTED in this article, so as to retain an exact reiteration of what he teaches. Telling people EXACTLY WHAT HE SAYS, and only that, is by no means inserting any sort of opinion other than Kiyosaki's.</p>
<p>- <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> - Reliable sources? Are you kidding me?! How could anyone claim that the sources are not cited? All throughout the article is says exactly where information come from. It ALL comes DIRECTLY from Robert Kiyosaki! It is a reiteration of the things he teaches. That is the entire point of this article; for someone who wants to read about what Kiyosaki teaches and be aware of what he says, this accomplishes exactly that; by quoting him and summarizing exactly what HE HIMSELF says. The source? Robert Kiyosaki! The specific sources? Yes that is listed as well. You see all over the article things like "(Kiyosaki, <i>Cashflow The E-Game</i>)" or "–Robert Kiyosaki 2002 <i>Retire Young, Retire Rich</i>".</p>
<p>I wrote this article almost entirely by myself. I did so by personally going through Kiyosaki's material (audiobooks, computer games, etc.) and summarizing/quoting exactly what he teaches. I have spent an enormous amount of time on this article; many, many days. And I feel I have contributed greatly to Wikipedia in doing so. I have produced something which is difficult (if not impossible) to find anywhere, much less previously on Wikipedia; I have made a very thorough documentation encompassing as much as possible of (while still summarizing) what Robert Kiyosaki teaches. Now anyone can simply visit Wikipedia if they want to have a good understanding of what Kiyosaki teaches people and his (HIS, not my) opinions on things. That is the purpose of this article; it accomplished it well; and in writing it, I have complied with Wikipedia's guidelines.</p>

Secondly, I cannot believe the lack of support shown here for having a complete, thorough account of the subject at hand. If someone were to want to learn about what Robert Kiyosaki believes and teaches to his students, this explains exactly that; and it does it well. A short concise summary of this, as seen on the main article on Robert Kiyosaki, does what it's supposed to: it provides a quick summary. It does not however provide anywhere near the amount of information shown here; obviously. To say that this article should be replaced by a short summary, is to degrade the very idea of Wikipedia. Wikipedia provides a wealth of information. It does not simply cover each given subject with a short summary with little to no elaboration or explanation. --<a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESloth_monkey_6488.html" title="User:Sloth monkey">sloth_monkey</a> 00:31, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I urge the closing admin to remember the following (taken from <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to deletion</a>): "Wikipedia is not a democracy and <a href="../../../m/a/j/Majority_voting.html" title="Majority voting">majority voting</a> is not the determining factor in whether a nomination succeeds or not."

<p>I point this out for obvious reasons. Many people in this discussion are voting to have this article deleted. I believe they are presenting this notion based on faulty reasoning and an incomplete picture of the facts. Please review the article for what it is (Teachings of Robert Kiyosaki). I believe it to be in compliance with Wikipedia's guidelines, as well as a very good, elaborative source of information on this topic. Reducing it to a mere summary would not nearly do it justice.

<p><b>Comment</b>. I would like to point out a possibility here. There are those who view this article to be little more than an "advertisement" for the man Robert Kiyosaki and his various money making endeavors, such as his "educational" material or motivational speaking. I would say that this belief stems from the opinion that Robert Kiyosaki is not to be taken seriously. If this were an article on Harvard University, the support for an elaborate explanative article on the subject would be much higher, simply because people respect the university as an established source of education; you wouldn’t see an objection to such an elaboration as seen here in this article. The point is that it is merely a subjective opinion that this subject (the “education” provided by Kiyosaki) does not deserve to be elaborated on, whereas another source of education would. It would be unfair and unequal treatment to arbitrarily decide that Kiyosaki is not a good source of information/education and therefore does not deserve to have his teachings explained in an article here.</p>
<p>Please consider that while some may view this article to be overly elaborate, it does still simply provide a <i>summary</i> of the different subjects which Kiyosaki teaches. It is still just a summary; but a more useful one than the concise summary provided on the main Kiyosaki article (his bio). I believe all of the information presented here is needed in order to provide a more complete understanding of what Kiyosaki teaches and his meaning in what he says, so as to not misrepresent his work with inadequate information. I have made use of direct quotes from Kiyosaki in order to deliver the most NPOV representation of his work possible. Also, as stated before, I have certainly cited my sources throughout the article.</p>
<p>Considering all of this, the only reason I could see someone would say to have this article deleted is because of mere <i>preference</i>, in that they do not think what Kiyosaki has to say is worth listening to. Well I say it is up to the reader to decide this. Not the people here. --<a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESloth_monkey_6488.html" title="User:Sloth monkey">sloth_monkey</a> 17:15, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment</b>. Additionally, I would like to add that for the sake of balance, there <i>is</i> a section on criticism and contraversy regarding the teachings of Robert Kiyosaki. This article is on Kiyosaki's main bio (<a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Kiyosaki_8793.html" title="Robert Kiyosaki">Robert Kiyosaki</a>). Presented here in this article (Teachings of Robert Kiyosaki) is simply the advice/information as he gives it. No opinion on whether or not it is good advice/information is given here in this article. --<a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESloth_monkey_6488.html" title="User:Sloth monkey">sloth_monkey</a> 17:15, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment</b>. If the closing admin decides that there are too many external links in this article and that it should be considered a mild form of spam, then by all means delete/modify the links. I don't care about them really. But consider that they were put there with the intention of being helpful and giving people additional material to review on other web sites; not for any reason related to spamming/promoting. --<a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESloth_monkey_6488.html" title="User:Sloth monkey">sloth_monkey</a> 21:54, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment</b>. Thank you for pointing out a possible reason for delete votes. After reconsideration, and although the 45 page critique is better written and probably more accurate than his books, merging <b>objective</b> descriptions of his teachings into the article about him is probably the best way to go. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 15:37, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm sick of this article being trolled. It's full of lies and nonsense. My justification for making a third nomination is that my circumstances have changed significantly since the last AfDs - I have resigned from the Board of Trustees of the Wikimedia Foundation.

<li>Oh, dear, I'm worried about your resignation not being enough for the people that believe you're encyclopedic... Something like "she was member of the BoT, but later resigned" =(. Since I think you're not encyclopedic (sorry =)) and keeping this article <b>do harm someone</b> indeed (you), I would <b>delete</b> it. I think she's not notable, she agrees, and doesn't like the effects of being mentioned in WP ("Why are popular people popular? - Because they appear on TV. - Why do they appear on TV? - Because they are popular!"). WP couldn't have an article on me just because every wikipedian would like the idea. I'm not popular, and certainly wouldn't like to be mentioned here. So I understand Angela.

<li><b>Comment:</b> This is a tricky case, and could be an important precedent. I hope you don't mind if I break the flow of the AfD to respond in some more detail. Let's pretend for a moment that this project was completely unreleated to Wikipedia and Wikimedia, because I don't think that should have any influence one way or another.
<p>Angela is borderline notable like many people associated with Wikipedia. Take the people associated with the German chapter and the German Wikipedia, some of whom (e.g. Kurt Jansson) have toured national media, spoken at important conferences, or accepted important awards on behalf of the Foundation many times. Or take Danny Wool, Brion Vibber, Tim Starling, all of whom are doing critical work for the Foundation on a full-time salary (Brion in particular has also spoken about this work at many occasions, including a speech at Google which is available on <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7747790812939045407" class="external text" title="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7747790812939045407" rel="nofollow">Google Video</a>). None of them has, or should have, an article. This is because Wikipedia is essentially a <i>media magnet</i>: it's such a buzzword that it's very easy to be interviewed, invited to conferences about it, etc. When does a person associated with Wikimedia become notable then? I would argue that the moment their <i>personal role</i> in the project becomes the center of media reports, and not just once, but on a regular basis, we need to re-evaluate our assessment.</p>
<p>Wikimedia alone would make it a borderline case. Certainly, she's historically been a very important asset for the Foundation, and being on the Board is in some ways a highly distinguished position. However, the judgment of her significance is one that should be independently established. Wikia makes the situation somewhat more complicated. Angela is the co-founder, and the company has received $4 million venture capital. It would not exist without her, and already hosts several notable wikis, including <a href="../../../u/n/c/Uncyclopedia.html" title="Uncyclopedia">Uncyclopedia</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memory_Alpha_f337.html" title="Memory Alpha">Memory Alpha</a> (over 1,500 wikis overall). She is not the CEO of the company; however, she does play a critical management role. Angela has made the point in the past that it's not yet clear whether the company is successful. Financially speaking, that is certainly true.</p>
<p>Looking at other articles in the same space, such as <a href="../../../w/e/t/Wetpaint.html" title="Wetpaint">Wetpaint</a> or <a href="../../../p/e/a/PeanutButterWiki_461a.html" title="PeanutButterWiki">PeanutButterWiki</a>, we don't have articles about their CEO or key personnel, though arguably, Wikia is larger and already more successful. I would say that Wikia makes Angela notable enough that it's not a closed and shut case, i.e. her notability should at the very least be re-evaluated a year from now.</p>
<p>Given that it's a borderline case where reasonable people can argue either way, I would say that the subject's opinion should be the decisive criterion. I believe we've already done this in a couple of recent cases. I've actually seen the same argument made for <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a>, but there I think the notability (NameBase founder, Google Watch founder, very prominent WP critic, activist) is much more clearly established. But, we need to be careful not to give Angela preferential treatment because she is a Wikimedian, and the "troll magnet" argument shouldn't weigh too strongly either. Whatever precedent we establish here needs to be applied consistently to other articles. As noted above, I vote for <b>delete and re-evaluate in one year</b> right now, with the rationale: "borderline case, subject requests it to be deleted." I might be convinced to change my vote to "keep", though.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 14:52, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>What I mean is that one of our policies should be: If the subject of a borderline biography does not want an article about themselves in Wikipedia, we should respect that.

<li>I think that it then hinges on the definition of "borderline" notability -- is Seth borderline? Is Angela? Is Brandt? I must admit that the Wikia argument weighs rather strongly in favor of keeping the bio, though it remains true that Wikia's financial viability is not yet proven.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 22:04, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Correction: I don't want a *Wikipedia* article. That's NOT synonymous with "*encyclopia* article". And I believe the latter way of phrasing it frames my objection in an extremely misleading way. If at all possible, I'd rather opt-out of being a target of trolls, flamers, and vandals. This seems to me to be an eminently reasonable position. To describe it as a *general* not wanting "an encyclopedia article" makes me sound like some sort of Thomas Pynchon style recluse, which will strike many people as very unreasonable. Normal encyclopedias do not allow anyone in the world to use them as attack platforms. That matters. -- Seth Finkelstein 16:36, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>But they should have the same rights as anybody else to nominate an article for deletion (whether it is about them or not) and, since they are <i>the</i> authority in the case of their own bio, their opinion has to carry some weight (unless we accuse them of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>).

If we wish to change that practice, we should do so in a general policy/guideline discussion, which might be a good idea - if someone is truly of encyclopedic importance, it will be possible to write a good article on them after they are dead, and we are never going to have articles on everything we intend to cover - but the change ought to be to tighten the standards for all living people, not just those who ask for their page to be deleted. Her argument is that the article attracts vandals - that was the exact same argument made by Seth at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Seth_Finkelstein_8b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Seth Finkelstein">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Seth Finkelstein</a>, where we didn't listen to him because he met <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

Because we can't filter out Wikipedia in searching for her, parsing search results is challenging, but there are enough results that show her as a public speaker that she is notable.

But obviously we have failed with this biography, which I think is a shame. We're unable to protect from trolling junk. I think this deletion sets a sad, but unavoidable precedent. If this is deleted, we must now honor all similiar requests by the "notable but not famous". Also, if we make this permanently fully protected as deleted (or redirected), we certainly have no justification for denying at least permanent semi-protection to any other living biography with problems.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I'd keep a scary proportion of relatively long-deceased people so long as their articles were very well-sourced (long-forgotten local bigwigs of no national importance and little lasting legacy are A-OK by me). I guess at least it's conceivable that a local history buff could find such articles worthwhile; and even if they are rarely edited that'd be fine since there'd be relatively little fresh source information to draw on anyway. Even if nobody looked at it for 5 years, it may turn out to be just the obscure person that the next reader was looking for, and to find a well-referenced article on the subject could be extremely useful to them. On the other hand, when faced with a modern person (and at the back of my mind the fact they don't want to be listed lingers) I set the bar far higher. The absurdly poor state of this article, the poor referencing etc. is, in theory, a matter for cleanup not AFD. But still part of me thinks: what's the point of cleaning this article up? What information, or useful way of seeing information, will be saved by doing so? Miss Beesley has played a part, if we wish to aggrandize ourselves, in shaping the history of the internet, but only as a cog in the bigger machine of the Foundation and the online communities she has interacted with. This article will never explain, nor should it attempt to, the way that cog turned, the gears it meshed with, the times things ran smoothly, and the times more oil should have been applied... that would all fall short of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> (at least until some biographies get published, but heck, I doubt that'll happen any time soon, and no, a blog does <i>not</i> count as a "serial biography"). Without that, though, I'm afraid there's really nothing left to be said. <i>That</i> was precisely what her role in "notable" history has been. We can have her date of birth (ooh, is that a reference I can see for it? Ummm... no) and place of birth (aha, a reference! oops, my mistake) and even find out which university she went to (so long as you'll believe anything you'll see uncited in an encyclopedia that "anyone can edit"). Oh yes, and she has the sort of picture that drive anon IPs to leave unwholesome messages on her talk page; but so long as we don't go down the <a href="../../../../de/index.html" class="extiw" title="de:">de:</a> route and scrap fair use images entirely, they can always check out a certain J. Wales's former employees instead. In summary, what would be lost from leaving an unlinked "Angela Beesley", heck, even an "A. Beesley", in the articles where she's relevant? I can't see any "notable information loss". And deleting articles like this is a surefire way to boost our average factual accuracy. And indeed, to get back closer to the "anyone can edit" philosophy (which Angela would espouse, I am sure), so long as the back end of that was an "and also anyone can nominate non-notable living people biographies for deletion". <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 09:37, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Angela is a public figure who deserves an article. Firstly, "I'm sick of this article being trolled. It's full of lies and nonsense" is not a good enough reason to delete an article, it is reason to fix and watch an article. Secondly, I don't think the person whom the article is about should ever request AfD themselves, it is a request of special treatment. Under NPOV thinking we should never grant such requests to friends (and non-friends) of Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldakQuill_3b15.html" title="User:OldakQuill">Oldak</a> <a href="../../../o/l/d/User_talk%7EOldakQuill_6507.html" title="User talk:OldakQuill">Quill</a> 10:58, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>...I concur with the likelihood of notability around Wikia, and believe a lot of notability remains from her association with Wikimedia. I disagree with the premise that resignation does not reduce one's notability. For a living person, part of one's notability is their potential for future action. Thus, being in an ongoing association with an organization ties you to that organization's notability. Removing that link causes you to evaluate their past actions (and possibly their impact on the future success of the organization) and determine notability on that basis. This is one of the reasons that many above feel Wikia is a basis for notability...it is notable in and of itself, and Angela is (at this point) intrinsically linked to its future success / failure.--<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeJ9919_0983.html" title="User:MikeJ9919">MikeJ9919</a> 18:35, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

In favour of the "Keep" position, I am concerned about the precedent of allowing an article to be deleted at the request of its subject - if someone who considers herself not to be "notable" can make such a request, what is there to prevent persons who are unquestionably notable from making similar requests? What about persons who were once well known, but have since faded from the limelight? Against that, I have to note that Angela is someone I personally like and respect, and I don't feel good about thwarting her repeated requests for the deletion of what is, after all, an infringement on her privacy.

<li><b>Comment</b> As I understand it, Angela is unhappy with <i>"lies and nonsense"</i> which she says have been inserted into (previous versions of?) her wikibio. OTH, since she appears to have been a leading Wikipedian for many years who was involved in various key decisions (or non-decisions), it seems that many users agree that there is a legitimate need to keep some basic factual information about her available somewhere in this website.&#160;:As I understand it, Angela's motivation for the AfD nom is that reverting bad edits to this article has grown too wearisome for the Wikipedia community--- yet permanently protecting it in a minimalist state which provides only the most basic factual information would be seen as an admission that the traditional description of Wikipedia as an "on-line encyclopedia <i>which anyone can edit</i>" cannot be sustained.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I happen to believe that the WP community must indeed muster the courage to publically admit that indeed, <i>which anyone can edit</i> is inconsistent with the goal of building a reliable encyclopedia, and that this policy needs to be rescinded. Be this as it may, I see a third alternative:
<ul>
<li>create a new namespace for write protected pages offering essential items like a mission statement, privacy statement, basic information about the principals of WikiMedia and the operation of Wikipedia</li>
<li>put a page giving essential information about Angela and her service on the Board in this new namespace,</li>
<li>delete the unprotected wikibio</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>By the way: I realize that Angela is not leaving WP, just resigning from the Board, but I'd like to see a policy or even a guideline on "graceful exits". That is, it seems that sooner or later, most contributors, even formerly very active contributors, do decide to leave WP. In such cases, there is reason to keep their user pages around for a year or more, but it might be well to protect their user page(s) on request in a designated area, for example in a case where the former contributor has left as the result of some acrimonious dispute with vandals. Or create a WikiProject whose members agree to let a bot add to their watchlist the user pages of departed Wikipedians and these users would then monitor for and revert any vandalism (former users could request the bot to sign them up for this service). No doubt there are other possibilities. ---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 21:59, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

If the article <i>is</i> deleted, perhaps it can be replaced by a simple redirect to a wikimedia.org page describing your former role on the board?

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm confused at the suggestion that deleting the article will set a precedent for the deletion of articles based upon the subject's wishes. First, Articles for Deletion is not precedent based. A precedent that I'm actually concerned about is people resigning or declining leadership positions in Wikipedia and the Foundation because they have had, or are worried about, their privacy being invaded. Also, while human decency, in my opinion, requires us to consider an article's impact on the subject, another very good reason for deleting the article has been given, lack of notability. Finally, having an encyclopedia article on a person, when he or she never would have had one if he or she had not been involved with Wikipedia and Wikimedia is more damaging to Wikipedia's credibility than deleting an article for humanitarian reasons, which we do not even have to resort to in this case because of the lack of notability. Far too much weight is placed on certain subjects on Wikipedia, like Pokemon, Star Wars, the free software movement and Wikipedia itself. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 03:55, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

There's also precedence here: Brian Peppers is only known within internet humor sites, and virtually nowhere else, so his article was deleted. (Not that I'm comparing Angela to Brian Peppers.)

<dd>I would probably agree with anyone who complains that <i>far too many</i> bios of not truly notable persons are kept following AfD discussions. I would even agree that those who say that Angela is notable mostly only at Wikipedia (but she is <i>very</i> notable for users of this website!--- which just happens to be one of the most used websites in the world). And I think those who fear an invasion of privacy of major Wikipedia figures who might prefer more anonymity have a point. Certainly I would not support a gratitious invasion of privacy at this or any other website. But I sense that many of the voters for deletion in this particular AfD would vote differently if it were anyone but Angela who was asking, and setting a precedent for some kind of double standard seems like a bad idea. Above I tried to suggest some compromises between outright deletion and keeping the article as an unprotected wikibio. One of my simplest suggestions would be to replace the bio with a redirect to a wikimedia.org page describing Angela's service on the Board and simply permanently protecting this redirect. Wouldn't a permament redirect be less obtrusive than a permanent notice warning against attempts to recreate an article called <i>Angela Beesley</i>? ---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 04:06, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: so she's notable because she co-founded some web page (Wikia) and because of her involvement in WP and its derived foundation. Well, IMO that doesn't give notability for anyone in the real world, where people still watch news on TV instead of in Wikinews. But OK, some people believe she's notable, she's awesome, etc., so let's have an article about her. I don't care about <i>having</i> the article. But, <b>what can we put in that article?</b> I doubt there can ever be a non-stub article about her. Her birthdate, nationality, birthplace, living place, her boyfriend, or even her photo have nothing to do with what (suposedly) makes her notable: they're tabloid info, not encyclopedic info. And still with that info, the article isn't but a stub. I don't mind having an article about her. It's just we have <b>not</b> an article, and I cannot think of a way for it to become an article. That's what happens with non-notable people, IMO. That's why I consider she isn't notable enough. And the fact our wannabe-article acts like a tabloid, not only being non-encyclopedic, but doing damage, is why I decided to participate in this debate. I could add that Angela's opinion doesn't move me anymore than any other's opinion about their own article, since I know about her only because of her WP article.

<dd><b>Reply</b>. A distinction is already made between notable and non-notable individuals. That distinction is whether or not they get articles at all. "Minorly notable" is still notable. Vandalism occurence is not a determining factor in deletion arguments, unless the page itself was created solely as a vandalism/trolling page. This isn't.</dd>
<dd>Angela's argument is also based on the idea that a subject ceases to deserve an article once they stop holding the office that made them notable. Wouldn't this also apply to former <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Congress_8653.html" title="United States Congress">United States Congressmen</a>? For example, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_D._Carey_0fc0.html" title="Robert D. Carey">Robert D. Carey</a>, Republican representative from the state of Wyoming in the early 1920's, no longer holds office, and his only claim to notability was that office. Further, he's dead, meaning his current influence is effectively null. Yes, I recognize there is a difference in the notability holding a governorship gives you vs. being on a board at a company, but if formerly held offices don't count as notability criteria, then Angela is actually more notable than Robert Carey at this point in time. If we are to be a timeless repository of knowledge, then formerly held offices should be weighed on the same scale as currently held offices. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 20:18, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Per Jorge Luis Borges "These ambiguities, redundancies and deficiencies remind us of those which doctor Franz Kuhn attributes to a certain Chinese encyclopaedia entitled 'Celestial Empire of benevolent Knowledge'. In its remote pages it is written that the animals are divided into: (a) belonging to the emperor, (b) embalmed, (c) tame, (d) sucking pigs, (e) sirens, (f) fabulous, (g) stray dogs, (h) included in the present classification, (i) frenzied, (j)innumerable, (k) drawn with a very fine camelhair brush, (l) et cetera, (m) having just broken the water pitcher, (n) that from a long way off look like flies.". So if people can be divided into notable and non-notable, they can also be divided into majorly notable and minorly notable, as well as living and dead, with the living minor notable respected in a wish to opt-out. There should be a balance between being a timeless repository of knowledge, and a present repository of trollery -- Seth Finkelstein 20:54, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

And in my opinion, the conclusions are the same: the wishes of the subject of an article as to its existance or nonexistance do not over-rule the policy and notability criteria. If I want to have an article about myself, but I am not notable, no amount of me protesting will get it included. If I don't want to have an article about me, but am notable, the same thing applies. The trolling is regretable, but until we develop the software to read the minds of editors and determine whether they are acting in good faith or not, it is a necessary evil for the continued existance of the Wikipedia project as a whole. Perhaps our most relevant rule here, however, is <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>. Which is an official policy, I might add. You don't own articles which are <i>about</i> you any more than you do those you <i>wrote</i>. An opt-out system would violate this rule. Also, I think we have a slight <a href="../../../s/e/t/Seth_Finkelstein_6930.html" title="Seth Finkelstein">conflict of interests</a> here. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 21:54, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Forgive me, I've lost track of what's being disputed factually, versus what's being recommended as a wise course of action. Are we agreed or disagreed that a reasonable categorization distinction can be made involving degrees of notability, and interests of living people? That is, are you arguing this material cannot be taken into account for some significant reason? Or that even though it's possible, it should not matter - which can't be justified self-referentially, because that's exactly the point of dispute here? Remember, <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_binding_decisions_c105.html" title="Wikipedia:No binding decisions">Wikipedia:No_binding_decisions</a> is also official policy. A reasonable opt-out is merely a recognition that sometimes "do no harm" is the best policy. By the way, there's something deeply scary if not wanting to be trolled disqualifies me from participating in a policy-related discussion as to whether or not people should have to endure being trolled. -- Seth Finkelstein 22:59, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>An argument could be made that there is a difference between those who are majorly notable vs. those who are minorly notable or notable only within a small field. You can obviously group people into whether they like the idea of having a WP article about them or not as well. The disagreement is over whether it matters, or more precisely, whether in a project such as Wikipedia the subject of an article has (or should have) any more say than any other editor as to what happens with that article. In my mind, I look at this AfD, and I read the reasons why it is being proposed for deletion. Judging from the reasons given, I come to the conclusion that the nominator and deletion voters do not provide enough support for deletion, given the passing of two previous AfD noms, meeting the notability criteria, etc.</dd>
<dd>I would re-evaluate my vote in light of a policy or guideline change, but at this time, I do not believe that the name of the nominator for an article's deletion has any bearing on whether it should be deleted, as that would violate <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> as well as the common sense principle of impartiality. Unless your name is Jimbo the human supermajority (and I say that with no animosity towards him, as I recognize the need for "divine intervention" occasionally), you have the same vote and obligation to go along with consensus as everyone else does. "Do no harm" is not violated by the <i>existance</i> of this article, just by the trolls, which can be easily rectified. In fact, given the current semi-protection and the multiple people (including myself) who have doubtless watchlisted the page as a result of this debate, your concerns about vandalism will probably no longer be an issue no matter what the decision of this debate is.</dd>
<dd>On the conflict of interests, I did not intend to imply you shouldn't participate, clearly you are just as entitled to do so as I. I was merely suggesting caution, and that you might wish to objectively think over what your answer would be to <i>this</i> AfD if it weren't for your own article. No offense intended, and I realize I may have been slightly hypocritical to point this out, for which I apologize. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 23:44, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Apology accepted, and similar apology tendered for any harshness on my part. If you read above where I made my actual vote, I outlined my ethical reasoning. My position is of course affected by my experiences, but the outcome is logically self-consistent - all living people of minor notability who want to opt-out should have their wishes respected. If it takes finally affecting someone "inside" the circles of power, to spark enough debate which results in some positive change, well, it wouldn't be the first time that a problem had to hit an insider before it was addressed, whereas outsiders were blown-off. Of course, *only* addressing it for the insider would be the worst of all worlds. But I'd rather this all lead to some rethinking of what I view as a bad policy, rather than having that bad policy continue on.</dd>
<dd>There's a difference between wanting to micromanage one's biography, and not wanting to have to patrol and clean up after mudslinging. <a href="../../../i/n/t/Wikipedia%7EInterpret_all_rules_7caa.html" title="Wikipedia:Interpret all rules">Wikipedia:Interpret_all_rules</a> should support a distinction between these two types of objections. Telling people not to be control-freaks is worlds apart from telling them they have been chosen to be part of a grand experiment in having trolling, defamation, libel, lying, smears, and vandalism, directed at them, but it's settled policy that they can't decline. -- Seth Finkelstein 03:47, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I would suggest what you should do is write a policy proposal in which you outline all of your arguments. If your policy passed, it would solve this entire issue in one fell swoop, while even if it were turned down, so long as it had a decent minority who supported it, it could be left as an essay. Essays may not be policy but the popular ones do carry a good bit of weight, especially on the less by-the-book processes such as deletion review. Also, you may be able to find an ally in the form of <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">User:Herostratus</a>'s <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_EVIL_85b9.html" title="WP:NOT EVIL">WP:NOT EVIL</a> proposal/essay. This is an issue that needs to be decisively addressed eventually, and now would be as good a time as any. It would be much better to have this addressed by consensus rather than <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Divine intervention</a>--<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 04:27, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yep. I hate to say it and this is not Angela's doing (I would hope and do assume) but lots of these <i>delete</i> votes smack to me of folks, aware of it or not, who are mushing up to a member of Wikia who has a perceived, pervasive influence (true or not, resigned from WP or not). People are afraid to say so openly is all, for fear of falling out of favour, getting banned or whatever. Anyway Wikipedia is one of the highest traffic sites on the Internet and she's part of the story, which is already historic (one way or another) and that's encyclopedic. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 22:12, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I wouldn't say it's out of any sort of fear so much as respect. Rather ironically, the fact that she is a notable individual (especially one involved with wikis), the very reason she should be included in the first place, results in people respecting her. This respect makes people give credence to her opinions, which in turn makes them vote with her in her claim to not be notable. It's almost a paradox, a situation in which your accomplishments allow you to claim that those accomplishments are unimportant. However, what I was refering to by conflict of interests is the fact that, according to the mailing list, User:Seth Finkelstein also has an article, <a href="../../../s/e/t/Seth_Finkelstein_6930.html" title="Seth Finkelstein">Seth Finkelstein</a>, which he wants removed due to trolling. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 22:39, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

And notability can only increase with time, as far as I'm concerned, never decrease, even if I did care about it: the number of <i>new</i> media references to her, for instance, will decrease, but the number of <i>old</i> ones will never fall.

<li><b>Comment</b>: the best next thing would be Angela taking an important decision based on this article not being deleted, so the article could say it, and doing so, self-reference not merely WP, but itself! "blablabla because of this article not being deleted from Wikipedia." References could be added pointing to the AfD discussions. At least, that would be encyclopedic, being related to the cause of her "notability": WP. That is, it wouldn't be <b>trivia</b>. BTW, anybody knows what's the name of her pet? And anybody heard about <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>? If in some years she becomes notable enough for someone to do a research about her (for, say, writing her bio), he would find the same info we've found about her, in the same places we've found it. And then, we could make a serious encyclopedic, third source, article about her. Don't fear for that info to be lost because of deleting our article.

<li>'<b>Delete</b>. I submitted the page for deletion, so my vote for delete probably speaks for itself. For the admin who reviews this, a couple of thoughts ... 1. on the David Tench discussion page someone has already noted that " ... the shows producers or Network Ten are clearly using wikipedia as a means of promotio ... if they continue reverting the content to marketroid speak I think this page needs locking or deletion .." and 2. two of the <i>Keep</i> votes on this page contain identical text ... "It is a TV show. It is coming soon." and "it's a TV show. And it's coming soon." ... given one of them is anonymously logged, it's not unreasonable to suggest that both keep votes come from the same source. The show, if and when it airs, should be recorded by Wikipedia, but under it's correct program title, and not under the banner of the network's pre-broadcast marketing.

<dl>
<dd>1. <b>I am not the same person:</b> Hang on... So because I re-iterate a comment someone made before, I'm suddenly the same person now? For the admin who decides this, please assume good faith and disregard Whoby's statement that everyone who wants this article kept is the same person (the same way I assume that everyone who raises Crystal Ball is not a Whoby sock-puppet). For the record, I do not work for Channel 10 or any associated media group. I simply came here to see if Wikipedia knew anything more about "David Tench" than I did.</dd>
<dd>2. <b>This is not Crystal Balling:</b> The reality is that David Tench IS an upcoming TV show. This is a verified fact. The show is coming soon (within the next month or so if the information we have to go by is correct). The article on <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thank_God_You%27re_Here_97fa.html" title="Thank God You're Here">Thank God You're Here</a> started as nothing more than a stub <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thank_God_You%27re_Here&amp;oldid=46542955" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thank_God_You%27re_Here&amp;oldid=46542955" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> 5 days before the show premiered (which was the same time information was known about what it would be) and certainly not "2 years after it had plots and characters". As I also said before <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a> takes this into consideration quite clearly in its opening line where it states <i>All articles about anticipated events must be verifiable, and the subject matter must be of sufficiently wide interest that it would merit an article if the event had already occurred.</i>. This event is verifiable and the subject matter (a TV show) would be of sufficiently wide interest that it would merit an article had it already aired.</dd>
<dd>3. <b>People are coming here for this information:</b> It is clear that people are coming to Wikipedia to find more information about this show. What's better, nothing or a stub which clearly states "this is an upcoming TV show which Andrew Denton is behind"? If you delete the article now, it will be re-created in a few short months with the information about the marketing campaign likely mentioned under an appropriate sub-heading. Deleting the article now achieves nothing other than disappointing those who come here looking for what little further information there currently is. Yes, let's keep the marketing copy out of it (like we do many other Wikipedia articles). Yes, let's keep it to what we can verify. But no, let's not delete it simply to have it re-created a few days later when more information comes out. And if at such time a new name for the tv show becomes known, it is a simple matter to move the page to the correct title at that time. <a href="../../../y/a/y/User%7EYay_unto_the_Chicken_3d1a.html" title="User:Yay unto the Chicken">Yay unto the Chicken</a> 00:42, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Question: is David Tench a TV show or a person in a TV show? As I have said, when and if the show materialises it will get its due, but Wikipedia explicitly says it should not be used as a marketing or advertising service. This isn't a question of what you want, or what I want, it's very, very simple: Wikipedia has rules, and the David Tench entry seems in clear breach of them. IF the character of David Tench becomes noteworthy AFTER the show launches, then he (like the show) will get his due. The issue here is that Channel Ten are trying to use Wikipedia as part of their pre-launch viral marketing campaign. They've said as much in Australian newspapers. If people are curious about the ads, they can Google them. That's what Google is for. (<a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWhoby_3650.html" title="User:Whoby">Whoby</a> 02:08, 13 July 2006 (UTC))</li>

<dd>"<b>Is David Tench a TV show or a person in a TV show?</b>". David Tench is "[a] character [who] will be bringing a talk show to Channel Ten later in the year" <a href="http://www.chaser.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3193&amp;Itemid=44" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chaser.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3193&amp;Itemid=44" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>. Whether the show is named after that character is yet to be known. If and when enough information about the character and the TV show warrant a separate article on both, then that will occur in due course. For now, a single article which refers to both is sufficient.</dd>
<dd>"<b>Wikipedia explicitly says it should not be used as a marketing or advertising service</b>". In what way does the current article advertise or market the program? Its current revision <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Tench" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Tench" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> states the known facts, discusses the marketing campaign and has example quotes from that campaign. As per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a soapbox</a>, Wikipedia's "rules" state "Articles about companies and products are acceptable if they are written in an objective and unbiased style". IMHO, the article currently meets that requirement. Wikipedia is allowed to talk about marketing campaigns (<a href="../../../p/e/p/Pepsi_Challenge_6d4a.html" title="Pepsi Challenge">Pepsi Challenge</a>).</dd>
<dd>"<b>IF the character of David Tench becomes noteworthy AFTER the show launches, then he (like the show) will get his due</b>". My argument is that the expected event is of sufficient interest that an article is warranted now. We know it is about an upcoming Television show. We know the event is going to happen. We have no reason to believe otherwise or assume this is a hoax. Such television shows (like upcoming films) are notable articles. No, I don't like that Channel 10 are trying to use Wikipedia as a marketing tool. However, like many other pages on Wikipedia whom people choose to abuse, it is up to the rest of us to ensure that non-biased, verifiable information is present and that all links to non-verified "fan-sites" or "presumed official sites" are removed, along with speculation. We should not delete the whole article simply because Channel 10 has chosen to abuse it. <a href="../../../y/a/y/User%7EYay_unto_the_Chicken_3d1a.html" title="User:Yay unto the Chicken">Yay unto the Chicken</a> 03:24, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I agree to the previous post. Someone please rebutt. Also note that a new commercial has come out stating that David Tench is a character on the show.

<li>And when the show launches, it will duly get an entry under its title. And if the character of David Tench is interesting or noteworthy, he might get one too.

<li>So far, there has been one mention of this in the Sydney Daily Telegraph television column.

But more bits and pieces are leaking out about the show which, for fun, let's call David Tench At Ten, Tench being the host of the show." There is very little hard information available about the show with a source speculating that the host will be different with speculation that Tench may be animated ala <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Headroom_f725.html" title="Max Headroom">Max Headroom</a>. The short article concludes "The show will be recorded Thursdays at Fox Studios and an August start is tipped."

<li><b>Keep</b> i agree with the idea of stubbing it rather than deleting it only to recreate it later. it is still an article of obvious interest - i myself went here after seeing the ads; there is no problem describing a marketing campaign <b>unbiasedly</b> (which is another discussion altogether); and i feel wikipedia has no problem being an evolving organism that is to have a "David Tench" page for the show and person before details of the show with a probably different name and therefore article, to be filled in later, have surfaced.

<li>Wikipedia is about putting together verifiable information about things. The article can be nothing more than a series of speculations until the show comes out, in this name or another. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 02:25, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep'</b> This page will just come back when the show airs anyway, with infromation about the viral marketing. People will only come to this page after they've seen the ads, this wont help the viral marketing.

<li>Wikipedia does not seem to be able to find verifiable references for this show.

<li><b>Keep</b> I came to wikipedia to find out more about the show and so have other people. Someone is going to recreate the article later when the show airs. Other future television programs are allowed to have their own article then why not this one? Erica Wellance 00:56, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>After the show screens the article could have some content, instead of being full of uncited <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">weasel words</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 02:25, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> As far as I can see, as long as the article stays neutural, it's not providing advertising for Channel Ten. There have been new ads-I only manged to see the end of one, but it does appear that David Tench is going to host/star in a show. This article is not doing anyone any harm, and as long as it doesn't turn into a list of speculations, it seems fine for Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunny01_2d2f.html" title="User:Gunny01">Gunny01</a> 05:56, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The article as it has been all along has been uncited speculation. Citing a "Chaser" article and putting up a screenshot of one of the advertisements are not enough to keep an article within the core policies of wikipedia, notably, the verifiability policy and the no original research policy. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 02:25, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The article contains absolutely no information. In its current state, where all it says is that he was an actor, it would indicate that Barnard Hughes is not noteworthy enough to be listed on the notable deaths page. Evan Carlstrom 03:27, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Keep. It hasn't been expanded yet, but it will. He's a tony-award winner and an emmy-award winner. I don't know enough about him (other than face recognition and the fact that he played the old guy on Blossom) to expand the article without relying on obits and IMDB, but I think it'll expand in the upcoming days, the way a lot of thin articles do in the wake of the subject's death. <a href="../../../w/e/n/User%7EWencer_1fd5.html" title="User:Wencer">Wencer</a> 03:33, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Definitely Keep and Expand</b> His acting credibility is enough that it should expand very rapidly. I'm surprised it hasn't already. One thing I did note that I was going to add myself was the original list of his movies did not include Doc Hollywood (1991) or Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit, both of which were supporting roles, but very crucial roles. → --<a href="../../../a/t/h/User%7EAthosmr_0bd3.html" title="User:Athosmr">AthosMR</a> 12:12, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

This article is <i>unverified:</i> there's no source for any of this information in this article, other than the implicit primary source. Additionally, this article is <i>unverifiable</i>: there's little to no independent commentary on these weapons, outside of how-to guides.</p>
<p>There's constant how-to advice; a couple examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Human weapons, however, are more effective than plasma-based weaponry against skin and flesh, making them more useful when shields are down, and ideal against the Flood."</li>
<li>"As with other weapons, the sniper rifle is most effective when used for head shots, which kill targets in one hit."</li>
<li>"Similarly to other human weapons, turrets are best used in bursts rather than prolonged periods of fire."</li>
<li>"The Battle Rifle is largerly considered the better of the two, but if fired with accurate aiming and precise timing, the Carbine can technically kill faster than the battle rifle can."</li>
<li>The entirety of List of weapons in Halo 2#Balance, complete with color-coded table highlighting the merits and weaknesses of each weapon</li>
</ul>
<p>Simply editing out this advice would leave nothing but paraphrased descriptions of the history of the weapons, and Wikipedia is not the place to abridge the source material from the manual.</p>

Quite a few links directing to this article, so it may be more important than you think (this includes a lot of redirect pages, which should be deleted as well should the consensus here be delete).

<li>Part of the reason for all the links, I would imagine, is that this was a merge target for a whole bunch of stubs with similar gamecruft/gameguide problems.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> - While difficult to source certainly, I would say that the weapons of Halo 2 are much more important to the game than <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master_Chief_b8f6.html" title="Master Chief">Master Chief</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halo_2.html#Plot" title="Halo 2">the plot</a>, and certainly any other character. I've removed the charts, which were certainly OR. I have removed/altered the sections of text you labeled as how-to advice, which some of them most certainly were. While there are probably other content issues and weasel words, these don't constitute deletion. While I am in favor of deleting cruft (I've been doing some of the work on Proto's list), such as RuneScape holiday items and articles for every single CS map, I think that a single (hopefully sourced in the future) article describing the most important (imho) aspect of a popular game can be non-cruft. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 05:07, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How can this possibly be sourced, though?<br />
As for rewriting this article, is there a single sentence in this article that isn't advice on playing Halo 2 or abridged from the game's manual? - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 05:12, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Incidentally, all you removed was the "Balance" section, which was particularly bad, but the article is still studded with game-guide-style advice. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 05:18, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>With a limited amount of searching, I was able to find a review from <a href="../../../i/g/n/IGN_e112.html" title="IGN">IGN</a> mentioning some of the info presented in the article. While there is certainly much unsourced material, I do believe it <i>is</i> possible to cite portions of it, though I don't know how much. I do believe that there are indeed sentences that don't fit the bill of a how-to guide. Stuff like (paraphrasing here) "unlike other covenant weapons, the carbine needs to be re-loaded" or the "magnum is a semi-automatic pistol that can be dual-wieldable" seems acceptable to me. Certainly a lot of stuff claiming "the magnum is most effective when used with the plasma pistol" or whatever needs to be removed, but I think if that stuff is removed, there is still an article there. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 05:28, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>How is "The carbine needs to be reloaded" not instructing people how to play the game? Eating an orange isn't any more acceptable per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> for being phrased "The peel needs to be removed" instead of "You need to remove the peel" or "It is a good idea to remove the peel." - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 05:32, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Actually, the article for <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orange_%28fruit%29.html" title="Orange (fruit)">Orange</a> says <i>"The fruit is commonly peeled..."</i>. So how about if the example carbine sentence said "The carbine is reloaded" or something more elegant. My phrasing was poor in the previous carbine example where I used the word "need". Clearly not every sentence discussing an action performed by a human is a "how-to" or instruction. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 05:39, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../o/r/a/Orange_%28fruit%29.html" title="Orange (fruit)">Orange</a> has content other than that brief mention of how one eats it.

<li>Tomorrow, I'm going experiment and try remove all the stuff that can be construed as how-to and see whats left.

<li><b>Keep if extremely pruned</b>, I'm as opposed to gamecruft as anyone else, I even listed for deletion practically wikipedia's entire orbiter game guide, but this article has a significant potential to exist as a collection of verifiable, non original research data.

The weapons of an FPS are surely as critical to it as the characters of a film like star wars, and being able to see what sort of weapon the "needler" is will help me understand halo in the same way knowing who 4-LOM or IG-88 refers to will help me understand star wars. We shouldn't be giving out gameplay tips, but a collated description of the weapons, referenced to sources like game guides and reviews, and limited to that content, is useful and not a mere indiscriminate collection of information. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 10:58, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Okay,I remember reading when first joined here that if one could not only include basic information about poker, but also make a poker-game guide there was no problem with it, I see the same situation here.

<li><b>Keep</b>: Interesting and pertinent point. Game design is a valid subject to cover, so this sort of material is worth keeping - the array of weapons and comparisons does indeed reflect game balance and design. For instance, the even more detailed and stat-heavy List of weapons in Halo: Combat Evolved would be non-cruft by that standard. At the same time, the information being necessarily stated as fact would appear as a game guide. I'd argue the descriptions here are facts (about fictitious weapons) and not a how-to guide.

<dd>I think you're dramatically overestimating the number of articles nominated for deletion on Wikipedia, and underestimating the size of Wikipedia. Excluding speedy deletions, about 100-200 articles are nominated for deletion daily. This is a drop in the bucket , given the total size of wikipedia. I would guess that when I'm regularly active, I participate in around 3-8 afds daily. I also generally choose to only vote in discussions which are not foregone conclusions, or on which I have long-standing views on. I concentrate my efforts in arguing cases which are tightly fought. I'm deletionist, but that certainly does not mean I want to delete everything as you suggest - it just means I favour higher general standards of inclusion. I vote for keep perhaps 1 time out of 15 - but that's because most of the afd nominations are good ones. Examples of very recent (i.e. in the last week or 10 days or so) afds, where I have not only voted keep, but actually been one of the main arguers for keep have been <a href="../../../t/w/i/Twink_%28gay_slang%29.html" title="Twink (gay slang)">Twink (gay slang)</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gosh_Numbers_89c2.html" title="Gosh Numbers">Gosh Numbers</a>, <a href="../../../f/e/m/Female_sex_tourism.html" title="Female sex tourism">Female sex tourism</a> and <a href="../../../z/s/a/Zsanett_%C3%89gerh%C3%A1zi_0128.html" title="Zsanett Égerházi">Zsanett Égerházi</a>. In the first case, I was an early keep voter who identified the nomination as likely to be bad faith. In the last three (with the caveat that two are still active), I believe I was instrumental in swaying debates (that were originally majority delete) towards keep or no consensus through researching evidence.

<dd>FullSmash26, Almost two thousand articles are created each day, and Wikipedia reached 1 million articles on March of this year. <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1025_3-6045044.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.com.com/2100-1025_3-6045044.html" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> Each day over a thousand articles are deleted, and this is necessary to keep the encyclopedia clean and serious. Imagine what a joke Wikipedia would be if every MySpace Musician were allowed to have an article. Wikipedia is currently at least three times larger than any paper encyclopedia, and we must ensure its integrity remains intact. <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Deletion Policy</a> <a href="../../../d/i/o/User%7EDionyseus_52e5.html" title="User:Dionyseus">Dionyseus</a> 14:09, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep if extremely pruned</b>, per my halo 2 rationale: I'm as opposed to gamecruft as anyone else, I even listed for deletion practically wikipedia's entire orbiter game guide, but this article has a significant potential to exist as a collection of verifiable, non original research data. I'd think of it as analagous to a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_minor_Star_Wars_droids_dcc6.html" title="List of minor Star Wars droids">list of minor Star Wars droids</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_recurring_robot_characters_from_Futurama_cfd3.html" title="List of recurring robot characters from Futurama">List of recurring robot characters from Futurama</a>--every member of the list has verifiable data documenting its contribution, however minor, to the larger plot of a major, notable work, and knowledge of the individual members adds to an understanding of the greater work. The weapons of an FPS are surely as critical to it as the characters of a film like star wars, and being able to see what sort of weapon the "needler" is will help me understand halo in the same way knowing who 4-LOM or IG-88 refers to will help me understand star wars. We shouldn't be giving out gameplay tips, but a collated description of the weapons, referenced to sources like game guides and reviews, and limited to that content, is useful and not a mere indiscriminate collection of information.<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 11:04, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>I reviewed the history of the article and the pages of Xaosflux and Wedian and I found out that both of them are not legal professionals and thus they should not and could not be aware of the validity of the content of the article. As an Egyptian legal professional, I ensure that it is undisputed that Asser harb is a well known and a distinct State Solicitor in Egypt and thus I confirm that all the content of the article is true and NOT a hoax. Please proceed to save the article from deletion.</p>
<p>Ahmed Hassan</p>
<p><br />
It seems that <a href="../../../w/e/d/User%7EWedian_2daa.html" title="User:Wedian">Wedian</a> is not a legal professional. She can not defferentiate between the Attorney General and the Solicitor General. In Egypt, the Title Attorney General is misused before the name of the Public Prosecutor, however, the title Solicitor General is used before the name of the President of the State Lawsuits Authority, another judicial institution that is in charge of representing Egypt before national and international courts.</p>
<p>Indeed, Asser Harb was a bank lawyer one day ( and the article itself says this), but he is currently Egypt's State Solicitor, i.e. he is currently a member within the Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority. He is also well known as an eminent international legal practitioner on behalf of Egypt in complex international arbitrations.</p>
<p>As a legal professional working in Egypt, I ensure that although all the comments of <a href="../../../w/e/d/User%7EWedian_2daa.html" title="User:Wedian">Wedian</a> can possibly be true, however I confirm at the same time that all the content of the article Asser Harb is true and valuable to the legal wikipedians.</p>
<p><a href="../../../w/e/d/User%7EWedian_2daa.html" title="User:Wedian">Wedian</a> is not a legal practitioner but a pharmacist, who should not and could not judge a legal article like Asser Harb.</p>
<p>BY THE WAY THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR (OR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL) IS NOT A JUGE BUT AN ADVOCATE FOR THE STATE IN CRIMINAL CASES. TAKE CARE USER BEFORE MISLEADING THE OTHER WIKIPEDIANS TO MIS UNDERSTAND THE CONTENT OF A VALUABLE ARTICLE. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.201.207.248 (Talk) (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.201.207.248_%28Talk%29_49ee.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.201.207.248 (Talk)">contribs</a>) 23:54, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<li><b>KEEP</b> Following the history of the article in that way does not lead necessarily to the deletion of the article. It seems that <a href="../../../w/e/d/User%7EWedian_2daa.html" title="User:Wedian">Wedian</a> improperly confounds between two different Egyptian Judicial institutions, the Public Prosecution النيابة العامة in one hand and the State Lawsuits Authority هيئة قضايا الدولة in the other hand. The members of the aforementioned two judicial institutions are not judges but counsel for the state. Google hits can not possibly be a criterion to evaluate the credibility of the article, since most of the members of judicial institutions in Egypt and other countries are not popularly known, however they are just famous and well known among the legal practitioners. I worked closely to Honorable Asser Harb and he is really an exceptional legal faculty that should be recorded by Wikipedia. It is not the author's fault to have non-legal wikipedians unware of the famous legal practitioners in Egypt, but it is the fault of <a href="../../../w/e/d/User%7EWedian_2daa.html" title="User:Wedian">Wedian</a> who is obviously legally ignorant.--Save Data 13:24, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

The 28 years old Asser Harb can't even be a judge or councel (moustashar).

<li><b>Comment</b> Dear <a href="../../../w/e/d/User%7EWedian_2daa.html" title="User:Wedian">Wedian</a>, I purden you for your misunderstanding because you are not a specialist. The website Arab Decision that you have cited do not comprise all of the members of the Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority. Moreover all the names included therein are not updated. For instance the current President of the Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority is not H.E. Counselor Hossam Adel Azim as you have just contended, but he is H.E. Counselor Milad Sidhom and you are invited to read the content of this link <a href="http://www.emigration.gov.eg/AllNews/DisplayNews.aspx?CatId=8&amp;NewsId=56864" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.emigration.gov.eg/AllNews/DisplayNews.aspx?CatId=8&amp;NewsId=56864" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>. Furthermore, you have to know that the word "counsel" does not mean مستشار in Arabic but means نائب and مستشار in English is "Counselor". The State Counsel or نائب الدولة in Arabic is normally so much younger than the State Counselor or مستشار الدولة and thus Honorable Asser harb, who is Egypt's State Counsel, should be so much younger than H.E. the President of the State Lawsuits Authority, who should be, in accordance to the governing law of the Authority, the oldest Vice President in the Authority. As regards the number of members in the Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority, it is not 28 as mentioned in the Arab Decision website but more than 2000. Moreover, youy have to know that Asser Harb was appointed as State Counsel within the Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority by virtue of the Presedential Decree No. 133/2003 and you can easily get a copy from the Formal Gazzette الجريدة الرسمية . Also, you can simply know more about Honorable Asser Harb from the Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority at the 10th floor, Mogamaa Building, Tahrir Square, Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority, Department of Foreign Disputes. You will learn that although he is one of the youngest members of the authority, he is currently recognised for his extensive international legal practice on behalf of the Arab Republic of Egypt. Because you set out an in depth research, you have to complete it to the end. Go on and I am sure you will not delete the article but you eill try to enhance it. My last advice to you is that you have to take care you are currently insulting a judicial member within the Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority, the act that constituites a crime in accordance with the Egyptian penal law, which you can possibly be accused of ( even in Mansoura).

I am not in a position to file evidence against anyone here, but I am just talking from a legal point of view in accordance with the applicable Egyptian law. It does not matter with me personally to have the article kept or deleted. I am just drawing the attention to a fact that is well-furnished. To provide a hard fact ( as you have just requested)&#160;; I simply invite anyone who can understand Arabic to review Article 6 bis of the law governing the Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority <a href="http://smsma4law.com/vb/showthread.php?p=16570" class="external text" title="http://smsma4law.com/vb/showthread.php?p=16570" rel="nofollow">here</a> and he will learn that I am right. As regards filing evidence, it can possibly be filed under the Egyptian applicable law which you do not know anything about but I do.--Save Data 22:57, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> This is my last comment. I'm not engaging anymore into this. The author of the article tried to convince the readers that Asser Harb is the chief state solicitor. <a href="../../../a/s/s/User%7EAsserHarb_10ae.html" title="User:AsserHarb">User:AsserHarb</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AsserHarb_b208.html" title="Special:Contributions/AsserHarb">(contribs)</a> and User:196.205.176.54( <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_196.205.176.54_b953.html" title="Special:Contributions/196.205.176.54">contribs</a>) - another <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">single purpose accountwho</a> only adds Asser Harb related content- have created <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egyptian_State_Lawsuits_Authority_5e33.html" title="Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority">Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority</a> and the <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney_General_303a.html#Egypt" title="Attorney General">Egypt section</a> in <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney_General_303a.html" title="Attorney General">Attorney General</a> with the sole name of Asser Harb in both articles. But, if you are certifying that Asser Harb is one of the councels in the Egyptian lawsuits authority, then <b>he certainly fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a></b>. This actually ends it -at least for me-. No offense intended, but the article Asser Harb lists no special achievments except for his job. I guess we have first to write articles about all the current and previous presidents, vice presidents, judges and councelors of all <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egyptian_Judicial_System_1689.html#Courts" title="Egyptian Judicial System">Egyptian_Judicial_System#Courts</a> of the <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egyptian_Judicial_System_1689.html" title="Egyptian Judicial System">Egyptian_Judicial_System</a> and then we can turn to counsels and prosecutors. How many articles would that be? If you are - as i assume- Asser Harb yourself or one of his friends, then please read <a href="../../../a/b/_/WP%7EAB_9fd9.html" title="WP:AB">WP:AB</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia is not a soapbox</a>. Instead , why not use your legal knowledge to help wikipedia by expanding articles like the <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egyptian_Judicial_System_1689.html" title="Egyptian Judicial System">Egyptian Judicial System</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Constitutional_Court_of_Egypt_5894.html" title="Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt">Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt</a>, <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egyptian_Civil_Code_16b2.html" title="Egyptian Civil Code">Egyptian Civil Code</a> or <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdel-Razzak_Al-Sanhuri_cd73.html" title="Abdel-Razzak Al-Sanhuri">Abdel-Razzak Al-Sanhuri</a> who wrote the first version of the Egyptian civil code. Another thing, <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">User:Pascal.Tesson</a> was asking you to provide evidence to verify your statements about Asser Harb and not evidence that i might be punished if i insult a judicial member. BTW, how serious are these threats? Should i be afraid and disappear from wikipedia before anybody discovers who really i am and make me really disappear?&#160;:)--<a href="../../../w/e/d/User%7EWedian_2daa.html" title="User:Wedian">Wedian</a> 03:10, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The age of the house is irrelevant. Whether histories of this house have been published outside of Wikipedia is.

For <i>this</i> house, however, I can find nothing (apart from listings on real estate agent sites). The article cites no sources. This is <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>, the first publication of a novel history of a subject that has not been published anywhere outside of Wikipedia.

<p>Seems to have become a list of links to external commercial yoga sites. Although there is a caveat that each entry should have at least an article on Wikipedia, not all do, and no one seems to be enforcing the rule. So, to me, there does not seem to be any attempt to show that the entries are notable enough for inclusion in Wikipedia. Would be better as a category, any school notable enough to warrant an article, could be placed into that category.</p>

<li>To expand, because they don't offer enough material to test for notability, and also don't offer enough content to be a decent stub, merging into a list is a good solution. When our (currently somewhat distracted) contributors to content on India have the time, they can work through the list to build out at least decent stubs for those where there is content to include. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 14:24, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and expand as appropriate. These are real life non-arbitrary concepts which affect rather a lot of people.

<li><b>Keep all</b>: These stubs regarding Jat clans are one liner at present but likely to expand in future. Each clan contains in itself history. Some clans have been recorded and some have not been properly recorded. If a stub is kept on wikipedia with request to expand people tend to expand them. It has so happened with some clans but they became good article over a period. Deletion will not serve any purpose. Hence these may not be deleted. <b>Keep them all</b><a href="../../../l/r/b/User%7ELRBurdak_7c15.html" title="User:LRBurdak">burdak</a> 13:29, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>All said and done, I reiterate that the fact remains that Indian surnames/family names have historical and sociological significance and they function like socio-historical DNA fingerprints. Wikipedia and we, the Wikipedians should continue to contribute to enrich “the sum total of human knowledge”, of course, conforming to the Wikian philosophy and standard. And, so all bit of information is necessary, so that a seeker of knowledge should not return empty handed from wikipedia. Yes, sure, <i>Imagine a world in which every person has free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That's what we're doing.</i>" I repeat the same again.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep All</b> The idea of an encyclopedia is to have information it. Quite often, the information which appears useless to one individual, but may very well valuable to others. For someone to play god, sit in judgment, as to what is ‘valuable, important, useful’, may be fun; it could also be, one could suggest be bordering on arrogance.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Many of these names are Jat clan names. For researchers like me, they are useful, for as one gets deeper and deeper into the history of the people, it is of interest where they lived, how the names evolved, what their contributions to society were.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For the descendants of these clans, these give a family history. Many people turn now to Wikipedia as their first source of information. To delete these lists, is telling someone of this clan, ‘heh, you are not important enough, and let us erase you from our public records. That is a fate, slightly worse than death.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is correct these are stubs today. The idea of a stub is that it serves as a catalyst, to encourage people to expand it. This approach is working. Expanding the stubs will take time. They will be expanded, as more and more people get involved.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I will strongly suggest that no names be deleted. People wishing to look for items to delete, may please take their focus efforts elsewhere.

<dd>I do not play God and resent that implication (as I do the one of arrogance). The articles <i>as they are</i> could hardly be valuable to others, as they presented no information beyond what was already in e.g. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jat_clans_e278.html" title="List of Jat clans">List of Jat clans</a>. They had no assertion of importance and were strictly speaking eligible for speedy deletion as an article about a group of people: <a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-bio_ac6d.html" title="Template:Db-bio">Template:Db-bio</a>. That would have been harsh though, and so I decided to start the discussion about these uninformative oneliners. The articles as presented do not "give a family hstory" (which is a category which falls clearly under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> anyway), and deleting them does not say "you are not important enough". The article has to make the case why its subject is important, not the other way around. If not being included is "a fate, slightly worse than death", then most of us are in the same position. As for the articles being stubs, intended to act as a catalyst: the <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abusaria.html" title="Abusaria">Abusaria</a> article was created in December 2005 and no more modified since February 2006. For me, it is impossible to know that anything more of encyclopedic value can and will be said about this family and others, and thus it is perfectly normal to nominate it for deletion, without playing God or having fun doing so. People wishing that these articles be kept should make a case about why they are important as per Wikipedia guidelines, not discuss the motivations of the nominator in a needlessly negative manner. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 13:42, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep All</b>. Many Indian-related articles have limited exposure online so it can be difficult for non-Indians (and Indians too!) to discern whether something is legitimate or not. Many of these gotras are used by vastly more people than other surnames listed on Wikipedia.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: but other names aren't notable either, and every article that basically only says that "X is a surname found mostly there or there" should go. If the people who know more about these things claim that there is more to say (of encyclopedic value) about each and every of these family names / subclans / whatever you want to call them, I have no reason to doubt that, although the articles as they were gave no indication of that and hence were logical targets for deletion: so keeping them because encyclopedic contents (history, asserting importance, ...) will be added is fine by me, but keeping them because other family names are supposedly notable is a wrong reason, as that isn't true per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 13:42, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment to all discussion above</b> I remain unconvinced that there is any reason to keeping these as separate articles at the present time. Merging to one list keeps all the content, and redirects to a list can be overwritten any time someone has the content for a decent stub. These lack the content to be a decent stub, with the possible exception of the three I called out above. If they don't properly belong in the list highlighted above, they may need to be in multiple lists. But the fact that I can't tell what would belong where is evidence that the current content is lacking adequate context - and the one thing a stub must have is adequate context for expansion. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 22:10, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A hacker calling himself 'Wicked' successfully hacked www.grc.com (Gibson Research Corp.) on 4 May, 2001 and launched a series of six DoS. The website was down for 17 hours, and Gibson, a security expert (ironic?) <a href="http://www.grc.com/dos/grcdos.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.grc.com/dos/grcdos.htm" rel="nofollow">reports</a> that the attack reveals an enormous bug in Windows software, reporting this and various analyses to the FBI. The hacker was caught, but because he was only 13, his name was withheld and he was not subject to prosecution.</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Slight misunderstanding. The authors on this list write <i>about</i> Christian topics, not simply authors who profess the Christian faith (except for maybe a few...Danielle Steele?). I see two courses of action we can take. We can rename it to something else like "Authors of Christianity" or "Christian writers", or we can explain the list as I did <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Christian_authors&amp;diff=63433570&amp;oldid=63390223" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Christian_authors&amp;diff=63433570&amp;oldid=63390223" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Either way, this list is very useful, and no category is feasible because they cannot be annotated and explained, as in the case of Tolkein, who <i>did</i> write of Christianity, but may be questioned by some. See my edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Christian_authors&amp;diff=63434796&amp;oldid=63433570" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Christian_authors&amp;diff=63434796&amp;oldid=63433570" rel="nofollow">here</a>. <i>That</i> is why lists are better than categories.<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 16:38, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> There is no <b>article</b> on the topic of Christian authors, suggesting that this is not a recognized, coherent, encyclopedic concept.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Leave it up and running! Although the 2026 Cup is still way in the future, information already starts popping up so why not have it in Wikipedia? What's posted here is not some private person's thoughts but the info backed up by newspaper publications, so to a certain degree it's a credible info. There is a lot of speculative info re: 2014 and 2018 Cups as well, yet nobody proposes to delete it. And lastly, why are you so obsessed with the deletion? If you don't like it, just don't read it - read something else instead.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Perhaps not well known in Salzberg, Berlin, or U.S.A., this is significant store in Canada, more importantly in Ontario. Optimale suggests that they do not appear on Google, but is that really a good measure of a company's notability? (And may I just say that upon typing "trans canada store supplies" in Google, I got no less than 68 hits, one of which even came from the Canadian National Defense department, which outlines how the company supplied them $31 000 worth of equipment) Ask any restaurant, grocery store, school, or convenience store in Northern or Central Ontario and you will discover not only how notable, but also how vital this company is. Further, the comment about it sounding like an advertisement is completely unfounded. The article is written with clear, concise, and obvious objectiveness.

<p>The result was <b>no consensus</b>. Whether the awards cited actually confer notability is open to further discussion - not all awards do, and we're plainly not talking a Pulitzer or a Lindgren here (yet). Yanksox also says that <a href="http://www.strongattheheart.com/book_reviews.html#honors" class="external text" title="http://www.strongattheheart.com/book_reviews.html#honors" rel="nofollow">this link</a> checks out the claims, but in fact it doesn't - the link is dead for me right now, but I do note that the link is from strongattheheart.com - an article's subject cannot be used to source assertions of notability about themselves. Nonetheless, those arguing for delete do so weakly, and no real case has been presented against the awards' notability, so this particular discussion can only be said to have resulted in no consensus on the basis of lack of overwhelming weight of opinion or argument. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 15:45, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>keep</b> Hi. I'm the guy who put the article up, so hardly surprisingly, I think it should stay. The reason I think it's very important is that there are thousands of abused boys and girls (most now adults) who will welcome the access to important material as provided by the encyclopaedic resource of Wikipaedia. Because of the sex industry, searches for articles relating to child sexual abuse don't always through up suitable answers and Wikipaedia is always there on page 1 or 2. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sandel_9801.html" title="User:Tony Sandel">Tony Sandel</a>

<li><b>Comment.</b> Tony, thanks for your contribution. The issue here is the notability of this particular book, not the subject of child abuse in general. As the article's author, it's your duty to provide verifiable (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> refers) sources of its notability - independent reviews, citations by other experts in the field, evidence of its use by respected therapists, etc. I'm not saying the article should be deleted merely because the book has a low sales rank; however, you'll have to provide some other reasons why it should be kept if its going to survive AfD. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 14:35, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> As the author of the book in question, perhaps I can offer some context for the discussion. Strong at the Heart was published last November on the young adult (YA) list of Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, a literary publisher. YA nonfiction is a small part of the market, but--as evidenced by Mr. Sandal's article--this book has developed an international crossover audience among adults (Japanese rights sold early, although that edition is not out yet). What makes the book unusual, groundbreaking actually, is that it is the first to bring readers face-to-face with real teens and adults who talk about their experiences with childhood sexual abuse and healing. Each person's story is illustrated with photographs, including a full face portrait; these are not anonymous or "composite" stories written by a clinician to prove a point, but rather real people sharing a wide range of personal experience. The mix of interviews reflects the demographics of child sexual abuse in North America, so readers get a picture of how abuse happens, who survivors are, and the wide range of choices people make in addressing this experience. Honors for Strong at the Heart include: Kentucky Bluegrass Award, 2007 Master List for grades 9-12; National Council for the Social Studies, and The Children's Book Council, 2006 Notable Trade Book for Young People; Skipping Stones Magazine, 2006 Honor Book; Bank Street College, Children's Book Committee, Teen List, one of twenty five recommended books for teens in 2006; New York Public Library, 2006 Books for the Teen Age.

<li><b>keep</b> Booklist, Horn Book, and Kirkus reviews are all notable reviewing agancies who think this book is notable. I personally think there are far too few resources for people who have lived through sexual abuse, and this is a particularly helpful one for teens and young adults in particular. It'd be nice if people could find out about it via Wiki. "Without sensationalizing, the first-person narratives each convey the particulars of an individual experience that will encourage readers' empathy." -- The Horn Book "Excellently balanced. Over and over, the interviewees each say how much it helped to hear that someone else shared their experiences - that they were not alone. One hopes that this book will be that voice for readers." -- Kirkus Reviews "Lehman's powerful collection...packs a strong emotional punch.

<li>Could we <b>transwiki</b> the full description and <b>keep</b> a vastly-narrowed description of the storyline? I am the original author as mentioned in the delete request. I understand the arguments for moving the full synopsis to Comixpedia [EDIT 22:20, 13 July 2006 (UTC): Comixpedia had a much-earlier, more basic description I had written. I have copied the current WP text there]. But this storyline should not go unignored in Wikipedia. GPF is arguably one of the most popular web comics of today, and Surreptitious Machinations was an all-consuming storyline within it. Just as a major episode of <i><a href="../../../s/m/a/Smallville.html" title="Smallville">Smallville</a></i> or <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a></i> would get its own basic article, I believe there should be <i>something</i> of an independent article on WP for this storyline. --<a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKitch_5ab1.html" title="User:Kitch">Kitch</a> 22:08, 13 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's more analogous to a major storyline from a comic book than from a TV show, I'd say. But even if it wasn't, take a look at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Best_of_Both_Worlds_%28TNG_episode%29_310a.html" title="The Best of Both Worlds (TNG episode)">The Best of Both Worlds (TNG episode)</a>, arguably the most important (two-part) episode of TNG. It includes an Overview, discussing the episode's role in the overall <i>Star Trek</i> saga, a relatively consise plot summary, and a criticism section. And it's still shorter than this article. =) It's possible this storyline might merit an article, but it needs to be more than just a detailed rehash of the plot; it needs context, and it needs references for that context. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 23:17, 13 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is a major plotline no doubt, but it dates back to 2002. No such synopses of later plotlines have been written, nor should they. <i>No</i> webcomic has its entire plot mapped out in such an exhaustive fashion. In fact, I suspect that's true of any work of fiction on Wikipedia, and that's the way it should be. It's not encyclopedic and should be on a fan site. It even goes beyond Cliff's Notes. We shouldn't even have scaled down versions of the plot spun off into separate articles either, since it makes maintaining consistency across them difficult. Perhaps a single plotline article would be fine, such as <a href="../../../s/t/o/Storyline_of_Bob_and_George_ddcf.html" title="Storyline of Bob and George">Storyline of Bob and George</a>, but even that tends to be a cruft magnet. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 10:47, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It is the task of a dictionary to "confirm that a phrase is in use". <i>Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia</i>, not a dictionary. An article here entitled "Work spouse" is an article about work spouses, whatever they are. And for determining what work spouses are, "specific references" <i>most definitely are</i> required.

<li><b>Comment</b> The problem as I see it is that "Work wife" or "Work-wife" or "Workwife" or "Office wife" <b>has</b> in fact gotten a substantial amount of traction, but the phrase "Work spouse" has not. By trying to be gender-neutral, the writer has created a term that doesn't really exist. Incidentally <a href="../../../f/a/i/Faith_Baldwin_6d48.html" title="Faith Baldwin">Faith Baldwin</a>—what? we don't have an article on her? we should—wrote a 1930 novel entitled "Office Wife," which became a movie. The <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021197/plotsummary" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021197/plotsummary" rel="nofollow">imdb plot summary</a> says "Larry Fellowes of Fellowes Publishing wants Kate to write her next book about the 'Office Wife'. The personal secretary/stenographer spends more time with the busy executive and makes more decisions than his wife ever well. This creates a bond between the secretary and boss that the wife can not hope to equal," so the phrase "office wife" is hardly new. See <a href="http://www.wordspy.com/words/officespouse.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.wordspy.com/words/officespouse.asp" rel="nofollow">this Wordspy article</a> for more evidence of its reality.</li>

<p>The word seems to have been made up by the author. A Google search for pages in English yields only 67 hits. All of those are either exact copies of the article (complete with merge proposal), or just a nonsensical, dead-end list of words with no independent meaning. Virtually every sentence and clause in the article starts speculatively with <i>may</i> or <i>if</i>, and it is merely called a <i>possible</i> caricature. At minimum, the lack of any other use on the internet means it is non-notable and non-verifiable.

<p>I really hate bringing this to AfD, but after listing this item for speedy deletion twice, and Prodded once, with ALL tags removed by the author, by procedure I have no choice.

<li>Speed of writing has nothing to do with it. I was talking about <i>lack of source material</i>.

<li>No way. Go and look at those pages. (1) <i>Biographies of living people need special care because biographies containing unsourced material might negatively affect someone's life and could have legal consequences. Remove unsourced material about living persons immediately if it could be viewed as criticism,[1][2] and do not move it to the talk page.</i> I don't see anything on his page that meets these criteria for deletion. (2) <i>An edit counts as original research if it proposes ideas or arguments. That is, if it does any of the following: It introduces a theory or method of solution; It introduces original ideas; It defines new terms; It provides or presumes new definitions of pre-existing terms; It introduces an argument, without citing a reputable source for that argument, that purports to refute or support another idea, theory, argument, or position; It introduces an analysis or synthesis of established facts, ideas, opinions, or arguments in a way that builds a particular case favored by the editor, without attributing that analysis or synthesis to a reputable source; It introduces or uses neologisms, without attributing the neologism to a reputable source.</i> I do not find anything on that page that meets these criteria. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvertype_f1b1.html" title="User:Evertype">Evertype</a> 17:13, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Please read the <i>whole</i> of our policy pages. <i>I don't see anything on his page that meets these criteria for deletion.</i> — The criteria for deletion that are relevant here are verifiability and original research. If you do not see that an article for which no underlying source material exists is unverifiable, then you haven't yet grasped the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> policy. If you do not see that an article that presents a synthesis of facts, i.e. a biography, of a person without reference to any existing synthesis (or indeed, without any sources for the facts being synthesised) is original research, then you haven't yet grasped the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Wikipedia%7EOriginal_research_757d.html" title="Wikipedia:Original research">Wikipedia:Original research</a> policy.

<li>I've pointed out that there are no secondary sources on the subject matter. That is pretty much the most fundamental complaint that there is. That you ignore it does not make it go away. I've asked you to cite sources twice, now. If you can cite sources, you can address the complaint. But so far you have not cited any sources at all, and have repeatedly instead argued about something other than sources. Please cite sources. Citing sources is always the best argument. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:45, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Also note that Wikipedia covers his <i>contributions</i> elsewhere, in articles such as <a href="../../../e/u/r/EURion_constellation_9a47.html" title="EURion constellation">EURion constellation</a>. As I said, he is a producer of source material on other subjects that is used as reference material in the articles on those subjects.

I am sure that similar statements are made in MOST of the biographical articles on the Wikipedia. The number of pages which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Markus_Kuhn" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&amp;target=Markus_Kuhn" rel="nofollow">link</a> to that article shows that an article is needed and useful.

<ul>
<li>Again, your argument bears no relation to what I actually wrote, and does not answer what you were asked. The number of hyperlinks to this article is irrelevant. What is important here is <i>sources</i>. I ask again: What sources do you think can be used to verify the article as it stands, to expand the article, and (indeed!) to verify the statements that you make above? Please cite some sources of biographical information about this person. <s>You have</s> <a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETeke_11ee.html" title="User:Teke">Teke</a> has cited one that contains 1 sentence of information (which isn't even in this article, ironically), so far. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:12, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What <i>source</i> exactly do we need to prove that Markus was born in Munich in 1971? Where is the <i>source</i> proving that <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> was born in Huntsville? This move for deletion is mean-spirited and pointless, and the deletion of this article for the weak theoretical argument you make will not make the Wikipedia any better. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvertype_f1b1.html" title="User:Evertype">Evertype</a> 17:20, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We need a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable source</a> that states that, of course. The source for anything in <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> should be cited by that article (and, indeed, if you read that article you will find that it cites sources and even has a citation link right next to the sentence that states where he was born). If you consider <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> to be "weak" and "theoretical", then you have come to the wrong place.

<li>...and that was about the third link down on a google search, right below his homepage and the wiki entry. An advanced search turns up 179,000 exact matches- many are this Kuhn.

But there's no source material written <i>about</i> Markus Kuhn, for use as reference material for <i>this</i> article.

<li>As pointed out above, I haven't been able to turn up any source material about the subject of this article (even though he is the author of source meterial on other subjects). A verifiable biographical encyclopaedia article about this person that is free from original research simply cannot be written. Unlike <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Russinovich_2aa0.html" title="Mark Russinovich">Mark Russinovich</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Mark_Russinovich_66c8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mark Russinovich">AfD discussion</a>), there simply isn't anything published about Markus Kuhn that isn't directly sourced from Markus Kuhn himself. (See <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Wikipedia:Autobiography</a>.) The principles of Verifiability and No Original Research cannot be thrown out simply because we <i>would like</i> an article to be written about someone. Markus Kuhn is in the class of people who have produced citeable works but who <i>themselves</i> are unverifiable.
<p>I encourage any editor who thinks that Markus Kuhn should have a biography to <i>go and write one</i>. Get it published as a book, in a journal, or in a magazine, and <i>then</i> Wikipedia can have an article on him. But sans sources, which is the case as far as I have been able to find (and no editor arguing that this article be kept has actually found and cited any sources that are about Markus Kuhn), no article can be had. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:54, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>That's a strange policy. Lots of people covered on Wikipedia don't have separate biographies, but are covered here because of their notable work.

</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Obviously notable, though I admit that the article doesn't make this clear. He is well known for several different achievements - indeed, I'd heard of him years ago, and given the extent of my knowledge about computer science, that's saying something. While it's true that there ought to be sources for the stuff in this article <i>there is no need at all to wait until a published biography is written!</i> It's completely within policy - indeed, it's basically the point of Wikipedia! - to collect and collate information from other sources. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 20:29, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as per Evertype and Ciphergoth. I find Uncle G's concerns about verifiability thoroughly overstated. In cases like this, I see no reason why we shouldn't be able to use the subject's own resume's, webpages, etc. to work from. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 22:31, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This self-advert / autobiography has been nominated for speedy deletion once and prodded twice. In lieu of the second prod, which is not allowed, I am hereby taking it to AfD so we can have it deleted properly. The article asserts some notability, but I do not believe that its subject is notable <i>enough</i> to warrant an article, especially not one to which he himself is the only substantial contributor. <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenning_Makholm_0024.html" title="User:Henning Makholm">Henning Makholm</a> 20:18, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> This page is in a GREAT need of a re-write, it reads like a bio from a company website. Notability is questionable, though someone may be able to confirm whether the company he is CEO of is notable enough to be considered. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWildthing61476_ea8a.html" title="User:Wildthing61476">Wildthing61476</a> 20:27, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Per Wildthing61476, this article is in an atrocious state (we don't need "<i>Mr.</i> Estill" everywhere for a start), but the subject is <i>probably</i> notable per guidelines (haven't checked for sure).

<li><b>Weak keep</b>: I was going to vote delete, but I did a proquest search and found about half a dozen articles on him and his companies.

<li>This is a tough case. As a member of the board of directors of a public company with shares or ADRs traded in the United States, the company is required to include a brief bio in their annual reporting. All of these are available online. He's been on the board for 9 years, so the basics of his business involvement are clearly available. These corporate reports should count as reliable sources due to the risk of shareholder lawsuit for knowing inclusion of false information. His blogs are self published material, so they aren't reliable sources for establishing notability, but they are reliable sources for expanding the article. It will be hard to have more than a stub unless the Canadian media chooses to do a bio. The Forbes Q&amp;A recently added to the article is weak data on notability. He sits on the board of a number of other Canadian companies. I think it is a <b>Weak Delete</b>. As a blogger, it is hard to sort through for news media coverage, but I've tried searches with several limiting terms, and the best I've found is <a href="http://www.itbusiness.ca/it/client/en/CDN/News.asp?id=37795" class="external text" title="http://www.itbusiness.ca/it/client/en/CDN/News.asp?id=37795" rel="nofollow">this site</a> listing him as #19 in Canadian computer dealer newsmakers for 2005. That just isn't high enough for my thresholds. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 14:09, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, to my mind, pushing an article up for deletion every so often is a bit like Wikipedia's Natural Selection. If the article is voted to be retained it will likely be improved more than it would have were a stub or cleanup tag put on it. If the article is voted to be deleted then we've just cleaned up a bit of cruft. The Wikipedia has a lot of stubs and useless articles in it and low traffic articles don't recieve much attention even with a stub tag, so it may well be worth it to delete that which we weren't keeping up. No offense, of course; just trying to shake things up in a constructive manner. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoofyheadedpunk_6175.html" title="User:Goofyheadedpunk">goofyheadedpunk</a> 05:34, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>, there's a [Category:Jewish-American journalists] which I think suffices, and I'm always keen to delete list pages where a category does the same work. The only benefit of this list over a category is that we have citations to prove the Jewish heritage of each individual, and while I concede that this is a big benefit, there's no reason why these citations can't be made in the subjects' individual articles. -- <b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">H·G</a></b> (<sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumbleGod_dc3d.html" title="User talk:HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">words</font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HumbleGod_9674.html" title="Special:Contributions/HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">works</font></a></sub>) 23:29, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, I think that all lists and categories of people by nationality, ethnicity and religion should be deleted because there is no agreement on the criteria for including people in such groups. For example, if a person moved to another country as a young adult and has since spent half of his or her life in many other countries, some for a few months, some for several years and one for many years, which countries should be counted? For religions, if a person was brought up in a Christian household, but does not attend church, except for weddings, should he or she be counted as a Christian? Even if a person attends church frequently, he or she may not have converted to Christianity yet (from non-belief). Also, a person may attend church even when they don't believe, out of habit, family obligation or appearances. As for ethnicity, there is disagreement over whether it matters how much of a certain ethnicity a person is (this may not be scientifically accurate, another problem) and whether it only matters what the person considers himself or herself to be, or both. For example, a person who is only 25% Spanish, but grew up in Spain, may consider himself or herself only Spanish, even though he or she is 75% English and moved to England 20 years ago. It should be remembered that it is very likely that we will not have access to all of this information (whether a person truly believes in a religion, what ethnicity or ethnicities they consider themselves to be or even all of the countries a person has lived in, if they are not very notable or there are just no records, like for <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackbeard.html" title="Blackbeard">a person who went by a pseudonym or hid his or her past</a>), let alone which factors should be used to make determinations. This makes such lists extremely unreliable. Also, since there are no exhaustive lists of people by ethnicity, nationality and religion from reliable sources that we can use as sole determinants for inclusion and no widely accepted criteria for determining who should be included in such groups, the lists are original research. Finally, whether a person fits into a group is almost always determined by a member or enthusiast of that group. This tends to lead to individuals thought of as admirable (like most celebrities) to be added to the list and those thought to be undesirable (like murderers) to be excluded when they should not be. Categories have the same problem, so I do not suggest them as an alternative, although they might be slightly less abusive than lists, since only people that have articles can be included in them and people who are knowledgeable about the person are more likely to see that he or she has been included in the group. My apologies for the long post. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 01:12, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>, maybe merge. I voted to delete the AA 1740 article and so I might seem a bit inconsistent here, but there are three factors which tip me to the keep side this time. First, this is a much better article, with a detailed summary of the events and the investigation. Second, this article was considered interesting enough to go into the DYK box on the main page (and I know of no other incident where the passengers on the involved plane got to have an external view of their aircraft from onboard screens). Third, while AA 1740 is hardly the most serious incident to hit American Airlines, B6 232 <i>is</i> the most serious incident so far in JetBlue's history (which might suggest that a merge of some, but not all, the content might be a solution). I think the notability of such accidents are very dubious, but because of the article's quality, the DYK, and JetBlue history factor, I am going for inclusion on this one. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 12:48, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This item is very remarkable simply for the fact that the passengers were watching the event live on board. This is a first and is extremely significant. This is a landmark moment in the information age - it has always been normal for people to be told as little as possible ("to avoid a panic") - and that is beginning to become impossible. This event parallels the effects of modern communications on 9/11's Flight 93. Who here thinks that if they had the chance, the airlines or law enforcement would have called passengers to warn them about what was happening on the other flights that day? The ways that we communicate and receive information are becoming too pervasive to censor in many situations. I'm willing to bet that the pilot downplayed the emergency as much as possible to the passengers, but they were able to see just for themselves what was really going on. Do not underestimate the importance of this incident or the phenomenon that it heralds. -- Ed</li>

I can see this meriting perhaps a paragraph on the JetBlue article, but a dedicated page is overkill for what was, in the end, a non-event. Ermar 00:46, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>What an incredibly annoying theme tune. In fact, it was so annoying precisely because it was rather popular among horrible little children, who sang it very often and loudly; and since I am a person of refined taste and sensibilities, and with a delicate ear to boot, that was quite a horrific experience. Also, a tiny amount of research (on the main <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_Rangers_5c57.html" title="Power Rangers">Power Rangers</a> page) shows that a certain unutterable Cowell released this monstrosity upon the charts of at least one horror-struck country, where it peaked at a quite worrying <i>number three in the singles chart</i>. Don't laugh unless you had to live through it&#160;:-/ This does, at least, prove that nobody's musical ambitions lack all chance of success, which will be welcome news to those visitors to this hallowed page yet to climb even the peak of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. Would that I were able to vote <i>delete</i>, and the very memory of this tune be exorcised from this earth, I would do so unreservedly. Yet Wikipedia sometimes has to be but the accurate reflection of the world's imperfections, and even I may be able to endure this one - so long as nobody gets this put on the front page, and I plead, never put a fair use sound clip in! Hence I must bequeath this most undeserving of pages the most grudging <b>strong keep</b> in AFD history, and hope that it never troubles me again. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 20:03, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I was completely unaware that this single had even hit the charts anywhere, but it still has no links other than to this AfD. It is completely unknown to anyone who searches the <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_Rangers_5c57.html" title="Power Rangers">Power Rangers</a> article, and the article isn't even named correctly if it's supposed to be for a single. I only found this by going through <a href="../../../p/o/w/Category%7EPower_Rangers_0b49.html" title="Category:Power Rangers">Category:Power Rangers</a> at random, at which I removed It may pass <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, but the other articles I listed are fairly crufty and short. Whatever information I found within them I transferred to to where they were linked (which was two places for V-Lancer, where there was another location that had much better information, and a single place for the DVD, which was only linked to the main PR article). I will change my own vote to <b>Keep</b> for the music single, with a dash of <b>Move</b>, but I still think that the short articles should be <b>deleted</b>. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> 20:23, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I largely agree with Ryulong, with greater emphasis on <b>Move</b> for the single. As far as the orphan issue goes, I'm sure there are places (the main Power Rangers article, or Mighty Morphin article, or various lists) that are appropriate places to reference and link to the article once properly named. -- <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESupermorff_0984.html" title="User:Supermorff">Supermorff</a> 22:04, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We have articles for other theme tunes though, and the theme tune may have more international impact than the single since that was heard wherever the show was broadcast. The single was a derivative of the theme tune and probably doesn't deserve either to be an article in its own right, or to be the focus of an article that deals with both the single and the theme tune. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 23:52, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>While there are articles on other theme songs, this article has specific information about the Single that Cowell put forth, not the "Go Go Power Rangers!" song. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> 00:11, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

Sorry I am a little new to editing on wikipedia and guidelines for deletion, so I edited it first and checked to see if it qualified to be deleted second. This was also in the article until today: <i>"Several members of the team started going to trivia at the Chapter House in Ithaca, NY after practices using CCCP as their team name. The CCCP trivia team repeatedly achieved champion standing and gained many rivals. One of those rivals started taking the team name "CCCP sucks". "</i> As I explained on the talk page, the Chapter House is a relatively small bar that hosts weekly sunday trivia with about 5-10 teams competing with no entry fee each week for a cash prize of $50, and is one of three bars that has weekly cash trivia nights in bars in [[Ithaca, NY]]. Also the repeatedly achieved championship status is unverified. I could see inclusion of the group name in a listing of Sports Clubs at Cornell, but not as an independent article. -Jimbobl 18:51, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The result was <b>Keep</b> but it does need substantial cleanup. The discussion makes it clear that this is an experienced jazz bassist who has worked and toured with many other artists. You can buy his albums at Tower Records. For a jazz artist celebrity and commercial success is not a good measure, so we shouldn't expect to see him in the charts, though his download success in this month's emusic.com suggests some modest success. There are numerous arguments for deletion below because this is a vanity article, but this isn't compatible with Wikipedia policy. We don't delete such articles, we clean them up. I'm sure that the current editors will be only too happy to help us do that once they learn how Wikipedia works.

<li><b>Delete</b> Small companies aren't notable by deletion precedent, which isn't a guideline (though it's still a good idea). In any case, the only news coverage I could find on their website appears to have been written by the company itself, <a href="http://www.na-refining.nf.ca/news/neighbour_news.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.na-refining.nf.ca/news/neighbour_news.asp" rel="nofollow">[47]</a>, and I didn't see any other indication it met WP:CORP.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 21:36, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Despite what the article says this is /not/ a small company. Their website says 'The North Atlantic refinery is now the second leading oil refinery (utilization) in Canada and gainfully employs just over 700 Newfoundlanders'. Significant employer and refineries are usually highly visible and significant in the community. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 22:26, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But what does this mean? A refinery is not the same as an oil company, many of which are <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vertical_integration.html" title="Vertical integration">vertically integrated</a>. Look at the top oil refineries at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_oil_refineries.html" title="List of oil refineries">List of oil refineries</a>. There are two in the US owned by ExxonMobil, which is an oil company. Plus, why the parenthetical qualification, "utilization"? I still say delete, if for no other reason than the lack of independent sources that can be used to write an NPOV and verifiable article.

<dd>Let me add my two cents why you should provide sources: In a hundred years, when both you and your great uncle will no longer be around to explain first-hand this musical instrument, how's anyone going to prove that this wasn't all made up and a blatant lie? Verifiability is vital.

<li><b>Keep</b> (creator) Open your eyes. Do you guys know anything about college football? On the other hand, though I am an expert, I look at it in a higher light than you. College football is a very fun, entertaining, and engaging sport, and so are comebacks. A 28 point comeback is freaking out-of-the-world in amazingness. How many 28 point comebacks have you seen? After watching hundreds of college football games, I haven't seen any, proving the claim that a 28 point comeback is both rare and notable. This was the largest comeback in ACC history, which is notable since there have been 10,000+ ACC games played.

<li><b>Delete</b> as per CrazyRussian. I would have speedy deleted it, as blanked by author and a non-notable biography, but Stifle removed a speedy tag previously. The creator seems to have made all of the substantial additions of content to the article, with the only other significant contribution being the addition of a template and some deletions and rearrangements of content. The creator's username suggests that it is the article's subject. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 00:10, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. As I explained before, this page was blanked by its creator and only substantial editor (CSD:G7). All other edits either delete information, or move it into an infobox. Furthermore, this person is not notable, assertions of MySpace notability notwithstanding; Wikipedia says: I'm an encyclopedia, not a child modelling catalogue. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 07:32, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>.

<p>Non-notable. A Google search produces www.tennishockey.com (and very little else - mainly things in German) - a site which gives no history or notablity of the sport. This WP entry was likely created by the site owner. <a href="../../../e/u/r/User%7EEurosong_5f20.html" title="User:Eurosong">EuroSong</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/u/r/User_talk%7EEurosong_19f5.html" title="User talk:Eurosong">talk</a></sup> 01:01, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I just created the entry -- while I'm not the owner of the website, I do know him. It's a sport that a small group of people has played for many years, that has slowly spread to a few other parts of the world (Germany as you noted). A number of other former players will contribute to this entry -- the sport is still small, but enjoyed by a growing number of participants. Also, the site www.tennishockey.com is admittedly spare, but it does have detailed information if you browse through the site.</p>
<p>My apologies if the article was formatted poorly (or this comment is) -- I'm a newbie. --Voodoodoodoo 01:06, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Delete</b> - Hi.. welcome to Wikipedia&#160;:) Newbies are always welcome - it's great to see that you want to contribute, thank you. What I do suggest, though, is that you familiarise yourself with some of Wikipedia's policies before creating such articles. Have a look at <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Can you find some reliable, published sources which not only mention Tennishockey as an established game, but give a full breakdown of the rules? Are there any official governing bodies of the sport? Any proper sports grounds, which consist of more than just "using two existing tennis courts"? Have a think about it&#160;:) <a href="../../../e/u/r/User%7EEurosong_5f20.html" title="User:Eurosong">EuroSong</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/u/r/User_talk%7EEurosong_19f5.html" title="User talk:Eurosong">talk</a></sup> 01:19, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
