<p>Sudarshan Kriya is a breathing process, based on ancient breathing techniques. It was designed by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar in 1982, and is a core offering of many of the personal-development, stress- and trauma-relief programs taught by the AOLF. Although the foundation claims that the technique has been patented, no patent records can be found in the US patents database as of Dec 2006. An indian newspaper has publicly described the technique in an article. <a href="http://www.tehelka.com/story_main16.asp?filename=Ne030406Sudarshan_CS.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tehelka.com/story_main16.asp?filename=Ne030406Sudarshan_CS.asp" rel="nofollow">[7]</a></p>
<p>Several studies related to Sudarshan Kriya have been published in peer-review journals, and those who continue to practice Sudarshan Kriya and its related practices clearly believe in its benefits. Some of the published studies include:</p>

Abdul Kalam, President of India; Ruud Lubbers, a former prime minister of the Netherlands; Otumfuo Osei Tutu II , King of Ghana; and people of diffferent faiths and walks of life. <a href="http://www.artofliving.org/silverjubilee/index2.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.artofliving.org/silverjubilee/index2.htm" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>. The highlight of the third day (19 Feb) , was a public meditation, in which 1 million or more people are claimed to have participated.</p>

<p>As a non-profit organization, the foundation has been criticized for its commercial nature and for charging high fees for the Art of Living courses. A non profit organization, though, is not legally prohibited from charging a fee and some non-profit organizations use fees to pay their expenses (staff, printing, hall and facility rental, etc.), while others depend upon donations. Sri Sri Ravi Shankar has also cited earlier issues with non-commitment of the course participants when the courses were being offered for free <a href="http://specials.rediff.com/news/2006/feb/16sld2.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://specials.rediff.com/news/2006/feb/16sld2.htm" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>. Organizers point out that the course fee in lieu of the fee for the basic workshop, a participant is entitled to attend "weekly follow-up" sessions anywhere in the world at no additional cost. Full time students and senior citizens are generally offered a discount and courses are regularly taught for free at several places such as prisons, slum areas and at disaster relief areas such as Iraq <a href="http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/women/building.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/women/building.htm" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>, after the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York, New Orleans since Katrina, etc.</p>
<p>The foundation states that the money collected from courses is directed towards its "operating expenses, special service related projects, building improvements and endowments".<a href="http://www.guidestar.org/pqShowGsReport.do?userHomePage=false&amp;npoId=404233" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guidestar.org/pqShowGsReport.do?userHomePage=false&amp;npoId=404233" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>. According to the 2005 tax return filed by the American chapter <a href="http://www.guidestar.org/FinDocuments/2005/770/240/2005-770240101-025eb863-9.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guidestar.org/FinDocuments/2005/770/240/2005-770240101-025eb863-9.pdf" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>, AOLF had total revenues of $3.2 M (mainly from course fees and public support) and expenditure of $1.9M (mainly in salaries, occupancy expenses and travel) in 2004; however none of the money went towards international developmental or humanitarian programs, disaster relief, scientific/medical research or charitable activity. According to the document, the organizations sole accomplishment for the year was to "teach art of living courses".</p>
<p>Critics also point to the ostentatious ceremonies the Art of Living Foundation conducted to celebrate the Art of Living's Silver Jubilee, as well as the the grand <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashram.html" title="Ashram">Ashram</a> the organization has built at <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangalore.html" title="Bangalore">Bangalore</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>. <a href="http://www.vvmvp.org/campus.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.vvmvp.org/campus.htm" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> Followeres claim that the ashram turned down at least one large donation that would have built many buildings several years ago because Sri Sri Ravi Shankar wanted it to be the product of the efforts of many people, not just a few.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The participants to any Art of Living course are required to sign the non-disclosure statement in the registration form. Critics are said to view this requirement and AOLF's claim of having patented <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudarshan_Kriya_0656.html" title="Sudarshan Kriya">Sudarshan Kriya</a> as conflicting with the foundation's stated goals, though it is not clear which goals this conflicts with. <a href="../../../s/r/i/Sri_Sri_Ravi_Shankar_6e55.html" title="Sri Sri Ravi Shankar">Sri Sri Ravi Shankar</a> has stated that the <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudarshan_Kriya_0656.html" title="Sudarshan Kriya">Sudarshan Kriya</a> had been filed for patent, <i>"Because someone else was going to patent it.

<p>AOLF registered "Sudarshan Kriya" as a trademark with the USPTO in 1995 and was filed for renewal in 2006, giving it exclusive rights to make commercial use of the term in the U.S. <a href="http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=77033509" class="external autonumber" title="http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=77033509" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>. However there is no evidence to support Sri Sri Ravi Shankar's claim that Sudarshan Kriya was patented, either in India or the U.S.A.</p>

<p>The Art of Living volunteers have been criticized for making unsubstantiated claims about the effectiveness of <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudarshan_Kriya_0656.html" title="Sudarshan Kriya">Sudarshan Kriya</a> in benefiting patients suffering from not only depression and trauma but also cancer and AIDS. Published research done at India's <a href="../../../n/i/m/NIMHANS_293c.html" title="NIMHANS">National Institute for Mental Health and Nueroscience</a> indicates that Sudarshan Kriya and its related practices are as effective as medication and electroshock therapy in treating depression. [see the reference under Sudarshan Kriya above: Janakiramaiah, N., et al. Antidepressant efficacy of Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) in melancholia: a randomized comparison with Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and Imipramine. Journal of Affective Disorders, 57(1-3):255-9.] However this research has not yet been validated and there is no scientific research supporting wider claims for Sudarshan Kriya's benefits. Critics charge that exaggerated and <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscientific.html" title="Pseudoscientific">pseudoscientific</a> claims (for instance, the claim that <a href="../../../h/i/v/HIV_abc5.html" title="HIV">HIV</a> cannot survive in the oxygen rich environment produced by Sudarshan Kriya <a href="http://www.bawandinesh.net/AIMSPresentation.ppt" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bawandinesh.net/AIMSPresentation.ppt" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>) mislead patients with serious physical and mental illness and thus prove dangerous and cause harm.</p>
<p>The foundation makes no official guarantee or promise of any therapeutic effects of Sudarshan Kriya, although research, personal experiences and testimonials of those benefited are highlighted.</p>

<p><a href="../../../s/r/i/Sri_Sri_Ravi_Shankar_6e55.html" title="Sri Sri Ravi Shankar">Sri Sri Ravi Shankar</a> has been accused by critics of leading a personality cult, with certain followers in India and elsewhere treating him as a deity. The organization's volunteers attribute this to the ancient Indian cultural norm of referring to a spiritual guide as a guru, and the tradition of having a spiritual master. Most Art of Living programs are taught without this orientation, however, and some programs make little or no reference to the founder, although many AOFL followers greet each other with <i>"Jai Guru Dev"</i> ('Literal meaning- "Victory to the divine teacher", though the foundation explains it to mean- "Victory of the Big God". Where Jai means Victory, Guru is for 'Big' in Sanskrit and Dev is for God, which comes to mean close to 'Victory of the Divine Order'). When questioned in talks and interviews, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar has occasionally expressed discomfort with his followers touching his feet <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VDuUvyA4j8" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VDuUvyA4j8" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> - however, the tradition of taking a spiritual master is an option for those who choose it and many followers show open admiration for the teacher. Critics complain of certain followers who criticize anyone who questions the organization’s teachings. Notably, many Art of Living volunteers have objected to such (rare) conduct saying that it goes against the teachings of the foundation.</p>
