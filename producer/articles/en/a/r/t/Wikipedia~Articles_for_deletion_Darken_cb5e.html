<li><b>Delete</b> as failing <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. I do not agree that <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keenspot.html" title="Keenspot">Keenspot</a> is a "site which is well known" for the purposes of WP:WEB. For starters, the article <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keenspot.html" title="Keenspot">Keenspot</a> itself does not meet WP:WEB because it makes no claim to notability and has no links to third-party coverage. In this state, it certainly can't confer notability to subsidiary content. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 12:27, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's an argument for deleting <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keenspot.html" title="Keenspot">Keenspot</a>, not <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darken.html" title="Darken">Darken</a>. <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darken.html" title="Darken">Darken</a> meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> even if <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keenspot.html" title="Keenspot">Keenspot</a> doesn't. Keenspot is clearly well-known with daily visitors in the millions<a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=keenspot.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=keenspot.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. -<a href="../../../a/n/%C3%BE/User%7EAn%C3%BEony_a6df.html" title="User:Anþony">Anþony</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/%C3%BE/User_talk%7EAn%C3%BEony_4ae4.html" title="User talk:Anþony">talk</a>) 13:01, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, it's an argument for deleting both. "Well known" in WP:WEB must <i>at the least</i> mean "notable", because it would make no sense for something to be considered notable for the sole fact that it is being distributed by something that is not itself notable. Keenspot is not (apparently) notable, so Darken isn't notable just because Keenspot carries it. Also, there's a difference between "well known" and "visited a lot". Porn sites are also visited a lot. This doesn't make every porn image on them notable. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 15:01, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have a couple of arguments to make:
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> does say well-known, not notable. (I would claim that Keenspot is notable, but one argument at a time, see below.) To me, that implies that the bar is lower. It is possible for something to be well known and yet never received an award or warranted comment in other publications. I won't stress this too much because it comes close to wikilawyering, I think.</li>
<li>For the purposes of this AfD, I think it we should assume <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keenspot.html" title="Keenspot">Keenspot</a> is notable simply because it has an article. That it hasn't successfully been deleted yet implies a consensus that <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keenspot.html" title="Keenspot">Keenspot</a> is notable. The proper course is to nominate Keenspot for AfD first, then decide this issue. I notice you've already prod'd <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keenspot.html" title="Keenspot">Keenspot</a>, which is odd considering that <i>I</i> clearly object. I'll remember <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> if you remember <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>.</li>
<li>The nominator is a <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">single purpose account</a>, whose <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bobagal_1d1f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bobagal">only contributions</a> have been to nominate <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darken.html" title="Darken">Darken</a> for AfD. That doesn't invalidate the AfD, but it does make his motives suspect. -<a href="../../../a/n/%C3%BE/User%7EAn%C3%BEony_a6df.html" title="User:Anþony">Anþony</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/%C3%BE/User_talk%7EAn%C3%BEony_4ae4.html" title="User talk:Anþony">talk</a>) 23:26, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, does no meet our content policies. Seems to be all original research as there is no third-party coverage by nontrivial reputable sources. Wikipedia is not an internet guide.

<li>You know, I wouldn't normally be so adamant about keeping an article on a webcomic, but I'm amazed by this repeated and outright denial of the facts. Aside from prominent articles in a major US newspaper and <i>the</i> publishers trade magazine, Keenspot has its own chapter in The History Of Webcomics (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0976804395</a>). I've collected plenty of evidence at <a href="../../../k/e/e/Talk%7EKeenspot_8f48.html#Keenspot_notability" title="Talk:Keenspot">Talk:Keenspot#Keenspot notability</a>; if anyone has a serious doubt about Keenspot's notability, I ask you to address that evidence directly.</li>
<li>Admittedly, <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darken.html" title="Darken">Darken</a> does need work. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marmaduke.html" title="Marmaduke">Marmaduke</a> isn't so hot either.

<li>Would you care to retract your accusation of "repeated and outright denial of the facts"? That's way over the top. I don't think I typed that Keenspot wasn't "notable." Maybe my eyes are decieving me, but I'm fairly certain that I typed that it was not a generally well-known publisher. I'm not sure why you're being so adamant that people address your tangent about the sources you've found for the Keenspot article, when you've neglected to address the nominator's original point that this article does not meet <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>. Note in particular that "Articles should rely on reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy," and that "If an article topic has no reliable, third-party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on it." (Also, as far as your Keenspot sources go, you do know that "The History Of Webcomics" is written by a former Keenspot artist, right? So it's not that surprising that he spent a whole chapter writing about it?) -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 07:53, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're right. In my frustration, I used language that was not appropriate and I do apologize. I still don't see how anyone could claim that Keenspot isn't notable <i>or</i> well-known. Even accepting that the book might not be a completely independent source, Publishers Weekly and the San Francisco chronicle have both run pieces on Keenspot and its founders. Doesn't that hold any water? How can I prove that Keenspot is "well-known"? You seem to admit that it's notable. We have objective tests for notability which Keenspot easily passes. There are none for being "well-known", which makes it pretty easy to disregard any evidence I should bring to bear. <i>That</i> is what frustrates me.</li>
<li>I've started a discussion at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Comics_54b1.html#Advice_on_improving_Darken" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Comics">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Comics#Advice on improving Darken</a> to address the concerns you've raised in a constructive effort to improve the article. Fiction articles rely on the fiction itself to source plot summaries and character descriptions all the time. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> does include an exception for self-published sources for articles about the author when the claims are not contentious. Though that admittedly does not directly relate to articles about fiction works, I see a clear parallel supported by the common Wikipedia practice in writing about fictional works. <span style="color: #F06A0F">–</span><small><span style="border: 1px solid #F06A0F"><a href="../../../a/n/%C3%BE/User%7EAn%C3%BEony_a6df.html" title="User:Anþony"><b><span style="background-color:White; color:#F06A0F">&#160;Anþony&#160;</span></b></a><a href="../../../a/n/%C3%BE/User_talk%7EAn%C3%BEony_4ae4.html" title="User talk:Anþony"><span style="background-color:#F06A0F; color:white">&#160;talk&#160;</span></a></span></small> 08:57, 28 November 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and previous statements, as I believe Keenspot itself is notable (and have made a note of such on Keenspot's talk page about some possible examples in favor of its notability), and that this notability does in fact apply to its member comics, too. As a business, there's a standard applied to get into Keenspot that generally means its member comics are also going to be known to a fair number of people already, a standard I think is high enough for recognition here. I also question the insistence for verifiability - on what information, specifically? Darken's wiki page makes no claims on its pageviews or other statistics that traditionally are considered to need extra sourcing. Is it just a matter of having to go through and cite specific pages of the comic where mentioned events happened? I'm not being snarky, I'm seriously curious if that things happened in the comic and can be pointed to on the site are enough or not. Nerrin 09:17, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, Keenspot is both notable and well-known, it's notability extends to all of it's member comics as per Anþony. If that isn't enough, Keenspot is a category, surely the items within the category should be considered notable? Darken is a work of fiction, and the only verifiability that should be required is referencing the fiction itself (such as citing the website, or citing pages which events occurred). Unless there is something in the article that talks about something that is outside of the content of the fiction, then no verifiability beyond the website itself should be required. If there is anything in the article that is outside of the content of the fiction, then those details should be addressed, not the article itself. Admittedly, the article should be written in a more Out-of-Universe approach, but that is an argument for improvement, not deletion.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholaiDaedalus_e937.html" title="User:NicholaiDaedalus">NicholaiDaedalus</a> 23:35, 29 November 2006 (UTC) <small>— <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholaiDaedalus_e937.html" title="User:NicholaiDaedalus">NicholaiDaedalus</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENicholaiDaedalus_a882.html" title="User talk:NicholaiDaedalus">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NicholaiDaedalus_a1d8.html" title="Special:Contributions/NicholaiDaedalus">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
<li><b>Delete</b> this article is completely unsourced, and no reliable sources have been identified from which the facts in the article may be substantiated, because as far as can be seen from a quick review there is no reliable source which gives details critique of this comic. If such sources do exist, feel free to cite them in the article, but right now it is an unambiguous delete per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 13:23, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> should not be a factor when the article cites the fiction itself as per AnÞony's and My previous comments, and doing so does not create a <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> violation as long as inferences and analysis is not included in the article. If there is no citations, then someone needs to just pop them in. If there is any original reasearch, then remove anything and everything in the article that isn't a description of the fiction's content. Would you delete the article on <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_62cc.html" title="Final Fantasy">Final Fantasy</a> if someone wrote in that FFVIII had the best opening sequence? It's in violation of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> isn't it? No you wouldn't, you would delete that comment and leave the rest of the article in tact. Again, these are arguments for improvement, not deletion.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicholaiDaedalus_e937.html" title="User:NicholaiDaedalus">NicholaiDaedalus</a> 20:40, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I do not think something should be deleted simply because it isn't Virgin Records or a top band. This site was made to be an Encyclopedia, was it not? The purpose of an Encyclopedia is to put as much information as possible. Now, I am not saying that Darken is a bad, non notable comic. Creator Komiyan is very notable in the webcomic community. The only argument I am seeing here for deletion is that Keenspot is not notable, that's an argument for the deletion of KeenSpot, not Darken. Plus, in the webcomic community, everyone has heard of Keenspot. In fact, I think it is the most notable. I may be biased because I'm a reader of Darken, but I see no evidence here other than it's hosted by Keenspot to delete it. -Paralda <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.250.206.182 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.250.206.182_6335.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.250.206.182">contribs</a>).</small></li>
