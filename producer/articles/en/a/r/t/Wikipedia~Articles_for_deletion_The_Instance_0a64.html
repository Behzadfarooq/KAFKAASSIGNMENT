<li>Regardless if the article is a work in progress there still is a lack of articles from 3rd party independent sources that lend credibility to the notability of the subject.

<li>Well, that's what I'm working on right now. I'm not associated with the podcast and will do my best to support the article. There hasn't been any discussion on the show on the main page at all before it was marked for deletion. The original authors where never even given a chance to remedy the article before this deletion was posted. However, if I can't find anything notable about it, I will join the chorus asking for its removal. <a href="../../../a/s/e/User%7EAselman_2b51.html" title="User:Aselman">Aselman</a> 03:34, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I add the following references and arguments from the originating articles discussion page, where this should have been brought up in the first place. I preface this by stating that an immediate call for deletion without so much as a single argument on the article's discussion page violates community spirit if not policy. My references for the page follow: This podcast was originally broadcast through <a href="../../../i/t/u/ITunes_59e0.html" title="ITunes">iTunes</a> distribution as a podcast on January 1, 2005 and has produced 47 episodes that have covered the entire year. Pursuant to the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">notability rules</a>: "Web-specific content[3] is notable if it meets <b>any one</b> of the following criteria...3. The content is distributed via a medium which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster." You have been arguing here just the first of three criteria, when any of the 3 is an argument for notability. It is difficult if not impossible to argue that distributions via iTunes for a year is trival. On the podcast homepage, over 394 people have commented on the podcast with an average rating of 4.5 (of 5) stars. According to the site comments are being logged as late as January 8th. Also notable that if you run a search for <b>World of Warcraft</b> in <a href="../../../i/t/u/ITunes_59e0.html" title="ITunes">iTunes</a> 30 podcasts are returned. This show has 390+ user comments. The next nearest cast has 140 or so. Its also important to note that the podcast has two sponsors, "TypeFrag" - a Ventrillo server company and perhaps more importantly <a href="../../../u/p/p/Upper_Deck_Company_31be.html" title="Upper Deck Company">Upper Deck Company</a> sponsors the show with advertising and prizes surrounding its <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_of_Warcraft_Trading_Card_Game_dd10.html" title="World of Warcraft Trading Card Game">World of Warcraft Trading Card Game</a>. I would argue that companies that spend advertising money on a podcast, clearly makes the show as notable as ANY television show that accepts advertising. Finally, outside links to the podcast. Since podcasts are downloadable media, the reside on a single server and are advertised at multiple directories around the Internet. This is how subscribers find the show. <a href="http://www.podcastalley.com" class="external text" title="http://www.podcastalley.com" rel="nofollow">Podcast Alley</a> contains a listing for the show at <a href="http://www.podcastalley.com/podcast_details.php?pod_id=17466" class="external text" title="http://www.podcastalley.com/podcast_details.php?pod_id=17466" rel="nofollow">here</a>. <a href="http://podcasts.yahoo.com" class="external text" title="http://podcasts.yahoo.com" rel="nofollow">The Yahoo Podcast Directory</a> contains a listing <a href="http://podcasts.yahoo.com/series?s=f953fc152a336f3178bf7d4686cda7fc" class="external text" title="http://podcasts.yahoo.com/series?s=f953fc152a336f3178bf7d4686cda7fc" rel="nofollow">here</a>. <a href="http://www.podcastpickle.com" class="external text" title="http://www.podcastpickle.com" rel="nofollow">Podcast Pickle</a> also contains a listing <a href="http://www.podcastpickle.com/casts/19122/" class="external text" title="http://www.podcastpickle.com/casts/19122/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The podcast is active and clearly has a following. Moreover, it meets the requirements for notability. <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> also notes that sites that are new should be given a chance to grow. I believe that is the case here as well. <a href="../../../a/s/e/User%7EAselman_2b51.html" title="User:Aselman">Aselman</a> 04:50, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>A lot of what you've said isn't an argument for keeping. It's easy to argue that distributions of podcasts on iTunes is trivial. They host literally thousands of podcasts, not all of which can be considered notable. Popularity is not one of the criteria for deletion (or keeping), so that's irrelevant. The problem is that it's received no independent coverage. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 10:33, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Trebor, you keep arguing about independent coverage of the podcast but you are missing the fact that that is just one of three possible tests for notability. You may feel you can dismiss my argument under the 3rd test, but it meets the criteria laid out laid out under <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, that <b>a program distributed by a third party makes it relevant</b>. Independent citations of the podcast are <b>not</b> required if <b>one</b> of the other two tests there are met. World of Warcraft has over 7 million subscribers, this podcast brings news and information to that community. It is this podcast's service of that community that makes it notable. Podcasts should be tested like radio programs and there are any number of programs that have a far more limited audience and far less significance. Yet there they are in a their own article in Wikipedia. The <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_US_radio_programs_bb92.html" title="List of US radio programs">US Radio Program Listing</a> is here. All I ask is that you actually read the rules for notability completely and not stop with the first one. <a href="../../../a/s/e/User%7EAselman_2b51.html" title="User:Aselman">Aselman</a> 13:25, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

If this shouldn't exist, why should articles on characters that have mostly been in maybe a page of a comic book have any mention at all?

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> I did not create the article for promotional reasons and I have no other connection to The Instance other than the article (in fact I have quit playing WoW altogether); I believe that it has enough relevance to exist, regardless of "third - party sources." I did not include the Show Sponsors section when I originally created the article. That section has been removed to prevent it from appearing to be a promotion. However, I would not call it a "promotion" of the podcast because it costs nothing to subscribe to it. And aren't all articles a promotion of their topics? While <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo86_eb89.html" title="User:Leebo86">Leebo</a> says that the article "only has relevance to some WoW fans," he/she neglects that that is exactly the point of the podcast, to be relevant to WoW fans! And by some, he/she means thousands! The Instance is among the most listened to WoW podcasts (as evidenced by it being one of the few WoWcasts to have sponsors) and has one of the highest amounts in customer reviews on Itunes with over 350. It has arguably the largest fan base of contributors and show participants, whether through posts on forums, emails, and phone calls of any podcast. What is meant by those who say that they can't find any unbiased sources about the topic of the article. Why would this article require unbiased sources? There is no debate about the podcast or the topics it covers and the article has by all means a neutral POV. If you do a Google search of "most popular warcraft podcasts, "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en-us&amp;q=most+popular+warcraft+podcasts&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en-us&amp;q=most+popular+warcraft+podcasts&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">here</a> you will find the truth about whether or not this article should by AfD.

<li>Please see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a> for the criteria for notability. While a podcast might be listened to in to World of Warcraft community, whether or not that is notable enough to deserve its own article is a separate issue. Being listed on directories does not establish notability, as evidenced in the "Primary notability criterion": <i>"Non-triviality" is an evaluation of the depth of content contained in the published work, exclusive of mere directory entry information, and of how directly it addresses the subject.</i> There are a lack of published works discussing this podcast. So far all the evidence of its notability have been its listing in directories of podcasts and the amount of comments left for it on those directories.
