<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Non-notable neologism? I think not. I first heard the term nearly 20 years ago, so I doubt whether "neologism" stands up. As for "non notable", if it reached this far-flung corner of the English-speaking world it's fair to say that it is almost certainly in use in many countries. 68000 non-wiki ghits should be some kind of indication in itself. The term has been used widely in the media, too, by everyone from <a href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=245096" class="external text" title="http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=245096" rel="nofollow">The New York Times</a> to <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/relationships/sex-lies-and-movies/2006/11/28/1164476209095.html" class="external text" title="http://www.smh.com.au/news/relationships/sex-lies-and-movies/2006/11/28/1164476209095.html" rel="nofollow">The Sydney Morning Herald</a> to <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1837281" class="external text" title="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1837281" rel="nofollow">NPR</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 02:09, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - "A topic is notable if and only "if it has been <u>the subject of</u> multiple, non-trivial published works with sources independent of the subject itself and each other." "The subject of" <u>does not</u> equal <u>merely mentioned in</u>. Right now, the cold hard facts mean the article does not meet that criteria. <b>Note:</b> Culling together sources that merely mention or use <i>Vanilla sex</i> <u>as a colloquialism or slang term</u> only asserts that the article is, in fact, Synthesis and Original Research. I suggest if you want to keep this article, you best expend your efforts finding sources where <i>Vanilla sex</i> *AS A SPECIFIC TERM* "has been <u>the subject of</u> multiple, non-trivial published works with sources independent of the subject itself and each other." <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Notability is not subjective</a>.

<li><b>keep</b> "vanilla sex" has been discussed at least by implication in essentially everything written about other flavors; the use is universal, and the content real. I remind Cyber that the verifiability has to be about the <i>subject</i> &amp; what is said about the <i>subject</i>. The term merely has to be shown to be the standard term, and that is surely clear enough.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> "Vanilla Sex" is not in and of itself a topic or thing that can be talked about beyond mere definition. "Vanilla" is commonly used to describe something ordinary or boring, thus "vanilla sex" is just ordinary or boring sex. I can't see how something like that can ever move beyond the Dictionary stage (which I think is borne out by the article as it stands) and therefore is inappropriate for Wikipedia. Nothing in the article purports scholarly use or cites any sources--it's just a colloquialism for unexciting intercourse.--<a href="../../../v/e/l/User%7EVelvet_elvis81_65b4.html" title="User:Velvet elvis81">Velvet elvis81</a> 07:08, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I've added a couple of sources. One is a criticism of the term "Vanilla Sex". The other is from the British Medical Journal, whose use of the term adds weight to its credibility.
