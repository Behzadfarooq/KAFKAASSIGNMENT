<li><b>Delete</b> - Most likely it was originally a section from the main article and was split off because it got too big.

<li>Uh... the thing is, we can't just take your word on it. We <i>could</i> if Slashdot would have a complete archive and automated statistics system, and someone would have done extensive chronicling of the place. By purging the history automatically, it kind of digs its own grave on the verifiability department; what we have is "current" situation. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 15:17, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Okay, I admit it, I clicked on the <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=20721&amp;mode=nested&amp;commentsort=1&amp;threshold=-1" class="external text" title="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=20721&amp;mode=nested&amp;commentsort=1&amp;threshold=-1" rel="nofollow">link</a> you provided. As far as I can tell, all the content is just copy-pasted text from public domain sources (the bible, old dictionaries, etc), all presumably posted by a bot or some posting script, and given the lack of variety, more than likely all posted by the same bot. So if all the posts are generated by bots, with no actual discussion going on, who cares whether it gets a thousand "posts" a week, or a million, or a trillion? They aren't even actual posts, and without any discussion going on, it isn't even really a forum. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 15:45, 11 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As mentioned in the article, Trolltalk has been attack almost constantly since May 2005 by a sophisticated crapflood script that renders it practically unusable. Generally, nobody posts during the crapflood because their post would get buried, despite the efforts of the Trolltalk Digest (which FAILS IT miserably). Sometimes the crapflood crashes for a few days, and human activity will return until the crapflood is fixed and restarted. Some people still skim through Trolltalk even during crapfloods looking for other human posts, but it's usually an exercise in futility. Surprisingly, however, Trolltalk got more posts <b>before</b> the crapflood: the number of genuine human posts in the past two weeks was often well above <b>5000</b>. Most of the former users have been driven away by the crapflood so Trolltalk probably would never return to its former glory even if the crapflood were stopped for good. In fact, the crapflood was stopped for about two days in order to announce these AfDs, but nobody seemed to care. Because of that two days without posts, the Trolltalk post count is actually about 500 less right now than it would be if the crapflood had continued during that time. 4.253.43.96 20:48, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also, the crapflood does not use "copy-pasted text from public domain sources". The crapflood uses a number of different process threads that operate in different manners. One is a crapflood uptime report. Three use the Unix <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortune_%28program%29.html" title="Fortune (program)">Fortune (program)</a> including the standard databases and a number of collected &amp; customized databases. Four use <a href="../../../m/a/r/Markov_chains.html" title="Markov chains">Markov chains</a> to generate random but sensible-looking text based on four different sets of input text. One of these replies to existing comments in order to fuck up the anti-crapflooding efforts of the Trolltalk Digest. Then there are others but you get the idea.</li>
<li>p.s. I'm not the Trolltalk Crapflooder; I'm going off of public information here &amp; analysis of the crapflood over the past 1.5 years in an attempt to track down the Trolltalk Crapflooder's identity. I am in no way connected to the Trolltalk Crapflood; in fact it's widely believed that the Trolltalk Crapflooder doesn't even read Trolltalk anymore. 4.253.43.96 20:56, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Even though Wikipedia doesn't consider the number of posts as a measure of notability, it would be good to point out that ~500 posts/day is fairly good evidence that a forum/website is FAR from being large enough to be notable. Realize that places like <a href="../../../g/a/m/GameFAQs_b5e0.html" title="GameFAQs">GameFAQs</a> have HUNDREDS of individual boards with that amount of activity per day, and they certainly don't have their own articles here. --- <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockMFR_f871.html" title="User:RockMFR">RockMFR</a> 23:17, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Askaryan was indeed the inventor of the light self-focusing, reference now given in the Article. This is well-known and widely accepted in the scientific community. Apart from that he was the inventor of what is now called the Askaryan effect. To emphasize the broad range of interests and topics investigated by Askaryan, I included a list of 50 selected publications from 1954 all the way to 1997. Note that most of the papers have been published in Soviet times in domestic journals, which limits the access somehow for the general public. All the publications can be found at www.isiknowledge.com To show the importance of the light self-focusing in fundamental science (particularly non-linear optics) as well as in its later applications in laser optics I will soon provide more references. This has now become a classical textbook material in optics. In fact, this can easily be found simply searching in google. As a person belonging to the laser optics and laser spectroscopy community, I will try to mainly contribute about Askaryan's works in optics, but I am sure much can be said about his contribution in plasma physics/chemistry and high-energy physics. This will be done too. Vahan Senekerimyan 09:00, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This book (Strimple, Nick (2005). <i>Choral Music in the Twentieth Century</i>. Amadeus Press. p.261. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1574671227</a>) says, "Prominent educational composers at century's end included ... Rene Clausen (b.1953), who mastered a lush impressionistic style...." Also, an Amazon search found 20 discs containing his compositions, 11 of which are currently available, 2 of which are kept in stock at Amazon. Those are facts I can quickly produce. BTW, I know of him only as a composer, whose music I've performed on a number of occasions. The fact he's possibly a non-notable educator is irrelevant. I'm no expert, and won't think of including my opinion in the article, but I believe he is unquestionably a notable 20th century sacred choral music composer. I'm confident that a little more digging could document this better. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuintote_b2cc.html" title="User:Quintote">Quintote</a> (<a href="../../../q/u/i/User_talk%7EQuintote_226d.html" title="User talk:Quintote">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Quintote_f09a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Quintote">contribs</a>) 15:09, 11 October 2006.</small></li>

<p>At least one of the claims in this article was unverifiable and the subject of the claim complained about it (apparently), so I removed it. The other claims don't seem verifiable either. I found very few references to an organization with this name even existing through web searching. Someone de-proded because the article is also on the French wikipedia, however, that article is just a translation of this one (including all the dubious claims). If someone can find reliable sources then we can abort this AFD. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small>2006-10-10 01:58Z</small></i></span></p>

<li><s><b>Delete</b>. I agree with Siva that the article is unverifiable at present. The article is also on the French Wikipedia, but as Quarl observes (above) it was translated from the English original! Later commenters in either language seem to have improved the style (and removed one of the incidents) but not injected any new information from printed sources. Unless someone wants to read some French or Algerian newspapers or histories to get more info, I think we should delete. Otherwise we're just propagating an unconfirmable rumor.</s>. Changing my vote to <b>Keep</b>. See the article from Humanité found by Emeraude (below) and the UNHCR article. *Plus* see the web site www.algeria-watch.com. Although this site has a POV they are full of pointers to actual books and articles in the regular French press. See a bunch of info that I added to the article.</li>

<li><b>Probably keep</b> A search on google.fr for "Organisation des jeunes Algériens libres" and restricting to web pages in French only returns 65 hits (including the wikipedia article). Browsing the first half dozen suggests that the organisation did exist and was/is notable. For example: [<a href="http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/1994-03-31/1994-03-31-697561" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/1994-03-31/1994-03-31-697561" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>] and [<a href="http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/1994-04-01/1994-04-01-697648" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/1994-04-01/1994-04-01-697648" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>] both from the website of the French newspaper l'Humanité.

<li>The new evidence found is even more disturbing. We have one source which says the group exists, founded 1993, etc.; another says that it did not exist and was invented by the Algerian secret service as a cover-up. So now we know the organization was claimed to exist but not whether it really existed. Also the article had many unverifiable indirect claims ("OJAL killed foo who was bar", but we can't verify that foo was bar). If this article is to exist, someone will have to completely rewrite the article, spend time doing serious research, and making sure the article doesn't imply any of the claims/hypotheses are facts. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small>2006-10-12 06:57Z</small></i></span></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I agreed with your original nomination of the article for deletion, due to lack of verifiability. Now that we have relatively good sources, and don't leave our readers stuck without any resources to click on, I think we've done our job. If the quoted people, like Samraoui, disagree with one another, we can't help that. But so long as we trust that Samraoui was quoted correctly, I think we're OK. Let our readers decide from the evidence we collected what is most likely to be the truth. A diligent person could probably collect more references just by Googling on the people's names in the current article, but this may be enough. (Another option is to search Le Monde whose archives seem to be open). I encourage the reviewers who have found more references to add them to the article. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 22:18, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Reply to comment</b>: Take a look at the User Talk page and edit history of the user who created the article (<a href="../../../d/4/r/User_talk%7ED4rk0_7716.html" title="User talk:D4rk0">User talk:D4rk0</a>). This person seems to be a persistent vandal. I wonder if they are trying to promote the term just to see if they can get other people to use it. Perhaps they plan to start adding the term to other pages with links to this page. Note that seven months ago the person was scolded there with the remark "Please stop adding your own inventions to Wikipedia". Or perhaps "Vemo" is just a term used by this person and a small group of their friends, but not a widespread and noteworthy accepted thing. I also wonder about the choice of bands that are listed as examples of the alleged genre — for example, considering the description of the term, does <a href="../../../s/e/e/Seether.html" title="Seether">Seether</a> really fit? Also note that the only "supportive" edit to the article made after its initial creation was by an anon IP address that is associated with similar vandalism (<a href="../../../2/0/3/User_talk%7E203.114.137.10.html" title="User talk:203.114.137.10">User talk:203.114.137.10</a>). —<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWookipedian_bc6b.html" title="User:Wookipedian">Wookipedian</a> 19:21, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I had very little idea what they were supposed to be, so a definition in the introduction would be helpful. I have added a one sentence definition from the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brahmin.html" title="Brahmin">Brahmin</a> article, so readers who are not followers of the Hindu religion will have a clue. (When I saw the name of the article, I thought of rodeos.) If a number of them are notable enough to have articles on their own merits, there is utility in having a list, a category, or other means for linking the articles. The Brahmin article says they are at least 2% of the popuation of India, which would be 20,000,000. If the most important present 1% of them were listed, it would amount to a list of 200,000 individuals, leaving off those who lived in the past.

<li><s><b>Strong delete</b></s>. Ignoring the numerous sockpuppets infesting this debate, I would point people towards previous debates on the Awasthi <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Awasthi" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Awasthi" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> and Patel <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Patel" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Patel" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> surnames. I am completely unconvinced by the arguments given in those previous debates: you could make exactly the same points about most Western surnames, in that they originally denoted trade, religion, place of birth and so forth. Just because the clan name we are discussing is not Western, and involves areas of discussion such as caste, there is no reason to throw aside the principle that Wikipedia is not a genealogy database. To claim that the name Parekh inevitably means someone is of particular clan or status is less and less meaningful as emigration and reimmigration continue to throw categories into doubt. This should be on one of the numerous Wiki genealogy projects, but it is not an encyclopedic article. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 09:21, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> -I feel its one of the most efficacious Wikipedia articles with authentic sources and corroborations to the same, being found out easily when one coducts a few simple internet searches. The point of deliberation shouldnt be as to whether it qualifies for here or not, but about the authenticity of this great article on Parekhs. If Wikipedia were to delete it from here, then same should be the case for all surnames listed Wikipedia.org . There are "Parekhs", "Gupta", "Jain", "Shah", "Patel" some Indian surnames and countless other English surnames too which are currently enjoying an encyclopedic status at Wikipedia, where the roots of these surnames have been traced, and notable people with them have been included at their respective pages. So what's wrong with "Parekh" . If, in particular, Gujarati Surnames, "Shah", "Patel", and the likes can enjoy wiki status and encyclopedic articles on them which have existed since long without deletion, then why not "Parekh". Its just another surname like the hundreds listed here at Wiki, with accurate informations and notable people having the same. Its a remarkable research filled article on Parekh, I mean that's the way I see it and therefore see no point or end to this bit of debate. Neither is the article Licentious/profane/abusive/sexually perverse or anything that Wikipedia abhors, bans. It is perfectly within the standards of Wikipedia. Perhaps, it might need a little brushing over again, but that doesnt qualify it to be deleted completely. That'd be sad. And if that were to be, then I'd propose deletion of all other wiki articles on each other surname listed here. There are by the hundreds, each tracing roots of that particular surname and listing notable people with it, as in case of "Parekh". This is not a small issue. Calling for deletion of this article, calls for immediate deletion of each wiki article which defines a surname and traces its roots. I could say the same for "Patel" or "Gupta" or "Shah" here at Wiki. They too are mere surnames , and again not fit as encyclopedic articles, if the debate were to expound further. A little refurbishing is all that needs to be done . And definitely this article should remain, in lieu of other hundreds of such articles on topics of 'surnames', if this were to go, rightly should the others follow suit too. Lastly, I believe its Wikipedia's policy to ban or warn such members here who abuse or deem others inferior in public, such as user "Vizjim" has done in his last post, calling others here as "sock puppets". This behavior is severely banned in open places/forums of Wikipedia .I would also like to call upon the attention of the administrators to immediately seek apologies from Vizjim of having open castigated other fellow Wikipedian's who've commented on this article.</li>

<li>Erm, I denigrated nobody by name. If the cap fits...

<li>That's the point. If this article were to be deleted, then so should hundred others which have references to; or are encyclopedic articles on surnames. They are by the hundreds here, as I keep searching wiki's index. They are "Parekh", "Gupta", "Shah", "Reed", "Straley" and a whole exhaustive bunch of them. All surnames, which have encyclopedic pages dedicated to them, which are huge. And ending with famous/notable names with that particular surname as in Parekh. Parekh, I reiterate again, is a wonderful article. And in anycase, it makes no sense deleting such a well researched, well polished article--for again, if that were to be, then I'd be sorry to see hundreds of other articles,only on "surnames" go from here. Rules are rules. Rules applicable to one article should be stringently followed for the other. The Bottomline,if "Parekh" is deleted, then so should hundreds of other articles here at Wikipedia.org which list only 'surnames/end names' of people of virtually every origin.</li>

<p>And Vizjim, no that does take away your abusing people and fellow wikipedians here. Your calling them 'sock puppets' doesnt make you the leader of the lot. They are all important people here in this argument, leaving their valuable time and comments on this particular article as I see. Did wikipedia give you the right to call them 'sock puppets' and clearly deem them inferior doing the same. Wikipedia needs to take serious action against this particular comment of yours on other worthy wikipedians here in this discussion, as you've called them 'sock puppets'.

<li><s><b>Strong keep until</b></s> Khukri you are right. I have also deliberated upon this in discussions above. Unless each article containing 'surname'or personal 'name'isnt deleted at Wikipedia, it would be wrong to delete "Parekh". If "Parekh" is deleted, then what about those hundreds and thousands of other 'surnames' which have encyclopedic articles written about them here at wikipedia. Should wiki delete them all. Who would point them all out to wiki in the first case. They are just too many. We could at the most point out to a 100 more of them existing and see to their deletion. But even still, thousands would remain in wiki's database, unnoticed and it would be unfair that whilst a few 'surname' articles are deleted-thousands more would remain. Unless, Wikipedia itself doesnt define a clear cut policy for this 'surname' article issue, that would imply to all 'surnames' here, there's no point deleting "Parekh". The moment "Parekh" is deleted (which'd be really sad , as its a fantastic article and a beautiful research on the word), it should in fair sense imply, that every other 'surname' here at wikipedia is deleted, without our having to point the same out to wikipedia-or without our having to research in great inexhaustible detail as to which other 'surnames' are prevailing here. Wikipedia itself should take action against every article with 'surname' itself, and remove all these thousands from its database. Which I think would be sad, because of the rich depth and content of these articles, compounded with the several hours of legitimate research that might have gone into creating these articles.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>A final conclusion to this mighty discussion. That in fair sense, "parekh" should remain, and be brushed up a little, if it doesnt meet the perfectionist wiki standards. We can all unite to brush and polish it. But in no circumstances, should it be removed, as that would lead to a mass 'exodus' or virtually every other 'surname' and 'name' being deleted from here. A great loss that to the spirit of wikipedia and these great articles created. Let "Parekh" live, the bottom line. And Vizjim thanks for the apologies to all, in future I hope you restrict yourself to open abuse of words such as 'sock puppets' in open forums and other places. They only show your airiness and your deeming of other users here as inappropriate and belittling their views.Coolkeg908 13:09, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Strong Keep</b></s> Vizjim, you are again resorting to open public abuse by addressing all other users as 'sock puppets'. Your behavior is really absurd. On one hand you apologize as above and now again you are on the ranting and condemning other users. So what if they're a first time. Perhaps, they are trying to enter other discussions as well here at wiki. And even if they're first timers, who gives you the right to condemn them or abuse them or belittle them for that matter. This is serious. I must report this to Wikipedia immediately. They should be taking action. Emeraude, yes you are right and as I'm also saying above, if this 'Parekh' is delete , then alongwith it every 'surname'/'name' wiki article should be deleted. And that should happen instantaneously from the database of wikipedia. It shouldnt be that "Parekh" is deleted first and then time/months pass before other 'surname' articles are deleted. If the deletion of this article has to happen, then on a fair basis, every other wiki article with 'surname'/'name' should be deleted simultaneously. If that isnt done and only this one is given the stick, I feel it would be highly unjust. And we users would never be able to reach out to every 'surname' article here at wiki and inform wikipedia about the same, b'cause there are thousands of them out here , which we'd never be able to tap. Also if they arent deleted simultaneously, all of them with 'surname' , then I dont think justice would prevail. Anyways, in the end, I would leave it to Wikipedia to give its final verdict, all that I would finally like to iterate again is that "Parekh" is a brilliant article in all respects. It should be given its credit for the countless hours of research that must have gone in building the page up.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>If it calls for deletion, then so do the thousands of other 'surnames' and 'names' here at wikipedia.org , and that too simultaneous deletion of all these thousands of articles, not that this one goes first, and then the rest take ages to go, just b'cause we users would be virtually unable to point out to them.Coolkeg908 14:05, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Disambig</b>- Agree with you Disambig. Because of 'noteworthy' people and name-bearers involved, let the page remain, dont delete it. But turn it into a 'disambig' page. The page shouldnt be deleted at any cost, b'cause that gives birth to many more controversies, invoking the immediate deletion of thousands of other pages of 'surnames'/'names' for a fair basis. So I feel, this option works out best and avoids the deletion of several thousands of other related pages. 220.224.21.251 17:41, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Disambig</b> I think <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> has the best plan.

<li><b>Comment</b>-Since this page was proposed for deletion on Oct 9, I feel that by Oct 14, ie. 5 days later, a final decision would be taken regards its deletion, as there's a time frame of 5 days involved, in which wiki listens to debates. As far as this one goes, well its pretty obvious then that the page would stay and wouldnt be deleted. Good for the Parekh's notable ones, involved here and the very brilliant depth of this article. We'll soon come to know within 2 days or so if I'm not mistaken, about the final status of this page. I'm sure now after all these debates as above that it'd stay. Sadly, if deleted, it'd invoke thousands of other pages to be deleted as well containing 'names' and 'surnames' which are wiki encyclo articles currently. Coolkeg908 18:10, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Reply</b>: not assuming to know the way the closing admin will see this, but the current consensus among the regular editors seems to be to get rid of the current article and to replace it by one that says: "Parekh may refer to: -Link to name1 -Link to name2 - Link to name3." Please don't expect that because most people don't support deletion, this will mean that the article will just stay as it is.

<li><b>Comment</b>- Well if that is so, that if this page were to be replaced by something as you suggest, with just links to the notable people, with the other stuff being removed, that be it. But then, Wiki should do that on a fair basis for thousands of other pages here with 'names'/'surnames'. It shouldnt be one-sided and only for this page. This has been discussed above. That should be fair enough then. If this were to be converted into the way you are implying, then so should countless others be, similar to this. So I feel, that Wiki would let the article remain, rather than changing thousands of other articles . Coolkeg908 05:06, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Just to be quite clear, the logic employed here would lead to the deletion or radical pruning of the following articles: <a href="../../../s/m/i/Smith_%28surname%29.html" title="Smith (surname)">Smith (surname)</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clan_MacKay_44e9.html" title="Clan MacKay">Clan MacKay</a>, Li (surname), among many others.

<dd>No problem with the removal of most of the material on <a href="../../../s/m/i/Smith_%28surname%29.html" title="Smith (surname)">Smith (surname)</a>. The Clan is more of a political / sociological entry, similar to a tribe (no offense intended towards either tribes or cottish people), so I think that an AfD there may justifiably give a different result. I have nominated for deletion a lot of Indian clans (ghotra's) as well, but reached no consensus. If a name is clearly more than just who was your father and what was the occupation of some greatgreatgrandfather, but indicates a "tribe" (for want of a better word), with political, geographical, ... implications, then more people will be willing to keep the article. This is of course a fuzzy boundary, and it won't be clear on every article in which category it falls (see <a href="../../../h/a/b/Habsburg.html" title="Habsburg">Habsburg</a> for an extreme example on the "keep" side). I don't feel that this article (Parekh) has enough reason to keep it, and furthermore has a complete lack of sources (thus failing <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>). <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 10:16, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I think we've come back to squre 1. Its not just about the deletion of surname 'Smith' or another particular surname. The question here is about the deletion of all 'surnames' and 'names' irrespective. That is, if "Parekh" is deleted, so should thousands of them others , particularly 'surnames' should be deleted from Wiki on a fair basis. So, lets not argue on a particular deletion of a 'surname'/'name' alongwith deletion of "Parekh". Lets conclude in a generalized statement, that if "Parekh" is deleted, then on a very fair basis, Wiki should immediately delete all other 'surnames' wiki articles alongwith the same. That's why I've been reiterating that let "Parekh" remain. If there's problems, lets work at updating it or refurbishing it according to Wiki standards. But the bottomline, let "Parekh" remain, in order to avoid the immediate deletion of not just one particular other name/surname, but in order to avoid deletion of thousands of other articles with 'surnames'. Because each Wiki article with surname is like "Parekh" , in conjunction with "Parekh". So you have to be fair in deleting all of them, if the question is about deletion of "Parekh". A surname is a surname. There's nothing special about any surname. They are just encyclopedic articles on each one of them, like the article on "Parekh". Also, the whole absurdity of the situation here is, that whereas someone suggested "Parekh" for deletion in the first case, that someone didnt care about this aspect of several thousands of other surnames being here at WIKI and their simultaneous deletion with "Parekh". If that someone had thought of the same, then he/she wouldnt have suggested or nominated this particular article for deletion. Or whilst nominating this particular article for deletion, would have definitely on an ethical and fair terms, also suggested the deletion of thousands of other 'surname' articles, doing a thorough research on them, and pointing out to them individually by their names. I feel I have nothing more to talk about this. What's fair is fair. Lets adhere to that. That if this goes, so should thousands of other 'surnames'.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> (this began as a <i>weak keep</i>, but I'm now sufficiently perplexed as to be unable to draw a conclusive conclusion) I've long argued that, where a subject is notable but where there is little salvagable encyclopedic content in the article apropos of him/her/them/it, stubbification or deletion (with, concomitantly, a listing on <a href="../../../r/a/_/WP%7ERA_a7f5.html" title="WP:RA">WP:RA</a>) is in order, but there appears here to be sufficient content, especially in view of Ëzhiki's additions, that the concerns as to the bizarre, essayistic quality of the article ought to be allayed; there remains, to be sure, <b>much</b> culling to be done, there is a not insignificant amount of text that might be kept or substantially reworked. As to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, whilst I'm not at all certain that one's receiving a <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hero_of_Socialist_Labor_097e.html" title="Hero of Socialist Labor">Hero of Socialist Labor</a> or the State Prize of the <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainian_SSR_3da5.html" title="Ukrainian SSR">Ukrainian SSR</a> confers notability, I think it likelier than not that Sukhomlinsky is notable in view of his prominence as a pedagogic(al) philosopher, which prominence is evidenced, I suppose, by his having been the exclusive subject of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Each-One-Must-Shine-Sukhomlinsky/dp/0820439886/sr=1-1/qid=1160498166/ref=sr_1_1/002-9260599-5532833?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/Each-One-Must-Shine-Sukhomlinsky/dp/0820439886/sr=1-1/qid=1160498166/ref=sr_1_1/002-9260599-5532833?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">one book</a> (and a referenced subject in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_seeall_2/002-9260599-5532833?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=Sukhomlinsky&amp;rh=i%3Aaps-blender%2Ck%3ASukhomlinsky%2Ci%3Astripbooks" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_seeall_2/002-9260599-5532833?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=Sukhomlinsky&amp;rh=i%3Aaps-blender%2Ck%3ASukhomlinsky%2Ci%3Astripbooks" rel="nofollow">fourteen more</a>, as may perhaps be sufficient per <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROFTEST_d942.html" title="WP:PROFTEST">WP:PROFTEST</a>) that is, AFAICT, the subject of at least one independent, non-trivial review (so as to suggest that the book, at least, is perhaps <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28books%29_a961.html#Criteria" title="Wikipedia:Notability (books)">notable</a>); whether as an author the subject is notable is a closer question.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>, but <b>re-write</b>. A known Soviet educator, recipient of numerous prestigious (even though Soviet) awards. He is mentioned in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Soviet_Encyclopedia_520c.html" title="Great Soviet Encyclopedia">Great Soviet Encyclopedia</a> and contemporary Russian encyclopedias. Indeed, the article looks like an essay, but it doesn't mean he is not notable. And guys, if you never heard of a person, it doesn't mean he is not notable. E.g., I saw a DYK article the other day called <i>Raising the flag over Iwo Jima</i> (sorry for possible mispelling), which CLAIMS that this is <i>the most recognizable image in the world</i>. I've never seen this image in my life until I visited the US. How's that for not notable?? <a href="../../../k/n/e/User%7EKNewman_9692.html" title="User:KNewman">KNewman</a> 17:17, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> per above. An award is an award. The fact that it was given in the Soviet Union does not make it less of an award today.

<li><b>Keep</b> Others have adduced much better sources than those I found, and they of course make plain that the subject is notable. I'd intended to ask an editor able to read Russian to weigh in, as I imagined that many more references were available solely in the Russian language, such that a simple Googling wouldn't be dispositive as to notability, but several editors seem already to have taken up that task, for which they are to be commended. As to the awards, btw, I didn't mean to suggest that the fact of their being conferred by the Soviet Union and the Ukrainian SSR thereof ought to be understood to diminish their significance; rather, as I've expressed elsewhere, I look somewhat dimly on our considering as necessarily notable those who have received similar <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_decoration.html" title="State decoration">state decorations</a> (even those that are particularly exclusive, such as the <a href="../../../b/h/a/Bharat_Ratna_f097.html" title="Bharat Ratna">Bharat Ratna</a>), but I've come, in any case, to rethink that view. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 20:18, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Since wrestling is one of a few topics disproportionately represented on Wikipedia to the point of cruft, as opposed to more notable topics like history, and people seem to want to cover wrestling even more than what's already represented, and the system for marking results of matches is cool but also cruft even if it's on <a href="../../../w/r/e/WrestleMania_III_4bdf.html" title="WrestleMania III">WrestleMania III</a>, might I suggest rejuvenating the <a href="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/c:Prowrestling" class="extiw" title="wikia:Prowrestling">Pro Wrestling Wikia</a>?

<li>You said "none of them are associated with a specific brand". Now you are defining "them" to be episodes of RAW, SD, or ECW. Since Family Reunion, which included wrestlers from all three brands, does not fall under your definition (so "association with a single brand" is not defined by what wrestlers are included), it seems to me that your definition is structured to either render your point always true or to confuse people. How can "they" be episodes of RAW, SD, or ECW, and not be associated with a specific brand (or show, as it now seems you meant here)? Care to clarify the point you were trying to make? Because I don't see the difference between Family Reunion and the Guerrero tributes or other <a href="../../../v/e/r/Very_special_episodes.html" title="Very special episodes">very special episodes</a> of RAW. (If you had said "cable/broadcast television shows" it would be a lot clearer, though not completely, because <a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturday_Night%27s_Main_Event_a611.html" title="Saturday Night's Main Event">Saturday Night's Main Event</a> isn't an "actual episode of RAW, SD, or ECW" either.) <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorgan_Wick_96a0.html" title="User:Morgan Wick">Morgan Wick</a> 23:45, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>PPVs are considered Supercards. The assertion was that all Supercards have articles. You countered that Supercards are not associated with a specific brand. I proved that statement to be false.

<li>Sorry, not thinking clearly. All this show was was a season premiere of RAW that just happened to feature wrestlers from the other brands. It was more a special edition of RAW than a supercard. Supercards are basically specials like SNME that occur once in a while. But even then, not each SNME episode has it's own article, it's all in one SNME article, same with the non-major PPV's. Each edition of Backlash doesn't have it's own article, they are all in one Backlash article. So why should special episodes of RAW have their own articles when the last SNME isn't by itself or the 2006 Backlash PPV doesn't have it's own article? <a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDubhagan_33c0.html" title="User:Dubhagan"><font color="black"><b>James</b></font></a> <a href="../../../d/u/b/User_talk%7EDubhagan_8d04.html" title="User talk:Dubhagan"><font color="green"><b>Duggan</b></font></a> 19:33, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I take umbrage slightly with this dismissive and borderline uncivil attitude.

<li>Definitely dismissive, certainly incivil. Nothing personal against you, but there has been a crop of bad, bad AfDs lately, and I think this is one of them. I think there are just some people out there who don't like music, aren't fans of music, and don't want to see music articles on Wikipedia, so they're putting up as much as possible for AfD. There was recently a bunch of food articles speedily deleted by <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">a misguided editor</a>, and that demonstrates the point I'm trying to make - why should someone have to argue for an article on <a href="../../../n/i/l/Nilla_Wafers_94cd.html" title="Nilla Wafers">Nilla Wafers</a> to be kept?

<li>Falsely accused of lack of resources and dispute over neutrality. References section has been in place since day one. Made clear that information posted has come from subjects statements or from researchers, and not of my own opinion. Made clear that article is not to please majority, but to collect statements from subject and researchers. Accusations of conspiracy is conclusion of accusers, and has been the sole purpose of deletion. Tried to edit any sections that did not have a neutral POV, or lack of reference, and have yet to find one. Challenged accusation on neutrality, challenged accusation that subjects story is minority view, and challenged accusation that govt. doesn't believe story, with ANY REFERENCES. Have yet to see any. Author believes that accusers are unhappy that I did not shadow article with doubt. I believe that would be dishonest to my readers.

<li>Added link to the references section. I've tried the best I could to find any mainstream sources, and I've only found one. I WILL NOT be deleting and redirecting, because this page is about James Files as the subject, not scrutiny over his claims. Everyone has attacked the article thinking I'm trying to shove a big conspiracy down the readers throats. This is not the case. That is exactly why I put "Files states...." or "Files claims...." in all sections. Because thats exactly what they are, they are claims and statements. Some of the statements came from the DVD "Files on JFK", which must be purchased. I'm going to come out and say, maybe he's lying, maybe he's telling the truth. I do not know, that is for the readers to decide. I am using the work of several respected researchers, primarily Mr. Wim Dankbaar and Mr. Bob Vernon (but not exclusively), because they've done the hard research, as opposed to others that, say, may have read an article and sprinkle their opinions in a commentary or something. The best I could do was google some more websites to add to the references section. <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldwings_200f.html" title="User:Goldwings">Goldwings</a> 06:12, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The simple fact of the matter is that the vast majority of "respected [JFK] researchers", even those who are conspiracy-oriented, consider James E. Files to have all the credibility of Wile E. Coyote. Wim Dankbaar's website is close to being the sole reference point for this article and is cited no fewer than twenty times. The article is riddled with pro-Files bias, in spite of the author's claims, and ought to be deleted forthwith; at the very least, it ought to be merged into the JFK Conspiracy Theories section and should not be allowed to stand alone.

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. Although Acaosr asserts without contradiction that they might be notable, right now in the article there is only a couple of sentences here and the tracklisting of a compilation album (which doesn't really belong), so if there might be enough outside coverage and other notable bands to write a real article on them, then surely someone can do so. As he says, this deletion doesn't prejudice such an article. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 15:03, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> They have released loads of records. I dont know what to vote either way here but fyi, they are one of the medium to bigger UK independent labels and have limited distribution to record stores. their ex act, <a href="../../../g/e/t/Get_Cape_Wear_Cape_Fly_e71b.html" title="Get Cape Wear Cape Fly">Get Cape Wear Cape Fly</a> was signed to Atlantic this year and another of thier acts, Yndi Halda is probably notable enough for inclusion. They are pretty well known amongst uk indie music. (can't sign on as I'm at work, username is <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmists_8945.html" title="User:Amists">User:amists</a></li>
<li>I'm giving this a <b>Weak keep</b>. I don't think giving <a href="../../../g/e/t/Get_Cape_Wear_Cape_Fly_e71b.html" title="Get Cape Wear Cape Fly">Get Cape Wear Cape Fly</a> his first releases is enough of itself but they're home to two or three full-time international touring acts and some of their recent releases have enjoyed the attentions of the BBC and The Guardian. A record label can only ever be as notable as its artists and this label is a borderline case but just (and only just) on the right side of the border for my cash. <a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 17:35, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Keep this page! The label has released many great bands, not just Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly. See www.bsmrocks.com for evidence of that.

<li><b>Comment</b> - the quality of the music isn't being discussed and isn't relevant. I hate Coldplay but I don't deny their notability. There are plenty of bands/labels I love but wouldn't attempt an article for. The question is whether or not the label is, at this time, of encyclopedic value. If it isn't now, it may be in six months time so a delete is not fatal and binding forevermore. <a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 16:38, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Move</b> to <a href="../../../t/h/e/Variant_Magic%7E_The_Gathering_Formats_eab8.html" title="Variant Magic: The Gathering Formats">Variant Magic: The Gathering Formats</a> as suggested by Mister.Manticore above. The current article is probably a little large for a niche format, but just as Magic storylines and Magic rules have split off and made their own article, perhaps a Variant formats article is also appropriate. Obviously, if moved, RRD would become a section, not the entire article. Such an article would probably need to be viligantly watched with "must have a cite before adding a format," but that's doable. Plus, that way the main article can simply have a link to Variant Magic Formats, and niche formats like RRD can be removed from it more easily. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowFire_df7e.html" title="User:SnowFire">SnowFire</a> 15:15, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ehrm. For future reference, C&amp;P moves are generally frowned upon, as they erase the contributor history required by the GFDL; moving the RRD article would probably have been better.

<dd>The problem with that is that it would give far too much weight to a single format, and that just didn't sit right with me. But heck, the article probably needs a rewrite from the top anyway. With a whole article, we can do at least a paragraph on each notable format, not just a sentence. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 00:57, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I have read it in my books about RC theology. I do not know the exact term in English because I studied it in Czech and in German, but this could be solved by moving the article, if the term Conservator is wrong.

<li>Yes but they describe the concept. I am not sure about the term in English - in Czech it is Udržovatel and I found many www references related not only to the Christian God, but also to Vishnu and other deities. In English I found <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06614a.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06614a.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a>, but it does not use the title as well. - What I wish to say is that the title of the article may be wrong, but the concept is established and IMHO encyclopedic.

<li>Please, do not use too much irony against fellow Wikipedians. Wrong title is really not a deletion reason. - Now I found it - the proper English term is Sustainer and not Conservator.

<li>Wait for an admin unless you are one.&#160;:-) - The obvious problem of the article is that it is concentrated only on Catholic theology, but the concept of God Sustainer is present also in other Christian denominations, in Islam and other monotheistic religions, and even in Hinduism (Vishnu). It should be broadened. Greetings--<a href="../../../i/o/a/User%7EIoannes_Pragensis_cdfc.html" title="User:Ioannes Pragensis">Ioannes Pragensis</a> 15:16, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have seen discussions which ended for withdrawal without being unanimous. But it does not matter much. The important thing is that this is not OR - you can find the notion about God the Sustainer in many books and articles (e.g. <a href="http://www.stnews.org/Commentary-2389.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.stnews.org/Commentary-2389.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.stnews.org/Commentary-2389.htm</a>). And it is not a NPOV violation, because the article just reproduces the Roman Catholic POV and correctly says it. Of course there are other viewpoints which can (and should) be there, but this is not a reason for deletion.--<a href="../../../i/o/a/User%7EIoannes_Pragensis_cdfc.html" title="User:Ioannes Pragensis">Ioannes Pragensis</a> 20:23, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Note and Question from Author of the Article:</b> First, it should be noted that he did not write this article. The problem may be with the way in which I wrote the article. I did not mean to simply write a resume but I did not want it to be a commercial either. I wanted it to stick only to the facts of the person and give the general information which people have been interested in finding out about. Granted, unless you are involved in the futures industry, you may not be familiar with who this person is. But, due to his commentary on the subject, he is fairly well-known of in this field. Again, this is most likely my own error. I modeled it after some bio articles I found on here such as that of the new CEO of the Ford motor company, etc., as I imagined those would be properly written. Would anyone here be able to suggest what to do to change it so that it does not simply look like a CV - while at the same time maintaining an unbiased and fact-only content so as to stay in line with the integrity of Wikipedia's purpose? Or is it actually ok in it's current form?</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>, Guy, you say "this is a nominee (not even a candidate yet)". But a nominee of a major political party (Republican) is possibly further along in the policial process than a mere "candidate". Did you mean to say "not even an elected official yet"? If so, why are candidates for a national political office (assuming reliable sources about their candidacy can be found) inherently non-notable? In this particular case, I could only find one article in a reliable source to support keeping this article, so I <b>abstain</b> from voting here. · <b><a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#707070">j e r s y k o</font></a></b> <i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#465945" size="1">talk</font></a></i> · 19:16, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>jersyko, candidates are generally non-notable because (unless they succeed) nobody would want to know about them in 10 years' time, and sources will not remain available to keep the article up-to-date.

<li><b>Comment</b>, so candidates in an election to a national office are inherently (generally) non-notable. What if there are multiple <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> (say, newspaper articles, which, despite your comment to the contrary, will be available 10 years from now) that provide enough <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> information such that an article about the candidate can be written? Additionally, what proof do you have that someone will not want to read about an election and its candidates 10 years from now? (Actually, that's probably the best time to study an election, or even later than that, after the historical picture becomes more clear with time) The whole idea is (1) biased in favor of incumbents and possibly violates NPOV and (2) supported only by subjective perception of what is and is not "notable" with passing reference to WP:NOT. The blanket assertion that political candidates are non-notable is, I posit, an untenable position. I don't meant to single out your arguments only, Vectro, as there are other editors who have argued in the same vein. I suppose all I can do is chalk it up as yet another example of the <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_On_notability_01d9.html" title="User:Jersyko/On notability">overuse of notability as a ground for deletion</a>. · <b><a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersyko_510d.html" title="User:Jersyko"><font color="#707070">j e r s y k o</font></a></b> <i><a href="../../../j/e/r/User_talk%7EJersyko_3ca3.html" title="User talk:Jersyko"><font color="#465945" size="1">talk</font></a></i> · 18:27, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Article lacks ANY verifiable information. Not ONE citation. Subject is a completely unnotable pornographic star with very internet presence other than her own pornographic website (with a completely low Alexa rating), and mirror sites. Only notability seems to be 1. Her extremely large breasts 2. Being one of the few neo-fascist big breast stars 3. Her heroin addiction, none of which qualifies her whatsoever under current AfD rules.

<li>I meant #6, "Performer has been notable or prolific within a specific genre niche," extremely large enhancements being a very specific genre.

<p>No establishment of notoriety. Website has an Alexa rating of below 600,000. Only other notability is the ownership of a MySpace. Major films include "Razor Woman" and "UFO Tracker" both B-grade films with limited releases, prints lost. More big-boobcruft. I hope people can look past their prejudices towards well-endowed women and realize this stuff is completely unnotable and doesnt belong on an encyclopedia.

<li><b>Comment</b>: The sources adduced so far seem to be limited <i>her own,</i> aside from her list of appearances at IMDB. ¶ More generally, I'm puzzled by the way in which WP seems to treat seriously the biographical claims of this or that porn star(let). My utterly uneducated <i>guess</i> is that these people would draw a line between their professional and private lives, and would take considerable precautions to protect the latter from their ardent (and priapic) fans (who will certainly be represented among WP readers, if not editors). If this guess is correct, then the phrasing would be something like "According to the biography concocted for her, the person marketed as 'Wendy Whoppers' was born on 13 August 1970" blah blah blah. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 03:30, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm not sure what the bases for your complaints are. Her own site is an authoritative source on relatively uncontroversial matters per <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>. Things like her film, magazine, and television appearances are uncontroversial unless you find a source that questions them. AFDB lists 95 of her 120 films, IMDB also lists quite a few. Here is a link to a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG2iKzNUs7k" class="external text" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG2iKzNUs7k" rel="nofollow">YouTube page with an clip of her on Montel Williams</a>, likely a copyright violation, like so much on YouTube, but it is proof of her appearance. Yes, porn stars lie in their bios, but not nearly as much as the writers, lawyers, businessmen, and politicians, whose claims we also take seriously without claims contrary. Finally, the very first sentence in the article says it's her stage name, without using the unnecessary and loaded words "concocted"and "marketed"; all that is what a stage name is. We don't even do that much in the whole lead section for <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wayne_22ff.html" title="John Wayne">John Wayne</a>, surely no less of a concocted and marketed persona. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 13:47, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I thought I'd made the bases pretty clear. Yes, I think the IMDB list of her appearances (or perhaps we should say revelations) in films, etc., would be fairly uncontroversial. It's a long list, and I imagine that it meets WP's porn notability criteria, which I have neither read nor claimed to have read (this being one reason why I haven't voted). You say: <i>Yes, porn stars lie in their bios, but not nearly as much as the writers, lawyers, businessmen, and politicians, whose claims we also take seriously without claims contrary.</i> This seems strange. The facts that the two groups want to advertise or obscure are likely to be very different. Politicians' addresses will be known to the mass media, the more prominent among them will get police protection. Porn stars' addresses are a different matter, and the porn cliche that the stars like to pork virtually anyone, any time is likely to inflame the passions of the dimmer readers. I find it hard to imagine that the stars would get police protection, much though they might deserve it. Politicians have to talk truthfully about their origins, academic achievements, etc.; if they don't, the opposition will pounce on the inaccuracies. By talking truthfully about her past, a porn star makes it easier for her more ardent fans to locate her in the present, which is something I imagine she's unlikely to want. Et cetera. So again, I've nothing against porn stars in general or this one in particular, and I am completely certain that this one exists -- but I've no particular reason to think their "biographical details" (other than nationality and very approximate age) are more than fiction. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 23:55, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Aha. I think I see your point. However, given all that, what exactly in the article do you object to? The sentence "...currently resides in Fort Lauderdale..."? I actually can't find that on her bio or other sources. Will strike. That she was born in St Louis 30 years ago? That hardly makes her easy to find now, so I would leave that in. All that said, does that weigh on the article's being deleted completely, which is what this AfD page should be about, or should we move it to the article's talk page, which should be where individual minor facts are discussed? <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 13:04, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

Nevertheless, the reasoned argumentation that there is leans clearly enough toward deleting. The publications by this author are really pretty minimal also, and so there is none bestowed upon this book by transference. (I would also observe that the article is <i>massively</i> over-detailed and entirely disproportionate to its own needs.) I do not think it met any of the recent castings of G11, however.

I do not believe Wikipedia should be used as the repository for every single stat or book or episode related to a certain subject. But and this is a big but and the reason for the Weak delete, is that precedent has been set all over Wikipedia, using a term I've noticed recently of <i>fancruft</i> i.e. stats of everysingle WWE wrestler.

<li><b>Comment</b> The talk page covers the true issue with Randy, ego. He has no body of work and no fame beyond what any fan would have. Dreadmire has set no records of note. There is no legal status as no legal proceedings were conducted, the book was simply rejected and the project dropped. No new paradigms were introduced, I do have a copy of the book, most of the swamp information was copied from other public sources and no relevant game information was produced. The site is self promotion and spam. Currently Randy has no associations with gamming. He hits the local cons only to shill his book. He rejects all views contrary to his own and lashes out at anyone with a different viewpoint. He is a master at the sockpuppet. Currently Randy owns his book site, the spellbinder site and the message board. He owns the Spellbinder and dreadmire name user names, I believe he is also Cryogenesis as well as I fail to see any person who would want a worship site for him. Deletion is earned just by the need to make this something it is not. Lets wait 5 years and let Randy publish a few more books under his company Spellbinder then we can revisit this.<a href="../../../q/u/o/User%7EQuode_b582.html" title="User:Quode">Quode</a> 02:06, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> As I said, this is personal for you. That has no place here. You desperately WANT your accusations to be true. You felt slighted and now you seek revenge. Okay, fine, but you should post your accusation on the Spellbinder Games forum, or some other gaming forum. It has nothing to do with the criteria for inclusion in Wikipedia, which is primarily "notability". If someone had to be moral or ethical to be a part of Wikipedia, then there would be no articles on <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolph_Hitler_82be.html" title="Adolph Hitler">Adolph Hitler</a> or <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Koresh_ffce.html" title="David Koresh">David Koresh</a>. Trying to convince us that Randy Richards is crazy or unethical has nothing to do with the notability of the Dreadmire article about his book.

<li><b>Comment</b> The above quote is accurate. It may seem trivial, but its a game, and no one is saying its noteworthy beyond that genre. Its certainly no better than the wrestling. You have to intimately know the genre to understand why the book is notable. If the Dreadmire entry is deleted, there are going to be hundreds - maybe thousands - of other deletions of books, campaign settings, TV shows, editors, and authors that must follow. Precedent has already been set in this genre. If its gets deleted I am sure someone else will eventually add it back without realizing it was deleted. No big deal I guess, I just hate to see all my work go to waste and someone else get to enter it. If it needs to be "cleaned up" then clean it up, don't delete it. Suggestions on cleanup are welcome.--<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryogenesis_42ba.html" title="User:Cryogenesis">Cryogenesis</a> 07:07, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't know what other ONLINE references I can point to. To prove to you the book is, without a single doubt, notable, I would have to take you to a few dozen conventions to watch and talk to the people playing the game, and talk to industry game designers and companies. I would have to show you the other reviews and articles written in magazines that don't have their content available on the internet (which is rare). I would have to take you to game stores across the U.S. to get the scuttlebutt on the book by gamers. Its not like Wrestlemania where its easy to see on TV. This is something that takes place in real life, in garages and game cons all over the world. The links I provided give some indication to the level of interest about Randy Richards and his published works. <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_21fa.html" title="Dungeons &amp; Dragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> books, even the ones produces by <a href="../../../w/i/z/Wizards_of_the_Coast_1d36.html" title="Wizards of the Coast">Wizards of the Coast</a>, are not likely to be reviewed on national television or other more established book sources, which is what it seems that you want. The convention circuit is where such books are reviewed - with money and play time, and guest spots for the author. I have provided several of these links to establish a verifiable pattern. Explain to me what more you want and I will try to provide it. --<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryogenesis_42ba.html" title="User:Cryogenesis">Cryogenesis</a> 07:36, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Why all the discussion about Ego and advertising? Shouldn't this be about the Product? Has anyone here actually read the book? I have. I own a copy bought with my hard earned cash and the fact is... I like it. Being a Gamer of 24 some odd years, I've seen the Golden Age of Role Playing Games. I have also seen the business side, where corporations try to turn a profit on my favorite hobby. I've seen an assortment of products: some that were fairly absurd and some with stories that gripped me and made my imagination run wild. I would get an idea that would start a campaign that went on for months and gave me many an enjoyable hour sitting with friends. Randy Richards book, "Dreadmire", reminds me a good deal of the wonderful modules and products of the "younger" days of DnD.. It gave me quite a shock of nostalgia when I first thumbed through it and I'm glad I bought it. What about the fact that The Ancient Druids left several mysterious artifacts behind, many of them sunk into the swamp? What about the possible side effects of "Dark Pollen" created by the "Somesuch" and can something be "brought back from the Dark Side"?? Does anyone want to discuss the 'pros and cons' of having Leacon the Ducklord as your Deity of choice? He, Randy, gave us a Great deal of information while keeping some portions ambiguous enough to allow the DM to "run" with an idea he/she might have. Personally, I'm tired of spending a great deal of money for a thin book which Dreadmire certainly is not. It was well worth the money in my opinion and deserving of a mention here for other 'pure gamers' to find. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 74.230.180.50 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_74.230.180.50_046a.html" title="Special:Contributions/74.230.180.50">contribs</a>) 01:54, October 12, 2006.</small></li>

This is where the fans speak. No fan nominated or voted for Dreadmire. Granted there will be those who like the product but for the ENnie awards a large fan base is required.

<li><b>Comment</b> This was discussed on the message board. ENnie nominations for books that were published in 1995 are nominated at the beginning of 1996. Since the book was published in December of 1995, and worldwide book distribution did not begin until Spring of 1996, there was no chance to nominate Dreadmire. It is my understanding from reading the website, that since it was technically published in 1995 it will never be able to be nominated for an ENnie, even if its the greatest D&amp;D book ever published.--<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryogenesis_42ba.html" title="User:Cryogenesis">Cryogenesis</a> 07:07, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

I would hardly think that is enough time for gamers to play and evaluate the book in time for an ENnie nomination. Seriously, its got 220,000 words.

<li><b>Keep</b> I bought Dreadmire during the Summer when it first became available in my area at my local hobby store. My original intention was to read the book and knock the wind out of it in an online review. I had high hopes of pointing out all the IP violations. That never happened because 1) there isn't any I could find, and 2) the book was just that darn good. A game is a game, and no one is going to argue (hopefully) that Dreadmire is going to solve world hunger or bring peace to the Middle East. And I know there are a lot of harsh feelings against the author. The book he wrote is unbelievably engaging and detailed. So good in fact that we have a club here locally we call "Dread Gamers" and we get together every week to play in the Dreadmire campaign setting. I can't speak for everyone. Its a popular book in my circle of friends. I know at least 14 gamers that own a copy. If people can separate the book from their bias against the author, you'll see why Dreadmire deserves an article on Wikipedia.--<a href="../../../j/l/s/User%7EJLsan_4a26.html" title="User:JLsan">JLsan</a> 22:44, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

This user's entire edit history reads like a massive, interlinked set of advertisements for the non-notable author "Randy Richards" and this particular publication. User Cryogenesis has (as of the time of this posting), edited the Dreadmire article (a book written by Randy Richards), uploaded images of said publication, added lists of fictional Dreadmire-specific plants and animals, created an article on Spellbinder Games (the publisher of Dreadmire, and apparently no other works despite the fact that it is claimed Spellbinder has existed since 1975), created a biography of Randy Richards, and made almost no other contributions beyond a few edits on other D&amp;D-related topics. In addition, several of these inter-linked articles have been created since the Dreadmire article was nominated for deletion. It would seem *highly* likely that Cryogeneis is in fact Randy Richards, and that he is in blatant violation of <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>. In fact, if you examine the edit history for all of these articles, you will find that Cryogenesis has created all of them, and made almost all of the substantive edits to these articles. There's a WP term for this, which escapes me at the moment, but essentially this is a circle-jerk type of phenomenon. Cryogenesis has created and edited a bunch of articles which fail <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>, and made them look interlinked and "sourced," when in fact this is one giant circular, interlinked advertisment for a non-notable publication.

<li><b>Comment</b> Credibility suffers when “facts” change while trying to discredit an observation. This discussion is in regards to this article being spam. When first raised we had this argument brought to the table “I would also like to note the article is not meant to be an advertisement for Dreadmire. The book was published several years ago, and I believe its "run" is over (in the gaming industry, book runs are often short-lived). If this article is perceived that it is to be used to sell books, I would think its a little late for that!”. And yet when there was an issue with this article being noteworthy we learn this. “Uhhhh, as I just posted, according to Alliance Games Distribution the worldwide distribution did not begin until spring of 2006, in mid-May. I would hardly think that is enough time for gamers to play and evaluate the book in time for an ENnie nomination.” The same goes when people try to paint me as being one thing or another. My argument and reasons for such are clear along with my motivation, I stand up to bullies. Please do not confuse infamy with notability, endless diatribe with beneficial debate.<a href="../../../q/u/o/User%7EQuode_b582.html" title="User:Quode">Quode</a> 02:10, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Credibility suffers when “facts” change while trying to discredit an observation. The comments about worldwide distribution, ENnie qualification, and the "run" of the book being over, are all accurate. The d20 market is soft. In the 1980's/90's a typical D&amp;D book run was 30,000 books. In 2006, a game company is lucky if it sells 800 books. 1,400 book sales would be a runaway hit. 2,000 would be a blockbuster. Ask any game company, including WotC, Spellbinder Games, and Necromancer Games, if you don't believe me. It doesn't take but a couple of months to sell 800 to 2,000 books. The "run" of the book is over, as would most any game book by this time. Perhaps you should do more industry research before spin doctoring information to fit your version of the world. The only bully here is you, as your consistent hammering has made self-evident.--<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryogenesis_42ba.html" title="User:Cryogenesis">Cryogenesis</a> 18:04, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: CLEF has been a major driving force behind much cross-language research, in Europe and beyond. Increasingly, it is also the platform of choice for investigating innovative retrieval scenarios, proposed by research comunity and/or industry. It has given rise to hundreds of scientific publications, and is an excellent venue for new research groups and young researchers to get into the field. Finally, more and more IR and NLP research in Europe needs to be supplemented with explicit task-based evaluation efforts---CLEF provides an evaluation platform for a broad variety of information access tasks, and because of that it (and the many retrieval test sets that it has produced since the start of the century) has become an essential building block in the European research landscape. (As a side issue: CLEF is a collaborative effort, very much organized in a bottom-up fashion, by the research community. The knowledge and resource sharing that goes on in and around CLEF is in the very same spirit as what drives people to cotrnibute to Wikipedia.)

<li><b>Keep</b> - CLEF is a very important evaluation campaign for Information Retrieval systems. It has indeed done some notable work by providing a common setting for researchers to perform experiments and thus evaluate their systems.

<li><b>Keep!</b> CLEF has a seven year history and attracts a large and growing number of research groups from around the world.

<p>Seems fairly low in the notability stakes, certainly by internet meme standards (compare ~500 GHits for <i>"Crazy German Guy" video</i> to &gt;1,000,000 for <i>"<a href="../../../n/u/m/Numa_numa.html" title="Numa numa">Numa numa</a>" video"</i> or &gt;400,000 for <i>"<a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_kid_473a.html" title="Star Wars kid">Star Wars kid</a>"</i>, which I suppose are somewhat comparable internet phenomena).

<li>I am the author of Crazy german guy's article. While I am starting to understand that maybe this isn't quite notable enough, personally I'd rather not have it deleted. It took me ages to watch a subtitled video of it and copy word for word into the dialog section, and I don't want to have all that work deleted. (PS. If in order to keep it I must change the title to Crazy German kid, how do I do this?

Lots of our competitors have pages, such as <a href="../../../a/k/q/AKQA_397a.html" title="AKQA">AKQA</a> - I just want us to have one too...? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Henweb (<a href="../../../h/e/n/User_talk%7EHenweb_cd05.html" title="User talk:Henweb">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Henweb_8902.html" title="Special:Contributions/Henweb">contribs</a>).</small>

<dd>I'm sorry I failed to notify you of this AfD. First of all, the question is if you should write an article about your own company in the first place. Articles on wikipedia should be <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a>, and it's very hard to remain neutral when you are involved. The important this is whether the company is notable enough for wikipedia. The basic notability guidelines for companies can be found at <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. That is what articles about companies are judged on. We don't have articles because "competitors also have pages", or because the company would like to have an article. <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Aecis_0e71.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Aecis"><font color="blue">A</font></a><a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis"><font color="green">ecis</font></a> <sup>I'm too <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis">busy</a> acting like I'm not <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis">naive</a>.</sup> 12:51, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree it's too notable to be speedily deleted and it could be a reasonable article if the author can change it to a neutral point of view. I'd say it's too heavily focused on promoting the company and listing acheivments instead of providing a user useful, impartial information on the company. <a href="../../../a/a/_/User%7EAA_Milne_73ab.html" title="User:AA Milne">AA Milne</a> 12:57, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>I understand that, but I checked the guidelines and it looks fine to me. The guidelines state "The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself" - we are frequently mentioned in the press, we are mentioned in the current issue of Revolution for instance, and Marketing Week. Can you clarify why you think we don't qualify? I can give you some examples if you like? A quick look at our client list should show we are a pretty big player in the UK industry, though I appreciate what you mean about not writing our own entry.</dd>

<li><b><s>Keep</s></b> There may be problems with this article, but is it really any different than the other car rental companies? Unless somebody can convince me why a company with 3500 locations should *not* have an article, I'm going to suggest this be moved to cleanup. As it stands, I suspect this was babelfished from a foreign language wiki. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 15:58, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm not saying that this company shouldn't have an article, I'm saying that the article as it stands does not belong at wikipedia. Cleanup has been attempted, but didn't help. If that is the case, it's better to have a redlink than to have this article. <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Aecis_0e71.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Aecis"><font color="blue">A</font></a><a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis"><font color="green">ecis</font></a> <sup>I'm too <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis">busy</a> acting like I'm not <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis">naive</a>.</sup> 16:33, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps paring the article down to a bare minimum might work? Me, I could probably be easily convinced that the company isn't even real, but given that it is a foreign one, I'm inclined to give it the benefit of the doubt. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 17:28, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is not a company that has 3500 locations, rather it brokers other car rental agencies with a total of 3500 available pick up locations. Give it a redlink if you like, on the French page it is flagged for something, looks like grammar there too (don't read French that well), so I am not sure it is babelfished or not. I tagged it for cleanup a few weeks back as I am all in the interest in keeping pages in the 'pedia, but no-one had any interest in cleaning. After I read it again I saw the lack of any company history or anything encyclopedic. Furthermore I have gone to the site and discerned that they do not publish a company history, and the parent company is "Autos Benelux". any article here should at least be for the parent company. Interestingly enough the About Us link brings you to a page about the company that has some of the same grammatical errors as the article.<a href="../../../p/u/c/User%7EPuchscooter_404c.html" title="User:Puchscooter">Puchscooter</a> 18:21, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, on further reflection, I'm going to have to rescind my vote. It doesn't seem that this company is genuinely what it purported to be, though if somebody who reads French or Spanish or whatever language this company is native to does know better, then they're welcome to say so. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 18:53, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>A Must Keep</b> - The Kamehameha wave has become a universal icon and inspiration to the world of modern art and animation. As Western culture and practices become ever more influenced by methods and aesthetics of the East, the significance of the Kamehamehe wave is increasingly noticeable. I find that most arguments made against the inclusion of this definition stem from a disdain for "fans" or people who possess a zealous interest in the particulars of artistic expression (particularly television programs). Ultimately, this article is completely valid and factual in that it accurately represents a term employed in the program referenced, therefore such definitions are factually based, and factually based information, however trivial some may feel it to be, is indeed knowledge. Those who seek its removal seek, simultaneously, to limit the scope of Wikipedia's ability to inform. They seek to cut short knowledge. It is not for us to deem what is or is not "good" or "relevant" or "trivial" information. All information is of worth. And those who seek to remove any information, are guilty of crimes against knowledge.

To quote one of the users in that discussion: "Let me see if I can, I was reading this and then had a look at the page. What does the one page attacks page consist of? Well when you break it down, it's a list of the different ways one character can punch another in the face [note: in this case, it would be "blast someone in the face"]. Using this logic, we should create a page for DC universe offensive use of superpowers - Superman has quite a few and using them in combination he can work up more than 5 "attacks". Once we have done this, we can move onto the same for the Marvel Universe etc. When you consider that minor characters should not have their own articles unless there is good reason.... attacks?" This is even worse than the linked page, since several attacks in this show are very similar.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>- The Kamehameha is a very important element in Dragon Ball and has enough information to keep it's own article. The attack list doesn't do any harm, and it helps readers understand more about what they're reading by giving a picture and description of each attack. I'd say these articles are pretty important, and this request is pretty rash. I also think it's interesting how your account is only 2 says old, and you have 7 edits (6 of which are creating this page and nominating said pages for deletion).--<a href="../../../k/o/j/User%7EKojiDude_79b7.html" title="User:KojiDude"><font color="blue">Koji</font></a><a href="../../../k/o/j/User_talk%7EKojiDude_b028.html" title="User talk:KojiDude"><font color="darkblue">Dude</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_KojiDude_f1ad.html" title="Special:Contributions/KojiDude"><sup><font color="lightblue">(Contributions)</font></sup></a> 19:09, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

The designation of "cruft" hinges on it being UNIMPORTANT to the topic in general. This one doesn't fit that because of the nature of the show. The anime has the various special attacks and such things as the way of determining combat. Thus having a list of them is almost as important as having a list of races or characters.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarhawkman_ce32.html" title="User:Marhawkman">Marhawkman</a> 03:02, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - In general, it seems that most of the ability stuff is better confined to the characters who use it. Centralized information in the character articles is far more useful.

<li>All right. Let me rephrase that. My vote is <b>delete</b>, because there is NO REASON whatsoever that this article needs to exist on its own. The information (such as it is) in this article could easily be trimmed and merged right back into the individual character articles. (How hard is it to mention something like "Vegeta's 'Big Bang attack' creates a large sphere of ki which is then launched at the opponent, leaving a <a href="../../../m/u/s/Mushroom_cloud.html" title="Mushroom cloud">mushroom cloud</a> in its wake" in the main <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegeta.html" title="Vegeta">Vegeta</a> article?) So.

<li><b>Keep</b>: I've seen pages like this before, I don't think this is fancruff at all. I think this is a good attempt at handling attacks that most other major manga and anime attack pages fail to do and it DOES contain useful infomation. Now I'm not a fan of the show (in fact I can't stand it!), normally I would oppose everything to do with DB because I'm somewhat baised, however this page is okay in my books. It may not get read very often (but there are other wikipedia pages that don't get very often too that are far less informatitive) because of what its about... But it is useful. I don't see a problem with this article.
<p>Plus a lot of this page is just common knowledge amongst the DB, DBZ and DBGT media. If you delete this, this might make the DBA wikipedia pages incomplete somewhat. I agree there is still room for improvments, for instance there are far too many pictures for moves as some of them cannot be summed up in one picture. As someone pointed , many of these moves are simulair.</p>
<p>And... Even Superman has his own attacks page so to speak.<a href="../../../p/o/w/Powers_and_abilities_of_Superman_724f.html" title="Powers and abilities of Superman">Powers and abilities of Superman</a>, although its more abilities then attack (just listing what he is capable of doing). Perhaps if this was more written towards like how this article is, would you allow it? I say, if this page is delete worthy at least let everyone working on it at least give everyone a chance to rethink it. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngel_Emfrbl_1a20.html" title="User:Angel Emfrbl">Angel Emfrbl</a> 07:49, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Ah, the flawed and ill-founded "It's just like <a href="../../../p/o/w/Powers_and_abilities_of_Superman_724f.html" title="Powers and abilities of Superman">Powers and abilities of Superman</a>." argument again! <a href="../../../p/o/w/Powers_and_abilities_of_Superman_724f.html" title="Powers and abilities of Superman">Powers and abilities of Superman</a> is a <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Wikipedia:Summary style</a> breakout sub-article of <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html#Powers_and_abilities" title="Superman">Superman#Powers_and_abilities</a>. To justify similar breakout articles for one particular facet of Dragon Ball characters on the same grounds, you would have to show that they, like <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a> had individual articles on the individual characters that were so crowded that one had to break out the special abilities section, summary style, from the main article on the character. Looking at <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegeta.html#Techniques_and_special_abilities" title="Vegeta">Vegeta#Techniques_and_special_abilities</a>, that's clearly not the case. Indeed, the information on the attacks in the character article is <i>longer</i> than the information on the attacks in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Dragon_Ball_special_abilities_c3fe.html" title="List of Dragon Ball special abilities">List of Dragon Ball special abilities</a>.

<li><b>Delete all</b> per nom. Even the Kamehameha, while perhaps an important concept in the series, does not need this much detail - the entire article could be boiled down into a single paragraph. Quite simply, this is an encyclopedia not a fan-wiki, and as such it is quite adequate to describe a character's <i>most important</i> abilities <i>in that character's article</i>, and only break them out if (like Superman) those characters and abilities are so culturally relevant that it is important to discuss them in more detail than there's room for in a single article.<br />
Note that this clearly doesn't apply to these abilities, because even references to Dragonball in other series tend to refer only to very general concepts like "powering up", not to specific attacks.<br />

<li>comment To delete or not seems to hinge on one thing: Is it encyclopedic? If you're going to do an encyclopedia article about DragonBall Z, then you're going to need to explain the various techniques and skills performed during the course of the show. Whether or not this takes the form of an itemized list is determined entirely by how detailed you make the article. IMO this article IS detailed enough to warrant a seperate list. As for "justification" I'd like to point out that there's only ONE article for all of the Dragonball characters.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarhawkman_ce32.html" title="User:Marhawkman">Marhawkman</a> 09:56, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>No. You don't have to explain the mass amount of "attacks" "He blasts him away with ki energy." "He blinds him with a ki skill." It's rather easy to explain without resorting to pointless names that only confuse the lay reader. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterrobamf_9382.html" title="User:Interrobamf">Interrobamf</a> 10:01, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Actually I find it to be the opposite. That sort of explanation is suited to a plot summary. However it's not well suited to an encyclopedic article. Besides, the names aren't pointless. Most of them are mentioned in the anime/manga as the name of the technique when it is shown being used.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarhawkman_ce32.html" title="User:Marhawkman">Marhawkman</a> 10:09, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hilarious how you refer to an "encyclopedic article", as a list of fictional attacks in a cartoon that's treated as if they were real isn't anywhere close to encyclopedic. I still fail to see how "Goku uses an Kalakamakma on Biggu Heado" is more encyclopedic than "Goku fires a blast of ki energy at Biggu Heado". <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterrobamf_9382.html" title="User:Interrobamf">Interrobamf</a> 10:19, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep it as well as the rest</b>: Why the heck is this page being nominated for deletion and on the basis that the One Piece Attacks got deleted? The Dragonball pages are more professional looking than what was deleted plus these moves are more notable than the One Piece ones. Do not delete them because they are integral. They exist because they are part of this types of character. The way a fictional anime and manga character hits someone with a named attack can explain alot of the character. They explain what a character can do and can't do. They explains how far they are willing to go. They explain the character's creativity based on how they deliver the attack. They explain alot of the characters that words alone cannot summarized. You can't explain that in a summary like what the Superman page. The only way to convey that message is to list the attacks in some sort of manner. This is not cruft. In fact as quoted by the admin who deleted the One Piece article "One man's "cruft" is another man's priceless tidbit on information, and regardless of anything else it's incredibly rude to the individuals who have volounteered their time creating the article to use a belitteling and pejorative term." In other words what is useless to one person is useful for another person. This page is worthless to somebody who doesn't like or even knows the show but it is useful to those who do. The One Piece Attacks deletion was a great lost to alot to the people who edited it. It made alot of people sad and angry. Did anyone think about those people who gave alot of sweat and blood for that page. Did anyone think of the long hours and research they tireless did. If you delete this page and others like them based on what really should be in a proper looking and real encyclopedia rather than a free source of information then you are alienating an entire community from wikipedia. You are alienating them all. You are alienting both editors and clients. I am saying all these because I was spammed by one for my opinion who's first post in Wikipedia was in the One Piece attack AFD discussion namely the guy who brought up these entire discussion. I am going a bit uncivil here and risking being blocked if not banned from Wikipedia but it is well worth it.

<li><b>Comment</b> The Dragon Ball Character articles are already massive as it is; now you want us to copy all these attacks and ect. into them? The list is a conveinient and informative article. It isn't "fancruft" at all. It's just ifnormation about attacks used in the show. How are we supossed to write the Dragon Ball articles and expect somone who's never seen the show to understand it? I've seen that in every peer review, Rey Brujo mentions that the article needs to be understandable to somone who hasn't seen the show. That's what this article is. I really don't see what part of this article warrants deletion, and every DB article links to it.--<a href="../../../k/o/j/User%7EKojiDude_79b7.html" title="User:KojiDude"><font color="blue">Koji</font></a><a href="../../../k/o/j/User_talk%7EKojiDude_b028.html" title="User talk:KojiDude"><font color="darkblue">Dude</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_KojiDude_f1ad.html" title="Special:Contributions/KojiDude"><sup><font color="lightblue">(Contributions)</font></sup></a> 12:51, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I really don't see how these are all that different from the One Piece Attacks page, they have all the same positive and negative aspects. Reading the closing admin's reasoning on that deletion debate, it seems the main reason the One Piece Attacks were deleted was a complete and total lack of cited <i>sources</i> external to the thing itself. This is a valid concern, and one I brought up in my keep "vote" there. This AFD bundles the attack list with 3 pages on individual attacks. The main attack list is a <i>little</i> better sourced than the One Piece one (but not much), but the other 3 have no sources cited at all. Any keep argument I can come up with would be essentially the same as the ones I made there; however I definately do see the vital importance of sources to Wikipedia's credibility. A lot of people would make an exception for fiction, but I'm not convinced that fiction should be an exception to the reliable sources rule. I do believe, however, that a lack of cited sources is a clean-up concern and <i>not a reason for deletion</i>. However, in instances where sources can never reasonably be expected to be found deletion may be an option. The difference between the main list here and the One Piece attacks list is that this one <i>does</i> cite 2 sources, whatever you may think of the quality of those sources. Therefore, by that reasoning it should be kept. The other three articles however, do not cite any sources (though I imagine they would be the same as the main article), and therefore should be <b>merged</b> into the main list and deleted (or sourced appropriately, including a source for the contention that they are more important then the other special abilities and deserve their own article). Hence, the weak keep. ~ <a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn">ONUnicorn</a> <small>(<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">Talk</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">Contribs</a>)</small> 14:37, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

However, you don't seem to realize that I am talking about books and other media that are the ones who have done the observation of the Dragonball series, and as such, this content is clealry derived from that, so your first objection does not apply. To your second, well, I don't think it is a prime example of that, as this is all relevant information to the Dragonball series, which is itself a notable anime.

<dd>Well, there are clearly verifiable facts in these articles. However, without a single source in any of the articles and just 2 external links to sites which may not be <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a>, nothing is actually <i>verified</i>. I'd strongly suspect that a fair chunk of this is indeed OR and so unverifiable, if there are verifiable facts here - give a source so they can be verified. I feel it is indiscriminate in that it lists every attack, no matter how minor, the Kamehameha is important to Dragonball but can you really say that of the Gekiretsu Kōdan? My view is the stuff which should be said on these attacks would be best served in the other DB articles.--<a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENilfanion_64a5.html" title="User:Nilfanion">Nilfanion</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/l/User_talk%7ENilfanion_2aa8.html" title="User talk:Nilfanion">talk</a>) 22:17, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The Gekiretsu Kodan doesn't have its own article. If you want to remove it from the collated one, I suggest you take it to that article's talk page. But since it is apparently used in some video games, presumably by name, perhaps someone with access to them, and their manuals can provide useful sources. I can't do it, as I'm not knowledgeable enough of Dragonball or Japanese to do it, I don't own any of the games, even the card game. Can others? Maybe. But an AfD like this one is unlikely to make it happen.

<li><b>Delete all.</b> First and foremost, very little of this is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verified or verifiable</a>, particularly the list. All of it is sourced to direct observation of the show itself, and Wikipedia isn't here to provide watchers' guides for longrunning anime series.<br />
<br />
Additionally, it's indiscriminate. The word "indiscriminate" gets thrown around a lot, but what it means is that Wikipedia summarizes subjects, instead of listing every single exhaustive detail. It would be perfectly reasonable to mention that attacks are frequently named in the articles on the various DB anime and manga, and it would be perfectly reasonable to name some of the most prominent attacks, even describing them as the signature attacks of certain characters. This is discriminate. Indiscriminate is a list so exhaustive that it lists <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Dragon_Ball_special_abilities_c3fe.html#Gekiretsu_K.C5.8Ddan" title="List of Dragon Ball special abilities">Gekiretsu Kōdan</a>, an attack that is never once used in either manga or anime.<br />
<br />
There are additional, aggravating factors. These articles are laden with fair-use images, illustrating every single attack however minor, even if that attack can amply be described with prose. These articles are often highly speculative, due to the lack of reliable sources. Romanizations are unattributed; I'm fairly sure that a number of these Romanizations are controversial among fans. The lot of these articles are written from an in-universe style, which is <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">inappropriate</a>. Even if these lesser issues were resolved, however, the fact remains that there's no verification and no discrimination, and that's just not the sort of thing that can be included in or allowed in this project.<br />

<li><b>Comment</b> The verifiability of the article is problematic because of the nature of the subject. Independant agencies aren't gonna write about this.

The Anime and the Manga.(the primary sources for ALL of the Dragonball Z pages) But while this, arguably, may not fullfill the letter of the verifiability policy, it IS verifiable by anyone who watches the source material. We do have the various videogames made from the series though.

<li>But there isn't an article on Gekiretsu Kōdan, it is merely a component of a larger article.

<li>Oh, I understand how they're important to the show.

<ul>
<li>Depends on the context. For DB as a whole, we could easily say, "Attacks in Dragon Ball are flashy, fantastic, and often pyrotechnic. Characters throw punches in flurries too fast for the eye to see, hurl massive balls of shining ki energy, and often shake the landscape or even split planets in the course of a battle." If we wanted to describe one character's style, we'd do that. They're not all alike, but they're all examples of a single, largely unified art style, and the vast, vast majority are different forms of ki or energy blasts, and the ones that aren't aren't attacks at all and would probably be described individually (flight, fusion, transformation) or are different ways of hitting people (which can easily be summarized). - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 22:11, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>There's a difference between a common-knowledge claim, trivially simple to source but unsourced as it isn't in dispute and excessive citation would clutter the article, and a claim made only on Wikipedia, attested to nobody. "Grass is green" is so widely verified that it isn't necessary to specifically attest it but attesting it would be trivially easy; these lists are of such narrow appeal that attesting their claims is nearly impossible.

<li>As you say, it is going overboard to insist on "independent" sources, whatever the real definition of that is. Reliable sources in the context of this article are going to be on the fan sites, where if something is said that is wrong, someone will pick up on it in a Peer Review fashion, which gives legitimacy to the site overall. Kind of like the peer review system here, except they are much more devoted to single topics on those sites (hence improving in accuracy value). <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 00:10, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Dude, will you stop saying they don't have sources? They <i><b>DO</b></i>. They have about 3 million. What the fuck is your problem man? Sources which aren't the subject themselves aren't needed. How is an Anime not notable? Are you fukcing high or something? Saying there aren't sources is just plain biased. You want an independent source, fine, look at the millions of fan sites and merchandise. There's no way in hell for you to back up your argument of it being un-sourced, unless, of course, you expect everyone to just assume you're right scicne your an administrator. Two things I've noticed about this AfD is that it was made in Bad Faith by a possible sock puppet, and nobody really has any solid arguments against the articles. I'm pretty sure that warrants closing, unless you wanna use your godly administrator powers to change the policy on closing an AfD so you won't lose the argument.--<a href="../../../k/o/j/User%7EKojiDude_79b7.html" title="User:KojiDude"><font color="blue">Koji</font></a><a href="../../../k/o/j/User_talk%7EKojiDude_b028.html" title="User talk:KojiDude"><font color="darkblue">Dude</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_KojiDude_f1ad.html" title="Special:Contributions/KojiDude"><sup><font color="lightblue">(Contributions)</font></sup></a> 01:33, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, okay, I get it, the 279 episode Anime is just my personal opinion. These articles should <i>definitly</i> be deleted, seeing as how having about 3 million sources isn't enough for any article. Let's see, how many artciles on Wikipedia have less than that? You better get started. Oh, by the way, this is directly from the admin guide for deletion: "<i>Administrators necessarily must use their best judgment, attempting to be as impartial as is possible for a fallible human, to determine when rough consensus has been reached. For example, administrators can disregard opinions and comments if they feel that there is strong evidence that they were not made in good faith. Such "bad faith" opinions include those being made by sock puppets, being made anonymously, or being made using a new userid whose only edits are to the article in question and the voting on that article.</i>" Seing as how this whole thing was started in bad faith, your job as an administrator would be to close it, not to repeatedly say that it isn't notable, when it obviousley is. Also: <b>pay attention to what I write</b>. Just because I'm used to using vulgar languege doesn't mean my opinion doesn't matter.--<a href="../../../k/o/j/User%7EKojiDude_79b7.html" title="User:KojiDude"><font color="blue">Koji</font></a><a href="../../../k/o/j/User_talk%7EKojiDude_b028.html" title="User talk:KojiDude"><font color="darkblue">Dude</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_KojiDude_f1ad.html" title="Special:Contributions/KojiDude"><sup><font color="lightblue">(Contributions)</font></sup></a> 01:45, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You've mistaken "people interested in the subject" and "structural divisions of the subject" for "reliable sources independent of the subject". You've argued that there are a lot of DB fans and that there are a lot of DB episodes. That's nice, but <i>the fact that DB is important does not necessarily mean that every single detail of DB is sufficient material for its own Wikipedia article</i>. Given the lack of sources other than direct observation, the indiscriminate nature of these articles, the fact that these attacks can reasonablybe summarized in broader articles, and the legion of style problems with these articles, I think there's ample evidence that we don't need such overspecific articles.</dd>
<dd>Now, as for being an admin, I'm here expressing my opinion as an editor, rather than closing the AFD debate (which I wouldn't do, as I've participated in the debate and additionally have a strong personal opinion). The fact that I am an administrator is only relevant insofar as it's good evidence that I'm a user in good standing, as opposed to the nominator, who is apparently a brand-new user. I never meant to imply that my arguments carried any extra weight because I'm an administrator, merely that even if this was a bad faith nom made by a new user with a grudge (the worst possible situation) that the nom had a point and such-and-such reasons were why. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 01:56, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I could assert that the color orange is the most important part of the show, and then write Orange (Dragon Ball) about every appearance of the color orange. No interpretation, of course, just a list of every single orange thing in Dragon Ball. (It'd be a lot; orange is one of Toriyama's favored contrast colors.) The hedge against me doing so is the fact that we rely on (sounding like a broken record here) <i>coverage in reliable sources independent of the subject</i>. These lists have the same problem that Orange (Dragon Ball) would, and the argument that the attacks are important would apply, just as reasonably, to the color orange, because it's a claim made by a Wikipedia user with nothing whatsoever other than that Wikipedia user's say-so to support it. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 02:13, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> The preceding comment by Hoary is oh so important. Why oh why would the article have less value to fans if it were on a Dragon Ball wiki? Probably because it's not as well-known as Wikipedia and there's an extra sense of importance that comes with your favorite topic having an article in here. But there's no denying that this article is entirely unreferenced original research and none of the articles' supporters have seriously adressed that concern. Man in Black put it pretty well: it does not make sense to cover this in an encyclopedia when no other third-party source has ever bothered to. It's useful to the show's fans? Sure, so move it all to the useful dragonball wiki and let's get on with writing an encyclopedia here. I urge the closing admin to go beyond counting the votes here. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 14:00, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep and Merge</b> (if I can, following rules, otherwise <b>Comment</b>) I'd like to make you note that an encyclopedia should retain, at least, 'common' knowledge (or things commonly assumed to be known). A lot of "Dragon Ball"-related (as well as "&lt;other anime/manga/TV series&gt;"-related) topics <i>are</i> common knowledge for the young and not-so-young generations of <i>many</i> so-colled rich/industrialized/post-industrialization countries, nevertheless are <i>important</i> parts of their folklore-mythology, much much more than, e.g., ancient greek mythology (which is however naturally retained for historical reasons). Because of it, it's expected <i>at least</i> the presence of articles (or pieces of articles) regarding those most famous topics necessary to understand common cultural references (like Son Goku, other main characters, kamehameha and so on), but, as <i>every</i> good encyclopedia is expected to do, it <i>should</i> (and IMHO <i>must</i>) go into them a little more, exactly to tell the reader more about the things that gave birth to this widespread culture-folklore-mythology (simply what an encyclopedia is supposed to do). That said, I don't propose to retain a single article for every DB ability or such, but to list them correctly (e.g. per character) in the right place (like "List of Dragon Ball special abilities" was supposed to be) and use this page as the link for the other DB-related article citing that ability. I'm not writing that that article is perfect and sould retained as is or that all the 'abilities' should be written in it (IMHO only the most notable ones, but this is another discussion), I'm only writing it shouldn't be deleted. In my opinion, the deletion of similar articles is a sort of censorship of the 'olds' (OK, the world population is becoming older and older but there are younger people too) or cultural racism (something like "every single detail of the ancient greek mythology is acceptable for an encyclopedia because it's 'highly' cultural or 'ancient', but everything relating contemporary mythology is to discard as it isn't culture at all"). To sum it up: there are too specific articles to be merged into bigger ones (like ability-specific articles not culturally widespread, but a kamehameha article to me is perfectly just), there are things to change in these big articles and probably there are things to be deleted, but these, fewer, articles should exist [we are not talking about an unknown manga/anime which sold only two copies]. --87.7.62.159 16:52, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>: Hydromasta's reason's for deleting this article are horrendous. Unlike other genres of animated series, Dragonball is more or less a parody and a homage to martial arts. Techniques and how they are used are very important througout most of the saga although by late stage Dragonball Z and Dragonball GT the importance of individual techniques where minimized. Still comparing Dragonball to comics like Batman, Superman, Spiderman, etc is not appropriate. This article list is very informative especially to those new to the series and even those who are experienced fans. Individual articles on certain techniques however should be deleted. Articles such as the Kamehameha and Kaioken should be either deleted or merged into this one. Certain transformations however like Oozaru deserve their own article. --Maphisto86 17:39, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>In case any editors haven't seen this suggestion, I will post it again here: Hmm, it seems that the One Piece attack list has been moved to a <a href="http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Attacks" class="external text" title="http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Attacks" rel="nofollow">wikia</a>, and after it is cleaned up enough a link to it will be provided on the wikipedia One Piece page. Would it please both parties if the DBZ attacks were moved to a similar place, with links to that page replacing the ones currently linking to the pages up for deletion? For example, if Goku's article said "His main attack is the <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kamehameha_%28Dragon_Ball%29_f257.html" title="Kamehameha (Dragon Ball)">Kamehameha</a>", it would instead say "His main attack is the [(insert link) Kamehameha]." Pretty much the only real changes would be that the attacks can't be found using the Wikipedia search engine, that the links would have those squares next to them, and it technically wouldn't be on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/i/g/User%7ESigmasonic_X_df4d.html" title="User:Sigmasonic X">Sigmasonic X</a> 17:51, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>A Must Keep</b> - The Kamehameha wave has become a universal icon and inspiration to the world of modern art and animation. As Eastern culture and practices become ever more influenced by methods and aesthetics of the West, the significance of the Kamehamehe wave is increasingly noticeable. I find that most arguments made against the inclusion of this definition stem from a disdain for "fans" or people who possess a zealous interest in the particulars of artistic expression (particularly television programs). Ultimately, this article is completely valid and factual in that it accurately represents a term employed in the program referenced, therefore such definitions are factually based, and factually based information, however trivial some may feel it to be, is indeed knowledge. Those who seek its removal seek, simultaneously, to limit the scope of Wikipedia's ability to inform. They seek to cut short knowledge. It is not for us to deem what is or is not "good" or "relevant" or "trivial" information. All information is of worth. And those who seek to remove any information, are guilty of crimes against knowledge... Hmmmm, I may have erred in my posting practices earlier. I am new to this, apparently one is to place comments in chronological order downward? Also, it seems that a username is to be listed. I am currently uncertain how to accomplish this but will attempt my best. Patiencee please. GCZ 01:24, 16 October, 2006 (UTC) <i>... in fact added by User:12.218.119.147</i>

<li><b>Rejoinder</b>: I don't even know what's meant by "universal icon" but doubt that this is one.

Oddly enough I found Dragon Ball Z from trying to find out what this phrase meant, being I heard the phrase before I heard of the show, its like the derka belacka craze but worldwide and with lots more people. --<a href="../../../n/u/c/User%7ENuclearUmpf_6ec8.html" title="User:NuclearUmpf">Nuclear</a><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0</a> 20:29, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is a list of published works on Islam, and self-professes "to compile a comprehensive list of introductory books on Islam written in English anywhere in the world". It does not fill any normal definiton of an encylcopedia article, it's not even properly a list by the Wikipedia definition i.e. it does not contain <i>information</i>, merely <i>data</i>. None of the books or authors on the list (bar one or two) are demonstrated to satisfy the relevant notability guidelines.

Is it expandable in a nontrivial way? George W. Bush is notable, yet George W. Bush in December, 1978 does not merit a separate article, nor does Hairstyles of George W.

<li>It doesn't cite any sources because nobody's added them yet. Give me half an hour and I will find you a half-dozen citations of the brand from business and advertising journals. Try and tone down the patronizing attitude, and remember that you are talking to a fellow administrator who has been here since 2003, not a newcomer who needs to be lectured on citation. The issue here is one of time. I voice my support and reasoning first and then find the citations when my life leaves me a little more free time. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 18:24, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There's no patronizing. But there is a double standard which should not be being employed. Moreover: If you are "voicing your support" then you are voting, just as the discussion forum members who come to AFD to voice their support for their pet discussion fora vote. AFD is not a vote. You have days to contribute to the discussion. You don't have to "vote immediately and often". Sources help the encyclopaedia far more than votes. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:31, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>By assuming that an experienced user is unfamiliar with basic processes, and explaining them as if to a novice, you continue to take a patronizing attitude, and it's not helping. Saying "Keep, because (multitude of reasons)" is not a simple "keep vote," it's a contribution to a discussion, and I have seen too many AfDs incorrectly closed as speedy to say that getting opposition in first and then providing the references is wrong. I can't do a more thorough search right now, but in 1998, Chips Ahoy! was the third-top-selling cookie line in the U.S., with $184.4 million in sales (<i>Snack Food &amp; Wholesale Bakery</i>, June 1999). <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 18:48, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Ah, understood. I also want to state that bringing the need for references to an AfD discussion is of questionable relevance, since we do not deleted articles solely on the basis of being unreferenced. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 19:27, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is where you are getting it wrong. Citing sources is <i>very much</i> a part of AFD discussions (not least because <i>it is what we are supposed to be doing here in Wikipedia</i>) because it is the way to demonstrate unequivocally that notability criteria are satisfied. "It's notable because it's famous." is a worthless rationale. Fame isn't a criterion for deletion or inclusion, and a Wikipedia editor simply asserting that something is famous doesn't <i>demonstrate</i> it. "It's notable because this source, this source, this source, and this source demonstrate that the notability criterion is satisfied." is a good rationale. Citing sources in support of arguments is the way to make arguments, and that applies here as much as it does anywhere else. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:19, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The above comments appear to be pasted across the numerous AfDs created from the DRV. While I endorse the DRV's actions, this should be an idependent evaluation. Now, unlike, say, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chips_Ahoy%21_c802.html" title="Chips Ahoy!">Chips Ahoy!</a>, for which I can find dozens of mentions of in news article litterred like candy, I cannot find the same for this. The fact that the product was so short lived means its a blip of a product that failed, and we do not need an article on every single product produced by a company. Across history there's an untold number of different products and companies that have come and gone. What's special about it? It does not appear to have the multiple reliable sources for <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>'s guideline for notability. May be more appropriate for something more closely related to <a href="../../../b/e/t/Betty_Crocker_9584.html" title="Betty Crocker">Betty Crocker</a>, but that appears to be lacking too for much in the way of products in general. There's no sources for the article really, and I can't substantiate it being a "major brand/product" because of that. Actions by a highly noted company don't make it notable either. (Children of famous people don't get articles automatically). The product should be able to stand on its own. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 08:16, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. I'm not keen on short articles like this which appear to have limited scope for expansion, and would prefer a system where notable-but-not-expandable products were described in an article on the manufacturer (along the lines of our fiction guidelines, in which minor characters are supposed to be described in an article on a series). That said, I don't see that this fails any inclusion guidelines.

<li>'<i>Abstain</i>, but leaning towards <b>delete</b>. Do we anticipate a separate article on every cookie/biscuit from every manufacturer? I doubt the claim that this is the UK's leading seller, but this could depend on definition. The article is clearly written by someone in the UK, where the word "cookie" is used to refer only to certain types of biscuit. My understanding is that in the USA and possibly elsewhere, "cookie" is synonymous with "biscuit". So here's the vonfusion - what does a US reader get from the phrase "the UK's best selling cookie" and what does a British reader get. Maryland cookies are certainly NOT the best selling biscuit. Other parts of the article are unnecessary - drug smuggling for example - but I refer back to my original point: Do we need an article on very cookie from every manufacturer? <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 17:00, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Emeraude, I don't know if you are familiar with the background to this, but the reason there are so many biscuit articles on AfD today is because they were all speedy deleted as a group by <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImprov_b282.html" title="User:Improv">user:Improv</a> a couple of days ago, they were brought to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a> as a group, and so the overturning of the speedy deletion was for all of them as well (see link in nomination statement). Per process, I had to list all of them on AfD, hence the large number of them. As for why biscuits and not any other type of product, I don't know. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 20:03, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Gee, I'm sorry, but I don't have a copy of an Australian Business Almanac (or Newspaper, or whatever) on hand, and in lieu of evidence to the contrary, I'm going to assume that a company that is large enough to have over 4000 employees is not going to outright lie on their website, that as a subsidiary of a major US company (Campbells), they are going to be truthful, and that ultimately, the contents of article can be verified. If they can't, then I request you identify what can't be, so it can be specifically dealt with. More importantly though, my real problem was that they should <b>NEVER</b> have been speedied. That was such a bad result that it brings into question the whole Speedy Deletion process. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 19:05, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's a circular argument. You know that it has 4,000 employees because you read it on the web site (as you stated above). You trust that the web site is telling the truth because the company has 4,000 employees. Citing sources for notable companies to demonstrate that they satisfy <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> isn't hard, but if you don't do it the first time that an article comes up at AFD, the article most likely <i>will</i> be challenged again, months or years from now. It also gives you a proper foundation for assertions about the size and significance of the company, because you can point to source material to back up what you claim. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:27, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm just pointing out that I don't have a directory of Australian businesses available on hand. I'm sorry, but that's not the sort of thing I have at home. Maybe some Aussie users do, I don't know. However, the fact that they do claim such a large number of employees makes them notable, and this is either something outright provable or disprovable. If you've got some source that claims they don't exist, or any kind of evidence of their being deceptive, tell me.. But to act like you are now? It creates the impression to me that you're overzealous, not that you're really concerned about the article. Narrow-mindedness is not a good thing, and it does not inspire me to work with you.

<ul>
<li>I'm happy if you cite multiple non-trivial sources about the subject from people independent of the manufacturer, and base your argument upon them. I'm ecstatic if you put them in the article, so that this article doesn't end up coming back to AFD in a year's time, as happens if sources aren't added to articles. (Remember the drinking games, where people had pile-on votes the first time the articles were nominated for deletion, but didn't actually put any sources in the articles, resulting in their coming back again to AFD months later? Citing sources stops such cycles. None of us wants articles on notable companies and products to come back to AFD repeatedly. <i>Getting the argument right the first time around</i>, so that people can in future say "Of course it's notable. Simply look at the references section of the article!", ensures that they don't. Pile-on, unsupported, "It's notable." votes just yields another AFD nomination months or years from now, when another editor, who may never have even heard of these products in xyr country, decides to challenge a whole load of unsourced articles.) <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:52, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I understand completely why you're harping on this, and I don't fault you one bit, but the difference between this and a drinking game is that no one would ever think for a second to AfD this. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 18:59, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We're here in the first place because someone not only thought that this article out to be deleted, xe actually went ahead and deleted it. There <i>will</i> be other people who think the same in the future. There <i>will</i> be editors who have never even heard of the product. Citing sources now allows us to say in the future "Just look at the cited sources, and you'll see that the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> criteria are satisfied.".
<p>Citing sources also stops people from making the Argumentum Ad Biscuit, which they <i>will do</i>, now that all of these articles have been discussed. "Why do you editors delete our wonderful web site when you keep articles on individual brands of biscuits?" they will ask. I don't speak for anyone else, but <i>I</i> want to be able to to turn to them and ask "That brand of biscuit is documented at length in scholarly papers and in history books, which <i>you can see cited</i> in the references and further reading sections of the articles. Where are the papers and books about your web site?". <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:04, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
</li>
<li>Good points, Uncle G, and I mostly agree with you about the need for references, but I will point out that the person who deleted all these pages has already said that they did not bother to check for sources (or talk pages, logs, etc.) but deleted the page because they thought it should be deleted, plain and simple, with no regard to cited sources. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 18:28, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm sorry, but I'm simply not impressed you with making a connection between a drinking game and a multi-million dollar cookie business. That tends to put you even further towards arrogant and patronizing, which as I said earlier is the impression you're giving, instead of genuinely concerned and interested in the subject. I am honestly not inclined to point out sources for you, as it feels like I'm giving into bullying. Frankly, that it even got Speedy Deleted shows a problem with the process, not with the article. As I said under Arnotts, this is another example that should '<i>Never</i> have gone there. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 19:13, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you don't "want to give in" when people ask you repeatedly to cite sources, then Wikipedia won't be a comfortable place for you. <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html#Further_reading" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Insisting upon sources</a> is what we do here. My concern and interest lies in making a better encyclopaedia, which citing sources in articles does, and in preventing the pet articles of people who "are interested in the subject" coming to AFD in the first place, which citing sources <i>also</i> does. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:04, 10 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem is how you come across, which is not as someone who is genuinely interested in a better Wikpedia, but as someone who is dogmatic and narrow-minded. Especially in circumstances like this, which are clearly highlighting an exceptional problem. I'm sorry, but your multiple repetitions of the same post to various proposals on this subject are not in your favor. Me, I at least tried to individualize my responses. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 20:36, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm not quite sure why you relisted this. It's quite obvious that the entire article should be deleted- there's never been any evidence that the merchant in RE4 is named Tom, there's no noteability for this character (he's just a merchant in a video game, out of thousands of merchants in video games), the list of quotes attributed to him is full of errors and none of the article follows the manual of style. <a href="../../../e/x/-/User%7EEx-Nintendo_Employee_f09f.html" title="User:Ex-Nintendo Employee">Ex-Nintendo Employee</a> 17:09, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The movies are good (especially the Star Wars one's sing alongs). I see no reason to delete this article as (apart from the discussion forum) it is not biased and definitely written in a good encyclopedic style. Wikipedia needs more not less on this series of entertaining films. Compared to most films on Google Video the "How not to make a.... movie" series of films has a lot of views. I wouldn't call it a vanity project as it is simply stating facts that users may find useful. The fact they are posted by one of the producers of the films makes sense as he probably knows a lot more about the subject than most casual viewers of his films.

<li><b>Delete</b> - It is not clear to me that the sources cited are either reliable - a genetic engineering .org site that recommends a cell phone brand? I don't think so - or, in the case of the book, relevant to the claims of the article. If this is real science, someone will do it right at some point. I believe it's fiction, based on what I see. Original author also blanks his Talk pages, which doesn't go far with me for credibility. - <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorporal_Tunnel_bf12.html" title="User:Corporal Tunnel">Corporal Tunnel</a> 20:27, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Doubt about a religion to be scientifically true, must not cause an article on that religion to be deleted. Obviously the concept of the article topic exists and there has been scientifical criticism on it - thus it was certainly notable enough. The article itself mentions the criticism. I prefer people to read about that here than to hear about the topic in a non-critical environment. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../o/c/t/Oct_19.html" title="Oct 19">19 Oct</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> 17:17&#160;(UTC)</span></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It cites references, and is about a theory still talked about. It needs work, for sure, and it has too much POV, but it's worth having an article on. I would say weak keep, but I think it should stand alone, rather than merge, so I'm saying normal keep. <a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAubreyEllenShomo_7ada.html" title="User:AubreyEllenShomo">AubreyEllenShomo</a> 17:21, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Good-faith submission. After someone copied text from the Hebrew wiki a month ago, I translated it from the Hebrew, and put a notability tag on it. Since then, there has been no improvement. I just don't think it's notable. In essence, he is a past president of the Israeli Astonomical Association (not known how many astronomers in Israel) and he has an asteroid named after him (not known how precious that really is).

Using Google, I can't <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> (though maybe others can) the claim that he's got an asteroid named after him. Wouldn't say he's achieved fame or notoriety even if an asteroid was named after him. Google and Lexis-Nexis suggest he's not the primary subject of multiple non-trivial publications. As for the Israeli Astronomical Association, with <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22israeli+astronomical+association%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=180&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22israeli+astronomical+association%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=180&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">178 unique ghits</a>, no results on Lexis-Nexis, and its <a href="http://www.astronomy.org.il/nuke2/modules.php?name=News" class="external text" title="http://www.astronomy.org.il/nuke2/modules.php?name=News" rel="nofollow">English website</a> being down, I'd say that the association, and especially its past president, is probably not notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> The team is already in the process of editing the page and some people went a bit to far. We are trying to update it and expand it with external references. MTA has become one of the more known modification in the gaming industry, IGN even mentioned us in one of it's first articles about GTA:SA and Gamespy had the following line in it's article about Saints Row "<a href="http://xbox360.gamespy.com/xbox-360/saints-row/718937p1.html|What" class="external text" title="http://xbox360.gamespy.com/xbox-360/saints-row/718937p1.html|What" rel="nofollow">we saw was the concept of what would be known as another GTA clone extended to its next logical point on the 360: cloning Multi Theft Auto</a>. " . If this article is up for deletion then i can also recommend <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Andreas_Multiplayer_5f9d.html" title="San Andreas Multiplayer">San Andreas Multiplayer</a> which is similar in content and handles about a similar subject.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I'm entirely biased, but I consider it notable in that I've met many people who play the game in "Real Life".

<li><b>Keep</b> The article is being changed, and currently contains at least a lot more references.</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> based solely on the references added; thanks, Blokker. Frankly, gaming mags and websites are pretty low on the reliable-sources scale; comments like the one cited above don't meet the "non-trivial" standard, so you pretty much need feature articles to justify inclusion. For comparison, in boardgaming where I'm more active than computer gaming, just because the latest expansion to <a href="../../../s/e/t/Settlers_of_Catan_5436.html" title="Settlers of Catan">Settlers of Catan</a> gets talked about on BoardGameGeek, that doesn't mean I'll put an article in WP. And no, this isn't cut-and-dried enough to justify a "speedy keep" closure. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 21:00, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's not that we just have been featured on some forums. We have a couple of articles in the written press that take more then 1 page, the major gaming sites (IGN and GameSpy) compared games like True Crime and Saints Row with MTA. Fileplanet has placed us on it's frontpage, for a mod that's rare. And G4TV did a feature about us on TV. We even received an e-mail from Rockstar itself stating that they took an interest and will keep track of our progress. When your project is well known by the biggest editors in the bussines then it's difficult to call something trivial imho. Blokker 1999 04:16, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> i'm an MTA fan and noticed this under deletion policy. My opinion will be biased, but the 'Press coverage' page features a lot i find - surely magazine articles, frequent mentions on IGN and a full feature interview on TV are highly notable. MTA "is probably the world's first publically known and most successful multiplayer modification for a PC game ever." It is also known as the first ever mod to bring multiplayer to the GTAIII series, which makes it distinct from other multiplayer mods for GTA (which also feature on wikipedia).
<ul>
<li>Also i'd like to add that being on the front of fileplanet is no easy job. A few days ago i saw the demo of Medieval Total War II being featured in the main banner where MTA featured. Today i see a battlefield 2142 demo in the same space. These are both huge commercial files, and the fact that Fileplanet were willing to sacrifice such a space for MTA is definately notable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> "In order to have a verifiable article, a topic must be notable enough that it will be described by multiple independent reliable sources." The list given above shows multiple sources in print, TV and internet pages. Whilst some sources have an interest in video games, they are independent and have no connection to MTA whatsoever. I think the magazine and G4TV sources could also be described as reliable. They have a large, paying audience and limited time / space, yet they chose to dedicate some time/space to MTA. - JonChappell 22:19, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> But with restrictions. I'm in favour of keeping this article as I do believe, being popular and one of the first GTA multiplayer modifications, MTA is a notable modification, a similar debate was held for the also notable SA-MP modification and the consensus was keep. However I would recommend that the MTA Team advise their community to not use Wikipedia for flagrant advertising (See Vicer's edits for an example), all contributors to the article should be made aware that citing community centric forums does <i>not</i> constitute as attribution of notability. It should also be made clear that Wikipedia is not the place for flame &amp; troll wars between members of the MTA and SA-MP community, both communities should take action to reduce such behaviour by it's members. To the person above who recommended that <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Andreas_Multiplayer_5f9d.html" title="San Andreas Multiplayer">San Andreas Multiplayer</a> should also be considered for deletion, as already stated a discussion has already taken place regarding the SA-MP article and that bears no relevance to the MTA article, MTA &amp; SA-MP are two wholly independent modifications and are no more related than CS is to TFC (Half-Life modifications). - Jaqel 22:47, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If you did read everything you would have noticed that that was me who posted that. And the reason is simple (even though a discussion has been held in the past). When i did research on why our article was put up for deletion i noticed that to establish notability you have to include indipendent sources, something the sa-mp article does not do even though it was put up for deletion months ago. And while we get nominated over it they only get a warning and probably only after reading what has been said here. Now that looks to me as having two standards. Further more we and SA-MP try to avoid flame wars ourselves. Anyone trying to start one in our forums or IRC sees their post removed or gets warned/kicked/banned from the channel. We have a healthy relation, hell i even warned Luke (one of the SA-MP devs) about the warning on top of their article. Blokker 1999 06:25, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>The issue under debate here is the MTA article, it has nothing to do with SA-MP. Bringing the SA-MP article into question serves no purpose and contradicts your stance of neutrality between the two communities. What happens on IRC or community forums is of no relevance to Wikipedia, the issue I was referring to in regards to relations between either community and Wikipedia was the issue of vandalism that intermittently happens to both the MTA and SA-MP articles. Also realise, the SA-MP article received a similar nomination and has had a similar discussion under AfD, it was not simply a 'warning', you are not receiving some sort of injustice. - Jaqel 19:53, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong, speedy, super punk rock keep</b> - First, thanks to trials for making this AfD, which is preferable to the speedy delete another editor inflicted upon it. I have been encouraged not to make any aspersion about the editors who tried to knock this down, so I will say this... we have an article on <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maximumrocknroll.html" title="Maximumrocknroll">Maximumrocknroll</a> and on <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_Planet_e401.html" title="Punk Planet">Punk Planet</a>, and this zine is in that category. I'm not entirely sure what verification is needed. HaC has just always been around, just like <a href="../../../e/b/u/Ebullition_Records_1b8d.html" title="Ebullition Records">Ebullition Records</a>, it's an establishment within the <a href="../../../d/i/y/DIY_03f9.html" title="DIY">DIY</a> scene. Do you need distribution numbers? Letters from all the record stores that have sold it? Personal notes from the notable bands that pay attention to it? I am open to including or finding whatever you need, but this article was targeted in bad faith because the zine itself is being used as a source in another article up for AfD. This is an attempt to discredit HaC as a credible and notable zine, and therefore jeaopardize any bands with listings on Wikipedia that are made notable in part by their inclusion in this zine. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 21:19, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Keep by equivalent is never a strong argument. Just because the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_Kennedys_1621.html" title="Dead Kennedys">Dead Kennedys</a> have an article it doesn't mean any punk band that strives to be the next Kennedys should get one.

<dd>I agree with you, MiB, that something you self-publish and mail to a few friends is not notable; however, if you did it 50 times with significant distribution, and if it had an impact on the subculture, it <i>would</i> be. On the other hand, the relationship between the subculture and the mass media is such that I wouldn't expect the <i>New York Times</i> to cover it; how often does the mainstream media write about <a href="../../../n/m/e/NME_8ba4.html" title="NME">NME</a> or <a href="../../../m/a/x/Maximum_RocknRoll_6740.html" title="Maximum RocknRoll">Maximum_RocknRoll</a>?

What is really lacking is other media commenting upon the influence of this zine. Back in the day (mid 80s for me) we knew that the zine Urgl-Orp was having an impact because <a href="http://www.factsheet5.org" class="external text" title="http://www.factsheet5.org" rel="nofollow">FactSheet5</a> said it was the best of it's genre (political punk zine). What does FF5 say about HeartattaCk? That would carry some weight. An earlier editor commented that a list of bands interviewed may demonstrate notability, I don't believe that. (For the second issue of my totally NN zine, I interviewed Dick Lucas, I'll be stunned if anyone can figure out it's name, it was "distributed" as far as Australia, the UK, etc). (will watch for further evidence) <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 05:55, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per Pete.Hurd. I'm quoting <i><a href="../../../o/u/r/Our_Band_Could_Be_Your_Life_8606.html" title="Our Band Could Be Your Life">Our Band Could Be Your Life</a></i>: "Some of [the zines] grew quite large and influential — including <i><a href="../../../f/l/i/Flipside_%28fanzine%29.html" title="Flipside (fanzine)">Flipside</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../m/a/x/Maximumrocknroll.html" title="Maximumrocknroll">Maximumrocknroll</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../f/o/r/Forced_Exposure_b355.html" title="Forced Exposure">Forced Exposure</a></i> — but there were literally hundreds of smaller zines that collectively framed the indie aesthetic." From the discussion here it's becoming clear that HeartattaCk was one of the hundreds. I'm happy to be contradicted though and recommend keep voters go <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=punk" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=punk" rel="nofollow">here</a> and search the books for mentions of HeartattaCk as a major influence on the punk scene. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 06:50, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>There seems to be a misconception here about the assertion of notability... there is no claim this zine was an influence on 70's 0r 80's punk. No, this zine was a staple of 90's and 00's hardcore and DIY punk. I think that has been proven with the sources that MrFizyx has provided. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 15:57, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>The only thing even approaching a reliable source I can see is a four-liner in Metro Santa Cruz (a free weekly), and that doesn't even establish the claim to notability, it just says HaC exists. What I said has nothing to do with era, it has something to do with our policies on outside sourcing, and the sheer lack of them in this article. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 17:21, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hey t&amp;e, you should update those articles with your quoted source since currently those don't meet <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> either. We have lots of articles on music magazines in the same situation, this isn't easy to fix. E.g. every Barnes &amp; Noble carries <i><a href="../../../g/u/i/Guitar_World_8675.html" title="Guitar World">Guitar World</a></i>, but if you want to describe its coverage and circulation the easiest thing to do is to go to the source itself (though in this case there are likely trade publications one might find, but not without serious effort). This scene is outside of my expertise. My concern has been that we were deleting this out of ignorance--perhaps some of you have enough punk cred that that I'm wrong about this though. -<a href="../../../m/r/f/User%7EMrFizyx_3bff.html" title="User:MrFizyx">MrFizyx</a> 19:17, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article needs clean-up but this publication is certainly notable, well-known, and foundationally important to the American Hardcore scene. This is one of a handful of very important zines with good distribution (including maximumrocknroll, punk planet, under the volcano, and flipside) that functioned as a clearinghouse of information for punk, hardcore, and the DIY movement before (and while) the internet became so widespread.<a href="../../../c/d/a/User%7ECDaniel_7b46.html" title="User:CDaniel">CDaniel</a> 21:03, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> HeartattaCk is reasonably notable because it sold 10,000 copies of almost 50 different issues over the years. The issues that are still available will be gone shortly. Only a handful of punk zines have ever been able to achieve this feat. Those other zines include Flipside, Maximum RocknRoll, and Punk Planet. In an interview in 2000, Aaron Elliott was quoted as saying his Cometbus publication was being printed in quantities of 8,000, so at the time, even that legendary zine wasn’t selling as many copies. My point is that you can’t repeatedly sell 10,000 copies of a punk zine over a 12 year period without being a notable publication. Furthermore, this zine was a self-sustaining project after the first few years, so it wasn’t being run by a scam artist who was purchasing a bunch of stamps and inventing print run numbers since 1994 with the sole purpose of being included on Wikipedia in 2006. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartin062_6dac.html" title="User:Martin062">Martin062</a> 09:38, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Take a look at the print run numbers source for yourself on <a href="http://www.operationphoenixrecords.com/archivespage.html" class="external text" title="http://www.operationphoenixrecords.com/archivespage.html" rel="nofollow">my site</a>. The HeartattaCk print run numbers are listed on page 2 of issue #3, page 2 of issue #5, and page 8 of issue #6 (upper right hand corner for all). The scans were taken from the original zines. The source for these zines not being available at this time is HeartattaCk’s official site, which is listed in the external links section. The source for the Cometbus print run number is Maximumrocknroll issue #200, and a copy of that interview can be seen <a href="http://www.operationphoenixrecords.com/archivespage.html" class="external text" title="http://www.operationphoenixrecords.com/archivespage.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<li>Me haven't heard of it doesn't really mean anything. I've ok-ed many articles on subjects that I haven't heard of before, because others have and have reported on it in reliable sources. That's the whole concept behind Wikipedia, and as I've posted above there are in fact punk zines that have been covered. The literature on punk is actually quite large (although most of it is on 1976-87). So the numerous evasive arguments here ("why isn't the NYT article sourced?") and the reliance on personal experience makes me doubt the arguments that this zine was notable. Otherwise folks would've come up with quotes from now notable bands claiming that HaC was the first zine to review them, etc. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 16:49, 15 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There’s nothing evasive about my argument. A rational person can easily argue that a zine selling so many issues over that length of time was notable and relevant. If it wasn’t, the zine would have ceased to exist many years ago. The lack of a mainstream news source reporting on the existence of HeartattaCk doesn’t diminish its importance or negate the facts surrounding its history. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartin062_6dac.html" title="User:Martin062">Martin062</a> 17:33, 15 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I wasn't referring to your argument specifically. You actually cited a source, even though it's a primary one. This has also nothing to do with "importance" but with Wikipedia policies, which ask for backing of claims by reliable sources and prohibit original research. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 21:14, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I enjoy the genre, but the examples within <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_pop.html" title="Power pop">power pop</a> are sufficient starting points. The only way I could see keeping this is if it were limited to songs which have been judged notable power pop by outside sources as opposed to leaving it to the discretion of Wikipedians, in which case it might be worthwhile (and I have seen articles which do that sort of thing). Anyway, in its current form, it's not worth it. GassyGuy 05:21, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, OK. At first glance I was thinking the article was about the network of the San Diego city's metropolitan area. A metropolitan area normally has more significance than the county level. I'm obviously not from the area. I don't know if places like <a href="../../../o/c/e/Oceanside%2C_California_ce91.html" title="Oceanside, California">Oceanside</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encinitas%2C_California_8a89.html" title="Encinitas, California">Encinitas</a> and <a href="../../../e/s/c/Escondido%2C_California_9b74.html" title="Escondido, California">Escondido, California</a> are part of the San Diego metro area (I'm guessing not). So I should have said to merge to <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Diego_County%2C_California_a30e.html" title="San Diego County, California">San Diego County, California</a>. My concern was that an article should not be a rehashing of a section of another article, and that the scope of public transportation was too limited compared to articles about general transportation in other parts of the U.S. But I have good faith that the article could be expanded per Vectro and Zzyzx11, and I change my vote to <b>keep</b> (and not merge). In my preference, I would rename the article Transportation of San Diego County, California to expand the scope beyond public transport and include issues such as <a href="../../../e/f/f/Effects_of_the_automobile_on_societies.html" title="Effects of the automobile on societies">car culture</a> in that part of the country (as that would be my first thought about transportation in San Diego) and my 2 other suggestions above, but that can be discussed apart from this AfD. <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETinlinkin_3891.html" title="User:Tinlinkin">Tinlinkin</a> 08:54, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>That they drive on the other side of the road in some places is worthy of an encyclopedia entry on Overtaking?

<li>No, you're right. The article would have to have more info to be good, but if it talked more about the legality of the practice in different areas, that could in fact be encyclopedic.

<li>Per the further reading section of the article, there's plenty more to write on the subject of overtaking. It has been a well-studied subject in psychology and road-safety research. There's plenty of source material yet to be plumbed. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 19:27, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Most of the further reading seems to be instructional, thus falling under WP:NOT. I agree that the psychology of raod safety would be a very good topic for an article, but it would not be entitled "Overtaking."Verklempt 20:34, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Vector's is precisely the relevant point. Article can be vastly improved but does not require deletion. But I wish to declare an interest. I am pressing for a disambiguation page for <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passing.html" title="Passing">passing</a> and, interestingly, Verklempt (the initiator of this deletion attempt), opposes this on the basis that <a href="../../../o/v/e/Overtaking.html" title="Overtaking">overtaking</a> and every usage of <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passing.html" title="Passing">passing</a> other than "passing oneself off as a member of different group" is not worthy of an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passing.html" title="Passing">Passing</a> requires a disambiguation page because of articles such as <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passing_off.html" title="Passing off">passing off</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/s/Message_passing.html" title="Message passing">message passing</a> and, of course, <a href="../../../o/v/e/Overtaking.html" title="Overtaking">overtaking</a>. <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 22:52, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes! And "<a href="../../../p/a/s/Passing.html" title="Passing">Passing</a>" will redirect there, as it should. Imagine if someone was blocking creation of the "<a href="../../../p/a/s/Pass.html" title="Pass">pass</a>" disambiguation page, insisting their favorite "pass" (e.g. "mountain pass" or "travel pass") article occupied that slot in the namespace.
