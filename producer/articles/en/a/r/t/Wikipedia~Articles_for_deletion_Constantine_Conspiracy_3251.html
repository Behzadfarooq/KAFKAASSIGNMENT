<p>This appears to be a recreation of <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authentic_Matthew_7546.html" title="Authentic Matthew">Authentic Matthew</a> by a suspiciously acting "new user". I am alleging that most of the voters in the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Constantine_Conspiracy_Archive_56d1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Constantine Conspiracy/Archive">previous afd</a> were sockpuppets of <a href="../../../m/e/b/User%7EMeBee_2caa.html" title="User:MeBee">User:MeBee</a>. User:MeBee's whose User:MeBee/Matthaei Authenticum appears to be a recreation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authentic_Matthew&amp;oldid=14377751" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authentic_Matthew&amp;oldid=14377751" rel="nofollow">another previously new user's article</a> that was redirected (without merging). Among the similar points that shout "sockpuppet" are the highly unusual use of boldface text where it wouldn't ordinarily be suspected, and the fact that most of the content is the same. Since I have grounds for suspecting that most of the previous votes were due to sockpuppets, I am re-opening the afd, and requesting a sterner test of sufference (ability to vote).</p>
<p>The article in question, Constantine Conspiracy, appears to be trying to assert the same original research, to wit that the original version of the Gospel of Matthew was the Gospel of the Hebrews and that the latter was historically called <i>Authentic Matthew</i>. This position is, as far as I can tell from reading the talk page <a href="../../../a/u/t/Talk%7EAuthentic_Matthew_6390.html" title="Talk:Authentic Matthew">Talk:Authentic Matthew</a> total original research with no academic merit whatsoever, that has been supported by an extraordinary large number of sockpuppets in the past.</p>
<p>I also suspect that the previous afd was an incident of <i>gaming the system</i>. The proposer, <a href="../../../a/n/i/User%7EAnikk_2f8d.html" title="User:Anikk">User:Anikk</a> appears to be a straw man; they have made absolutely no edits to any article other than those related to Constantine Conspiracy. In effect, I suspect that MeBee created the article, created Anikk to afd it, so that MeBee could game the system by claiming that the article was kept after afd, when in fact the only people voting, or who knew about the article, were sockpuppets of MeBee.</p>
<p>Due to the likelihood of sockpuppet votes, I would like to ask the closing admin to discount votes from any editor with less than 200 edits on 1st April 2006. <a href="../../../c/l/i/User%7EClinkophonist_b598.html" title="User:Clinkophonist">Clinkophonist</a> 22:08, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep and send to cleanup.</b> Pardon me. I've actually done research on this; an entire half of my graduating thesis from high school was on Constantine's role as leader of Sol Invictus and his motives for convoking the Council of Nicaea. That aside, the article as it exists right now can't be properly described with civil diction. It is, to say the least, terribly off-topic, and in need of a major rewrite.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>On a side note, I would like to remind Redvers that Articles for Deletion behaves dialectically and meritocratically. People voice their opinion here with a vote and an argument. Consensus here is rare. - <b><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorbinSimpson_55db.html" title="User:CorbinSimpson"><font color="#003399">Corbin</font></a> </b><i><sup><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECorbinSimpson_68d4.html" title="User talk:CorbinSimpson"><font color="#009933">Be excellent</font></a></sup></i> 03:52, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> In this article I have used no original research. Every fact can be backed by at least two sources. Nor am I trying to put forward a point of view. From my study of the sources, Constantine seems to be trying to do what is right. However, Jerome, Epiphanius and other Church Fathers state clearly that the <b>Gospel of the Hebrews</b> was written by the Apostle Matthew. Its disappearance has affected the Christian faith. Indeed the sources show that '<b>The Way'</b> was changed from a <i>Jewish Faith</i> to a <i>Christian Faith!</i></li>
