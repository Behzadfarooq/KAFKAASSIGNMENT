It seems identical to the system described in the DoYouDo patent, and eCRUSH is mentioned in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> MatchNet annual report. See <a href="../../../d/o/y/Talk%7EDoYouDo_d72a.html" title="Talk:DoYouDo">Talk:DoYouDo</a>. I am trying to figure out, though, if the "proprietary and patented" process they use refers to DoYouDo's patent.

<li>The editor is countering your comment that the company's idea "failed to go anywhere". That a very similar method is used by eCRUSH is relevant to assessing the notability of DoYouDo. Innovations that turned out to be complete dead ends would be less notable. We should have an article on an innovative company that once existed independently but has now been acquired by another (e.g., <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avalon_Hill_d3a2.html" title="Avalon Hill">Avalon Hill</a>). <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 02:00, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Sorry, but that's not even consistent with the facts presented in the article. A <i>third</i> company bought this with pretend money one based upon perhaps acquiring the already existant eCRUSH at some later date.

<li>I know it was a third company. MatchNet acquired DoYouDo, while a different company eCRUSH, is using "a very similar method", as I wrote. It goes to the notability of the general subject area.

<li>That's not evidence of advertising. My style just happens to be that I focus attention on a particular subject until the project is complete. That is how I wrote four featured articles (although I think it would be tough for this subject to reach that level). Just to clarify for the record, <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.217.105.2.html" title="User:205.217.105.2">User:205.217.105.2</a> and this IP are the same user. <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.54.208.177.html" title="User:24.54.208.177">24.54.208.177</a> 00:41, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I know this is not particularly germane to the AfD discussion, but you might consider registering a real user name. This will make it easier for people to communicate with you, and be less confusing all around. Also (whether it is justified or not), people tend to give less weight to comments left by anonymous users. --<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> 00:55, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Oh, well, creating an account works well in the long run, but in the short run, it looks like a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESockpuppet_c4eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppet">sockpuppet</a>. Moreover, I keep telling myself, "I'm done with this wiki; let me just make this one last edit" but then I end up posting more stuff, yet never starting an account. So that explains the anon edits. True, I did change my mind a couple times about the notability of my own article, but that was because I was doing research and learning more information. Some new info I gathered made it look non-notable, and then further info made it look notable again. So that (partially) explains why I changed my vote. The other thing was that I changed my mind about certain comments, and also got offended at people calling my article "spam" and "just crap," and responding to my comments with what I regarded as <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> attacks, so I decided to remove those comments. So that explains the removed comments. I guess when people see unusual behavior, they tend to assume the worst, but in this case it was just eccentricity and ambivalence. There is a little more to it, but you probably would find those other aspects of the situation incredible. <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.54.208.177.html" title="User:24.54.208.177">24.54.208.177</a> 01:37, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Ah, I'll tell you anyway, to clear the waters. My name is Nathan Larson and I have been a Wikipedian since around October <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, and written numerous articles, including <a href="../../../j/u/j/Jujyfruits.html" title="Jujyfruits">jujyfruits</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/y/Baylisascaris.html" title="Baylisascaris">baylisascaris</a>, <a href="../../../p/i/e/Piedmont_Geriatric_Hospital_e3af.html" title="Piedmont Geriatric Hospital">Piedmont Geriatric Hospital</a>, and four featured articles. For a long time, I was toying with the idea for an <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anonymous_matching.html" title="Anonymous matching">anonymous matching</a> system, and a few weeks ago, I finally decided it was time to implement it, and went about looking to patent it. In the course of my search, I stumbled across <a href="../../../d/o/y/DoYouDo_da62.html" title="DoYouDo">DoYouDo</a>'s patent, which was startlingly identical to my idea. Defeated, I gave up but decided to use the information I had gathered to write a Wikipedia article, so at least my research work would benefit the public. Then my article was put up for deletion and I naturally voted "Keep," because I found the idea intriguing. Around that time, I was gathering information (e.g. looking at the internet archive of the failed website DoYOU2.com) that made the company seem less notable; moreover, in the course of my research for the article, I exchanged emails with Gil Sudai, who offered to help me get in touch with the owners of the patent and arrange to purchase it. In an effort to reduce publicity that might bid up the price, I changed my vote to "Delete." However, I then found out that <a href="../../../e/c/r/ECRUSH_e476.html" title="ECRUSH">eCRUSH</a>, having introduced their own version of Sudai's system in February 1999, which was prior to the September 1999 registration of the patent, had been grandfathered in and therefore was able to run their competing (and dominant in the market) system without licensing the patent. That made the patent seem less attractive to me, and at the same time, I also realized that eCRUSH's success made the system DoYouDo implemented seem more notable, because it had been tried by another company successfully and thus wasn't just an idea that never caught on. So, I had a mix of selfish and unselfish motives, but the end result was the same, and that's how we got where we are. <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.54.208.177.html" title="User:24.54.208.177">24.54.208.177</a> 02:03, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>As stated earlier, the editor's removal of earlier comments have made this discussion page hard to read, and have also downplayed his earlier zeal, which really did make this seem like an SEO/advertising push. I agree with Brenneman that with all of his antics going on here (he first protested the deletion, then came back and said that the article should be deleted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FDoYouDo&amp;diff=23700324&amp;oldid=23699564" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FDoYouDo&amp;diff=23700324&amp;oldid=23699564" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, and then removed all of his comments, and is again pushing to keep or merge the article), it's beyond the regular assumption of Good Faith. --<a href="../../../d/r/o/User%7EDropDeadGorgias_33d3.html" title="User:DropDeadGorgias">DropDeadGorgias</a> <a href="../../../d/r/o/User_talk%7EDropDeadGorgias_66ce.html" title="User talk:DropDeadGorgias">(talk)</a> 01:14, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

Only a <a href="../../../d/e/v/Wikipedia%7EDevelopers_6a94.html" title="Wikipedia:Developers">developer</a> can remove that entry from the history page, and to do so would violate the <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_Free_Documentation_License_9d01.html" title="GNU Free Documentation License">GFDL</a>, which requires that the history remain intact.

<li>This company is part of the <i>history</i> of this form of matching, but, because it was acquired, it's no longer a player (at least in its own name). Therefore, the current treatment in <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anonymous_matching.html" title="Anonymous matching">Anonymous matching</a> is appropriate for that article: just a few lines about the company's role. The detailed information about the history of this particular company would be clutter in that article. It should be kept as a separate article, here, so that the information isn't lost. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 00:08, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>So what? The issue isn't assessing any particular user's conduct. The issue is what arrangement of the information will best serve the reader. For detailed background on a particular pioneering company in this field, the choices are: put it in an article about the company (linked to from the article about the field and from the article about the company that acquired the pioneer); include it in one of those other articles, where it would be clutter; or suppress the information entirely. I consider the first option to be the most useful for our readers. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 18:25, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Except that: <b>A)</b> It's hardly "pioneering" as the idea already existed and was being used. Getting a patent doesn't make you a pioneer. and <b>B)</b> It's not a "company" in any sense outside the most legalistic, and never was. Did ever have any employees? Did it ever have an office? Did anyone ever sit in a DoYouDo cubicle and sob silently at the utter mundane hell of their existance?<br />

<ul>
<li>The extent of cubicle sobbing and other such information can be included in the article. The issue for AfD isn't how much moral credit the corporation deserves as a pioneer, but whether it's notable enough that readers might want to know more about it. From that point of view, the issuance of a patent is relevant. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 08:53, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
