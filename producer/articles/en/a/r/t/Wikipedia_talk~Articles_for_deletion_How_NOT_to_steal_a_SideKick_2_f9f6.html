<p>Two things: the first being that this guy has posted an NYPD case number, I believe this might satisify your verifiblity requirement. And the second, just delete it already! It will get reposted, you'll delete, and repeat until it's gone. It's kind of sad that you guys find importance in Star Wars Light Saber Combat, but are horribly unmerciful to something that YOU deem un-important. How are 'Googly Eyes' important? Incidents like this are incredibly important to understanding the new social dynamic of our emerging technological society. These instances will be very useful in a socio or pysch grad student's thesis someday and this is where he or she could find the connections and accounts of an instance like this. These are things that don't always make into records like news media. Does that mean that this isn't important? Wikipedia should be more than just a mere collection of random, trivial, facts and fiction(Light Saber Combat?!). Wikipedia has the potential to be a driving force for acedemic research, and think this is a case where this holds true. Science and acedemia doesn't disregard something just because it doesn't appear useful at the time, why should you?

I have no idea what percentage have police reports, but presumably quite a lot.

<p>Yes, I am referring to the <a href="../../../l/i/g/Lightsabre_combat.html" title="Lightsabre combat">Lightsabre combat</a> article. Really, how relevent to the world is that article? Aren't there plenty of Star Wars fan sites that cover that topic already? Yet, it was kept? But like I said previously, and none have rebuked, instances like this have the potential to add so much more to the breadth of human knowledge. Personally, I don't care about this page imparticular, I'm just argueing a point.---Brady, 15:47, 10 June, 2006, PST. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.245.194.235 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.245.194.235_6dc5.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.245.194.235">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p><b>Comment</b>: It seems like the majority of the votes is <b>Delete</b> but that being said, in the event of a deletion, I may keep a copy of the page under my userpage just in case this incident becomes as notable as the P-p-p-powerbook article in the future.

The NYPD is too busy to help so the victim turned to the Internet. This may be shortlived, but someone thought it was momentous enough to make a permanent record of it. I agree.

<li><b>Comment</b> This is a quote about Wikipedia content "Wikipedia content is intended to be factual, notable, verifiable with external sources, and neutrally presented, with external sources cited." Keyword being 'notable'. Just because you did not take part in the event does not make it not notable. This was a very interesting case study in the power of community and how fast an Internet storm can take off.

<dd>That's the second reference to five servers crashing. I might point out that a lot of forums are low-budget operations with old Pentium 1's.

<li><b>Comment</b> I can verify that I was following this story all day as each server was brought up, accessed by millions of requests per second, and then crashed. And these are *NOT* servers made from Pentium 1 CPUs. The crashes were due to issues with PHP forums and MySQL databases and their performance under such heavy loads. Look, this is a note-worthy event due to it's rapid spread (12GB bandwidth to 132 GB bandwidth in one day for a simple, mostly text site. Thats a lot of traffic) as well as its reach. It should stay.--Thenet411 02:46, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

After hardware changes and improved software, the current forum came back online.

<dd><b>Comment</b> From the section <i>Reliability of online sources</i>: "At the other end of the reliability scale lie personal websites, weblogs (blogs), bulletin boards, and Usenet posts, which are not acceptable as sources. Rare exceptions may be when a well-known professional person or acknowledged expert in a relevant field has set up a personal website using his or her real name. Even then, we should proceed with caution, because the information has been self-published, which means it has not been subject to any independent form of fact-checking." Slashdot is a commercialised entity and its content system is frequently reviewed by its readers and editors. I don't think it falls into any of the abovementioned categories. It may not be as esteeemed as the New York Times but once upon a time, Wikipedia wasn't either.

<dd><b>Comment</b> No way on God's green earth is Wikipedia fit for academic citation. Information is constantly added by anonymous users. <b>Some</b> is reviewed and corrected by others, but much is not. As for slashdot, your first link is a paper about web sites, and mentions slashdot as one of them. Your second link is a guy using slashdot as a mode to request feedback.

<dd><b>Comment</b> In several computer science courses at the University of Toronto, Wikipedia is accepted as an academic source. This is just one instance, there are probably more examples. The first link is proof that Slashdot are referenced in academic papers and it does mention about its credibility from user editorials. The second link shows that the audience of Slashdot are professionally and adequately able to perform those editorials and contribute, the guy in question being a PhD student. If you had cared to browse the journal section of Slashdot, you might find many informative articles of a reasonably high standard. -- <a href="../../../e/v/a/User%7EEvanx_e026.html" title="User:Evanx"><sup><b><font color="brown">Evanx</font></b></sup></a><small>(<a href="../../../e/v/a/User_talk%7EEvanx_162a.html" title="User talk:Evanx">tag?</a>)</small> 04:07, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

When it was nominated I think it quite easily qualified as an event that fell below a reasonable threshold for inclusion, at least in my opinion (disclaimer: I don't consider the "Google test" or alexa rankings to be worth anything). The full page NYT article with pic at least gives it a good media referencethat is non-trivial in nature. IMO, this article should have never been created when it was because until the more recent media coverage it had very little verifiable, reliable source material to back it up... and It's still way to early to call it a meme.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:47, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To be honest, my delete vote had nothing at all to do with article quality or interest level in the story (I find the story fascinating and have been following/blogging it from the beginning), it simply had to do with the fact that, in my opinion, there simply was not <i>enough</i> <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> media coverage at the time of the AfD to support an article. Since close of AfD and additional coverage, you may have a stronger case.

Besides, I still think it is too early to tag it as a meme. Regardless, with additional sources you should be able to make a pretty good case for undeletion in deletion review.

<dd>Thanks, I have formed my defence of the article. There are several factors in favour, that of all previous concerns being met and thus the fulfilment of the Wikipedia requirements. I think you may have provided a less able New York Times article which led to an early spew of <b>Keep Deletion</b>. The one in my backup referred to a full page article. I have already included it there although it may be too late.
