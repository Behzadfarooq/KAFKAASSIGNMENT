A <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Nigerians_14a5.html" title="List of Nigerians">List of Nigerians</a> is of limited utility and is never going to be maintained properly.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. The intro clearly states that it is a list of <i>prominent</i> Nigerian people. Actually, very few lists of people have a "famous" or "notable" qualification attatched to their title. It seems to be understood that lists of this type include "notable" people only, since there are Wikipedia articles on them. We have <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_physicians.html" title="List of physicians">List of physicians</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_chefs.html" title="List of chefs">List of chefs</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_stand-up_comedians.html" title="List of stand-up comedians">List of stand-up comedians</a> and very few people seem to interpret those as attempts at listing <i>all</i> the physicians, chefs and stand-up comedians in the world - or calling it "professioncruft" or something similar. Why treat Nigerians differently? Generally, it seems to me as if most lists of people on wikipedia naturally adjust the notability bar in accordance with the size of the group the selection comes from. If this article lists Nigerians of some international fame, it can easily co-exist with a longer <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Nigerian_footballers_110e.html" title="List of Nigerian footballers">List of Nigerian footballers</a> with footballers that are notable on a national level. / <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlarm_3336.html" title="User:Alarm">Alarm</a> 17:49, 28 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>At the time of nomination there was no intro that stated that it was a list of prominent Nigerians. Now that the page has developed into something more than a single non-wikified name I'm willing to change my vote to <b>keep</b> as well. <a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHansonc_a277.html" title="User:Hansonc">Hansonc</a> 22:32, July 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> perfectly legitimate article, we already have several lists of people by nationality, should split it only if it exceeds recommended size. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatGallacher_b78b.html" title="User:PatGallacher">PatGallacher</a> 18:00, 2005 July 28 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment</b>: to clarify, if I'd had the chance to vote on list of Alaskans, list of Chicagoans, or list of Martians, I would have voted delete on them too. They're just not encyclopedia articles; they're phone book pages, without any data, and they'll never be accurate because they won't be complete. WP is NOT a trivia game or a directory. IOW, the reasoning that there are other articles like this doesn't persuade me. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidH_d410.html" title="User:DavidH">DavidH</a> 18:38, July 28, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Categories, people, this is what categories are for. Still, I think we need to treat this as a matter of policy rather than deletion, so we can implement the same policy (be it lists, categories, or both) across the board without the "it isn't being done with X so we can't do it with Y" arguments. I'll go with <b>delete</b>, and replace with Category:Nigerians, though I suspect the latter part's been done already. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 23:12, 28 July 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Wow. Four whole things to click. How will people find the time? Presumably they have some idea of what they're looking for, anyway. Or if they're just browsing Nigerians (perhaps looking for the guy who owes them $3,000,000 in money covered with black ink) they'll probably want to read the full articles anyway. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 18:12, 29 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Delete: Totally impossible list. The introduction might say it's of "notable" Nigerians, but the title says it's not.

<ul>
<li>To Geogre and Kappa, as well as Skysmith and RJFJR above: There is actually a clearly stated official policy that the list article's title should not include "notable" or something similar. <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html#Lists" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Naming conventions#Lists</a> says <i>"Put a list of Xs as list of Xs, rather than Xs, famous Xs, listing of important Xs, list of noted Xs, list of all Xs, etc."</i> <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html#Naming_conventions" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Lists (stand-alone lists)#Naming conventions</a> goes on to specifically mention lists of people by nationality (obviously not such a strange concept to those involved in writing the naming policy), saying <i>"People are either <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Finns_69d2.html" title="List of Finns">list of Finns</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_French_people_3931.html" title="List of French people">list of French people</a>, preferring <b>List of _ people</b>".</i> Any concerns about this probably ought to be discussed over at <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_b869.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions">Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions</a>, rather than here. / <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlarm_3336.html" title="User:Alarm">Alarm</a> 10:59, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b> - It is far to broad to maintain. Specific categories (not lists) should be, and are used. This is just a waste. Categories are visible to article viewers, and will be updated.

<ul>
<li>Comment: There are several pros with a list, which have been mentioned in other discussions. Most inportantly, it can contain red links to notable people who haven't got articles yet. This can actually stimulate the growth of Wikipedia and, in this specific case, possibly help counter systemic bias. Another argument is that it helps navigation. Since categories contain subcategories, a top-level list with the most notable names provides a good general overview. Clicking your way from <a href="../../../n/i/g/Category%7ENigerian_people_3b8b.html" title="Category:Nigerian people">Category:Nigerian people</a> through <a href="../../../n/i/g/Category%7ENigerian_people_by_occupation_90c5.html" title="Category:Nigerian people by occupation">Category:Nigerian people by occupation</a> and <a href="../../../n/i/g/Category%7ENigerian_sportspeople_ca1a.html" title="Category:Nigerian sportspeople">Category:Nigerian sportspeople</a> down to <a href="../../../n/i/g/Category%7ENigerian_footballers_4a9b.html" title="Category:Nigerian footballers">Category:Nigerian footballers</a> to find <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jay-Jay_Okocha_263e.html" title="Jay-Jay Okocha">Jay-Jay Okocha</a> isn't all that convenient. / <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlarm_3336.html" title="User:Alarm">Alarm</a> 10:35, 29 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comment: The "red links" become a problem when there are many poorly maintained, redundant lists, each with conflicting name spellings (especially non-English names). It's easy for a newbie/novice to create an article with the same name on such a list, without realizing it's not the same person. That's less likely to happen with a stub. These "red links" are bad way that people by-pass vfd process for non-notables. A non-notable person can get on such a list much easier than they could get an article, causing a problem later with a notable person with the same name comes along. Anyhow, I've now realized my problem is with wikipedia's list policy, and not specific to the Nigeria list. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 18:32, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

I can't believe some people are voting to delete this one. Categories do not replace lists. This one could probably do with lots of red links.
