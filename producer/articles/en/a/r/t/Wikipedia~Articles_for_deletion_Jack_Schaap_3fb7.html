<li><b>Keep this article</b> Jack Schaap is a leader in the Independant Baptist movement, and although a small movement, it is vocal nonetheless. This article comes up as #2 on google. That is notable NovumTestamentum 03:45, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> This is a marginal call. The major claim to notability seems to be as chancellor of <a href="../../../h/y/l/Hyles-Anderson_College_8c2f.html" title="Hyles-Anderson College">Hyles-Anderson College</a>. We use campus papers of major universities to establish notability. <a href="../../../h/y/l/Hyles-Anderson_College_8c2f.html" title="Hyles-Anderson College">Hyles-Anderson College</a> cannot exactly be said to be major. But nonetheless, if it's conceded that it's notable enough to warrant an article (which isn't being contested), then it seems perhaps the campus newspaper could be used to establish notability of the chancellor. A bit of a stretch, but within notability. There doesn't seem to be evidence of notability other than Hyles-Anderson related media, however. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 04:11, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - he appears to be the pastor of an extremely large congregation. Also, there's quite a bit of controversy. Gsearch for 'independent.baptist schaap' returns some interesting if not entirely reliable links. -- <a href="../../../b/p/m/User%7EBpmullins_987c.html" title="User:Bpmullins">Bpmullins</a> | <a href="../../../b/p/m/User_talk%7EBpmullins_8769.html" title="User talk:Bpmullins">Talk</a> 05:56, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Nothing I can see in the article to make him stand out beyond any other pastor/vicar/priest/whatever. User:NovumTestamentum says that Schaap "is a leader in the Independant Baptist movement"; now if that was leader <i>of</i> rather <i>in</i> we might have something more important. User:Shirahadasha's comment that he is chancellor of a college needs to be balanced against the statement in the article that this is "an unaccredited bible college". User:Bpmullins says he "appears to be the pastor of an extremely large congregation" but there is no evidence for this. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 15:04, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I've included several new links that lend notability to the Jack Schaap article, including his and his churches inclusion in a couple of Christian magazines. Last year Schaap and his church enjoyed public visibility in a national church magazine as being among the top 50 churches in the nation. If Wikipedia is going to include film and television *characters* whose sole existence is based on a tv show or movie, then why not a Pastor who is becoming nationally known in mainstream Christian magazines? He's also fairly well-known among certain segments of Baptists, and is a source of controversy among Independent Baptists, and former Independent Baptists who now occupy pulpits in other denominations. Jack Schaap, like it or not, is poised to be a big player nationally speaking. He's already made it into at least two(2) nationally read Christian magazines. As to the comment of "User:Bpmullins says he "appears to be the pastor of an extremely large congregation" but there is no evidence for this. User:Emeraude|Emeraude 15:04, 21 January 2007 (UTC)": They must not have read the two links that I've provided stating that he is the pastor of a very large congregation at the end of the article. I will supply them into the top section as well if this needs to be there also. But Jack Schaap and First Baptist Church of Hammond average well over 20,000 persons in services at their church campus every Sunday. Their auditorium seats at last 7,500; they have around 10,000+ members if memory serves me correctly. As stated before, Schaap is the pastor of one of, if not THE, largest Independent Baptist church in America. As well as a large Independent Baptist Bible College. His church also has two high schools, two elementary schools, etc. Exactly how much "notability" must an individual like this have in order to be considered notable enough for Wikipedia? Most of the characters from Buffy the Vampire Slayer are included in Wikipedia, and their only claim to fame is that of a television show that is no longer making episodes. If television characters can be included, I see no reason to trash this article. I've asserted at least three separate articles from separate magazines and newspapers outside of the college and church which assert some notability to Jack Schaap.IFBScholar 20:14, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I don't see the references to mainstream Christian magazines that are mentioned by IFBScholar above; all of the links are to the college or to mentions of the subject's books and sermons. As it is, the entire section quoting his books, etc., looks promotional to me, and I don't see anything establishing notability in the article. As always, if it's sourced well by the end of the AfD period, I'd be happy to reconsider. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Fox_1932.html" title="User talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a></small> 04:32, 22 January 2007 (UTC)
