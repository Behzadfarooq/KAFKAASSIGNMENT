Point 1 "subject of non-trivial public works" (several <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Newspaper_Group_30a5.html" title="Los Angeles Newspaper Group">Long Beach Press Telegram</a> articles). Point 2: "participates in the highest grade of the state, province or regional competitions in at least three extracurricular activities and has won at least two regional championships or one national championship in any of these activities, or holds a verifiable record in such an activity." (Won several state championships.) Point 4:"Significant awards or commendations have been bestowed upon the school."(recognized as a <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_Distinguished_School_d7bc.html" title="California Distinguished School">California Distinguished School</a>) Point 5:"The school has notable alumni or staff (e.g. would qualify for an article under WP:BIO or WP:MUSIC)."

<li><s><b>Keep</b> I agree with the above statements. If anything, all high schools should be given an article, especially high schools with data and well-sourced information. Nominations of deletions should occur, if at all, first with high school articles with poorly written prose and/or no citations before getting to ones like these.

<li><s><b>Another comment</b>: note that at the time of deletion, the article had only one citation, which did not give any notability / importance: good sources were only added after the AfD started.

<li><s>Sorry, but an award given to around 5% of all schools in the state <i>every year</i>, and awarded for 4 years, meaning some 20% of schools have the award at any one time, is hardly an indicator of excellence. The two news articles cites don't appear to be non-trivial, since they seem to be short-ish, and of primarily local interest. Notable alumni are pretty worthless too, since the school had no part in the process that got them their own articles. There's still nothing in this article which sets it apart from any other similar school. The references are all trivial mentions and purely local interest stories.
