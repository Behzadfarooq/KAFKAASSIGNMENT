<li><b>Comment</b>:This time last week, <a href="../../../s/m/i/Smithing_%28RuneScape%29_7682.html" title="Smithing (RuneScape)">smithing</a> was AfDed. I went ahead and merged it into <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_skills_dd18.html" title="RuneScape skills">RuneScape skills</a>, but someone said "that's not process; wait for the afd to end" and reverted it back. Now, two days later, before someone got around to re-reverting it, it's up for deletion <b>again</b>. What's the logic behind that? On that note, is this even allowed? Can someone really just nominate an article for deletion over and over week after week? Eventually, even if by chance, a consensus will be reached to delete. <a href="../../../h/y/e/User%7EHyenaste_70a2.html" title="User:Hyenaste">Hyenaste</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../h/y/e/User_talk%7EHyenaste_720f.html" title="User talk:Hyenaste">(tell)</a></sup> 08:55, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> per nom. Random events is just a list, whilst I can see that they should be mentioned somewhere, listing every random event and detailing what actually happens does not seem useful to someone trying to get a feel for the game. The other articles are examples of scrappy stubs which IMHO don't need individual pages and encourage fancruft padding. I'd suggest that the wiki editors repeat the success of the main RS page by concentrating on the larger pages (IE skills, combat etc.), nailing them down with relevant information, then standing back and looking at what can be split off into seperate articles. Considering that the main page apparently suffers constant revisions, yet still looks so good, repeating that with the larger pages would stop this 'divide and conquer' effect and give those who've slogged away for hours a bit of a break. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 09:59, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b>.

<li><b>Keep Cooking</b>, at the very least. That particular article reached a clear consensus of "Keep" very recently - it's bad faith to nominate again so soon just because there's a hip new crusade against "gamecruft" on wikipedia. 129.61.46.16 12:58, 26 July 2006 (UTC)Josh</li>

Give them a chance to finish, for pete's sake!

<li><b>Comment</b> - I would normally vote delete, as I believe these articles are unencyclopedic and contain mostly unverifiable information and doesn't use reliable sources. However, I would like to see some of the proposed merging take place and then see what the RuneScape article landscape looks like. I would <i>not</i> like to see a speedy keep take place, but would like to see this nomination withdrawn for now. It would be far better to have a proper AFD, rather than one filled with comments saying that they haven't had time to complete planned merges and saying keep on the ground of a recent "no consesus". <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 15:42, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> And let us finish our merging, editing, compiling, or whatever you want to call it. Enough is enough. I want to repeat my entire diatribe from the last one, but that would take up even more space.

<li><b>keep</b> - work in progress... As for the points: 1. Disgree with the "guide" argument, as most of the howto and full lists, for instance, have been slashed. 2. Relevance, no more or less relevant to non gamers, than the detail on many other topics is to non-whatevers. I'd question if there is enough WP-relevant comtent to support individual skill articles though, but maybe enough that skills needs to be split in some way to avoid being over-large .. not a guide, but more than the most minimalistic overview. Also, some editors are contributing on the other wiki, and pulling the history rug from under them would be unhelpful. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Risk_7eea.html" title="User:Ace of Risk">Ace of Risk</a> 21:53, 26 July 2006 (UTC) Inclusionist and supporter of the "recycle bin" idea</li>

<li><b>Speedy close to no consensus</b> per above, it is too soon (only two days!) since the last nomination. Is there official policy about how long before the next AfD for the same article (that ended in no consensus) can officially take place? One month? Six months? --<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevereTireDamage_33d2.html" title="User:SevereTireDamage">SevereTireDamage</a> 11:00, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
