<li><b>Keep</b>, Jeremiah Evarts is quite notable in five different ways; it was an omission that we didn't have a page on him. He:</li>
</ul>
<p>1) Was a leader in a movement to stop the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Removal_Act_2459.html" title="Indian Removal Act">Indian Removal Act</a> of <a href="../../../1/8/3/1830.html" title="1830">1830</a> and the subsequent removal of the Cherokees from the South in the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trail_of_Tears_d650.html" title="Trail of Tears">Trail of Tears</a> (ask them if he is notable) and was the author of 24 essays about it.</p>
<p>2) Was the subject of a full, published book "Jeremiah Evarts, the Cherokee Nation, and the Search for the Soul of America" (1994, John A. Andrew III). His life was notable enough that a 400 page book about his life was published 160 years after he died. (It is not a bad book either, I'm half way through it.)</p>
<p>3) Was the object of his father's concern over the lack of educational institutions in Vermont which is credited with helping start the wheels in motion in the founding of a major, current U.S. college (Middlebury College). This is a significant event in Vermont state history.</p>
<p>4) Was the father of an U.S. Secretary of State (and through William's upbringing, undoubtedly influenced U.S. foreign policy). How can you understand an important political figure like Secretary of State William M. Evarts without understanding that his father was a political figure in indigenous people's rights. The policy debate of that era resonate to this day in the U.S. foreign policy relating to issues of indigenous people's rights, given the dozens of ongoing ethnic conflicts throughout the world and the U.S.'s relationship to each of the parties in these conflicts.</p>
<p>5) Was the editor of "The Panoplist", a religious newspaper in which he published over 200 essays.</p>
<p><br />
This article has considerably more detail than the one in the Baldwin, Hoar &amp; Sherman article, so it is not redundant to that. The somewhat clunky form of another article does not have much bearing on the value of this one. If anything, having a page like this allows his entry on that page to be trimmed in size, since there is this other page.</p>
<p>I just added some more content to the article as well as some links. There are quite a few more aspects to add. In particular, a section detailing his leadership against Andrew Jackson's Indian removal policies should be added.</p>
<p>I'm fine with marking it as a stub, but don't delete it. The U.S. policies surrounding Indian removal are a significant topic in U.S. history. Jeremiah Evarts was a significant player in that struggle. It was an omission that he didn't have a page before. (Sorry, forgot to sign - I was the initial author of Jeremiah's page) <a href="../../../b/r/h/User%7EBrholden_e08b.html" title="User:Brholden">Brholden</a> around 20:00, May 3, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. An ill-advised nomination for deletion. Evarts is mentioned in the first three books I pulled off of my shelf about American Indian affairs in the 1830s, including <i>Trail of Tears</i> by John Ehle. He also has an entry in the <i>Dictionary of American Biography.</i> Please note that "not notable" and "I've never heard of him" are not synonymous.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Myers_58fc.html" title="User:Kevin Myers">Kevin Myers</a> 04:27, May 4, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I <i><b>did not</b></i> base this on "I never heard of him" and I'm sick and tired of the bleeping personal attacks on people who list articles in good faith. I nominated him because, in the first place, the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baldwin%2C_Hoar_%26_Sherman_family_fcdc.html" title="Baldwin, Hoar &amp; Sherman family">Baldwin, Hoar &amp; Sherman family</a> is an absolute mess. And in the second place, I reviewed the article and felt that none of his accomplishments warrant an article. He was with his father when idea of creating <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middlebury_College_8241.html" title="Middlebury College">Middlebury College</a> was first brought up? Woo freakin' hoo. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 08:10, May 7, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>When you nominated the article for deletion, it contained the following sentence: "He was one of the leading opponents of the removal of the Cherokees from the Southeast." Even that little bit sounds noteworthy to me. Since biographies of historic American Indians and related people are probably covered less on Wikipedia than, say, fictional <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digimon.html" title="Digimon">Digimon</a> characters, it certainly seems questionable to propose deleting "the leading opponent of the removal of the Cherokees from the Southeast." --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Myers_58fc.html" title="User:Kevin Myers">Kevin Myers</a> 02:30, May 8, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This is good feedback that my initial version of the article was badly written and that the current version still wasn't clear. I just reformatted it and added more detail to focus on the main acheivement of his life - his battle against <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_removal.html" title="Indian removal">Indian removal</a>. <a href="../../../b/r/h/User%7EBrholden_e08b.html" title="User:Brholden">Brholden</a> 19:40, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

He regularly attends folk music festivals in the US and Canada. Samaritan has highlighted his work with the New Foundation project. This leads me to the conclusion that he is notable within his genre.

<li><b>Keep</b>. All real places have great potential for expansion. Unlike fancruft, for which we only know what the fiction is willing to tell us and what we can reasonably deduce from that, any real place has an expansive history that can be unearthed through personal observation and research and hundreds of potential contributors with firsthand experience of the topic.

<li><b>Speedy keep</b>.

<p>I listed Ti (as my first entry) because I know firsthand that he will have two films in distribution within the next year and at least two others in production during that time. He has also worked with me in translating some documents containing ancient legends which we expect to see print within the next two years. Knowing that Ti will be a notable name within the near future, I was interested in watching how an article on him would develop over time from a simple outline in the Wikipedia world.</p>

<li>Notable within the canon, but I think by <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> it should still be a <s><b>merge and redirect</b></s>. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 16:01, 3 May 2005 (UTC) {'vote withdrawn 4-May regardless of whether I still think so'}
<ul>
<li>I'm not making a statement of agreement by asking this (actually, I 100% disagree) but: merge with <i>what</i>? The article in question is 25 KB in size.....only 7 KB from the recommended upper limit. Merging into any article will either require massive deleting of Mirror Universe or dominating an article's content (then by all means it should have its own article). One key point from WP:FICT is: <i><b>do not delete meaningful content</b></i>, which is precisely what you're really voting to do. <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 16:19, May 3, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The article is 25KB in size because it contains a lot of (apparently well-written) material that belongs in a Trek fan guide or concordance rather than WP. I was a Trek fan (though a little kid) when the original series was first-run, but we have different opinions about what is "meaningful content". About 2KB of that article belongs in a decently-fleshed-out wikipedia, in a section of a parent article, by the way I interpret <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>. We don't have 25KB articles about many factual topics of real-world significance and global awareness; how much <i>fictional</i> detail do we really need in WP as compared to a Star Trek Wikiproject? Unfortunately all that fiction is explicated at length here and will never get voted out, even if a wikiproject duplicates it all. So I don't waste time listing List of Tribbles seen eating quadrotriticale on ST:TOS episode "The Trouble With Tribbles" on VfD, but I cast a merge vote, which loses, when I see such a listing. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 17:34, 3 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper" class="extiw" title="m:Wiki_is_not_paper">m:Wiki is not paper</a>, space is dirt cheap so there's no reason to chop article A down because article B is smaller. Chopping A doesn't make B any larger. Additionally, WP:FICT is specifically about characters. WP has articles on individual episodes (and might I add that Jimbo thinks an episode should have its own page) and the Mirror Universe spans no fewer than 9 episodes. Comparatively speaking, Mirror Universe would be a major plot line not a minor one (otherwise all episode articles would be deleted). <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 17:50, May 3, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I support Cburnett's view. I have major issues with WP:FICT, but I certainly feel that WP:FICT doesn't really apply here in any event.<a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 01:35, 4 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, I know a bunch of fans who would insist that Star Trek isn't fiction, but I'm not that extreme. The fiction policy applies; we simply disagree which part of it is most relevant here. But I recognize the consensus is to keep this, so I won't tribble, er, quibble. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 02:01, 4 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think either 23skidoo or I are contending that ST is non-fiction, but that's not the point. Comparitively speaking, the Mirror Universe is not a minor plot theme which makes WP:FICT (even if you turn a blind eye to "character") inapplicable insofar as a "merge" vote. <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 03:58, May 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I concur with Cburnett. Clearly there was a misunderstanding of our comments on this matter.

Other trekkies soon arrived in mass and quickly stoned the defenseless Card to death with their DVD box sets of TOS, TNG, DS9, Voyager and Enterprise. Card had made the mistake of making comments in a Los Angles Times op-ed piece about the Star Trek franchise that did not deify all people ever involved in the series, including bit-part actors who barely had speaking parts. He even went so far as to suggest that perhaps Star Trek was not the best TV series of all time.

<li><b>Keep</b> Romer EXISTED, at the very least, and he was a falconer, if not necessarily a paleobotanist. I chanced upon him while working on a project for my intro Danish class at Penn, although not in any Danish books... I also happened to be looking up Falconry at the time (for personal interest and for an anthropology class, but let's not get into it...) I'll try and keep you abreast as I try to get these books back, and verify the information on Romer. I can tell you this off the bat, though-- he was NOT Dutch. At least not in his mind; his mother may have felt differently. --<a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurkoftheplains_9290.html" title="User:Turkoftheplains">Turk of the Plains</a> 05:54, 5 May 2005 (GMT)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Eesh. That random Danish link missed my eye; sort of an asinine thing to put in, don't you think? The falconry book is at least <i>plausible</i>, although I'll grant you that plausibility and accuracy are not quite the same. Being that I don't currently have access to a large body of foreign-language falconry literature, and that, alas, I can't exactly be reading about falconry in twelve languages anyway, I don't know what to tell you. In any case, making up garbage about Romer is a pretty stupid way to blow smoke up our collective orifices, although it would appear that someone has done that. Alternatively, someone has cooked up a hastily cobbled-together collection of half-truths, fairy tales, and skulduggery, then thrown in a dash of chicanery and called it a legitimate article on Romer. As I hope you can all see, I've been working to remedy this (I'll get on those references in due time), but Uppland and others can hardly be faulted for their skepticism. -- turkoftheplains 04:59, 9 May 2005 (GMT)</li>

<dd>What would "establish notability"? One of three schools sharing facilities on a single campus? A school run jointly by two different denominations of the Christian church? Or does it have to be at least &lt;x&gt; years old or have at least &lt;n&gt; alumni listed in Wikipedia to count as notable? --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">ScottDavis</a> 03:23, 8 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's one of those I-know-it-when-I-see-it things, but I'll try to explain anyway. I think notability is a function of the school having played a significant role in something historic, even if somewhat minor. Check the VfD on <a href="../../../f/r/a/Framingham_High_School_814f.html" title="Framingham High School">Framingham High School</a> -- Pres. Clinton kicked off a significant initiative there, therefore it just barely meets the bar for notability. Eton, on the other hand, is notable primarily for being the iconic British public school with numerous significant graduates and an influence on modern UK society.

<p>This is an article about a new religious movement written by an insider, this makes it original research and unverifiable. Members of the project seem to be against publicity at this early stage.

<dd>I have a question. I'm curious about how you can be sure that this was written by an "insider." I'm also unsure just what should constitute an "insider." If work by insiders is to be considered "original research," does that mean that a supporter of a political party cannot write about that party, for example? Or a mathematician about mathematics? Personally, I would far rather leave the article there, but have someone knowledgeable do some heavy NPOV work on it. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidcannon_cb6f.html" title="User:Davidcannon">David Cannon</a> 10:57, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As an adherent of Qaryanism, I can firmly say that the Qaryanic movement is not a movement at all, at least not at this point in time. There are only a few actual "Qaryans", and I place that in quotes because each adherent of Qaryanism is technically a Southern Baptist with Karaite and Aramaic inclinations. The person who wrote this aritcle and the other article about Qaryanic Aramaic does not have the support of other Qaryanic believers in his free exposure of our religious practices and beliefs. I, personally, would like to see some information about Qaryanism (not Qaryanic Aramaic) remain on Wikipedia, but not necessarily in the form of a full article. When I have some time I will try to condense the article to a short summary paragraph and place it inside another article about modern Messianic or Nazarene movements. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarShamashel_4356.html" title="User:BarShamashel">User:BarShamashel</a></p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Non-notable, directory style information. WP is not a mast directory. Well, actually it's becoming one, but I think that's a mistake. This information can be obtained from the FCC for masts in the U.S. I've seen the policy discussion, but if vast majority of the masts are to be deleted, we have to start somewhere. It's unfortunate that WP has hundreds of articles on non-notable masts, but here is an opportunity to make it a little bit better. Individual articles providing directory-style info for each insignificant mast are a profoundly poor way to present this information anyway. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 17:34, 3 May 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> <i>This information can be obtained from the FCC for masts in the U.S.</i> That's the whole point of an encyclopedia. <b>All</b> our information is available from elsewhere--if it wasn't it would be unverifiable and unencyclopedic. I do have some sympathy with people who would like to see them grouped together, but this can be done by having a separate list article as at present. So keeping separate articles and lists is quite easily achievable and, in fact, what we have now. No change is required. You don't have to read the articles if they don't interest you. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 20:07, 3 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, Tony, with all respect, I disagree completely. Encyclopedias are not directories, and the information collected on masts is not encyclopedic. Some mast information also requires constant update, something that the FCC does but that we are not equipped to do. Compare with directory information on restaurants in a city. It's constantly changing, so any entry gives only a point in time when the article was created. It's quite possible that the restaurant will be out of business when you read the article, and its very likely that WP wouldn't have correctly updated the article. (This isn't an argument against WP articles on notable restaurants, just that WP should not have articles on <i>all</i> restaurants.) Directories require <i>regular</i> maintenance, with entries updated every year or more often. WP is not set up to provide that. Nor are traditional encyclopedias, which is a large reason why directory information is considered not encyclopedic. Everything in the yellow pages is verifiable, but it isn't encyclopedic. THe mast articles are yellow pages for masts. There's a reason why encyclopedias, almanacs, and directories are separate works. WP is an encyclopedia, or at least it's trying to be. There are better places for directories. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 23:00, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>No vote</b> since these latest contributions are under scrutiny, but as someone who works in the broadcast industry, towers and tower sites are just a part of doing business. Unless we're talking about a landmark tower like Mount Sutro in San Francisco or a well-known site like Mount Wilson in LA, we're not talking about anything even remotely resembling encyclopedic IMO. AM arrays are big, tall steel trusses and FM arrays look like they're made up of rototiller blades. One FM I worked at had a solid state transmitter installed in an old portable shed and the rototillers were mounted on a wooden pole. If anyone wants info on US broadcast towers, let 'em go to the FCC. - Lucky 6.9 21:15, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Comment: It dawned on me that this is really good info for articles on individual stations. I still think that these don't make for particularly useful or even necessary articles. I don't think I'd look up the tower coordinates before looking up WKMX. - Lucky 6.9 03:35, 5 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is an article on a conlang based on Aramaic that only a handful of people know. As it's a recent invention it cannot be verified and is original research. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 11:00, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>At this point in time, the Qaryanic dialect of Aramaic is incomplete and is still in an experimental state. Its usage is limited to a small, privately funded circle of Syriac researchers at the University of Louisiana. There presently exists no published evidence of the language, and as far as the public is concerned, Qaryanic is invalid and nonexistant.

<li><b>Delete</b> I posted this information without having full knowledge of the language. Because of this, some of the information in the article is inaccurate. Also, this dialect is not called "Qaryanic". I made that name up because I didn't know what to call it. The people using this dialect are not even Qaryans. They are just Hebraic-minded Baptists. "Qaryan" is a term I made up to describe my own beliefs. So...this information should just be deleted. This all turned out to be a big mess. Sorry.</li>

Unfortunately, since I am a lowly Technician and not a General or Extra I don't know enough about the amateur bands to rewrite what was originally there in a coherent fashion, so that could use some love too. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 03:03, 8 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A gaming community centered around submissions of games generated by a freely available adventure game creator. The official web site for this game has an article that says 'Richy has created a RON entry at Wikipedia, which can be found at'... indicating one of their own has created the page. The forums at the official site has just 194 registered users at the time of this VfD submission. It gets worse.

Articles on the game's characters are likely to appear on Votes for Deletion - there is a debate as to whether individual pokÃ©mon are important enough to have their own articles and many more people have heard of the pokÃ©mon characters than the characters in your games. If you do make a new wiki at wikicities, there could always be a link to it on the main Ron article if people wanted more detail. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveW_ed49.html" title="User:SteveW">SteveW</a> | <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteveW_7844.html" title="User talk:SteveW">Talk</a> 17:56, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> -- I can see where you're getting at. I think it would be important to <b>keep</b> the main article itself, but RON is a pretty detailed project, and the current layout will mean at least 80+ different pages. Popularity doesn't really come into the equation with claims of vanity, but even the most popular thing in the world will be hard justified to cover 80 or so seperate articles...
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b>: How about this for a slice of fried gold - a Timeline of notable events and stories, with some of the more important characters thrown in for interest? That way we can stream it down to about three or four new pages (maybe not even that) and make it look presentable and informative. Would you agree to <b>keep</b> it then? Richy, whaddaya say? Dark Comet 20:52, 3 May 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment:</b> I think what's being inferred is that your game(s) may be notable, but expanding any information about characters is going a little overboard. Focus on reworking the main article, and consider deleting all the character / game cruft in the remainder of the articles. Vanity usually refers to people making pages about themselves in a vain effort to gain exposure. Whilst this may not be the case here, you're certainly contributing to the artcile to improve it which some may see as vanity. Adding character information about your game won't ensure its' articles' survival here. Proving your game is notable to those outside your own user base is what we require. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> | <a href="../../../l/o/n/User_talk%7ELonghair_0f2b.html" title="User talk:Longhair">Talk</a> 20:54, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> the main page, <b>Merge</b> or <b>Delete</b> (as relevance demands) the individual characters and user-created games. If a single game is relevant enough that an encyclopedic treatment of it alone becomes necessary, it could break out, but I would probably err on the side of brief summaries of some of the most popular games in the main entry for RON. <a href="../../../e/s/k/User%7EESkog_db4a.html" title="User:ESkog">ESkog</a> 04:21, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

<p>POV-hell. The article name is not what the first line reads atm: <i>A list of famous individuals and organizations alleged by some to have acted hypocritically at one time or another.</i> Who is a hypocrite is POV.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> â Notable. Spc. Lozano was found by the US Army report to be the only person who fired on Calipari's vehicle, ergo, the individual who fired the fatal bullet. As of today, his name has been widely mentioned in the press, both foreign and domestic, including in America's newspaper of record. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/03/international/europe/03italy.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/03/international/europe/03italy.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> Clearly, listing a name widely known poses no security risk. Also, he is the subject of a possible indictment by the Investigating Magistrates of Rome in their ongoing criminal investigation into the shooting. Furthermore, more pertinent information about Spc. Lozano is likely to come to light in the subsequent judicial inquiry, more than could be included in the page on Nicola Calipari.69.67.230.91 18:54, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Nicola Calipari doesn't deserve his own article? His death provoked a major international incident, and he's a national hero in Italy (and, per the U.S. Ambassador to Italy, "our hero too.")

If he doesn't meet your standards for notoriety, I think your call as to Lozano's non-notoriety is clearly suspect. 128.122.128.41 15:47, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Incident is internationally very notable; this soldier's name and alleged role have been featured prominently in international media, with a lot of short-term notability. Not as much long-term notability, probably, as the examples (who killed in circumstances unlike this one) cited by the anon ... but time will tell. With the major national inquiries still in progress, and many national leaders and major media (except in the USA) up in arms about it, this individual is a topic which may switch from temporarily-notable to trivial or to long-term encyclopedic in coming weeks. If Spc. Lozano's role fades and the meme becomes "US miscommunication leads to shooting of Giuliana Sgrena and escorting agents" rather than "a National Guard soldier killed them", this should perhaps be turned into a redirect to either <a href="../../../g/i/u/Giuliana_Sgrena_4f9b.html" title="Giuliana Sgrena">Giuliana Sgrena</a> (my preferred choice) or <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicola_Calipari_9518.html" title="Nicola Calipari">Nicola Calipari</a>. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 02:49, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Google News does not index foreign language papers. Check out La Stampa, Corriere della Sera, La Repubblica, etc. Corriere in particular mentions his name as an important element of the story, and indicate that the story may develop further - the Italian legal system is currently considering a judicial inquiry or a criminal indictment, in which case he would be called as a witness, and his (non)participation would add greatly to the noteworthiness. There are reports out of Italy that he is likely to receive a subpoena. <a href="http://washingtontimes.com/upi-breaking/20050502-043645-8294r.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://washingtontimes.com/upi-breaking/20050502-043645-8294r.htm" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> 128.122.128.41 14:39, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Not true, as I said, three of the four references were foreign press, one being British, one being Australian, and one Italian, "Agenzia Giornalistica Italia". RickK. <a href="../../../6/6/2E/User%7E66.60.159.190.html" title="User:66.60.159.190">66.60.159.190</a> 20:19, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Did you notice, RickK, those stories were all in English? If they're in a foreign language, i.e. Ialian, they're not in google news. So here's a link to another Italian story in Corriere della Sera, which of course, was not indexed. <a href="http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Cronache/2005/05_Maggio/01/usa.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Cronache/2005/05_Maggio/01/usa.shtml" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. If you want a count of foreign media mentions, you'll have to use Lexis. BTW, a Lexis search also reveals many U.S. media stories that aren't present in Google News - as of 5/04/05, Lozano is named in the L.A. Times, the New York Times, the New York Daily News, Newsday, and the Chicago Tribune.</li>

<dd>Actually, "bob's blog news" does not exist at all on Google <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22bob%27s+blog+news%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22bob%27s+blog+news%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. You may want to try "" next time you google, otherwise every article with the word "news", "blog" and "bob's" comes up, hence the high number of results.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilversmith_d59b.html" title="User:Silversmith">Silversmith</a> 08:57, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>No, a smaller entry wouldn't help, because the issue in this VfD is whether the subject of the website should have an article, not how it is written. I concur with Silversmith's analysis of the google hits, and restate that the site's extremely low Alexis ranking is rather fatal to any claim that the website is notable. Or do we have other articles on websites that have Alexis ratings of close to 5,000,000? <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 20:29, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Save Bobonit News:</b> First and foremost there were no copy right violations!. Counting on the Google algorithm to decide if a site is notable seems foolish to me, but since everyone seems fascinated by them and I was quite impressed myself in the results and was amazed at what I thought was extremely positive results in SEO.</li>
<li>The keyword results from Google for <i>bobs blog news</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Bobs_blog_news_1.jpg" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Bobs_blog_news_1.jpg" rel="nofollow">(screen shot)</a> (1, 2 on page one), is NOTABLE by itself since the goal with Google is to get your keywords to return your URL in the top results of at least the first few pages, to actually have the first and second result on the first page out of 165,000 hits with such common words is incredible compare that to the Drudge report (1, 2 on page one), FOX News (1,2 on page one) and those are with only two words much easier than three common words.</li>
<li><i>âBobâs blog newsâ</i> in quotes is not the point since that is not the actual or full name for the article entry just related <b>keywords</b>. <i>Bobonit or Bobonit News</i> both return 1, 2 on first page with quotes or no quotes!</li>
<li>I have checked ALEXA and it shows the old website and the entry is at least 2 years old and I have never optimized for great ALEXA results but the result they show puts <a href="http://Bobonit.com" class="external free" title="http://Bobonit.com" rel="nofollow">http://Bobonit.com</a> in the top 10% of World Wide Web I believe I guess it is a matter of perspective. I assume <b>ALEXIS</b> is a misspelling? --<a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERocdad_ac24.html" title="User:Rocdad">Rocdad</a> 10:00, 6 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

Being on the first page of results for a Google search this specific is completely meaningless. If your site came up first on a search for, say, <i>"news blog"</i>, then we might have something. The Google Test is meant to judge an article subject's notability based on the raw number of hits for a specific phrase. I have no clue where you get the idea that the Alexa ranking means that your site is "in the top 10% of World Wide Web."

<li>Comment: Yes, this forum is implicated, as others have commented, and they seem well aware that we could waste a lot of time trying to sort out who is who. But there's no need to. The fairest thing we can do to the real people who are quite possibly innocent victims of this (although I am of the opinion that it does nothing but good to their chosen careers as DJs and that they would know this) is to delete as much of the mess as is unverifiable and/or unencyclopedic. I'd be fascinated to know whether Wikipedia is mentioned on the programs they host, and what they say about us, and I guess they'd love to have our interest, but again it's not something we need to know. No change of vote. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 20:07, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Okay. I wasn't aware that 178 players isn't enough, but I (as author of the game, and the page&#160;;) ) am willing to accept it.

<dd>Pardon me for asking (and my format), but what is the grounds for the VFD besides not being big enough for wikipedia? Are we saying that it isn't notable enough, as if that is so then I'd suggest that 200 people is enough to qualify as possibly notable. The game has excellent growth potential, moving from less then 64 when I joined less then two weeks ago to near 200, only limited because of how Patricracy forms itself into nations of 8 parties each, generally limited by the number of new nations added by Mr. Lievens. In all honesty, since when is notability a criteria for VFD? There are more obscure topics around, including the mess of demographic ones that serve little purpose. I do not see how an open encyclopedia, which seems to lend itself to being a repository for all sorts of obscure information, can consider deleting articles for a lack of notablility. Sorry if this is formatted wrong/done badly, I'm new at this, and thanks for listening.69.136.240.8 01:34, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> -- The page doesn't say Exigo is closed source anywhere. The page is not out to give Exigo a bad name: It's out to tell people about BTE. Since one of BTE's goals is to be "Better Than Exigo," it's hard to write an article about BTE that doesn't mention Exigo... Also, the BTE devs put up a website at <a href="http://nandu.berlios.de" class="external free" title="http://nandu.berlios.de" rel="nofollow">http://nandu.berlios.de</a> so there is a source for the article now.

<li>I agree with you Rick, that the party was a small and short-lived venture in a small political jurisdiction. But why isn't there room for an article about them? What will be lost if the article remains? We know what will be lost if the article is deleted -- a little bit of information that is difficult to find elsewhere. One hopes that in time someone who remembers the PEIDBP will add more information. It probably won't happen, though, if there's no article. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> 22:47, 3 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>A noncopyvio deleted article would stay on the Wikimedia Foundation's hard drives <i>anyway</i>, just without public access. And about the only bandwidth this would use up would be people looking up the party, and eventually some of them would know more ("It arose after a controversial change to the province's Liquor License Act led to the closure of the province's last local beer plant..." or not.

<li>IMO, albums on major labels are all notable.

</ul>
</li>
<li>Since when does a major label define what is notable. There are smaller recording companies that make quality albums. Whether or not we personally find it notable, there is and always be a genre of people who want to know what it is, and need a reference point from the articles that point to it.
