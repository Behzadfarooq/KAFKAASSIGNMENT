<p>Article appears to be self-published by user, IMAC001, whose name is a derivative of Immaculate Records. It's companion article, Curtis Newart should also be considered for deletion. Please see the discussion on the Immaculate Records discussion page. <a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERonbo76_441b.html" title="User:Ronbo76">Ronbo76</a> 02:39, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment to Administrator</b> Please note that Ronbo76's page lists entries that he has had successfully deleted. Furthermore, his "To Do List" states: "Create a kill list of articles that I have successfully nominated." I strongly question the merit of this deletion nomination, especially since a body of work such as mine stands on its own merits. Furthermore, I believe deletion of my self-published entries 'Curtis Newart' and 'Immaculate Records' would be a decided disservice to your readership. However, to avoid conflict of interest, all copyrighted materials owned by Immaculate Records and/or Curtis Newart will be removed.IMAC001 01:22, 6 January 2007 (UTC)(Curtis Newart, Immaculate Records Owner)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> To avoid conflict of interest. All copyrighted materials owned by Immaculate Records will be removed.IMAC001 01:22, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>This discussion was just had on the user's talk page. My userpage is a sandbox where user can compile a to-list. The only articles are those AfD that have been successfully deleted. Immaculate Records is not on that list and this user knows it because he has been to my page.</li>

<li><b>Comment to User:IMAC001</b> I have no expertise in this field whatsoever (check out my user page), thats the kind of the point of Wikipedia. I would recommend that you get to know Wikipedia by editing articles that interest you and maybe creating a couple on topics that you are not directly related to but knowledgeable about before jumping in and creating on article on yourself and your company. While this is not necessary it would allow you to gain experience in what is and is not acceptable conduct on this site. Right now you are experiencing the kind of divisiveness that is the worst part about Wikipedia, but if he were to look beyond these debates you would find that it is truly a great source of information and enjoyment. You will also find that using it as a promotional tool is very difficult. Good luck and have fun <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J. Leivick">Daniel J.

<li><b>Comment</b>, to Curtis. <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> states the criteria for your inclusion. We'll need verifiable sources that you meet one or more of them - links to the specific pages on the RADIOGAY and CIBL sites that you refer to might be a good start, although I'm not sure that being in the top 40 in <i>Montreal</i> (as opposed to Canada) is really enough. The article can stay if you can prove your notability, but I hope you understand that we can't just take your assertions on trust. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 03:18, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Has it not yet occurred to you that notability in these discussions is mainly determined based on the consensus of the <i>"opinions"</i> of the editors posting here?

No one needs to prove there expertise here, that is the point, if everyone had to be experts then it would be just like any other encyclopedia. Please rather then arguing about notability and user's expertise in determining it please look at some of the other policies which you are violating most importantly <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAuto_aa00.html" title="WP:Auto">WP:Auto</a>. Once again I will strongly recommend you get to know Wikipedia and not be insulted by this process, as I have said before this kind of discussion is one of the least pleasant on Wikipedia.

<p><i>A <b>conflict of interest</b> is an incompatibility between the purpose of Wikipedia to produce a neutral encyclopedia and the concerns or aims of editors who are involved with the subject of an article. This includes promotion of companies you work for and their products, and criticism of competitors.</i></p>
<p>In keeping with Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutral_point_of_view.html" title="Neutral point of view">neutral point of view</a> policy, edits where there is a clear conflict of interest, or where such a conflict can or might be justifiably assumed based on the proximity of the editor to the subject, are strongly discouraged. Of special concern are organisational conflicts of interest.[1] Failure to follow these guidelines may put the editor at serious risk of embarrassing himself or his client.</p>
