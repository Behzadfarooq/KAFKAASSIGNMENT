<p>The subject of this list is unworkable, simply because it's too vast and is going to get bigger and bigger, but unfortunately with less and less notable artists and more and more contemporary ones, swamping the significant figures that one would wish to stand out. Smaller lists would work much better, i.e. List of 18th century American Artists, etc, List of American Artists born 1900-1950, then List of American Artists born 1950-75 and then 1976-. At least all the contemporary ones and the self-noms would be in one place to see easily if they merited a place. This would also create a historical context for the artists. There are also other artists lists that will need assessing, but let's take one at a time.<a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 00:26, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Maybe putting this list into a category would be better, don't you think? <a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDiez2_aaaf.html" title="User:Diez2">Diez2</a> 00:46, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep, but reorganize</b> Can't you just divide it by periods instead of alphabetically, put a notice on saying redlinks (and external spam links) will be deleted, &amp; maybe have a "major contemporary artists" section that is policed, and then another "other contemporary artists" one at the end that you accept will have to be a bit rag tag &amp; bobtail? You also have architects &amp; doubtless other types in there; the criteria for inclusion need to be defined. Obviously the concept of the list is fine; its just the practicality. Having separate lists by century is not attractive; there are all sorts of overlap problems. It's not in that bad a state. I have problems like this at <a href="../../../p/r/i/Printmaking.html" title="Printmaking">Printmaking</a> &amp; its daughter articles; better a messy list than no list. There already is a category of course, and people are always being encouraged to put categories into lists, not the other way around <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnbod_859e.html" title="User:Johnbod">Johnbod</a> 00:50, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm up for any meaningful and usable organisation, but this is no good to anyone, apart from unknown artists sneaking their name in. I've suggested retaining smaller lists. Using dates at least gives a rigid definition so that everyone knows where they are. Dates will also do a rough and ready job of sorting out major from ragtag contemporary artists, as major <i>tend</i> to be older. Good red links provide a valuable function to show articles that need to be written, so this purpose is also defeated by the present arrangement (though the new blue links are a good way of tracking down non notable contemporary artists..&#160;;) <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 01:00, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>If you have lists (or categories) by century, you have to put loads of people in two of them. The list isn't that long &amp; the older periods would be quite short; as you say the problem is the contemporaries. I think you have have to keep redlinks out; there are other places (Visual arts project/ articles needed) for articles that should be done. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnbod_859e.html" title="User:Johnbod">Johnbod</a> 01:32, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>It is nevertheless established that wiki does have lists (lots of them). What we need are lists that are useful and usable. This requires the right definition to start with. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 01:16, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Here's what I say to do: Redirect this to Lists of American artists which would cover the kind of segmentation suggested in the nomination.

<li>Do you mean a central list from which the specialised ones could be accessed? That would work. The real problem here is the amount of contemporary artists who swamp the rest. At the very least there should be a list of historic (i.e. dead) and contemporary (i.e. living) artists. The latter would be even better subdivided. If there was a list of people born after, say 1975, it would catch a lot of the not-terribly-notables (but just notable enough to survive an AfD) and make the other lists far easier to read. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 01:24, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I'm no expert, but isn't the generation of this type of list precisely what categories are for? So if anything, I'd suggest a set of narrower categories that include time period and nationality (i.e., 19th century American artists or whatnot). <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlanetneutral_0d3a.html" title="User:Planetneutral">Planetneutral</a> 01:21, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm no expert on categories (or lists - I tend to avoid them -mainly because there's too many like this one!), but an earlier comment said the encouragement was for lists rather than cats.<a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 01:26, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes - look at any Categories for deletion day page (<a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECfD_3468.html" title="WP:CfD">WP:CfD</a>) - "Listify" is the regular cry. I think this is quite right by the way; lists sit quietly by themselves; categories have to be in every article, are much harder to rearrange etc. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnbod_859e.html" title="User:Johnbod">Johnbod</a> 01:38, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sounds as if what we really need is the equivalent of an index, which is essentially what lists are, but conceiving of them in that way might make it easier to decide what lists to have. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 02:00, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> As it stands, this list is of very little use. It is just a list of (potentially many thousands of) names, providing no context for each name—which is precisely what a category is. To be useful, the names in such a list would need to be categorized by genre of art. Moreover, the definition of <i>artist</i> is so broad that the number of people who could be listed is vast—too vast for one page. This list should be a category, and not surprisingly there already is such a category: <a href="../../../a/m/e/Category%7EAmerican_artists_c75d.html" title="Category:American artists">Category:American artists</a>. ●<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanMS_20a7.html" title="User:DanMS">DanMS</a> 02:09, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> Wikipedia is not a directory or a list of lists. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilippebeaudette_89c4.html" title="User:Philippebeaudette">Philippe Beaudette</a> 05:39, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> an indiscriminate collection of information, listcruft. There are many American artists. It's simply impossible to compile it into a list, a category will be much easier. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerence_Ong_4371.html" title="User:Terence Ong">Terence Ong</a> 10:47, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep using criterion</b>. I raised this issue on the article's talk page. Specifically: "What's the criteria for listing here? Should the artist have been born in this country? Is reputation a factor? Are we wasting our time on a list that cannot be complete?" I might suggest the following. Allow this list by do not allow names for which there is no biographical information. In this way, the user can read a bio to determine information about the artist which, hopefully, puts him/her in context. This also prevents a random list of names with no context whatsoever. For example, I added the name George McConnell, but did not add a biography. This would force me to create his bio first, and then add his name to the list. Let me also point out that there are many references to biographies of American artists that are alphabetical with no further categorization. For example, the three volume reference Who Was Who in American Art (Falk, ed.).<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnJHenderson_96ee.html" title="User:JohnJHenderson">JJ</a> 14:24, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Change to Category or Delete</b> - I believe that something as broad as his would be best suited as a category or nothing at all. Then the criteria for inclusion are a bit more simplified in terms of notability. <small><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Thadman_6354.html" title="User talk:The Thadman">אמר</a></small> <tt><b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Thadman_c314.html" title="User:The Thadman"><font color="#0033CC">Steve Caruso</font></a></b></tt> <sub><b><font color="#000000">(<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Thadman_Desk_b02b.html" title="User:The Thadman/Desk">desk</a>/<a href="../../../a/m/a/WP%7EAMA_ced1.html" title="WP:AMA">AMA</a>)</font></b></sub> • <b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Thadman_Give_Back_Our_Membership_2940.html" title="User:The Thadman/Give Back Our Membership"><font color="#CC0000">Give Back Our Membership!</font></a></b> 15:12, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>/change to category. CfD "listify" cries are usually based, from what I can tell, on over-categorization. Something as broad as American Artists is, IMO, perfect for a category. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoffspear_16b0.html" title="User:Geoffspear">Geoffspear</a> (<a href="../../../g/e/o/User_talk%7EGeoffspear_af08.html" title="User talk:Geoffspear">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Geoffspear_4fb8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Geoffspear">contribs</a>) 21:05, 2 February 2007 (UTC).</small></li>
