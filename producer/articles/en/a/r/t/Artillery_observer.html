	    <p>An <b>artillery observer</b> is a soldier responsible for directing <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artillery.html" title="Artillery">artillery</a> fire and <a href="../../../c/l/o/Close_Air_Support_c335.html" title="Close Air Support">Close Air Support</a> (ground attack by aircraft) onto enemy positions. Because artillery is an <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indirect-fire.html" title="Indirect-fire">indirect-fire</a> weapon system, the guns are rarely in line-of-sight of their target, often tens of miles away. The observer serves as the eyes of the artillery battery, calling target locations and adjustments to the FDC (Fire Direction Control), which translates the observer's orders into firing solutions for the battery's cannons. Artillery observers are often deployed with maneuver combat arms units, typically <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infantry.html" title="Infantry">infantry</a> companies or armored squadrons.</p>
<p>Considering the need for the observer to be in visual range of a target, often deep within enemy territory, and given the general awareness of the firepower at his command, the soldier in question is considered a high priority target by both enemy <a href="../../../s/n/i/Sniper.html" title="Sniper">snipers</a> and regular personnel. Thus, the artillery observer must be skilled not only in fire direction, but also in stealth and, if necessary, direct combat.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Army_7e21.html" title="British Army">British</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Army_2abb.html" title="Canadian Army">Canadian armies</a>, an artillery observer is known as a <i>Forward Observation Officer</i> (FOO, pronounced <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/fuː/</span>), or <i>Fire Effects Detachment</i> (FED).</p>
<p>In the U.S. Army, an artillery observer is known as a <i>Forward Observer</i> (FO). A <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mechanized.html" title="Mechanized">mechanized</a> FO team usually comprises an officer, a technician, a driver/radio operator, plus any extra personnel required. A non-mechanized FO team, analogous to light infantry, and generally includes a gunner, trained to operate the <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squad_Automatic_Weapon_e45c.html" title="Squad Automatic Weapon">Squad Automatic Weapon</a>, for suppressive fire support.</p>
<p>In the Royal Australian Artillery an artillery observer team is called a <i>Joint Offensive Support Team</i> (JOST) and is made up of the <i>Forward Observer Officer</i> (usually a Captain), his assistant (usually a <a href="../../../b/o/m/Bombardier.html" title="Bombardier">Bombardier</a>—2 stripes) and two Artillery Signalers (<a href="../../../g/u/n/Gunner.html" title="Gunner">Gunners</a>—no stripes). They are trained in calling in field artillery fire missions as well as <a href="../../../n/a/v/Naval_gunfire.html" title="Naval gunfire">naval gunfire</a> and close air support (CAS) missions from the Air Force.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Artillery_observer.html" title="Edit section: Forward Observers in the US Marine Corps/US Army">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Forward Observers in the US Marine Corps/US Army</span></h2>
<p>Artillery observers carry the (<a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_occupational_specialty.html" title="Military occupational specialty">MOS</a>) designation of <i>13 Foxtrot</i> (13F) in the U.S. Army and <i>0861</i> in the U.S. Marine Corps. Commonly referred to as FO's (Forward Observers), FISTs (FIre Support Team), or COLTs (Combat Observation Lasing Team), their more general official designation is <a href="http://www.usarmy.com/mos/army-13f.html" class="external text" title="http://www.usarmy.com/mos/army-13f.html" rel="nofollow">“Fire Support Specialist”</a>; other designations referring to specific positions held depending on the mission.</p>
<p>For a variety of reasons, the position of Fire Support Specialist is often thought of as among the most dangerous and challenging in the armed forces. Due to the substantial firepower they control, their communications and reconnaissance abilities, and their small numbers, artillery observers of any variety are regarded as targets of very high importance to enemy forces. Their skills in reconnaissance must be met with similarly high intelligence and ability to think quickly in situations of extreme stress, as a minor mental error during a fire mission could lead to the forward observer ordering an artillery assault upon friendly forces or himself.</p>
<p>Soldiers in this MOS must meet a number of requirements not demanded of many other military careers. The artillery observer must be acutely aware of the position and movements of their own troops as well as those of the opposing forces. Because of the strategic importance of this information, U.S. Army FO's must qualify for <a href="../../../s/e/c/Security_clearance.html" title="Security clearance">security clearance</a>, the [<a href="http://www.usarmy.com/mos/army-13f.html" class="external text" title="http://www.usarmy.com/mos/army-13f.html" rel="nofollow">level</a>] depending on their specific position. They must be able to work independently for long periods of time, as some missions can be last for days or even weeks, and because of the clandestine nature of their work and their frequent placement on or behind enemy lines, the ability to operate with minimal support is of great importance.</p>
<p>Fire Support Specialists may be attached to the <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mechanized_infantry.html" title="Mechanized infantry">mechanized infantry</a> or an Armored division. When <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mechanized.html" title="Mechanized">mechanized</a>, fire support teams consist of a driver, a commander, a Fire Support <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-Commissioned_Officer_471a.html" title="Non-Commissioned Officer">Non-Commissioned Officer</a>, and a Fire Support Specialist of rank of E4 <a href="../../../s/p/e/Specialist_%28rank%29.html" title="Specialist (rank)">Specialist</a>). This team works within an <a href="../../../m/3/_/M3_Bradley_5411.html" title="M3 Bradley">M7 Bradley</a> Fighting Vehicle, called a B-FIST or Bradley FIST, which is designed for the task of Coordinating indirect fire.</p>
<p>Fire support teams designated to work with infantry companies and platoons play a more direct action role, performing their duties without the aid of a vehicle. Each infantry platoon is assigned a Forward Observer in the rank of E-5 <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sergeant.html" title="Sergeant">Sergeant</a>, along with his Radio/Telephone Operator (RTO) and a SAW Gunner (see above). These FO's fall under the auspices of the Fire Support Officer and Fire Support Non-Commissioned Officer who work at company-level.</p>
<p>Fire support teams designated to work with cavalry troops also play a direct action role. Due to the smaller platoon size in a cavalry troop the forward observer often fulfills the role of both a FO and a scout. As with the infantry the FO and RTO are assigned to be a Platoon Leader's personal asset.</p>

<p>One specialty of a fire support team is to act as a COLT (Combat Observation Lasing Team). The COLT is a high-technology observer team often called on to maximize the use of smart munitions such as the <a href="../../../m/7/1/M712_Copperhead_99ab.html" title="M712 Copperhead">M712_Copperhead</a>. COLTs are regularly equipped with a [<a href="http://trol.redstone.army.mil/cgi-bin/cmo/get_spare_definitions.pl?p_type=M" class="external text" title="http://trol.redstone.army.mil/cgi-bin/cmo/get_spare_definitions.pl?p_type=M" rel="nofollow">GLLD</a>, a device used to assist any munition which requires reflected laser energy for final ballistic guidance.</p>
<p>All US Army 13-series soldiers attend training at <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Sill_7fdd.html" title="Fort Sill">Fort Sill</a>, Oklahoma, regardless of specialty. The training for 13F's has recently been revamped, eliminating separation between "boot camp" and job training. Recruits complete both <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recruit_training.html" title="Recruit training">Basic Combat Training</a> and their job instruction not only at the same facility, but with the same cadre, all in one long training period. Marines receive their forward observer schooling at Fort Sill as well, though their initial training is completed elsewhere.</p>
<p>Forward Observers, due to their requisite intelligence, adaptability, and broad range of combat skills are often candidates for many special operations units and training. Occasionally, FOs will be trained for additional mission profile expansions, such as long-range reconnaissance, specific climate/locale (i.e. jungle, arctic, mountain, or urban environments), and other specializations, such as Ranger, Airborne, Pathfinder, and Air Assault. Due to their field training and general mission profile, artillery observers are often sought-after by high-profile combat units such as the US Army's 82nd Airborne, 101st Infantry (Air Assault), 10th Mountain Division, 2nd Infantry (STRYKER), and the 75th Ranger Regiment.</p>
<p>Many Forward Observers are considered 'special operations capable' due to their intensive training and highly selective requirements for admission into the MOS. Throughout recent missions in the Global War On Terrorism, FOs have been requested to join special task forces and mission personnel rosters, and have performed exceptionally well on these often highly sensitive and challenging missions.</p>
<p>U.S. Army FOs share an exceptionally high espirit de corps, and consider themselves to be apart from their fellow troops. FOs consider it a matter of pride to be the best. They push themselves and one another to excel at everything, from marksmanship and land navigation to even learning other MOS to be of more use to their units. Many Army FOs are among the best performing, highest rated, and most valuable personnel in their units. This demand for perfection, often rigorous additional training, and exceeding standards of performance, coupled with their smaller numbers and highly dangerous mission profiles, has generated a deep sense of fraternity and camaraderie among these "FISTers".</p>
<p>U.S. Army FIST Soldiers lives by the Motto, "Rock Hard", referring to these soldiers' toughness of mind, body, and spirit, and also the toughness of their training and the strength of the bonds between them. Another common FIST Motto, though much less official, is "With Your Shield Or On It", a reference to the ancient Spartan saying that it is better to return dead, being carried on your shield than to lose your shield that in spartan battle formation protected the man next to you. This alludes to the common sentiment among FIST Team members that nothing less than perfection or vistory is acceptable. Many FOs, when beginning training at Ft. Sill, OK, are told the story of the Spartans at Thermopolyae, in which FOs are taught to see themselves as the Spartans, a small, select and elite few who overcome any odds to defend their country.</p>
<p>A widely-distributed sentiment among U.S. Army FOs reads:</p>
<p><i>My job is the best in the world. I stand on a mountaintop at dawn, and with a single word I call fire and steel to rain down from Heaven. I shake the world before me, and cities and nations are cast into ruin. I call forth the lightning from the skies and armies and legions are scattered before me. I am an unseen force, and nothing and no one can come upon me. I am the preserver of Freedom, and by my works others may gather to repel the remaining darkness. I am a perfect tool for the destruction of the wicked and am an avenging angel about to descend upon the foes of liberty. I go anywhere, fight any foe, and neither the forces of man or nature can stop me. I am the Right FIST of God! Rock Hard!</i></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Artillery_observer.html" title="Edit section: Joint Fires Observer">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Joint Fires Observer</span></h3>
<p>A <i>Joint Fires Observer</i> is trained as a universal observer. The JFO is forward deployed and can call in artillery fire, just like a Fire Support Specialist. In addition, JFOs are trained a less extensive version of the <a href="../../../j/o/i/Joint_terminal_attack_controller.html" title="Joint terminal attack controller">JTAC</a> course so they can call air support.</p>
<p>As the US Army is transitioning its large <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_%28military%29.html" title="Division (military)">division</a>-based structure to more mobile <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigades.html" title="Brigades">brigades</a> under its <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transformation_of_the_United_States_Army_8529.html" title="Transformation of the United States Army">Army Transformation</a> program, it plans to reduce heavy artillery and depend more on air support. Because of this the Army wants 4000 JTACs assigned to ground units. The <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_Air_Force_5fa2.html" title="US Air Force">US Air Force</a> believes such difficult to produce specialists (currently only 700) should not be organic (permanently assigned) but instead liquid, assigned only when needed. The JFO comes in as a compromise between the Army and the Air Force.</p>
