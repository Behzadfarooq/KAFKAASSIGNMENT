<li><b>Definately Keep</b> - This story is currently unfoldiing, we should keep it. This event also made major national headlines, including a minute long spot on the NBC Nightly News.User:Millipedeman 8:56, 7 December 6 2006 (CST)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - 10,000 gallon propane tank? In all honsety, I have always wondered what one of those would do if it exploded. The article is poorly written, but should stay for now. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a> 12:28, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - I agree with <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">Chrislk02 (Chris Kreider)</a>. Although the article is poorly written the subject in hand was tragic and therefore should be kept for the time being.<a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDebaser23_b60b.html" title="User:Debaser23">Debaser23</a> 12:29, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - I put the article up, seeing as it was a disaster of some size, but apparently it hasn't turned out to be as notable as I had thought it was. Moreover, I didn't have the time to expand it into anything bigger than a stub. Maybe we should <b>merge</b> it into some explosions page or something. OTOH, maybe we should leave it to stand and develop on its own merits. — <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickyrab_21c2.html" title="User:Rickyrab">Rickyrab</a> | <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickyrab_2fd1.html" title="User talk:Rickyrab">Talk</a> 16:31, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - "This article is a stub" is a terrible reason to delete. Also, one less was killed in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Rome_metro_crash_4a64.html" title="2006 Rome metro crash">2006 Rome metro crash</a>, but it survived AfD, and the same with <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airwork_Flight_23_8c4e.html" title="Airwork Flight 23">Airwork Flight 23</a>.<a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlood_red_sandman_957e.html" title="User:Blood red sandman">Blood red sandman</a> 17:22, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - this article could easily be brought up to the standards of those in <a href="../../../e/x/p/Category%7EExplosions_ff2f.html" title="Category:Explosions">Category:Explosions</a> and the subcategory <a href="../../../g/a/s/Category%7EGas_explosions_3025.html" title="Category:Gas explosions">Category:Gas explosions</a>, or other disaster articles. Merging is an idea, but disaster articles actually make nice compact slices of history of their own.

<li><b>Delete</b>. We can't have articles for every local disaster or accident, otherwise I'm going to go off an create an article called <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980_Saskatoon_Queen%27s_Hotel_fire_06a8.html" title="1980 Saskatoon Queen's Hotel fire">1980 Saskatoon Queen's Hotel fire</a> which is notable as causing the first-ever deaths of firefighters in that city's history. Had the loss of life been large, had it been a terrorist attack, or had it otherwise been anything more than a major local fire, I might look at it differently. But it hasn't even continued to be a major story on CNN. In response to the keeping of the Rome Metro crash, etc. cited above ... maybe there might have been mitigating factors that might have been involved. Put them up for AFD again and I might vote to delete or I might vote to keep. Each situation is different. If kept, this article needs to be renamed, however; surely it's not the only explosion of some kind that occurred in that city this year. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 19:55, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm going to abstain from listing an outright 'keep' or 'delete' for this because I live in Milwaukee and might be a bit too close to the events to be neutral, but there are serious outstanding controversies about the explosion that ensure it's not going to be out of the headlines anytime soon, and it has already cleared WP:N with room to spare given news articles in the Chicago Tribune and Journal-Sentinal at least already, the day after. Furthermore I don't think the article is doomed to stubiness, there remain serious issues outstanding. I also think it's premature to AfD an ongoing event the day after the article was made and the event itself happened on the grounds of article quality and notability, sources will exist, but they may not exist yet the day after a major (literally ground-shaking, I felt the blast more than 20 miles away) event. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 22:46, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I've been looking for similar stuff (using "what links here" on the "current event" template is one way) and I found <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Tornado_of_2006_5e3e.html" title="London Tornado of 2006">London Tornado of 2006</a>. There was also a big fireworks factory explosion in the UK a few days ago that killed two firefighters, but I've failed to find any coverage here or at Wikinews - see <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/southern_counties/6204452.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/southern_counties/6204452.stm" rel="nofollow">BBC article</a>.

Sometimes these things are covered better by Wikinews, sometimes an article on the event is created and survives here as well. While looking over at Wikinews, I found <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Kim_20f8.html" title="James Kim">James Kim</a> as an example of an article that has been dominated by the news of his being missing and then found dead.

<dd>That fireworks explosion is covered, at the <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Hoathly_with_Halland_e804.html" title="East Hoathly with Halland">East Hoathly with Halland</a> and <a href="../../../f/e/s/Festival_Fireworks_14fc.html" title="Festival Fireworks">Festival Fireworks</a> articles; it just doesn't as yet have an article of it's own. Just by the way, I'm a UK resident and <a href="../../../s/k/y/Sky_News_4520.html" title="Sky News">Sky News</a> (who are brilliant for breaking news coverage, and deserve their awards in that area) aired some very impressive footage of all the fireworks launching and exploding - there was a lot of stuff to explode in there. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlood_red_sandman_957e.html" title="User:Blood red sandman">Blood red sandman</a> 07:29, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I see no question about it. Three dead and 37+ injured. There are a lot of explosion disasters with lesser impact that have bigger articles.

In response to <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a>: I agree that the article needs renaming, but you also woke my interest for the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980_Saskatoon_Queen%27s_Hotel_fire_06a8.html" title="1980 Saskatoon Queen's Hotel fire">1980 Saskatoon Queen's Hotel fire</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> As stated above, articles on lesser disasters have been kept, thus, this one should be kept. --<a href="../../../c/f/9/User%7ECF90_d6ea.html" title="User:CF90">CF90</a> 22:42, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and Cleanup</b> I think this article has merit from an emergency management perspective, especially if information regarding possible mitigation or preparedness steps (possibly controversial discussion) are included. I would change the name to be more specific, perhaps including the Fauk name. It definitely needs to be kept current, though. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParradoxx_b2fe.html" title="User:Parradoxx">Parradoxx</a> 19:23, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, I went by the explosion about five minutes after it happened on a coach bus, and I can say with no question that it was the biggest fire I have ever seen. It was enormous. The event made national news and was mentioned several times on Fox News Channel as well as hours and hours on Milwaukee TV. I made an article on the <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falk_Corporation_6ec2.html" title="Falk Corporation">Falk Corporation</a> the next day and included some of the info about the fire. The story is still being investigated, it's rather interesting because six of the people said there was no formal evacuation. I might have a picture of the fire, someone on the bus had a digital camera took a picture (I could only manage getting one on my phone). I believe this story is notable enough. Just think about it; a 10,000 gallon propane tank. I guess I'll clean it up a little bit. I just hope I can get that picture.++<a href="../../../a/v/i/User%7EAviper2k7_0275.html" title="User:Aviper2k7"><span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">aviper2k7</span></a>++ 21:03, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
