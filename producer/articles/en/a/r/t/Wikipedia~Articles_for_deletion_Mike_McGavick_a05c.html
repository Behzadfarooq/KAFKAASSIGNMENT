<li><b>Keep</b>. Safeco had a $4.19B revenue and is a major company, especially in Washington state. A recent CEO is certainly notable, and his Senate run only increases his notability.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Certainly notable as former CEO but also the Washington State 2006 Senate race is a highly watched one for Senate control. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 06:28, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, CEOs come and go frequently. According to <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20050519/ai_n14640944" class="external text" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20050519/ai_n14640944" rel="nofollow">this site</a>, Europe and United States CEOS last an <b>average</b> of 2.5 and 4.5 years respectively. Companies that have been in business for a while are likely to have a ton of ex-CEOs. Also, people running for office are rarely notable for doing so. Again, there is just a huge number of such individuals. For the U.S. House of Representatives, there are probably 700 to 1,500 failed candidates every two years, more if you do not count those who do not get past the primaries (the large range is due to the fact that smaller parties do not have a candidate for every seat). Also, we have had elections for the House for over two hundred years, although there were fewer Representatives in the past. Now, think about all of the failed candidates in other countries and countries that no longer exist, from the founding of the country to the current day or to the country's demise. Finally, some people want to include failed state, county and even mayoral candidates, which would be an even bigger number of people. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 08:34, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: Kjkolb makes a very strong argument, but the super-rich are fairly uncommon and tend to go about their business behind the shade of anonymity. The guy is too high profile <i>for everything else</i> in his life to be just a candidate. There are irrelevancies in the article, and the structure isn't great, but the figure himself passes. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:27, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> McGavick's <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003126085_senate14m.html" class="external text" title="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003126085_senate14m.html" rel="nofollow">net worth</a> is between $36M and $65M. I agree with what you said, but as far as CEOs go he isn't "super-rich." Still a high-profile guy in two fields, however. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliceNYC_999d.html" title="User:SliceNYC">SliceNYC</a> 17:06, 28 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Wow. It's a sad day when $65,000,000.00 doesn't make you super rich, but I believe you. It's still far enough up there that he qualifies for the company of "people who get things and whose names the public does not know." I hate to sound populist, but it is probably worthwhile to know who those folks are, as they keep popping up in industrial and financial contexts. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:23, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>People who "get things"? Did the Money Fairy suddenly show up on McGavick's doorstep one day and hand him a big sack of rumpled $20s? For someone who "hates to sound populist", you sure are good at it. McGavick is notable by any objective standard. Were he merely a major party nominee for the Senate, he'd be notable, and were he merely the former CEO of a Fortune 500 company he'd be notable. This AfD is silly. <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoiceOfReason_c913.html" title="User:VoiceOfReason">VoiceOfReason</a> 17:33, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry that you want to pick a quarrel, but I'm not really in the mood for it. I am not an expert on fairy largesse. I feel sure, though, that you will find someone to have an argument with, if you keep trying. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 19:36, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
