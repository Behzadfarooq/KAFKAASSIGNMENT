<li>The article tells us that the band released "two full-length albums". Allmusic confirms that this is indeed the case, and I found one of the albums in stock and available to buy on Amazon. The <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criteria appear to be satisfied. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:55, 13 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>...two albums <i>on a major label</i>. The one label's <a href="http://www.blueskiesturnblack.com/html/tours.html" class="external text" title="http://www.blueskiesturnblack.com/html/tours.html" rel="nofollow">web site</a> only lists seven bands: two are dead and four aren't touring. The other label's <a href="http://www.sickroomrecords.com/tours.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.sickroomrecords.com/tours.htm" rel="nofollow">web site</a> has about two dozen bands, no band descriptions and a broken Site Map link on every page.

<li>Is this the same criteria that I'm reading? "<i>Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable).</i>" Their labels are neither major nor important indie labels - is there anyone on either of their performer rosters that are on Wikipedia? Has anyone even heard of anyone on their rosters? Is there some other criteria I'm missing? —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 14:19, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Oh, the latest keep vote is from someone that only votes on my Afd's and always against. Clears it up for me. <a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> 14:37, 13 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have voted on a total of three AfD's, two of which Wknight94 created. The third one I created, pretty much at his request, and in agreement with him. I took him to task for disparaging one of my edits, and he has directed quite a number of posts to me or about me since then. I won't respond further here, as this has nothing to do with Rockets Red Glare, other than his attempt to discredit my vote. <a href="../../../d/r/y/User%7EDryguy_28f0.html" title="User:Dryguy">dryguy</a> 14:53, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd><i>Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country, reported in notable and verifiable sources.</i>

<dd><i>Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable).</i>
<dl>
<dd>You can certainly debate whether the label in question is notable <i>enough</i>, but a case <i>can</i> be made that the criterion is satisfied.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd><i>Has been prominently featured in any major music media.</i>

<dd><i>Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise extremely notable; note that it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such.</i>
<dl>
<dd>Again: you can debate whether <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Guthrie_2d6e.html" title="Jim Guthrie">Jim Guthrie</a>, whose band contains former RRGer Evan Clarke, is notable <i>enough</i>, but a case <i>can</i> be made that he is.

<li><b>KEEP</b> - They are disbanded so this is not some sort of plug for the band. They have records and songs out there. Probably some floating around on the internet. The people who made the music and care for the music are still around. Why not keep? Are we running out of room? Verifyable. Encyclopedic to some. Not an ad. So keep already. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 01:54, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>DELETE</b>. <s>They're notable because they released three albums. They are a band, they toured, they released albums, thus they are deserving of an entry. They're now part of the history of the Canadian music scene. I mean who decides whether a band is notable or not? Based on sales? Radio play? Fanbase? What? This article has to stay.</s> --<a href="../../../d/o/g/User%7EDogbreathcanada_755d.html" title="User:Dogbreathcanada">Dogbreathcanada</a> 04:41, 15 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> is supposed to say. Unfortunately, that just leads to discussion about what "notable" means in "<i>Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country, reported in <b>notable</b> and verifiable sources.</i>" Some say that is indisuputable. Me? I dispute it. To answer other questions, there has been a big push here - including making WP:BAND violation a speedy deletion criteria - to stop Wikipedia from being flooded by every band that every person likes. I.e., if Rockets red glare is notable enough, then so are fifty zillion other bands until half the database is just bands, each of which is notable in one person's mind. Has anyone found any of this band's label-mates in Wikipedia? Why not? Get that new article button moving because they must all be notable too. And, if any of them were on a slightly larger label too, make articles for all of that label's bands, etc., etc... Soon, every schmuck that's ever picked up a guitar and happened to know someone with some recording equipment who happened to know someone at a CD publishing joint - they're all on Wikipedia. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 05:22, 15 January 2006 (UTC)
