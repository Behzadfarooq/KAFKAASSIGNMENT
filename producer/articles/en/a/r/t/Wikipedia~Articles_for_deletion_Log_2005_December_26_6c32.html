<dd>There is significant discussion about who Vigdor is, for people who are just getting started, and questions about what I do in the land of bloggers. A visit to my website is the most authoritative way to answer those inquiries rather than the all-inclusive attacks and "horror" stories that one sees from the largely uninformed censors who inhabit this domain. I am not a person who is especially sensitive to the quality of the technology over the quality of the content but I did make a quick check on my code for the FINS website using TIDY, my favorite authority. They report 0-errors! with a negligible number of warnings, despite the alarming report by the "Timecop" authority. --Vigdor 10:01, 26 December 2005 {UTC}</dd>

<dd>Thesquire works hard at his job, I'll give him or her credit for this. He enjoys vandalizing my article on blogs, with page blanking, then posts warnings to me and fanciful "Comments" here and there demanding that users join his masquerade. It looks like the latest career move for the "mind guards" that use every form of coercion to get their way. In a society that is locked in gridlock of complex and conflicting ideas, the technique of coercion that is known as "Groupthink" is working overtime. Wikipedia is the made-to-order site for this destructive cabal. Reworking the meaning of the world guided by the standard of "Neutrality"! Organization of knowledge and approximation of a "world encyclopedia" have flourished since ancient Greek and Roman times. This new venture based on the standards of "Neutrality" is going nowhere. Knowledge organization requires, above all, engagement of the striving human spirit. To say that all we can be is what we are, which is what you get with the direction of "Neutral" ideas is a breakthrough to nowhere. The net result is a war of censorship, something that died a natural death in the Dark Ages, reborn in the 21st century at Wikipedia. Vigdor 11:27, 26 December 2005 {UTC}</dd>

<li>I have no idea what motivates stupid behaviour or vanity. What matters is the issue at hand- the article raises a relevant historical question, particularly considering that this is an internet encyclopedia. The references I added to the article confirm that Schreibman started an Internet news service and was denied press credentials in Washington. His case may be one of the early precursors in the ongoing confrontation between the old and new medias. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 04:57, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

I personally know little about the very early history of blogging myself, hence my reluctance to make an actual vote on this article, but I do not appreciate attacks upon my character.

<li>It's not the "first blog"! This is an attempt to rewrite history so that V.S. can be the first in a category that wasn't invented yet. But as the article itself documents, there were periodically updated internet presences before there was a web, and there were sites, such as the NCSA What's New page, that had daily updates before Schreibman. While he no doubt had an early internet presence, you will not find any source substantiating that claim except his own. (It's really hard to keep my annoyance over what's happening in the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">Blog</a> article from spilling over here.) <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodii_0ecc.html" title="User:Rodii">rodii</a> 22:16, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>((User Rodii makes a relevant inquiry, which certainly should be explored. In a genuine dialogue the first stage of idea generation requires that "Every person matters, so it is necessary to protect the autonomy and authentifity of each observer." In the second stage of idea synthesis, a model of influence and importance of each idea can be produced with the support of computer methodology such as Nominal Group Technique (NGT) or Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM). The approach followed in Wikipedia is very destructive, inviting vicious attacks by opposing partisans. No sane and reasonable person would call this a "collaborative system." The facts that I have stated about my experience in Internet-based news are accurate. The documents that I have cited are true and accurate. My entire library is open to public inspection. You will see, for example, the first edition of the Federal Information News Syndicate: in the directory on News Columns, the first article on "Participatory Democracy in the Information Age," which FINS published on January 11, 1993. The search engines may not pick this up because the text of my early reports were not HTML. I am pursuaded that my claim of being the first "blog" is valid, albiet open to challenge, based in large part on my experience at the Periodical Press Gallery of the U.S. Congress during the period from 1993-1996. During those years no one at that venue had the least clue what Internet-based news reporting was. In fact, when I started reported via Internet, the Manager of the Gallery, David Holmes, held a meeting with his colleagues to consider terminating my Press Pass; they were all terribly concerned about what I was doing, which they thought must be illegal. These are all seasoned Journalists, completely mystified by the whole idea of Internet-based news. My news column was clearly a first among that leadership group! There certainlly were others using the Internet, many Universities, including, of course, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), but it would surprise me to learn that they thought of themselves as a "blog"!

<p>I believe this article should not be deleted. It is informative. Other websites have their own wiki's as well for information on their sites. If this one is deleted. All must be deleted. [User: thewird] December 25th, 2005</p>
<p>It is my opinion that this should not be deleted for the reasons shown by thewird as well as the fact that KoC clone games are an important thing of note when discussing Kings of Chaos as well as MMO's in general, and that no other such KoC clones are represented in the wikipedia. [User: funkywizard] December 25th, 2005.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. If KoC clones are important when discussing KoC, then that deserves to go in the article. IMO, the single sentence mentioned there is enough to say that. If any of the clones are notable in themselves - by having a large userbase, some kind of media interest, or a high Alexa rating (142,000 is a long way from the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> guideline of 10,000). I would recommend anyone trying to save the article read the guideline in question, as well as the seciont on meatpuppets in Wikipedia:Sock Puppets, and maybe even tracking down an AfD that went in favour of a website's entry to see how an argument should be organised. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConMan_d21d.html" title="User:ConMan">Confusing Manifestation</a> 08:42, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - This is not a "pure dictdef". The content has now been expanded to stub-grade. There is much potential for development. For one, the Michelin Guide, widely considered the top of the heap for high-end gastronomy, gives a very limited number of its highest, the three-star rating (I believe, currently only 50 in the world). So, there is a clear distinction between a "three-star restaurant" and any other star rating. A top chef in France recently committed suicide, with some news reports citing the rumored impending demotion of his restaurant from Michelin three-star to two-star as the reason. Some people take their (three) stars more seriously than simply a dictdef. --<a href="../../../t/s/a/User%7ETsavage_7e01.html" title="User:Tsavage">Tsavage</a> 03:21, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>The content in the current stub has already gone beyond a dictionary definition.</b> For example, the Michelin three-star rating is a big deal in the restaurant world; naming and discussing the impact of three stars on those restaurants is one obvious expansion direction. In any case, I suppose I should read up on whatever specific definition of dictdef you're using, but a <i>phrase</i> almost always seems like it would NOT be simply a dictdef, a phrase stands for something that usually can be described, and has a story. This is Wikipedia, the open, anyone-can-edit, interactive encyclopedia with tens of thousands of active contributors and nearly a million articles on the Web, I don't see why we're trying to limit this, rather than see if it can go somewhere? What is the point? If there is a chance for expansion, as demonstrated by the stub, give it a break!?! --<a href="../../../t/s/a/User%7ETsavage_7e01.html" title="User:Tsavage">Tsavage</a> 18:33, 26 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Wouldn't a Move be beyond the scope of this particular AfD, since this stub is not equivalent to a restaurant ratings article? If that article were to be created, this content could possibly be merged there, and if so, this article then turned into a redirect. But as it is, while this article may be a future redirect or a subarticle of a currently non-existent restaurant ratings article, a Move doesn't seem to make sense. Or is this just another way of saying that "three-star restaurant" shouldn't have its own encyclopedia listing, i.e. it should be deleted? --<a href="../../../t/s/a/User%7ETsavage_7e01.html" title="User:Tsavage">Tsavage</a> 01:21, 27 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Is improving the article in question "beyond the scope" of an AfD? I say not --I contend that "three-star restaurant" without context is an improper title for what is clearly an article that will delineate exceptional restaurants. A Michelin guide's "three star restaurant" is supposedly superior to a "three star restaurant" as listed in a Mobil guide or the <i>New York Times</i>. A rename is definitely needed here to provide context for the search as well. The stub is good, but it cannot stand alone with the current name. It would be far better to change the name (with Wikipedia, that's a "move") and allow the expansion into a solid all-around article encompassing more than the Michelin guide (and if it's only supposed to cover Michelin three star restaurants, then a move to that page would be best). <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 06:14, 27 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm brand new to AfD so perhaps bear with me. I understand what you (and the other Move/Merge proponents) are suggesting. It sounds quite logical, and I understand the appeal of "let's just clean it all up in one bureacratic move." But I'm also interested in how procedures like this can work without contributing undue bias from relatively tiny minorities within the "community" (like a decision voted on by a handful of people). Flexible interpretation is great, but makes it all the more necessary that the "rules" are continually made clear. Here, if the orginal AfD was based on an article being no more than a dictdef, and that condition has satisfactorily been changed, is that not the end of that particular AfD? On one hand, we don't want to get mired down in endless bureaucratic detail and red tape, on the other, there should be quite clear scope for each procedure and process, else it becomes difficult to participate without getting mired in dealing with extraneous aspects. In this case, <b>if <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three-star_restaurant.html" title="Three-star restaurant">three-star restaurant</a> is (now) a proper stub, what are the grounds for AfD, and where are they stated?</b> --<a href="../../../t/s/a/User%7ETsavage_7e01.html" title="User:Tsavage">Tsavage</a> 19:16, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That seems to be an arbitrary way of determining how content evolves on WP. I think that, despite all types of not-getting-the-concept entries, vandalism, stupidity, whatnot, any entry that someone took the time to make has potential value. I can understand deletion when <i>no case whatsoever</i> can be made for an article (but that would be rare). Here, I can easily think of circumstances: An American traveller goes to France, encounters a ton of conversation about "three-star restaurants" (referring to the distinct, rare Michelin award), and wants to know, "What's up with three-star restaurants?" Well, he could get redirected to and have to read through a <a href="../../../r/e/s/Restaurant.html" title="Restaurant">restaurant</a> article, or a <a href="../../../r/e/s/Restaurant_guide.html" title="Restaurant guide">restaurant guide</a> article, a restaurant rating system article, a restaurant review article, a restaurant criticism article, or whatever. Or, if there was sufficient topic-specific information, he could go directly to a <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three-star_restaurant.html" title="Three-star restaurant">three-star restaurant</a> article that would proceed to quickly and efficiently, in an encyclopedia-like manner, answer the question. Isn't that part of the boundless electronic Webness of WP, the potential for things to be made more accessible than before?

<li>As I see it (and please correct me if I am misguided), had the article been originally written as the acceptable stub it is now, instead of as a dicdef, then there would have been no basis for submitting it as an AfD. Since that is in fact the current situation, how can a now-invalid AfD be used as justification for deciding how to title and organize articles in the general subject area of restaurant ratings...? In any case, all of that can be done as a matter of course in normal editing, so why is it being discussed here under AfD? --<a href="../../../t/s/a/User%7ETsavage_7e01.html" title="User:Tsavage">Tsavage</a> 15:51, 28 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There would have been no basis for submitting it as a dicdef, but there may still well have been those concerned that the topic was restrictive, since (as per much discussion abouve) that three-star rating is not the only one in existence. I have moved this article to <a href="../../../r/e/s/Restaurant_rating.html" title="Restaurant rating">Restaurant rating</a>, where it can be updated to include other rating schemes. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font style="color:green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">nni</a> <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font style="color:green">☯</font></a> 01:29, 29 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, so it is as I thought. Once the article was turned into an (acceptable) stub, this AfD was closed. All the rest of the votes are essentially irrelevant, since there was no longer a basis for deletion, and what you did with the move and redirect could have been done by anyone, at any time...

<li>I apologize. I am new, not only to wikipedia, but the internet as well. The term armifulation should not be considered entirely valid, although it is quite well know through several cities in Newfoundland and Labrador. Once the term can be properly cited in sevral reliable sources I hope it can be eligible for admission into the wiktionary. Right now, it's only documentation exists in the folklore archives at Memorial University of Newfoundland. I have also written an inqusitive letter to Funk and Wagnall's to see how a colloquialism can evolve into a universally accepted english word. Again, sorry for the misunderstanding.

<p>Non-notable band, their own website indicates most albums only had 1000 copies made (though one album allegedly had 5000 cassettes created). Google doesn't turn up a whole lot either (at least in my limited research).

<li>Contributions are not necessarily positive. Spreading information out in a thousand articles padded with ephemera is not useful if someone isn't after the ephemera. If that's your aim, well we've got that already, it's called the internet. We shouldn't be judging things on what theoretical position we have previously decided to hold, we should be judging things on what is most useful to a user of Wikipedia right now - not in some theoretical utopian future when a million other articles have been added.

<li>Firstly please remember that the people of Zimbabwe, who overwhelmingly do <i>not</i> have the internet, are the most likely to want to read about this school. In a theoretical future when a million other articles have been added, and if a decent proportion of them are about schools in Zimbabwe, it would be less harmful to bury this info in the town article.

<li>No, firstly you should consider that the population of Kwekwe are the most likely to want to read about the school, and such people are likely to have the intelligence to notice that Kwekwe High School is in Kwekwe.

<ul>
<li>The fact that "not one single school has been deleted in a year" is not relevent to the discussion. Most normal people have run away from the school AfF's because they are a complete waste of time. The school inclusionists have won by attrition and apathy and more importantly because rationale people, such as Denni, are not fighting the inevitable and trying to find a working solution to schools. Such a solution would prevent schools coming to AFD in the first place. The fact that the some are still on a high horse speaks volumes to the goals of the project. When will the adversarial interactions be replaced by something constructive? Again, the inevitable, "all schools are kept" is NOT a consensus it is a default. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDaycd_ee80.html" title="User talk:Daycd">(Talk)</a> 17:36, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>"When will the adversarial interactions be replaced by something constructive?" - good question, I'm disappointed that we are exchanging words like "nonsense" and rehashing the same old arguments for the millionth time, I thought we could have moved on by now. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 23:47, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm not sure where that feeling of disappointment might come from, Kappa. Your participation in the discussions at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a> was more than a tad underwhelming. Why do you suppose we're rehashing the same old arguments? I propose it is because the group of inclusionists seeking to keep school articles has not (with the notable exception of <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a>) made any effort whatsoever to compromise on school articles. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font style="color:green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">nni</a> <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font style="color:green">☯</font></a> 00:34, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>To be fair that is because Kappa actually does clean up the articles that come through Afd and makes them into fairly decent stubs. However, kappa can't do every school article himself. Merge without losing information is a fine compromise and one that would easily stop AFD nominations. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDaycd_ee80.html" title="User talk:Daycd">(Talk)</a> 19:15, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Burden of proof falls on those who want to delete. You got to do better than an english-language google search before saying this guy doesn't exist or is "insignificant".

<li><b>Comment</b> - The burden of proof is on the article's writer to provide <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable sources</a> supporting his or her addition. If none can be found, articles which are unverifiable may be deleted by consensus. As there are no verifiable sources around for this article, deletion is perfectly acceptable. &lt;cliche&gt;In the wake of Seigenthaler&lt;/cliche&gt; we're really cracking down on verifiability. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 09:35, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - there are thousands of stubs on Wikipedia, hardly any include sources. People write stubs to get rid of read links, and they don't very often do any research into writing a couple of sentences. Are you in favor of deleting all non-sourced stubs? At least be consistent, if that's you're position. I think the burden of proof needs to fall on deletion. Do actual research beyond google search to see about this guy. You're assuming he either doesn't exist or isn't important. If he was a politician and trade union leader of Nigeria then he is certainly important enough to be included. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMateoP_c31c.html" title="User:MateoP">MateoP</a> 18:34, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>There is absolutely nothing that unifies all the cultures of the Asian continent. One could argue that geography is something that could be considered a link between the numerous (and often times unrelated) cultures of Asia, but the fact of the matter is that very few people who live west of Pakistan consider themselves to be Asian. The average Israeli or Iraqi will not claim to be Asian. At best this page should redirect to other, more specific, cultural articles (i.e. Cultures of East Asia, Cultures of Southeast Asia, Cultures of Central Asia ect...}. Matters are made even worse since this article is now Collaboration of the Week, too much conflicting useless information will be added, causing this article to be one of the worst on Wikipedia.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Should allow collab. of week to finish before having an AfD on this one. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican">Youngamerican</a> 05:56, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> - This seems to be a bad-faith nomination to me. Someone sees it on Collaboration of the Week and decides to axe it. The point of Collaboration of the Week is to make an article better, not delete it. And as long as this AfD stays on the article it's going to discourage edits, thus negating the effect of the CotW. Thus I am voting Speedy Keep to allow the CotW to go back into effect as soon as possible. --<b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde Weys</a></b> <sub><a href="../../../t/w/o/Wikipedia%7ETwo-millionth_topic_pool_6995.html" title="Wikipedia:Two-millionth topic pool">vote</a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left: -16px; margin-right: -16px;"><a href="../../../c/y/d/User_talk%7ECyde_0e22.html" title="User talk:Cyde">talk</a></span></sup> 06:04, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Speedied because it's a sub-stub: <i>what else</i> can be added to the article? Speedied because there is no such topic as "Voice of the Borg".

<p>First of all, see Gunk Land -- Gunk land is an obvious hoax.</p>
<p>Skye Thorstenson and Elk Hotel, which is "still in production, scheduled for release 2005", are listed on IMDb, but I'm starting to doubt whether IMDb is reliable in this instance, since Skye Thorstenson and/or his collaborators like to submit hoaxes to Internet websites.</p>
<p>Anyway, even if it was actually "released", it still isn't notable just because there is an IMDb entry for it. The first google hit for "elk hotel" (in quotes) is a consumer review for Best Western Mountain Lodge at Banner Elk. The only related hits are Thorstenson's website and Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I strongly believe the following users are Skye Thorstenson and/or his collaborators. The domain gunkland.com is registered to Skye Thorstenson (since I stated this on afd/Gunk_Land, he has hidden the whois data via domainsbyproxy.com). He/they have vandalized AFD pages: alterning my signed comments, signing incorrect usernames, removing 'disputed' tags, obvious lying ("thanks for the lead to IMDB" even though he already wrote a misleading link to IMDB).</p>

<li>I didn't add the elk hotel page - i was quite flattered someone did. I'm surprised you can't verify this via IP address imprint.

Internet anonymity does bring out uncivil social interactions in people and everyone is susceptable to it. I was sincerely trying to be good natured and foolish with my gunk article. --lostheadfactory 23:42, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Well I am a regular player of this game, played it last night and had a great time. We did end up popping our blue baloon when a pot plant bottom fell on it (which was exciting as we havnt had that happen in a game before) but we blew up a red one and carried on. I do not think it should be deleted. I think it is too bad if it was a picture of a scotsman and called irishman, the user obvously must have thought that some pictures were needed and I believe it makes the page look more interesting. It is a great explanation of the game for new players to the game but misses out some great moves for more experienced players. I was interested in the origins of the game but I cannot say I have heard them before.219.89.154.156 21:56, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Finally someone has put up balloon patting, I have been meaning to put it up but for some time but never got around to explaining it. It- has run in the family for years. Although at the Greymouth Balloon Patting club I attend we use a Red balloon instead of the blue balloon - and just call it the red indian... Have reworded some of the rules for ease of use.. Yes, there are some missing I will add them in sometime, and some I havn't heard of. But gives you the general idea of the game.

<ul>
<li>Yes, it's Turkish. A rather odd sentence to be floating around in the middle of nowhere though! The sentence is a turkish definition of what we apparently call a 'pneumatic trail' in English -- although, in the parenthesis in Turkish it says "pneumatic distance" to be exact, but it sounds like essentially the same term. The translation of the whole thing is: "The distance between the point at which the tire makes contact with the ground and the point of sideways pull/impact is called pneumatic trail in English literature."</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>'yanal kuvvet' translated literally means 'sideways pull/force/impact', but in the context of the sentence, I'm quite sure it actually means traction/adhesive friction (you know, such as the tire grip and centripetal force when you're driving on a bend in the road for example). I mean, I'm no automotive engineer and I'm a girl =), but that’s definitely what it should mean. And they also probably meant 'in English' not 'in English literature'!</dd>
<dd>Still don't know why that sentence would be floating around aimlessly like that though.</dd>

<dd>well I agree that for many occupations nationality or ethnicity is a bit irrelevant, such as opera singer, classical musician, travel writer among others. But as Jews did not have their own state until the creation of Israel and were often denied citizenship or worse in countries in which they lived and most certainly had an identifiable culture of their own it is as justified to allow the Jewish people to have their own categories or lists as it is any other state. Arniep 01:41, 29 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I never disagreed with that. I believe completely that Jews should have their own lists and categories, but I think that some users a while back seriously OVERDID the listing - and I know others have noticed that too. As a matter of fact, I think the <i>categories</i> for Jews are underrepresented when they shouldn't be. <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jews.html" title="Jews">Jews</a> should be treated as an ancestry and should have it's own category under people by ancestry. But the listing is truly overkill. Many other ethnic groups function fine with their own country lists, and Jews have the most country lists of anyone. If a Jewish historian with no article was to be added to Wikipedia, then it takes just as much effort to find out if the historian is Jewish than to find out if the historian is Jewish-German (<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_German_Jews_3595.html" title="List of German Jews">List of German Jews</a>) or Jewish-Hungarian (<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Hungarian_Jews_6259.html" title="List of Hungarian Jews">list of Hungarian Jews</a>). I can see the rationale behind a list of Jewish historians who profess their Judaism in their writings in some form. That makes sense. The list as it is DOES NOT. If you truly agree with me on the fact that Judaism and being a historian have a connection than you will see that the way they are listed here will not work. If the majoriy of Wikipedian ethnic groups HAD lists of historians, then this list is completely fine, but they don't. Unless it is changed to reflect those who profess their religion in their works, it is truly overkill. I can't see how you can disagree with me. If you do, then please please help me understand because I seriously don't. My efforts here are not to "delete" all Jewish lists as <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">User:JJay</a> and you believe, it is to delete ALL lists that are overkill.

<dd>It’s relatively facile to cherrypick names from a list until you manage to prove a point. Given the theological impact of Kuhn’s paradigm, I think his relationship to Judaism is relevant. I would also note that a google for Thomas Kuhn + Judaism gives <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Thomas+Kuhn%22+judaism&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=pRn&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Thomas+Kuhn%22+judaism&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=pRn&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">28,000 hits</a>. Despite the hysterical reaction of <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> (should we delete African-American lists because the Klan exists?), I'm still waiting for an explanation for the google results I listed above. Either a disproportionate number of Jews are historians, or we should acknowledge that the world at large routinely indicates religion for Jewish historians, despite their focus. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 19:35, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No cherry-picking involved. I picked three names I know well from the list: one is a historian of Israel, one did little historical work explicitly on the Jewish people, but is clearly relevant, and one looked to me entirely irrelevant. What theological relevance is there to Kuhn's work? He's a relevant name to invoke on the question of whether science and religion could be counted as having incommensurable domains of expertise, but to say that this says something about <i>Jewish</i> theology is rather strained. Is there more that can be said?--- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 19:55, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Have you already forgotten Marx? We could also debate whether Kuhn is a historian or philosopher. These are secondary issues. Why don't you edit the list? Furthermore, when Jewish nobel prize winners are listed, as is routinely the case, what does that say about Jewish theology?-- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 20:06, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia is a free encyclopedia, but not a free webhost. Erase the term "free" as there is nothing free and sympathic there. .Pete Fenlon (talk) 20:10, 26 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia is a 'free encyclopedia' in the sense that you don't have to pay to look things up... as you would for a paper encyclopedia or other electronic encyclopedias such as Britannica's. It is NOT a 'free webhost' in that you aren't allowed to use it to post any material you would like... only material which one would expect to find in an encyclopedia. Now, people have made 'encyclopedias of Middle-earth' and thus you see alot of Middle-earth articles in Wikipedia... but nobody would ever make (or buy) an 'encyclopedia of unfinished fan RPG material set in Middle-earth'. It's just not the kind of thing ANYONE is ever going to need a handy encyclopedic reference guide to. What you should do is post your materials to geocities or some other web-host site. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 19:25, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Rewrite</b>: Include a discussion on listing of pedophiles</dd>
<dd><b>Rules for inclusion</b>: Restrict names on the list to people who:

<dd><b>a)</b> Are subjects or are named in existing wikipedia articles (pls follow the links to check),</dd>
<dd><b>b)</b> included in which are discussions of their association with pedophilia</dd>

<dd>If you put an accused murderer, a convicted shoplifter, a convicted serial killer, and a person accused but never formally charged, all in one article entitled List of alleged criminals I would AFD that too. If you renamed it to People associated with criminality and added a defense lawyer, I would definately AFD that. Meanwhile, I would still keep all those individual bio articles.

<dd>Robert, I struggle to understand your logic. For each of the names on the list there is a wikipedia article providing all the details that the list summarizes. Why is it that the facts are fine in an article, but as sooon as one lists them this constitutes a blacklist? Same information, different format. I generally consider myself fairly PC but the blacklist logic is PC elevated to the status of faith.--<a href="../../../s/u/i/User%7ESuidafrikaan_86b3.html" title="User:Suidafrikaan">Suidafrikaan</a> 07:24, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Context effects meaning. As an example, <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Glitter_8713.html" title="Gary Glitter">one of the first people added (later removed)</a> has an article that provides meaningful context of exactly what he was convicted of and what he wasn't convicted of. This list provides little context. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_alleged_pedophiles&amp;oldid=32752122" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_alleged_pedophiles&amp;oldid=32752122" rel="nofollow">pre-AFD</a> list provided no context whatsoever. Right now, there's a lot of scrutiny, and effort to "clean-up" this thing due only to the AFD. Once the AFD is over, attention will fade, and people will be free to add whatever names they wish. Allegations are closely scrutinized in bio articles, as people familiar with the person review them. But most lists in Wikipedia go largely unnoticed (except by people adding to them), and frequently contain dubeious info, that goes unchallenged. On the pre-AFD article, while it's common to start an article in a low-quality draft stage for its first version, surely something this serious warranted something a little better (there is a "Preview" button, next to the "Save" button after all). If this is kept, we can expect future poorly thought out contributions to the list (as editors will know the article's immune from deletion). --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 08:26, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> The term 'alleged' makes the article, by its very nature, POV. By grouping those 'alleged' by a few crack-pots with those convicted or sex crimes in a court of law, one clearly enters the region of implying guilt. That, in any jurisdiction, is defamation of character. Besides, even if it weren't, it seems like a pointless article in the first place.

<dd>pedophilia is a sexual preference not a crime, just like homosexuality; hence you're "implying guilt" part is nonsense kthx. and again, it's no more defamation than our <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_gay%2C_lesbian_or_bisexual_people.html" title="List of gay, lesbian or bisexual people">List of gay, lesbian or bisexual people</a>. <code>// <b><a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParoxysm_2155.html" title="User:Paroxysm">paroxysm</a></b> <a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParoxysm_da02.html" title="User talk:Paroxysm">(n)</a></code> 17:45, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Both are illegal in just about any jurisdiction that I could ever imagine, including, for the record, Florida, where Wikimedia is based. I don't care what <i>your</i> personal opinion of paedophilia is, because the only opinion that matters is that of the law, which makes this page defamation, hence illegal. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastin8_2990.html" title="User:Bastin8">Bastin8</a> 19:20, 28 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>o rly, Bastin..? Hmmm...</dd>
<dd>"Pedophilia" is not a legal term. It is a medical term used to describe the sexual attraction to children. Child sexual abuse and et cetera are described in a court of law as child sexual abuse, <i>not</i> pedophilia (for obvious reasons). Tabloids love to use nonsensical phrases like "convicted of pedophilia," though, but uhm, they're <i>tabloids</i> (QED). Pedophilia is not an act, and hence, you can not be convicted of it. Perhaps reading our very own <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">article</a> on pedophilia would be beneficial to you, hmm..&#160;?</dd>
<dd>So in the end, I agree, the law is all that matters, and the law doesn't give a damn about pedophilia. You can freely admit you're a pedophile in front of a cop and all he can do is gasp and call you a sicko. <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nineteen_Eighty-Four_808a.html" title="Nineteen Eighty-Four">Thankfully</a>. <code>// <b><a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParoxysm_2155.html" title="User:Paroxysm">paroxysm</a></b> <a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParoxysm_da02.html" title="User talk:Paroxysm">(n)</a></code> 01:57, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If you want to argue the toss about the differences between paedophilia and actually raping a child, it's best not to do it when arguing to retain this article. After all, most of the people in the list aren't there for reasons of <i><a href="../../../n/i/n/Nineteen_Eighty-Four_808a.html" title="Nineteen Eighty-Four">thought</a></i>, but for the reason that someone believes them each to have <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rape.html" title="Rape">gone through with the act</a>. If that is the justification for inclusion, your argument that the list <i>actually</i> concerns a psychological condition is flawed.</dd>
<dd>Then, the rectification of that 'flaw' (as you see it) leads to further problems. If we keep the list, and it is used to reflect 'paedophiles' in the more esoteric sense, we would be publishing a list of people's thoughts that are inferred from their behaviour. That is far more Orwellian than the alternative.</dd>
<dd>Moreover, use of the term 'paedophile' is understood by the public to imply that the paedophile actually <i>practises</i> it, just as is <i>homosexual</i>. Since that is the understanding, it is the definition for purposes of establishing whether the article is defamation. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastin8_2990.html" title="User:Bastin8">Bastin8</a> 12:57, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm having second thoughts about this. This sort of list is very easy to abuse, but clearly efforts have been made to minimise the risk here. The list is still abusable in certain respects:
<dl>
<dd>1. Two of the sections have rather fluid criteria for inclusion, namely <i>Historical figures alleged to have been pedophiles</i> - what constitutes an allegation? - and <i>People associated with pedophile organizations</i> - what constitutes an association?</dd>
<dd>2. The list has four rather different sorts of sections, and there is no clear reason why other sections might not be added. What looks to be a policeable list might easily become unpoliceable in time.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>So my second thoughts are that the page might not be so unpoliceable in time. I'll vote keep if we can establish some clear discipline for maintaining the list, but I'm dubious now. --- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChalst_cb81.html" title="User:Chalst">Charles Stewart</a> 03:44, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Although this article seems to be written in good faith, I cannot find anything on the 'net to <i>directly</i> support this concept. <a href="../../../t/a/o/Taoism.html" title="Taoism">Taoism</a> does indeed support a hierarchy of gods, so perhaps this "God of Village" is instead many many separate "Gods of Villages".

<li><b>Comment</b> - If this article is merged with <a href="../../../t/a/o/Taoism.html" title="Taoism">Taoism</a> make sure it doesn't land in the Tao chia (or Daojia) section of philosophical Taoism, which has no gods. <a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEndomion_ea7e.html" title="User:Endomion">Endomion</a> 17:27, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep &amp; cleanup</b>. Most English-language sources on religious Taoism refer to these local deities as a "Land God" or "Earth God." (Look halfway down <a href="http://www.taoarts.com/statuaryearthen.html" class="external text" title="http://www.taoarts.com/statuaryearthen.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a> for an example of a statue of a Land God.) They fit into the Taoist hierarchy of dieties above the <a href="../../../z/a/o/Zao_Jun_37e6.html" title="Zao Jun">Kitchen God</a> but below the City God or Town God. Aside from the name-- which may well be a legitimate translation-- there is nothing wacky about the info in the article, though some of it might need sourcing. I agree that it should be cleaned up rather than being merged into the Taoism article. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 04:38, 28 December 2005 (UTC)<br />

<p>I am the website owner and I don't feel my link should be deleted. I have added my site to the Directories List - right where my site belongs. I see it's up for deletion because it's commercial - so are other directories listed there such as Yahoo (I have provided over 10000 free links to the internet community). My site is a useful resource for members of Wikipedia and I would appreciate it if my article isn't deleted. I am also open to suggestions on ways I could make my article Wikipedia friendly? Any help would be appreciated. At the end of the day the category is called "List of Web Directories" exactly what my site is - a directory. If my link is deleted so should all the directory links be deleted, plus the category, because that means you cannot add directories to this category - therefore rendering it a useless category. Hope someone can understand, that category is for directories - regardless of whether the listed is submitted to by directory owners. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by BizSeek (<a href="../../../b/i/z/User_talk%7EBizSeek_20a7.html" title="User talk:BizSeek">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BizSeek_228b.html" title="Special:Contributions/BizSeek">contribs</a>) 26 December 2005.</small></p>

<li>Just because it doesn't have a Google hit, that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. It could be just hitting the internet world starting with this, and you would kill it?

<dd><i>Rather than create new songs as they had before, 50 decided to showcase his hit-making ability by retouching first-class beats which had already been used. They released the red, white and blue bootleg, "50 Cent Is the Future," revisiting material by Jay-Z and even Raphael Saadiq.</i></dd>
<dd><i>That's when the unbelievable happened, and hip-hop history was written. The energetic CD caught the ear of supa MC Eminem, and within a week Em was on the radio saying, '50 Cent is my favorite rapper right now.' Em looked to mentor Dr. Dre to confirm his belief in the young hitmaker, and the good doctor co-signed. Floored by the appreciation of the greats, 50 didn't hesitate in signing with the dream team.</i> <a href="http://www.50cent.com/biography.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.50cent.com/biography.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></dd>

Both the "traditional" Eastside and gang/rap Eastside articles for Long Beach will be expanded as soon as I find the time to search for accurate information.

<dd>If you can come up with a better name, I'll gladly use it. The facts are that there are two very different Eastside Long Beaches and there needs to be some easy way to differentiate them. The "traditional" Eastside has been called that for at least 60 years. On the other hand, the other Eastside is well-known to almost any rap music fan and is the only Eastside Long Beach that is known outside the LA area. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="green"><i>Blank</i></font></sup></a><a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="#F88017"><i>Verse</i></font></sup></a> 08:00, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The object of www.Wikipedia.org is to provide information on numerous subjects. To suggest that this page should be deleted because it has not yet been built is completely against the purpose of this website. The "River Country at Point Mallard" is pure fact, it is in the process of being approved and could become reality. I'm sure that there are other pages on things that have not yet been built or put into action, if this page should be deleted because "River Country" has not yet been built, then I suggest that you go forth and strive to delete those other pages of which advertise some other unbuilt structure, unapproved bill, or project.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Firstly, this list is not, nor could it ever be, complete, and faux pas change faster than the feasible rate at which Wikipedia could be edited--by the time a faux pas is verifiable or citable it could be on its way out. An incomplete list of faux pas is something more appropriate for WikiTravel to help people get along as well as possible in a new culture. Since Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and not a travel guide, it seems pointless to have a list of faux pas. A few examples in the <a href="../../../f/a/u/Faux_pas.html" title="Faux pas">Faux pas</a> article should suffice. This article could also be transwiki'd and put it into the <b>Talk</b> section of each country on WikiTravel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Secondly, this list does not fit the general usage of lists on Wikipedia; that is, a list of links to articles relevant to a particular topic. If someone wants to do important research on cultural aspects of certain countries, they would find better information by starting at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_national_cultures.html" title="List of national cultures">List of national cultures</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagicOgre_374d.html" title="User:MagicOgre">magicOgre</a> 22:45, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Rename</b> to List of Cultural Differences or something like that. This is a valid topic, and can actually be educational and useful, unlike 90% of lists on here. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlyboy_Will_540f.html" title="User:Flyboy Will">Flyboy Will</a> 00:23, 27 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What about the fact that we already have several pages on the culture of each country? <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagicOgre_374d.html" title="User:MagicOgre">magicOgre</a> 03:31, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> or transwiki per nominator. Some of those listed faux pas are controversial. This doesn't even differentiate between the different subcultures of the US (the biggest list). --<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> 00:53, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> but be more specific about what constitutes a 'faux pas'. 'Stuff that can be sort of annoying to some people' do not constitute a faux pas (e.g., waiters interrupting a conversation to check on the table, and stopping a face-to-face conversation to take a phone call). I'm surprised that 'discussing private matters on a mobile phone in a public place' isn't on the list, but I'd also argue that it shouldn't be, so there you have it. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Deken_ff24.html" title="User:Stephen Deken">Stephen Deken</a> 18:33, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but rename. This is not a "list of faux pas", it is a discussion of cultural mores.

<p>This <i>celebration</i> and the traditions appear to be nothing more than the invention of <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/redbird/iblog/GWPublications/C1045275013/E664819225/" class="external text" title="http://homepage.mac.com/redbird/iblog/GWPublications/C1045275013/E664819225/" rel="nofollow">Gordon Worley</a>. Google shows most mentions are mirrors to wikipedias or sites linking back to Gordon Worley's own site. None of the non-encyclopedia sites appear to have any mention of this 'celebration' dating from the last two years unless they are referring to this Wikipdia article itself. It would appear the article itself is perpetuating the celebration.

<li><b>Keep</b>. OK, time to come clean. By now I think I probably have as much personal experience with Newtonmas as anyone. Not self-initiated even: When I was a young adolescent my science teacher had an annual tradition of having his religiously diverse class celebrate Newtonmas as a "neutral" winter holiday. There was no "secular" bend to it, just a pro-science one. We had a little tree with apples and calculators hanging from it, and we ate pasta (manicotti I think), which according to our teacher was "Newton's favorite food". It was fun. Maybe I should make a website about it, and then I'll be an expert source like Gordon Whorley!--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 23:31, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Both Gordon and Robin have connections or interests in the academic world of Artificial Intelligence, so maybe one passed the <i>holiday</i> onto the other. Besides, since when has the blog of one person, the picture album of another and the science teacher of the third constituted enough evidence for the notability of a holiday? <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Eye_7860.html" title="User:Evil Eye">Evil Eye</a> 00:33, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This isn't a neologism; it's a holiday over 10 or 20 years old. Usenet postings go back to 1992, and a user on Talk:Newtonmas very credibly says to have made a radio broadcast about Newtonmas back in 1984. Look, I'm not saying it's the most popular holiday. But many people have heard of it, and a small but real group of people do celebrate it. Unlike high schools or something, there aren't that many small holidays; there's no reason to have an overly exculsive criterion of notability for them.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 01:17, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Me and some friends could devise a new holiday tomorrow involving a historical figure. We could celebrate it, tell people about it and mention it on forums we go to, in emails, on our blogs and post pictures of us celebrating it. This will let people beyond the group who celebrate it know about the new holiday. We could do this for several years. We would be a <i>small but real group of people</i> who celebrate this holiday. But would it make the holiday notable? I think not. Also, looking over the edits on Talk:Newtonmas, the person who added the info about the radio transmission appears to be quoting source written by Michael Morotta, who wrote an page linked to in the main article, so this radio broadcast was carried out by one of the few people we've already got associated with Newtonmas<a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Eye_7860.html" title="User:Evil Eye">Evil Eye</a> 01:37, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> I had already heard about this before I read the Wikipedia article. It's notable in certain humanist subcultures.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>: Newtonmas is certainly <i>interesting</i> enough to keep. Whether it's <i>real</i> enough is shakier, but I'll take the word of the various editors who vouch for it above. I do think the "traditions" § should go, though -- it seems to be entirely inspired by the suggestions in Gordon Worley's blog. Also, since the wikipedia isn't a soapbox, Newtonmas probably shouldn't be in mainpage selected anniversaries until its popularity begins to approach that of <a href="../../../f/e/s/Festivus.html" title="Festivus">Festivus</a>. <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoops_385d.html" title="User:Doops">Doops</a> | <a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoops_62fc.html" title="User talk:Doops">talk</a> 05:58, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> since it should be Hookemas&#160;;-) Actually this should be an article about Gordon Worley if he's notable, but Newtonmas itself is a conceit and really is not widely observed. It's a bit like the joke religions we delete all the time.

<li><b>Keepish</b> I just noticed the article on Wikipedia, (I saw Newtonmas as a link in the "See also" section of the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> article) but I had also heard of it way before this.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. From just above-- Not to mention, Newtonmas is hardly a <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secular.html" title="Secular">secular</a> holiday when you consider not only was <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Newton_6c7e.html" title="Isaac Newton">Newton</a> a famous scientist, but he was much more into the (<a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christian</a>) Bible than science. Also, in accordance with the currently used <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregorian_calendar.html" title="Gregorian calendar">Gregorian calendar</a>, Newton's birthday should accurately be celebrated on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_4.html" title="January 4">4 January</a>, not <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_25.html" title="December 25">25 December</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrickA_389d.html" title="User:PatrickA">PatrickA</a> 08:05, 31 December 2005 (UTC).

<li><b>Keep</b> I created the Wikipedia page and wrote my blog entry about it because numerous people had discussed Newtonmas with me. At the original time of my blog article's creation, there was very little you could find on the Internet about Newtonmas. The holiday is becoming more visible on the Internet and I've read several blogs where the writers have mentioned either celebrating it or at least observing it. To me, people are looking for information on Newtonmas, so Wikipedia should try its best to supply that information. <a href="../../../g/g/o/User%7EGGordonWorleyIII_ec34.html" title="User:GGordonWorleyIII">G Gordon Worley III</a> 16:15, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - My High school physics teacher (in Australia) mentioned this well before Wikipedia.. but I might argue it is non notable and should be deleted anway.

<p>Redundant Category</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. This page is redundant due to the bibliography on the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Haruki_Murakami_247a.html" title="Haruki Murakami">Haruki Murakami</a> main biography, and furthermore is less complete and contains less information than that list. <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EArio_3d60.html" title="User:Ario">Ario</a> 23:43, 26 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is my first AFD posting, and I wasn't aware of the separate process for Category for Deletion. Since I'm not an admin, I'm going to let the AFD process run its course, and then nominate this to CFD. <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EArio_3d60.html" title="User:Ario">Ario</a> 08:46, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Perhaps you should instead list this at <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_ac22.html" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion">Wikipedia:Categories for deletion</a> --<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> 06:35, 27 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Don't bother, categories are never deleted for being redundant with lists. Note that just adding something to the list won't make it appear in the "categories" section at the bottom of the page. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 21:56, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
