A grand total of 37 google hits <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=%22RateItAll%22&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;start=30&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ca/search?q=%22RateItAll%22&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;start=30&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. The links consist of 3 links to the site itself, 1 link off a page, 12 blogs, 6 press release reprints, 6 website directories, 2 photo sites, 1 forum and a myspace page. There are a couple of hits which go nowhere to sites which say things like "we have nothing on rateitall" or the link is dead. The only coverage from a reliable source is <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,2066703,00.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,2066703,00.asp" rel="nofollow">PCMag</a>, before we even get into the quality of it, WP:WEB requires multiple non-trivial coverage, and at best there is a single item of coverage. Given the nature of that coverage though, its borderline trivial as its solely a description of the content on the site. Even with the triviality of that coverage in question, its not enough to establish notability. Also there may be some conflict of interest on the part of the main editor as evidenced by this statement <a href="https://www2.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=13570898&amp;postID=1382980306562586898" class="external autonumber" title="https://www2.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=13570898&amp;postID=1382980306562586898" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></s>.<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 15:29, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep.</b> The "37 Google Hits" is grossly inaccurate. You have to search like this "rateitall" not like this "RateItAll." Depending on what Google data center you hit, you'll find 600,000 to 1,000,000 hits. Same thing on Yahoo!. There is also a video clip of an ABC News (national) piece on RateItAll on the "Talk" page. Compete.com places RateItAll in the top 6,000 sites on the web (in terms of traffic), and Alexa places it in the top 25,000 Web sites. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Lawrencecoburn (<a href="../../../l/a/w/User_talk%7ELawrencecoburn_34ab.html" title="User talk:Lawrencecoburn">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lawrencecoburn_f9e9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lawrencecoburn">contribs</a>) 18:38, 15 February 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<dd>Because the owner of the site was using that figure to claim notability, not only does it not establish notability, its not an accurate representation of how many hits it actually receives. What I propose is obviously whats covered in WP:WEP for establishing notability on a website. So even if we want to pretend that google hits has something to do with notability, we need to look at the correct number which is 44 per that search and not 800,000 any time google searches have been referenced its always the unique hits and not the magic number google pops up at the top which counts everytime its replicated on a page or site (like a forum where a term can easily have its google results blown through the roof if every members profile is indexed and each one contains that term).--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 00:57, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Strong Keep</b>. The first argument for deletion is that only 37 search results for RateItAll came up in Google. This number I dispute. The real number is over 800,000. The second argument for deletion is the lack of noteworthy sources referring to RateItAll. PC Magazine and ABC News (TV) have both features the website. I dispute the assertion and call them noteworthy.</p>
<p>Just as a test, I just ran a Google search three times, again, and each time about 800,000 hits came up on the return. I would entertain a discussion as to how the figures could be so disparate. Please advise.</p>

<dd>Crossmr, the PCMag article is a 783 word feature article in a leading tech magazine. Under what criteria do you find this trivial?
<dl>
<dd>its not word count, its the nature of the coverage. There are a number of types of coverage described in the notability guidelines and I don't really feel this meets the required type of coverage to be a source. The ABC news report is obviously a good source, but this is simply a description of the sites features.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 03:30, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> on grounds of continued additions; dispute claim of lack of Google Hits/alleged status of "Spam"</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon researching the link listed above by one who says that there are only 37 hits for RateItAll on Google, I've found it to be very misleading: I actually clicked on the link, and it says "Results 31 - 40 of about 812,000 for "RateItAll". (0.27 seconds)". I am baffled that this would translate to being "37 hits" when it very clearly says there are "about 812,000".</p>
<p>In addition, I dispute that the article is an advertisement nor SPAM; there is no solicitation nor is it a PR piece, and upon taking a look at the epinions article on wikipedia, it really does not appear to have a significant difference in content.</p>
<p>Regardless, I would argue that the content of the page, though meager now, has a great deal of expansion capability. By all means, I would agree that the content requires a lot of work, but that comes with time, with thorough and proper research.</p>

<dd>As pointed out, the only thing that even remotely matters from google is the amount of unique hits. I'm also going to remind people that this is a discussion, not a vote. I'm noticing more than one user who's sole contributions are to this afd and that article.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 00:59, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I believe I can safely assume that the above comment is directed at my account: I wasn't aware that seniority was an issue at this site. As a first-time user, the small contribution that I had made so far IS on the one site that I feel I am familiar with enough to write on (rateitall), but simply because I don't have the expertise to edit pages entirely too well doesn't mean that, with practice, I won't expand to other articles. I don't think anyone here would believe that this is a matter of "voting" by any means, but I do feel that pointing out any differences in translation on what is "spam" and what is not certainly qualifies for legitimate consideration. Again, I still support the venture to put information on this website on Wikipedia, provided that it is expanded to a respectable amount of information (and I do agree that <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is a legitimate concern that requires addressing, but as this is still a new article, I think it can be worked on]]</dd>

<dd>Its not a matter of seniority, its a matter of long history on wikipedia. Its not uncommon for things like <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">sockpuppets</a> to suddenly spring up when an article is up for deletion, especially one that involves a website or web content. I'm not saying you're a sockpuppet, but any AfD which involves editors who have only made a few contributions and they're limited solely to the AfD and the article in question always has mention of that made, with a reminder that this is a discussion and not a vote.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 03:30, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Reply: While I understand the concern in regards to "sockpuppets" (I guess that's the Wikipedia equivalent to "multi-ID spammer", if I'm understanding the link's article correctly), that would be an unfortunate side effect from being a "newbie" here; I know the guy who started the article is new at this, and I only joined in because I didn't realize that RateItAll didn't have an article up here. Actually, it never occurred to me to look until I found out he was writing one. Unfortunately for him and the article, I myself also don't know anything about editing stuff on Wikipedia either, so now you've got something that's entered in by two newbies (his contribution more than mine by all means), and it's bound to be a rough article when you don't have any experience.</dd>

<dd>But, I digress; as a newbie here, the best means of telling what's "good" and "not good" is comparison. So, when I looked up an article on a similiar type of website, I tried to see what the difference was, in order to figure out what needs to be done to get it to be "acceptable". However, I am having difficulty discerning what the differences would be. Not to pick on them or anything, as I think the page is nice, but I'm trying to compare content in the epinions article (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinions" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinions" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinions</a>) with the content on the rateitall article. If you can point out what, as far as differences, the rateitall article needs to do to be "up to par" for wikipedia's standards, that would be very helpful in getting the page to be acceptable.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - the discussion here is to determine if the article meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, which considers neither Google hits nor Alexa ranking. You can argue about Google until you are blue in the face, but the closing admin will just ignore it. The nominator asserted that this article does not meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, but few of the keep comments above address that point.

<dd>Alrighty then: so we are not discussing Google. That's all right. Please consider the comments of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Battelle_55b7.html" title="John Battelle">John Battelle</a>, who is as reliable a source on the development of web technology as you are likely to find, who mentions RateItAll as a prime example of user-generated-content (<a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/002603.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://battellemedia.com/archives/002603.php" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>). We get <i>lots</i> of non-notable sites on Wikipedia promoted by their creators: RateItAll is not one of them. Look at the hits on the PC Magazine article, where RateItAll was the "site of the week". RIA is not another throwaway forum or vanity website, the type we delete every day. Please consider improving the article using reliable sources, and removing POV, rather than deleting it.

<dd>I've already pointed out on the rateitall talk page, and genghis's talk page that regardless of how reliable people think John Battelle is, there is no allowance in <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> made for allowing him as a source, he is neither a well known journalist or professional researcher, so the comments he makes in a blog cannot be used as a reliable source. In regards to its promoter, the owner of the site has visited and commented on this AfD and encouraged the individual who is the main writer of the article publicly on the site. Whether its promoted by the creator or by the creator through proxy, its basically the same thing.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 02:09, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Not a "well known journalist or professional researcher?" He published <i>the</i> bestselling book on Google; he's one of the founders of Wired Magazine; he's an expert on this stuff. Of course his comments are allowable as a source. Please use some common sense. And you claim that the PC Magazine review of the site is "trivial"? Huh? That's a dedicated article about the site. It's not a trivial passing mention at all.<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntandrus_af9e.html" title="User talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 03:29, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Its a description of its features, dedicated article or not. As far as Battelle goes, thank you for addressing that. I'd previously mentioned that I wasn't aware of him being a well known journalist and no one else bothered to defend it. If someone had bothered to point it out when I asked 2 days ago on the rateitall talk page it would have made it easier to verify this sites notability.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 03:33, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>John Battelle is an extremely well known journalist - along with Chris Anderson, I'd say he is one of two of the best known in the tech industry.</p>
