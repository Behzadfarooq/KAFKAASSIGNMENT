<li><b>Delete</b> The cries of discrimination against Asian companies (or any company outside the US or UK) say little about the notability of this application or this article, and besides, anyone who looks at <a href="../../../m/a/n/Category%7EManhwa_bdf1.html" title="Category:Manhwa">Category:Manhwa</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Category%7EManga_1537.html" title="Category:Manga">Category:Manga</a>, and <a href="../../../a/n/i/Category%7EAnime_6c0f.html" title="Category:Anime">Category:Anime</a> can't say that there's no room here for Asian content. Simply whining about perceived bias isn't enough - this entry has to stand on its own, and it does not. It reads like a sales brochure ("Our system provides...", "Our e-commerce module comes with..."), and if the consensus is 'keep' it's going to need a lot of cleanup. Anyone can nominate any article for deletion, and if you don't think an entry is notable you should nominate it for deletion and allow the community to decide by consensus. Notability is decided by the community, However, like it or not, this is the English Wikipedia. We can't use sources written in Thai, Korean, Chinese or Japanese to verify the claims made here because most of us don't read those languages. I'm sorry about that, but this version of Wikipedia is written in English. Besides, there are plenty of articles here that aren't in the Thai/Japanese/Chinese/Korean Wikipedias, and vice versa. Please stop accusing editors of not acting in <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">good faith</a>, because it doesn't help you or this debate. Instead, tell us why the article should stay in the English Wikipedia based on the merits and use of the product and only the product. There are more than 125,000 projects at SourceForge, so having SourceForge as a host isn't part of the notability criteria. I can't get wavelet.biz to load after trying three different browsers, so someone else needs to explain the notability of the site/app and where the claims can be verified – in English. <font color="darkblue"><b>Baseball,Baby!</b></font> <font color="red"><sup><i>balls</i></sup></font><font color="darkblue"><sup>•</sup></font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BaseballBaby_1aec.html" title="Special:Contributions/BaseballBaby"><font color="red"><sup><i>strikes</i></sup></font></a> 23:47, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree, but your actions are truly inappropriate and undermine your own cause. From looking at your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/58.71.254.145" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/58.71.254.145" rel="nofollow">contribution history</a>, we can see that you've done nothing to even attempt to improve the Wavelet.biz article. Instead, you've gone on the attack against seven other companies' articles, at least some of which are clearly better (both in terms of asserting notability and in terms of sourcing) than the Wavelet.biz article. There's still time for you to fix the Wavelet.biz article instead of trying to inflict as much collateral damage as possible. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 17:03, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Extend AfD period and add sources to the article</b>. The article appears to have been at least somewhat rewritten during the discussion, making it read more like an encyclopedia article and less like an advertisement. If I had to vote now, I'd still vote 'delete', because it's still missing one critical piece -- sources, other than the project's own website, to establish notability. A flood of folks have shown up to defend the article. I would highly encourage those people to use their knowledge of the product to find neutral, verifiable, preferably-English-language sources that establish the project's notability, and quickly add those sources to the article. I don't know if procedure allows for it, but I'd like to see them given every chance to do this. (I know that AfDs are occasionally extended for a few days if there's no consensus, which seems to be the case here.) <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 16:56, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I would dispute that there is no concensus here. Many of the keeps do not list valid reasons or refute the arguements of the people who have voted for delete. Remember, it is the strength of the arguements, not the strength of the numbers. At this time it looks like Delete is the concensus and nothing about the article (as of this post) has changed to refute those claims. Another thing to remember about the AfD process, (right from <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>) <i>Unregistered or new users are welcome to contribute to the discussion, but their recommendations may be discounted, especially if they seem to be made in bad faith (for example, if they misrepresent their reasons). Conversely, the opinions of logged in users whose accounts predate the article's AfD nomination are given more weight.</i> Beyond all that this still falls into being "unencyclopedic" (violates <a href="../../../e/n/c/WP%7EENC_e8ee.html" title="WP:ENC">WP:ENC</a>). --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 17:55, 16 August 2006 (UTC) <small>I got to slow down.

I could see some sockpuppets and meatpuppets too. Overall, lets move forward, and see if the articles could be improved.

<li><b>Comment</b> While I respect that, your arguement is weak in the face of the matter that Wikipedia does not keep articles based on if they are interesting or not. <i>Wikipedia's three content policies are Wikipedia:Verifiability and Wikipedia:No original research and Wikipedia:Neutral point of view. Jointly, these policies determine the type and quality of material that is acceptable in the main namespace. Because the three policies are complementary, they should not be interpreted in isolation from one another, and editors should therefore try to familiarize themselves with all three. <b>These three policies are non-negotiable and cannot be superseded by other policies or guidelines, or by editors' consensus</b></i> So if you believe it should be kept, please provide a reason that these pillars of the wiki community should be put asside for this one article.--<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 19:31, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> In practice, Google testing also winds up being subjective, because Google itself has certain selection biases that need to be accounted for. Measures of Google pagerank often wind up measuring "How much has this web site owner done to optimize his or her Google ranking?" as much or more as "How notable is this web site?" Leaving that aside, <a href="../../../m/a/d/Made2Manage_Systems_39b9.html" title="Made2Manage Systems">Made2Manage Systems</a>, an article you nominated for deletion (in your only other apparent contribution to Wikipedia), also rates a 5 on your proposed test. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 15:23, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This is your <i>third</i> "Keep" 'vote' posted to this AfD, not counting any anonymous entries you may have made. And the list of invitees on that page includes such entries as "Tertiary Student Project - Multi-player Mobile Game - Chinese Chess". It would appear that Singapore's invitation criteria for this event were, shall we say, not particularly stringent. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 15:23, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> It indicates that the competition is very complete, and it is open for different categories, from financial applications to business applications, and there are categories for students. If Wavelet.biz represents the student category, then it is not worthy, but Wavelet.biz was representing the business/industrial application categories. Do not confuse the readers with the participants in one category from the other. Also, Singapore government is well known for its government efficiencies, policies and competitiveness. Accusing the Singapore government of not doing their job, just to bring out the point that Wavelet.biz is not worthy of wikipedia because Singapore government is not doing their job may not be the best thing to do. For the record, I am a Singaporean, and feel disturbed by the statement above, and sorry for my fellow countrymen. Singapore may be a small country in terms of size and population. But please do not insult us, Singapore as not serious in running our own country.

<li><b>Comment</b> My statement was certainly not an insult to Singapore. It was simply a statement that Singapore, like any other country, may run events or contests for participants of various levels of achievement and notability. Thank you for clarifying the nature of the contest, which was not clear from the source. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 03:38, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Wavelet.biz is recognized by Singapore Government and Singapore IT Federation, and represented Singapore in 2004 to participate in Asia ICT Awards in HK (year 2004).

<p>Wavelet.biz was selected and represented Malaysia to China to promote Malaysia ICT products and services.

<li><b>Comment</b> You already mentioned the Asia ICT Awards invitation, and I already replied. Unfortunately, the csia.org.cn article you link is not in English, making it difficult to determine what selection criteria were used. And RedHat application profiles are provided by the application writers, meaning that they are frequently self-promotional, and a listing does not mean that the product is important or well-known or widely-distributed. I appreciate you trying to find English-language sources; I just want to point out the problems with the sources you have provided. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 15:23, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> I've strucken out the extra 'votes' by Annietan and also slapped that SPA tag on their posts. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 18:15, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have to point out a striking thing about this debate: despite the volume of comments encouraging that the article be kept, <i>every single one of them</i> -- except for my own "quick, fix the darn article" comment -- has come either from an anon account or from what appears to be a single-purpose registered user account. In an AfD that superficially appears to have a volume of supporters on both sides, that's extraordinary. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 03:46, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Facts vs Consensus</b> <b>Remove</b> From what I see, in the interest of the wikipedia's editors' interest, it is better to remove Wavelet.biz. Since the primary users of the Wikipedia are wikipedia editors, facts are refuted, and subjective accusations, and "feelings" are taken into considerations. Pretty much like a war on who is more expert in creating some sort of SPA, to bring down the reputation of Wavelet.biz. Basically objective reference are discounted. Subjective comments are counted. Similar projects in wikipedia are kept, but Wavelet.biz is attacked by experienced wikipedia editors to play reverse psychology by creating sockpuppets etc. Articles that look like advertisements are kept, and article that state facts are removed. In order for the best interest of wikipedia, this discussion page itself should be removed forever, so that it does not affect the reputation of wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In summary, by removing the article, Wikipedian editors with limited exposure and knowledge would be happy. A community project like Wavelet.biz continues without being affected. Governments in south east asia will not be insulted. Other sockpuppets created by similar projects to bring down the Wavelet.biz wins. So, I would vote for <b>Remove</b> or <b>Delete</b>. Everyone is happy. Marcussua 04:54, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. You seem to be perceiving this as a referendum on your own worth as a person and the worth of several countries, and perceiving the actions of everyone else in that light. Unfortunately, the premise is simply false, and as a result your perceptions of others' behavior are misdirected. Wikipedia's concept of "notability" does not equal "moral worth", it never has, it never will, and it is not intended to.
