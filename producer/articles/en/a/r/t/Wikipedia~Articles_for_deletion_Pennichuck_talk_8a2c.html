<li><b>Delete</b> As someone attending the high school in which this "phenomenon" is "taking hold", I can say first-hand that this is by far not noteworthy enough to be on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> If one knows "Mike" one will know that he infact does attend this high school, but that the claims he makes are an attack to discredit and destroy an article that has not even had a chance to firmly plant its feet on the ground. Within 10 minutes of being created it was on the table for deletion, and while many in the wikipedia community may see that as a victory I see it as a shame - a shame that new ideas cannot be expressed or shared with the rest of the world. All I implore is that this article is allowed to remain active for more than five days so that those who have made this dialect so famous can voice their opinions and show that this article is "Notable" - <a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmack-nhn_f235.html" title="User:Smack-nhn">Smack-nhn</a> 02:49, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I will take that as a backhanded compliment. Look, it's nice to have something catch on and I don't doubt that your group has done that. But I had a History of the English Language professor who swore up and down that her family invented the word "crud" in 1955, and there is no way she would consider it inclusive as she admits there is no proof. That's from an person who knows language and dialect. Now, if I'm sitting down here in Tennessee and in six months to two years I hear this, then I will support. The point of the editors is that a few thousand teens (or adults) in New Hampshire are simply not notable. Myspace is a place to rally trends, not Wikipedia. By all means look over this place and the links pointed out, and become a serious editor. We take it seriously because there are several hundred <a href="../../../n/e/w/Special%7ENewpages_26cd.html" title="Special:Newpages">new pages</a> everyday that have to be filtered. I am here because I love history and English, but my job is not in the field so it's a nice way to relax for me.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Pennichuck Talk is not simply a local-Interest or a small scale dialect. It is a phenomenon that is starting to take hold throught the city of Nashua and the Region of Southern New Hampshire. Due to the increased networking of young adults in today's society - what may seem as insignificant or "un-notable" can very quickly become a national trend. By killing this article before it even starts, you are in effect killing the documentation of a dialect of the english language. Already, we here in Southern New Hampshire are seeing increased use of this "talk" among young adults from other schools through interaction in sports, clubs, and other extra-cirricular activity. The fact that it has spawned use by thousands of people after originally being born from a select few shows that this dialect Demands Notation - in a few short years it has firestormed and simply deleting it because it hasn't reached you yet is killing a part of our culture. A part of our culture that could reach you in a few years. If this site is all about spreading information and breaking borders, why is there censorship on what is percieved to be "Not-Notable" material.smack-nhn 30 March 2006</li>

<li><b>do not delete</b> honestly, at first I would have agreed with you. but after reading the article, i was so enlightened! People who live in Nashua actually really need this to be here. contrary to popular belief, this is more than a few kids making up stuff. this is one of those things that will spread like wildfire as did the use of awkward. I say ohp and I didnt even realize it was pennichuck talk. Now I can recognize it when I hear it.
