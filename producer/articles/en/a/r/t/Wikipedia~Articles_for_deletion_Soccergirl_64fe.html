<p><b>Notability definition: A notable, or remarkable, person or thing; a person of note.</b> Soccergirl has 165 shows, updated twice or three times a week since March of 2005. She has inspired many other podcasters and is considered among podcasting's pioneers. She has been nominated for a podcast award in the Mature category <a href="http://www.podcastconnect.com/archive/podcast_awards/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.podcastconnect.com/archive/podcast_awards/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> for two years in a row (other than Dawn and Drew, the only one who was) Her name is known by anyone notable in the field. 165 episodes and worldwide recognition is a little more important than eating 6 cans of beans.

<li><b>Dont Delete!!!!</b> Soccergirl incoporated gives me something to look forward to every week, listening to her podcast had changed my life. I feel more relaxed and enjoy life so much more. I chat under the user "thenintendofreak" soccergirl is a well known podcaster among the podcasting community, with her awsome beats and stories that are just so creative in nature. Soccergirl is right up there with the greats of podcasting along with dawn and drew, geekbrief with cali lewis, not too many people can say they get paid to podcast. Yeah she shows her boobs sometimes but theres much more too soccergirl incorporated then just listeners and podcasters its friendship too, she is the worlds first bathcaster. for one she has inspired me to do my own podcast. Soccergirl doesnt judge and deserves her spot in history, listen for you self, she always keeps it interesting. I wish i could be ryan p(soccergirls boyfriend) you wont find a kinder podcaster not even dawn and drew can top that.Richw53149 00:08, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment about references in press</b> We need to look critically at this. The mentions of Soccergirl are completely incidental to the articles they appear in - for heaven's sake, if that kind of "press coverage" qualifies one as notable for wikipedia, I will create an article for myself and several of my friends - none of us are notable, but we've all had passing references made to us and quotes attributed to us in national and even international press... --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyDancer_ed0c.html" title="User:SandyDancer">SandyDancer</a> 10:25, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep &amp; Wikify</b> Normally I would say delete on something like this, but after checking the sources I have to say it meets notability and verifiability criteria, though barely. To Sandydance: Normally I'd agree with you, but the press coverage in this case comes from major sources, the NYT and Reuters are not small and tend to cover only more mainstream, notable things. Furthermore, the sources carry the common theme of being a sort of introduction to the concept of podcasting to the general public which is precisely the type of article in which there'd be name drops of the most notable, paradigm-type examples of the subject matter. The fact she's appeared in numerous articles of this type is further in her favor. I must admit, however, that the sockpuppets weren't a help. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 10:42, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I cannot agree with <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a>'s rationale. Mainstream press coverage can be used to gauge notability, if the coverage is specifically about the topic at issue. This, by the way, is not necessarily grounds for notability, despite the apparently irresistible view here that if it finds its way into the NYT, it gets an article on WP (see <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hal_the_Central_Park_Coyote_3180.html" title="Hal the Central Park Coyote">Hal the Central Park Coyote</a>, a peculiar memento mori that exists ONLY thanks to this conflation between press coverage and notability). We need to be more intellectually energetic, critical and engaged in determining whether a topic is notable enough for inclusion, rather than arrogate that responsibility to the chance decision made by a deadline-stressed reporter looking to use one or another example to illustrate a point. I know that press coverage is crawling over our guidelines for inclusion, but we need to apply common sense in using that as a criterion. As in this case, press mention does not on its own confer notability. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 11:34, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment--staying with delete</b> I do not see the articles themselves as nontrivial. A mere mention by reuters or NYTimes is not sufficient to meet "non-trivial." <a href="../../../d/l/o/User_talk%7EDlohcierekim_2338.html" title="User talk:Dlohcierekim"><b>Cheers, <font color="#009500">:) Dlohcierekim</font></b></a> 15:51, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Normally I'd agree with all of you, however I feel that the fact that multiple sources have all chosen to use this particular blog as an example implies notability. If it was just the NYT then I'd say delete. Yet, it seems like an awfully big coincidence that many sources choose this particular blog, when theres thousands upon thousands of blogs out there. Indeed, I doubt its coincidence and I feel its more likely that this is seen as a paradigm example in the media's coverage of blogs. However, if the consensus is to delete then that is fine; I do recognize that the notability here isn't fully clear. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 20:43, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
