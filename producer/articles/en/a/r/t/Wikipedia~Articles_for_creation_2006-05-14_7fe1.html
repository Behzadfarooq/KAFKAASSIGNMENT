<p>Cairns Newspapers publishes three independent monthly suburban newspapers in Cairns, Australia.</p>
<p>Cairns Northern News, Cairns Bulletin and Southern Herald circulate Cairns from Palm Cove in the north to Gordonvale in the south. The publications are distributed free mid month to residences, libraries, newsagencies, tourist destinations, businesses and outdoor venues where the community shops, meets and greets.</p>
<p>Cairns Newspapers carry a lively mix of local, state, national and world news, arts &amp; entertainment , columnists, opinion, blogs, real estate, classifieds, community notice boards, sports, etc.</p>
<p>Cairns Northern News has been in print for over ten years, meeting the informational needs of the people who live in the Cairns northern beaches. The newspaper went through an ownership change in 2002. CCN Pty Ltd was formed, it purchased the Cairns Northern News and released Cairns Bulletin which covers the centre of Cairns and the Southern Herald covering the south of Cairns. It also created <a href="http://www.cnnet.net.au/" class="external text" title="http://www.cnnet.net.au/" rel="nofollow">CCNet</a> and <a href="http://www.cairnsnewspapers.com.au/" class="external text" title="http://www.cairnsnewspapers.com.au/" rel="nofollow">Cairns Newspapers</a> an electronic news site.</p>
<p><br />
During the past decade the city of Cairns has enjoyed a steady population growth of 2% annually, thus the newspaper's penetration of households has increased. Cairns residents say Cairns Newspapers one their primary source for independent news and information.</p>
<p>Although Cairns Newspapers don't foresee the Internet replacing the newspaper, they recognise that the electronic newspaper is becoming bigger every day. Cairns Newspapers are the first newspapers in Cairns to have an electronic newspaper presence on the Internet serving as a portal to the city of Cairns.</p>

<p>The bread ball is, as the name suggests, a ball of bread. After a loaf of bread has been baked, a person can take a few slices, remove the crust and squish the bread into a ball form. Individuals will then eat the bread in the ball form, like an apple. As it is squished together, starch in the bread is much denser and it taste much sweeter as higher concentrations, of starch, are digested in the mouth. The mouth's saliva breaks down the starch into sugars which is the cause for a more concentrated sweetness versus regular bread eating.</p>

<p>With an increasing population, water usage by human populations has also increased. Such an increase leads to deteriorating quality in many water sources, that have shrunk in proportion to the water removed for use. This also results in vast areas of land, becoming subject to increased water stress and desertification, though this is arguably a result of global trends and climate change. What is evident is that water is being used in many areas faster than it can be replenished by natural means (e.g. for irrigation, sanitation, drinking). This means many ground water levels have continued to drop, aquifiers and wells are exhausted, lakes and ponds 'dry up' and streams and rivers shrink significantly in size, some to the point of non existence. Such scarcity results in a range of environmental and social concerns.</p>

<p>The Sonic World (TSW for Short) is a up and raising Sonic The Hedgehog Fan created series which is has a pseudo base on the hit TV Show 'Sonic The Hedgehog' by DIC, But in no way linked with the Comic 'Sonic The Hedgehog' printed by Archie Comics which was another thing based on the same show.</p>
<p>Most of the Episodes which run as part of the 26 Episode run are offically Cannon for this show but mostly have been changed to include comments on Fan Created Characters which appear in the TSW Series. The Show then comes into force as it carrys on as a 'Third Series' for the 2 Series run of Sonic the Hedgehog (13 episodes in each).</p>
<p>TSW first started with a few small Writen 'Fan Fic' storys which were re-writen into still small volumes. In 2004 an 4 part- half Hour Audio Drama was created and this launched TSW more then before. Since then, a Short Animated Episode Pilot 'TSWA' (The Sonic World Animated) was created as well as a Short series of Short musical Episodes showcasing different character historys. As Of late last year, a Short Series 'The Adventures of Mighty and Ray' was created to introduce classic Sonic Characters of 'Mighty' and 'Ray' into the TSW World along with a new character 'Valaria'. This characters are rumoured to re-appear in one of the current In Production Projects. At the Moment, a 10 Episode Series of TSWA is in Production as well as a Computer Game.</p>

<p>TSW was created by Two people Living in Hastings, England. Manic Man and Bluedude. They were School friends and big Fans of Sonic from a young age. As they grew up, they have been able to use skills they learnt to carry on and make there 'storys' and ideas into a full series. Though Bluedude has started his Name online, Manic seams to prefer not to give out much detail on his real life name, saying that 'it doesn't matter, it's the storys that count'. Though Bluedude hasn't been seen to do much on the series, Manic has always claimed that he is a major help on the project.</p>

<p>A Number of New Characters were introduce into TSW. Some are Completely new Characters, some have bases in already created Characters and some are new takes on Classic Characters.</p>
<p><b>Manic Man Hedgehog-</b> Although sharing the name with the Nickname of TSW Co-Creater, Manic was the first new wave of Characters for TSW. He is a Green Hedgehog which came from 'Lower Mobuis' and after a shaky start, joined the Freedom Fighters. Though Smarter then Sonic, he isn't as Smart as many and has been used as a character to help explain things to the viewers, for Scenes where Sonic isn't around. Most of his time is spent being tormented my Female 'Amical Nett', and shares a friendy enermy tie with Whirlwind Hedgehog, created by other TSW Co-created 'Bluedude'.</p>
<p><b>Amical Nett-</b> Amical Nett is a Young Brown Cat (Created has quoted as say she is a 'Mobuion Comman Brown') which joined the cast after being saved by Sonic The Hedgehog and Sally Acorn. She also came from Lower Mobuis and in the TSW Short 'A Manic life' it was show that she started off feeling Sorry for Manic, but this grew into a Major Crush. She Shared a Hut with Amy Rose.</p>
<p><b>Tiara Bobowski-</b> Although not a Completely New Character, Tiara is though as a New TSW Character. She was Oringal created for the Canceled game 'Sonic X-treme'. Only 1 Offical Image of the character was none to have been created and he design was taken from this. The Character Colours were created by Co-Created Manic Man and a few others. Later the Offical Colour design was found out in an Interview with Game Producer, but Manic has said this colour set up will never be used. Tiara is shown as being very shy after spending most of her life along with only a Computer for friendship but some of the others have been trying to 'help' her out.</p>
<p><b>Whirlwind Hedgehog-</b> This Character was created along time ago with Co-Creater 'Bluedude' was a kid and bought into TSW. Whirlwind is the Son of Sir Charles Hedgehog, which makes him a cosion to Sonic The Hedgehog. At a Young age he was kidnapped and returned when older. The Story meant to explain all this (Whirlwind's Story) has been in pre-production for almost 10 years, way before TSW was even created.</p>
<p><b>Valaria Renard-</b> Valaria is the Main 'Bad Guy' of the Mighty and Ray Mini-Series. Not too much about the character history is given in the show but she is shown to be very smart and carefully plans out her actions.</p>

<p>WKAG, known as "TV-43" to locals, is an independently owned television station located in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. Although it is considered part of the Nashville, Tennessee DMA, its broadcasting range is much smaller than that, reaching primarily Christian County, Trigg County, Logan County, Caldwell County, and Muhlenberg County within Kentucky and the greater Clarksville area in Tennessee. While in early years it was primarily a Hopkinsville/Ft Campbell station occasionally featuring news from the outlying counties, today WKAG has refocused on Clarksville, Tn, where the station has a greater potential for advertising revenue growth. This change is evident by their attempts to change the station's commonly used name to "TV-3" (3 is the channel where the station can be viewed by Clarksville cable watchers--without cable it is viewable on the 43 UHF bandwidth, hence the original name) and by splitting their newscast ("Newswatch") into two portions--one exclusively broadcasting local Kentucky news and the other Clarksville, Tn news only. Despite this change, "TV-43" remains the commonly used appelation with viewers today.</p>
<p>A small station, WKAG has served as a jumping ground for many reporters and producers to advance their careers, although many employees do leave the business, as is typical with entry-level newsrooms. Famous former employees include Jill Baffert, wife of Kentucky Derby winning horse owner, Bob Baffert; Barry Gresham, a television production professor for Tennessee Tech University; and WBIR Knoxville, Tn anchor Beth Haynes (of the popular "Where's Beth?" segment).</p>
<p>Previously owned by the Kentucky New Era newspaper located next door, the station now belongs to Eddie Owen, long time general manager and current Newswatch anchor.

<p>The <a href="../../../e/l/b/Elbe.html" title="Elbe">Elbe</a> Cycle Route is part of an international network of cyling routes all over Europe. It is integrated in the system of currently 37 river cycling routes in Germany and by far the most popular route for cyclist in this country.</p>
<p>The Elbe Cycle Route starts in Prague on the Moldau, which joins with the Elbe river about 50 km from Prague. It then runs for about 980 km until it ends in Cuxhaven at the North Sea.</p>
<p>After a failry adventurous part of the Route on the Czech side of the river one reaches the famous Elb Sandstone Mountains and crosses the border to Germany. Shortly after this the Route leads through <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dresden.html" title="Dresden">Dresden</a> and later through other cities like <a href="../../../m/e/i/Mei%C3%9Fen.html" title="Meißen">Meißen</a>, Lutherstadt <a href="../../../w/i/t/Wittenberg.html" title="Wittenberg">Wittenberg</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/s/Dessau.html" title="Dessau">Dessau</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magdeburg.html" title="Magdeburg">Magdeburg</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tangerm%C3%BCnde.html" title="Tangermünde">Tangermünde</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/u/Lauenburg.html" title="Lauenburg">Lauenburg</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamburg.html" title="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/x/Cuxhaven.html" title="Cuxhaven">Cuxhaven</a>.</p>
<p>There are many small villages with old churches and other interesting sites along the way. A lot of restaurants and pensions offer their service to the weary after a day of cycling.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons however for its popularity is probably the fact that there are no significant level changes from Dresden on. It is practically downhill all the way from Dresden to Cuxhaven.</p>
<p>The Elbe Cycling Route is marked throughout Germany with a special sign.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-14_7fe1.html" title="Edit section: 10 Tips That Make Sense, When Buying Scents by Alison Blackman Dunham">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">10 Tips That Make Sense, When Buying Scents by Alison Blackman Dunham</span></h2>
<p>Here are the top 10 fragrance tips from Alison Blackman Dunham, author, and creator of the Advice Sister "What Works" monthly beauty, fashion and cosmetics reviews. These will help consumers narrow the choices, and make a wise one.</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify the type of fragrance. The basic types are: Floral (flowers); Fruity (fruits); Fougere (grassy, green, herbal); Oriental (incense, spices, exotics); Chypre (woods, earthy) and Oceanic (synthetics meant to evoke a particular feeling such as: ocean, sand, rain, fabric)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Don’t judge a scent just by how it smells in the bottle. Perfumes have top, middle and bottom notes–ingredients blended together to givea first impression. It must actually be worn on the skin, to know how it will smell, hour after hour.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Resist Trends: Not all scents work equally well with an individual’s body chemistry. Even if something is trendy this year, such as chocolate or green tea, it might not smell wonderful on everyone. Trends are here today and gone in an instant. Scent is an investment so choose wisely.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Fragrance The basic scent forms are: Perfume (most expensive, because it contains the largest amount of distilled essential oils and is very concentrated–use sparingly). Cologne and Eau de Toilette (often called “toilet water”))and solid fragrances (less expensive than perfume and less concentrated); Body Splash (even less concentrated); Bath &amp; Body Gels, Body Lotions &amp; Creams, Candles, Potpourri, Aroma Sticks, and Room Sprays</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Fragrance is not meant to be smelled across the room, but when others are up close.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Seasons Change and so should scent. The weather, moods, and each person's overall body chemistry will affect a scent. Lighter fragrances are generally the best bet during the warmer months, heavier scents are best for the cooler ones and special occasions. It’s best to have one scent for each of the four seasons: Winter, Spring, Summer &amp; Fall.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Fragrance is an investment. Scent, like wine or anything with organic ingredients in it, can “turn” or fade over time. Fragrance should be stored in cool, dry places away from the sun. Some people even store their fragrances in the refrigerator when the mercury, rises.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Money Matters: In general, the more expensive fragrances include more expensive and exotic ingredients and they’re blended by skilled experts. The less expensive scents may be less complex, but that doesn’t mean that all modestly priced scents are no good. Experimentation is key, as ofthen thesame “notes” (key ingredients) in an expensive fragrance may be repeated in another, less costly one (although it won’t be quite the same, either).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Get a sample! It is best not to overwhelm, trying too many samples all at once. The best way to buy since is to get a sample to try later,and let the scent stay on your body a few hours before purchasing it. This is especially important for anyone with sensitive skin</li>
</ul>
<p>HOW TO BUY A GIFT OF FRAGRANCE FOR SOMEONE ELSE:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider Personality &amp; Lifestyle: Do they wear fragrance at all? If so, give them something in the same range or get a home scent instead. Are they casual, stay at home, or do they work in an office all day? And, give them the license to return a fragrance if they truly dislike it. Fragrance is a personal gift and you shouldn’t obligate someone to wear something they don’t like (or that reacts with their skin). On a budget? If money is really tight, forgo the perfume and get a candle, scented soap, or moisturizer, instead</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-14_7fe1.html" title="Edit section: Dutch Whist">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dutch Whist</span></h2>
<p>A whist game similar to 'Oh Hell', but with an added twist.</p>
<p>Number of Players: minimum 2, maximum 7, optimum 3 - 5 players.</p>
<p>The aim of the game is to score the most points by being the player to most accurately predict the number of 'tricks' that he / she will win in each round. To play the game you need a pack of ordinary playing cards and a score sheet. The score sheet should have the following rows -</p>
<p>Heart 1; Club 2; Diamond 3; Spade 4; Heart 5; Club 6; Diamond 7; <b>Solitaire 7; Misery 7; Spade Blinds 7</b>; Heart 7; Club 6; Diamond 5; Spade 4; Heart 3; Club 2; Diamond 1. The suit in each row indicates which suit is trump in that round. The number in each row indicates the number of cards to be dealt to each player (their hand) in that round (17 rounds in total). <i>Notice that the number of cards in a hand increases in the first seven rounds (1,2,3,4,5,6,7), stays static at 7 tricks in the Special rounds (the middle three) then decreases back to one in the last 7 rounds.</i> The rows in bold are the three special rounds (Solitaire, Misery, Blinds). Notice, only Blinds has a suit indicated to be trumps.</p>
<p>The score sheet should also have 3 columns for each player - one to record the 'bid', one to record the 'score' for each round, and one to record the running 'total'.</p>
<p>The Rules</p>
<p>The rules of the game are quite simple if you are used to normal whist.</p>
<p>After the cards have been dealt, the player to the left of the dealer begins by predicting how many tricks he / she thinks they will win in that round. The number of tricks available is equal to the number of cards dealt to each player. After the first player has bid, the player to their left also bids on how many tricks they think they will win, and so on, until it is the dealers turn. The dealer must not bid in such a way so that the total number of bids matches the number of tricks available. e.g. It is round 5. 5 cards have been dealt to each player Player 1 bids that they will win 2 tricks Player 2 bids that they will win 1 trick Dealer CANNOT bid to win 2. They must either bid that they will win 0, 1, 3, 4, or 5 tricks.</p>
<p>Play commences like in usual whist. Each round has a suit that is Trumps, which top all other suits. The trumps suit in each round is shown on the score sheet.</p>
<hr />
<p>Playing a trick</p>
<p>The player to the left of the dealer chooses any card from their hand to play. The player on their left also plays a card, any card they choose, but THEY MUST FOLLOW SUIT, if they can. And so on - each player putting one card in until every player has played on card. All players must follow the suit played by the first player if they can. The player who has laid the highest card in the suit played by the first player wins the trick. In Dutch Whist, Aces are high. However, a trump can be laid if a player cannot follow suit. If one or more trumps are laid then the person who has played the highest trump wins.</p>
<p>E.g. 1. Hearts are trumps Player 1 lays a Jack of Spades Player 2 lays a Queen of spades Player 3 lays a 3 of Spades</p>
<p>Player 2 wins the trick.</p>
<p>E.g. 2. Hearts are trumps Player 1 lays a Ace of Spades Player 2 lays a 5 of Spades Player 3 lays a 4 of Hearts</p>
<p>Player 3 wins the trick.</p>
<p>The player who plays the highest card wins the trick. They get to lay the first card in the next trick in that round. The person to the left of the dealer in the previous round becomes the dealer in the next round.</p>
<p>Play continues in this fashion, until reaching the special rounds.</p>
<hr />
<p>Scoring</p>
<p>At the end of the round, the number of tricks won by each player is compared to their bid. E.g. Player 1 had bid that they will win 2 tricks - and they won 3, therefore they lost their bid. Player 2 had bid that they will win 1 trick - and won 1 trick, winning their bid. Player 3 (Dealer) bid before play that they would win 3 tricks, and won 2, loosing their bid.</p>
<p>In this case, players 1 and 3 would score 1 point for each trick they won. Player 2 would score 1 point for the trick won, and gain 10 points for a correct bid. A player gains 10 points for a correct bid, regardless (even if the bid was nil).</p>
<hr />
<p>There are three extra rounds in Dutch Whist compared to Oh Hell.</p>
<p>These are the special rounds</p>
<p>Solitaire In this round, each player is dealt 7 cards. No bids are made. No suit is trumps. Tricks are played for as before. <b>Players score 5 points for each trick won.</b></p>
<p>Misery In this round, each player is dealt 7 cards. No bids are made. No suit is trumps. Tricks are played for as before. <b>Players loose 5 points for each trick won.</b></p>
<p>Blinds In this round, each player is dealt 7 cards. <b>Before looking at their cards, players put in their bid.</b> Spades are trumps and Tricks are played for as before. Scores are based on the bids made 'blinds' and are awarded points as in the rest of the game (10 points for a correct bid, 1 point for each trick won).</p>
<p>Play continues as before, with the number of cards dealt to each player decreasing by one with each round.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>Strategy</p>
<p>Dutch Whist played well involves a lot of strategy. The hardest part is in predicting how many tricks you will win in each round, and if loosing, what the best outcome will be with the cards in your hand. Games can be won by spoiling another’s bid.</p>
<p>The special rounds in the middle part of the game, add an extra element of random to normal whist, as scores can be wiped out, go into minus figures, or propel the person loosing to the top of the score board.</p>

<p>A nondescript, alienated man named Clay Loudermilk observes a bizarre, supposedly pornographic film which features a woman he finds hauntingly familiar. He begins a sort of quest to find this woman and encounters only the bizarre and frightful. Clay bonds with Tina, a freakish fish-potato-woman, but manages to incur the wrath of mysterious figures (responsible for the film) who assign a hairy, shirtless assassin to dispatch him. Clay's life spirals further into horror and tragedy, and none of the answers he finds are in any way satisfying. A vaguely omniscient folksinger figure concludes the story with a performance of "Barbara Allen."</p>

<p>In <i>Pinkerton v. United States</i>, 328 U.S. 640 (1946) two brothers entered into a conspiracy to defraud the IRS. Both brothers were indicted for conspiracy and for ten substantive offenses. Both brothers were convicted of substantive offenses even though one of the borthers was in prison for an unrelated offense during the time the substantive offenses were committed. The Supreme Court affirmed the convictions holding that a co-conspirator can be convicted of any substnative offense committed by a co-conspirator in furtherance of the conspiracy, as long as he shares the <i>mens rea</i> for the underlying conspiracy. Thus <b>Pinkerton Liability</b> denotes the extensive liability possible from participation in a conspiracy, which is notoriously easier to prove (hearsay testimony permissible).</p>
<p>Many jurisdictions reject Pinkerton liability, notably the Model Penal Code, §2.06(3), which requires the prosecution to meet the stricter requirements of accomplice liability (purpose with respect to aiding in the commission of the crime) for each substantive offense, though the agreement itself may be used as evidence.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-14_7fe1.html" title="Edit section: Cardinal Juan De Lugo">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Cardinal Juan De Lugo</span></h2>
<p>Spanish Jesuit and Cardinal, one of the most eminent theologians of modern times, b. at Madrid, November, 1583, though he used to call himself "Hispalensis", because his family seat was at Seville; d. at Rome, 20 August, 1660. Both his father, John de Lugo, and his mother, Teresa de Quiroga, whose family name he bore for a time, as was custom for the second son, were of noble birth. Such was de Lugo's intellectual precocity that at the age of three years he could read printed or written books; at ten, he received the tonsure; at fourteen he defended a public thesis in logic, and at about the same time was appointed by Philip II to an ecclesiastical benefice which he retained until his solemn profession in 1618. Like his elder brother Francis, he was sent be his father to the University of Salamanca to study law; but Francis having entered the Society of Jesus where he became a distinguished theologian, John soon desired to imitate him and, having vainly asked his father's permission, in two letters, entered without it in 1603. After completing his studies he was appointed professor of philosophy at Medina del Campo, in 1611, and later of theology at Valladolid, where he taught for five years. His fame as a professor of theology attracted the attention of the General of the Jesuits, Mutius Vitelleschi, and de Lugo was summoned to Rome, where he arrived early in June, 1621.</p>
<p>The teaching of de Lugo at Rome was brilliant; his lectures even before being printed were spread by copyists in other countries. When the General of the Society ordered him to print his works, he obeyed and without help had the material for the first three volumes prepared within five years (1633, 1636, 1638). When the fourth volume, "De justitia et jure", was about to be published, his superiors thought it proper that he should dedicate it to Urban VIII; he had to present it himself to the pope, who was so much surprised and delighted by the theologian's learning that he frequently consulted him, and in 1643, created him a cardinal. This put an end to de Lugo's teaching; but several of his works were published after 1643. As Cardinal, he took part in the congregations of the Holy Office, of the Council, etc., and often had occasion to place his learning at the service of the Church. He died age seventy-seven, being assisted by Cardinal Sforza Pallavicini, one of his most devoted disciples, also a Jesuit. According to his wish, he was buried near the tomb of St. Ignatius that "his heart might rest where his treasure was", as is said in his epitaph. De Lugo was a man not only of great learning, but also of great virtue; obedience alone induced him to publish his works, and he always retained the simplicity and humility which had led him to refuse, but for the pope's order, the cardinalitial dignity; the fine carriage sent by Cardinal Barberini to bring him as a cardinal to the pope's palace, he called his hearse. His generosity to the poor was very great, and although his income was small, he daily distributed among them bread, money, and even remedies, such as quinquina, then newly discovered, which the people at Rome used for a time to call Lugo's powder.</p>
<p>The works of John de Lugo, some of which have never been printed, cover nearly the whole field of moral and dogmatic theology. The first volume, "De Incarnatione Domini" (Lyons, 1633), of which the short preface is well worth reading to get an idea of de Lugo's method, came out in 1633. It was followed by "De sacramentis in genere;" "De Venerabili Eucharistiæ Sacramento et de sacrosancto Missæ sacrificio" (Lyons, 1636); "De Virtute et Sacramento poenitentiæ, de Suffragiis et Indulgentiis" (Lyons, 1638); and "De justitia et jure" (Lyon, 1642), the work on which de Lugo's fame especially rests. In composition of this important treatise, he was greatly aided by his knowledge of law acquired in his younger days at Salamanca, and it was this work which he dedicated and presented to the pope in person and which may be said to have gained for him a cardinal's hat. De Lugo wrote to other works: "De virtuto fidei divinæ" (Lyon, 1646), and "Responsorum morialum libri sex" (Lyon, 1651), published by his former pupil and friend, Cardinal Sforza Pallavicini. In these six books de Lugo gives, after thorough discussion, the solution of many difficult cases in moral theology; this work has a very high value both from a theoretical and practical standpoint, as in the main it consists of questions proposed to him for solutions over long years. The seventh volume, "De Deo, de Angelis, de Actibus humanis et de Gratia" (Cologne, 1716), was published over fifty years after the author's death; the idea, as we find it expressed on the title page, was to complete his printed course of lectures. Other works on theology and especially on philosophy: "De Anima", "Philosophia", "Logica", "De Trinitate", "De Visione Dei", etc. are still preserved in manuscripts in the libraries of Madrid, Salamanca, Karlsruhe, Mechlin, etc.</p>
<p>Among the unprinted works, the analysis of Arnauld's book, "De frequenti Communione" and the "Memorie del conclave d'Innocenzo X: Riposta al discorso . . . che le corone hanno jus d'eschiudere li cardinali del Pontificato" may be of special interest; they are the only controversial works of Lugo. What he intended in his writings was not to give a long treatise, exhaustive from every point of view; he wished only "to open up a small river, to the ocean", without relating what others had said before him and without giving a series of opinions of previous writers or furnishing authors or quotations in number; he aimed at adding what he had found from his own reflection and deep meditation on each subject. Other important features of his theological conceptions are the union he always maintains between moral and dogmatic theology, the latter being the support of the former, and the same treatment being applied to both, discussing thoroughly the principle on which the main points of the doctrine rest. From this point of view the last lines of his preface "De justitia et jure", are instructive.</p>
<p>All his writings, whether on dogmatic or moral theology, exhibit two main qualities: A penetrating, critical mind, sometimes indulging a little too much in subtleties, and a sound judgment. He may be ranked among the best representatives of the theological revival of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The small river which he wished to open, is indeed among the most important which empties into the ocean of theology, so that in many dogmatic or moral questions, the opinion of de Lugo is of preponderating value. In several problems he formed a system of his own, as for instance about faith, the Eucharist, the hypostatic union, etc., and owing to the thorough discussion of the question at issue, his opinion is always to be taken into account. In moral theology he put an end, as Ballerini remarks, to several disputed questions. St. Alphonsus de Ligouri does not hesitate to rank him immediately after St. Thomas Aquinas, "post S. Thomam facile princeps", and Benedict XIV calls him "a light of the Church". Two complete editions of Lugo's work were published at Venice in 1718 and 1751, each edition containing seven volumes. Another edition (Paris, 1768) was never completed. The last edition is that of Fournials (1868-69), in seven volumes, of which an eighth volume with the "Responsa moralia" and the "Indices" was added in 1891.</p>

<p>SECOND GATE</p>
<p>When things aren’t quite going one’s way, what’s next? Put a rock band together and call it SECOND GATE! From the man who has been leading from the front, Harshvardhan Sharma (Final Year, Civil Engg.) decided that Second Gate would stand for a second opportunity in life. This year saw the band go big in a way that made the Institute stand up in pride. With Harshvardhan playing lead guitar and vocals, Jetoban Kachari a.k.a JK with the Rhythm Guitar, Saurabhjyot Singh on the Bass Guitar and drummer Achint Goel, the band struck the right chords with their fan following whose numbers are growing by every passing day.</p>
<p>While the main forte of the band has always been playing covers of heavy metal to classic rock, their skipper would some day like to play Blues. The band influences trace down to the Gods of British Rock Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd as well as fast music like that of Iron Maiden. As every budding rock star dreams, Second Gate did move from playing covers to own compositions with 2 Hindi Compositions and one in English titled Thin Air. Incidentally, the band was originally to be named Thin Air! Also in the pipeline for them are more original compositions, though Harshvardhan is of view that these songs generally score less in the eyes of the crowd that prefers personal cover favorites. As of now, the band is on the look out for a song writer. Here’s wishing them good luck from the followers!</p>
<p>As a Final Year student about to graduate, Harshvardhan sees a fantastic and revolutionary future for the band. This, however, he says will have to come from the students’ as the faculty here is not too supportive of this kind of activity. The only problem is that of financing which he says can be solved if the students and alumni decide to come up with support. To the rest of the crowd, Harshvardhan’s men who’ve been to IGMC Shimla and JP Engineering College, Solan with their music only to return with many accolades, the message is pretty clear. Drawing parallel’s from Rock Music, they say that one needs to do what your best at and give it 110+ %. A pretty strong message and sure enough, the fans are all ears! And as the dream of every alumnus is, Harshvardhan hopes to come back to NIT-H and mesmerize the crowd with his ‘butter-on-fingers’ style on the guitar inspired by a certain Jimmy Page. As it is said, a band is all about friendships, road trips and enjoying time together. Second Gate has embodied every bit of it. At NIT Hamirpur, we are proud of them!</p>

<p>Latter the knife became a favorite of the nobility and they often used it as a show piece on there belts. Some of the Dulcimers were made with rich ivory for a Beautiful handle piece but the average one used wood as the handle to make it affordable and usable by the peasantry and the crafters.</p>

<p>Tej Singh was born Tej Ram, into a Hindu Brahmin family from the Ganges valley. He was introduced to the court of Ranjit Singh by his uncle Khushal Singh, who was employed by Maharaja Ranjit Singh as a royal court official. Like his uncle before him, Tej Ram converted to Sikhism to become Tej Singh. He was employed by the Sikh army and was raised to the rank of general. Tej Singh's loyalty was to the royal family, not to the Sikh army. There are serious questions regarding his conduct during the first Anglo-Sikh war, he is widely considered to have been a traitor.</p>

<p>Cyril Norman Hugh Long</p>
<p>Based of O.L.K Smith and J.D. Hardy- Biographical Memoirs V. 46 (1975). Cyril Norman Hugh Long, the elder son of John Edward and Rose Fanny (Langdill) Long, was bron on June 19, 1901 in a village in Wilshire, England. However, most of his youth was spent near Manchester, in the town of Wigan. He often talked about his childhood as something especially important to the rest of his life. He had shown great academic promise as a boy, but never pursued the life of a scholar or of a scientist. Instead, he entered government service, becoming a Tax Surveyor. He was known for his rigid honesty and disposition, at home he dedicated his time to literature and history, and he devoted a lot of his energy in a number of hobbies. He experimented in the making of perfumes, jams, and woodwork. He also collected rare books and personally knew some authors such as Joseph Conrad. His father encouraged always encouraged him to be a serious student and to become a scientist. As a scientist his central theme research was the endocrine control of metabolism, which is “far more complex than appeared possible a few years ago”. He, with the help of a medical student, B. Katzin, was able to describe quantitatively the biological properties of the adrenal cortical hormones; he published a paper on the subject in Endocrinology in 1940. In addition to extensive correspondence, there are numerous laboratory notes, lecture notes, drafts of published papers, reports. He headed the Yale University Department of Physiology and School of Medicine for thirty-three years. Mr. Long died in 1970.</p>

<p>A breathtaking marvolous broadway production. I give Wicked a three thumbs up (If that were possible)! Eden Espinoso does a beautiful job playing the role of the green-skinned witch, Elphaba. Everyone deserves to see Wicked and I give it my total praise.</p>
<p>Wicked is a tale of the fair, bubbly Glenda and the brilliant, firey Elphaba's friendship. If you are up for action, adventure,and fantasy, you will be spellbinded by Wicked.</p>

<p>The members of the Ohio Village Muffins Vintage Base Ball program at the Ohio Historical Society in Columbus present the game of base ball (two words in the nineteenth century) according to the rules and customs of the 1860-era, wearing uniforms and using equipment representative of that period. The 1860-style matches also reflect the language, customs, sportsmanship, good manners, and gentlemanly behavior associated with that bygone time.</p>
<p>The Muffins were established in 1981 at Ohio Village, a recreation of a typical Civil War-era Ohio community on the grounds of the Ohio Historical Center at I-71 and 17th Avenue. From April through November each season, the Muffins play an ambitious schedule of approximately fifty games. Home games are held on Muffin Meadow at Ohio Village. Away games take the Muffins to various communities throughout Ohio playing matches with other vintage clubs and with local community teams at various events such as bicentennials, heritage days celebrations, festivals, and fairs. In recent seasons the Muffins have traveled east to New York, west to Colorado, north to Minnesota, and south to Virginia while providing an educational and entertaining experience for participants and spectators.</p>
<p>The vintage base ball program at the Ohio Historical Society includes the Ohio Village Diamonds, a successful women’s team which plays base ball according to the rules and customs of 1860. The Diamonds also play an energetic schedule of home and road games.</p>
<p>Each Labor Day weekend, the Muffins and Diamonds host the Ohio Cup Vintage Base Ball Festival, a gathering of 20-25 vintage teams in period uniforms from all over Ohio and several other states. The assembled teams play matches on three fields from morning to evening on Saturday and Sunday. The Ohio Cup Festival is a colorful, family-friendly, and educational event featuring exhibits and refreshments. The event is the oldest and largest gathering of vintage base ball teams in the nation and is a highlight of the vintage base ball season.</p>
<p>Along with the vintage base ball program at Old Bethpage on Long Island, which also began in 1981, the Muffins are the co-originators of the sport of vintage base ball and have been instrumental in helping with the establishment of many other vintage teams. Today there are approximately 200 teams in the United States and Canada playing vintage base ball. Information about the Muffins and Diamonds vintage base ball program at the Ohio Historical Society is available at www.ohiovillagemuffins.org. Information about the sport of vintage base ball and other vintage teams can be found at the website of the Vintage Base Ball Association at www.vbba.org.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-14_7fe1.html" title="Edit section: [Columbus Capitals]">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">[Columbus Capitals]</span></h2>
<p>The Capital Base Ball Club is a vintage team based on the original Capital Club which was one of three base ball clubs formed in the spring of 1866 in downtown Columbus, Ohio. The Capitals play an active schedule of approximately 15-20 matches a season. Their uniforms—dark blue trousers and hats, blue and white checked shirts with white shields—were designed from newspaper accounts of those worn by the original 1866 Columbus team.</p>
<p>The Capital Club often holds its matches at the playing field at the Ohio Village on the grounds of the Ohio Historical Society at 17th Avenue and I-71 on the north side of Columbus, near the Ohio State Fair Grounds. The Capitals also play on other local venues, often partnering with the Ohio Village Muffins to present an entertaining and educational demonstration of how the national pastime was played in the 1860s. One such joint effort is an annual game at Schiller Park in the German Village area of Columbus which re-creates an actual match of July 11, 1867 held on those very grounds (known as City Park at that time) between the Columbus Capitals and the visiting Washington Nationals. In this historic re-creation game, the Capitals portray their forbearers of the same name, and the Muffins portray the visiting Nationals, one of the top clubs of the 1860s and the first eastern club to make a tour of western cities. Columbus was the first stop on the Nationals’ historic tour in the summer of 1967 when base ball was spreading into the Midwest and becoming known as the national game.</p>
<p>The Capitals-Nationals match is notable in that three members of the Hall of Fame were on the field on the occasion of the original 1867 game. George Wright, the greatest player of his era, was in the line-up for the Nationals. Harry Wright, George’s brother and the Captain of the Cincinnati Red Stockings, came up from the Queen City to umpire the game and escort the Nationals to the next stop on their tour. Henry Chadwick, the great 19th century sportswriter, rules expert, and originator of the box score, accompanied the Nationals as their official scorer and wrote articles about the tour for the eastern newspapers.</p>
<p>In addition to its matches in Columbus, the Capital Base Ball Club also embarks on road trips several times a year to play other vintage throughout Ohio and other states. Recent out-of-state trips have included games at The Museum of the Civil War Soldier (Pamplin Park) in Petersburg, Virginia, the World Series of Base Ball at Greenfield Village at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, the annual National Road Festival in Addison, Pennsylvania, the Field of Dreams film location in Dyersville, Iowa and the Silver Ball Tournament in Rochester, Minnesota. The Capitals are also regular participants in the Ohio Cup Vintage Base Ball Festival hosted every year by the Ohio Historical Society over the Labor Day weekend.</p>
<p>The Columbus Capital Base Ball Club was founded in the off-season of 1997-98 by a group of members of the Ohio Village Muffins. At that time, the Ohio Historical Society was considering changing the time period of Ohio Village from 1860 to the turn of the century. In order to preserve the opportunity to continue playing vintage base ball by the rues and practices of the 1860s, the Capital Club was formed. Research was conducted on early Columbus-area teams and the Capital Club was selected as the model for the new vintage club. When OHS abandoned plans to change the time period of Ohio Village, the Capital Club was maintained since the research done on the founding of the original club showed a heritage worthy of preservation. Members of historic Columbus Capital Base Ball Club also continue to participate in vintage base ball as players, scorekeepers, umpire and interpreters for the Ohio Village Muffins. The Capital Club is a member of the Vintage Base Ball Association and takes great satisfaction and enjoyment from re-creating base ball as it was played in Columbus during the game’s formative years.</p>

<p>The Eiteiz are a comedy/ rock band started by two guitar weilding young men who refer to themselves as Raphiel McKenzey and Shephard Smith. In 2004, they were in a self titled film which inspired their first album, The Plaid Album. In 2004 again, they released "All out of Context," their first album containing full length songs. Over the next three years, they released Eiz of Fury, The Plight of the Plundering Sea Sparrows, Shadowfall (Considered to be their best solo album as of yet), The Life and Times of STS and Bill is Back!. Their most recent album, "Bill..." contained the song, Dancing Fireflies, which got them noticed by other local professionals. In California, they have begun recording their next album, which has not yet been officially named. They plan to begin their next tour in coming years, but as McKenzey stated recently, "I have no idea what the rush is, we keep giving and getting less each time," indeed...we need to pay them a token of respect.</p>

<p>John Black (Days Of Our Lives)</p>
<p>In 1986, a mysterious man arrived in Salem. He had recently undergone extensive cosmetic surgery and had no memory of his past. Dr. Marlena Evans tried to help him sort out his past and, at one point, thought he could be the evil Phoenix, Stefano, because of a tattoo on his shoulder. After visiting a cosmetic surgeon who had photos of the missing Roman Brady, Marlena was convinced that the man was none other than her husband Roman. "Roman" moved into her house, her bed and her heart. He picked up parenting duties for his daughter, Carrie, and the twins, Sami and Eric, whom he had with Marlena.</p>
<p>After about five years, the real Roman escaped from captivity and returned to Salem. John was shocked to discover that he had been living another man's past and still had no knowledge of his own history. It wasn't until 1992 when Lawrence Alamain's aunt, Vivian, came to Salem. It turned out that John Black was really Forrest, Lawrence's presumed dead brother. Once his inheritance was properly reimbursed from Vivian, who had claimed Forrest's share of the Alamain fortune, John had an independent income for life.</p>
<p>John was shocked to discover that he had been living another man's past and still had no knowledge of his own history.</p>
<p>John then became involved with Isabella Toscano, who became pregnant with his child about the time that Danielle Stevens came to Salem. Danielle claimed to be both John's wife and a private investigator, who was on the trail of the jewel thief Romulus. She led John off to Europe and would have seduced him, but Isabella discovered that Danielle herself was really Romulus. John allowed Danielle to escape, then returned to Salem and wed Isabella. Their son, Brady Black, however, arrived in a church anteroom before the couple exchanged wedding vows. Only a few months later, Isabella died in John's arms of pancreatic cancer.</p>
<p>John never really stopped loving Marlena, the woman who dominated his short remembered history. Even though they acknowledged their love for each other, Marlena was faithful to her husband and dedicated to her family. However, when John announced that he was leaving Salem for good, Marlena gave in to a moment of passion aboard his private jet. That changed everything. John decided to stay in Salem and Marlena found out that she had conceived.</p>
<p>While Marlena was pregnant, John began a love affair with Kristen Blake, who turned out to be already betrothed to Tony DiMera. While John and Kristen embarked on their bumpy romance, Marlena delivered a baby girl, Belle. After Sami Brady brought to light the true paternity of Marlena and John's child, Kristen felt betrayed and married Tony as planned. Stefano captured John and tortured him in a dungeon at Maison Blanche. Marlena tried to seduce Stefano to help John escape. Roman got them both out, then decided to divorce Marlena and left town.</p>
<p>By then, John was committed to Kristen even though she was married to Tony. They could not continue their affair however, because John discovered another piece of his past: he was a priest. That served Marlena well when it became apparent that she was possessed by the devil. She needed to be exorcised, and who better than John, qualified and loving, to do the job? John freed Marlena of Satan and then freed himself of his priestly vows.</p>
<p>John and Kristen planned to find a way to be together, but before Kristen could obtain an annulment, fatally ill Tony committed suicide. In a complex plot, Tony framed John for murder. John was convicted and sentenced to death. He actually inhaled some fumes in the gas chamber before his innocence, through Tony's diary, came to light.</p>
<p>Marlena and John came close to reuniting after John's near death. However, Kristen became pregnant and John proposed marriage. Marlena refused to come between the couple for fear that Kristen would miscarry. However, Kristen had already miscarried, but with Stefano's help, she came up with a pregnant double. The ploy kept John in Kristen's grasp for a long time, but Kristen's double began to assume Kristen's life... and fell for John.</p>
<p>Kristen's double, Susan, locked up both the now scheming Kristen and Marlena and planned to marry John. However, Laura Horton uncovered the plan and exposed both Susan's identity and Kristen's faked pregnancy. John's affection for Kristen changed to utter loathing when he learned that the child was not his. Another shock followed when all of Salem learned that Roman Brady had died on an ISA assignment.</p>
<p>At last, John and Marlena reunited. Before they could marry, Roman returned from the dead. Kristen and Stefano had brought Roman back to Salem, but Roman was suffering from a deadly illness. Marlena could not bring herself to tell the dying Roman that she was in love with John. Determined to win John back, Kristen had already led Roman to believe that she and John were a couple.</p>
<p>Stefano, following his own plans, led John off to the jungle in search of a cure for Roman. John's friend, Hope, followed him, certain that he needed someone to protect him from Stefano's schemes, and during their adventures, John and Hope forged new, deeper bonds. But John's love remained focused on Marlena, and on finding a cure for Roman. With John away, Marlena agreed to grant Roman's dying wish and agreed to marry him. John returned with a cure for Roman, just as Marlena and Roman were about to marry.</p>
<p>After Kristen's "murder," John was finally free to be with the woman he loved. Marlena and John planned to be married, but a couple with more obstacles has never been found. John gave up his search for the past, fearing he would not like the man he was under Stefano's control. John and Marlena went on their honeymoon in Hawaii when Gina, unbeknownst to Stefano, lured John away by faking a drowning. John was temporarily returned to 1985, and his love for Gina. In an unlikely twist, Stefano deactivated John's chip and threw him off the submarine. Stefano no longer trusted Gina and John to work together. Marlena found John's body washed up onshore and rushed him to the hospital. When he woke up, he had no memory of what occurred.</p>
<p>John and Marlena returned to Salem, eager to begin the joy of what should be the comfort and contentment of married life. But it could never be that easy. John and Isabella's son, Brady, moved back in and proved to have a tumultuous relationship with Marlena. The Coronation Massacre occurred, in which John returned to "mercenary mode" and pulled many of the injured guests to safety. John also believed for a time that he was the father of Hope's baby, but as the results of the baby switch played out, it was revealed that he wasn't. It was Bo. And John and Marlena were free to continue their beautiful romance.</p>
<p>John started a new business, Basic Black and hired Kate Roberts to run it for him. But the most shocking event to transpire in Salem was the return of Tony DiMera, the believed-dead son of Stefano. He brought John's spy skills to the front, as he and Marlena tried to figure out why Tony had come back. He also had to deal with the arrival in Salem of the Gemini Twins, Rex and Cassie, two "aliens" who Marlena wanted to help but who he believed were two more pawns of Stefano.</p>
<p>John and Marlena traveled to DiMera Island to try to learn more about the Twins. Eventually, with both Tony and Rolf's help, the discovered that Marlena had given birth to Rex and Cassie. And Tony was their father. John wasn't happy that there was now a link between Tony and his beloved Doc. John also wasn't happy to learn that he and Tony were half-brothers; they shared a mother, Daphne DiMera. The identity of his father is still a mystery. For a time, it looked as if Tony wanted to reunite with the mother of his children, but after the evil Count tried to kill John by locking him in a sauna, Marlena seemed to side with her husband once and for all.</p>
<p>The arrival in town of the Salem Stalker caused the loss of some of John's closest and dearest friends. His main goal was to uncover the identity of the Stalker; little did he know how close to home this was. He refused to believe his wife Marlena could be the killer, until the evidence stacked up against her was too much to ignore. When Alice called him with the message that Marlena was the killer and was ready to murder the Horton matriarch, John knew he had to stop her. He failed. Later that night, Marlena admitted she was the killer, then the two of them got into an altercation over his gun and she went over the penthouse balcony. When she awoke after the incident, she claimed that JOHN was the killer. Nevertheless, she went to jail for the crime, leaving John devastated. When Marlena "escaped" from jail, John tried to save her, but could not. She was shot by a police sharpshooter and died in his arms. He was devastated. He carried his beloved Doc through the streets of Salem and laid her out in church. It wasn't long after she was buried, however, that they discovered that her casket was empty. John became suspicious of a certain island and he and Bo tried to get their on the Basic Black jet. They were shot down, but survived to find their loved ones alive on Tony DiMera's island prison. John and Marlena were reunited, but he was a little suspicious about how close Doc and Roman had gotten while imprisoned together. The next step was escape. As they were finally getting out of Tony's clutches, the evil DiMera created a volcanic eruption, which in turn caused a giant wave. John was injured in his final fight with his half brother and joined the other Salemites on makeshift rafts. The Coast Guard eventually picked most of them up, but Marlena was not among the survivors. And John was paralyzed. Back in Salem, John found himself with another obstacle to his happiness. He was paralyzed and the pain killers were doing no good. It seemed that a DiMera operative was injecting his IV with a dangerous drug. He became addicted to painkillers as he was determined to walk his daughter Belle down the aisle. John did walk Belle down the aisle, but it wasn't long before his addiction was discovered, thanks to savvy Nicole. With Kate's help, he fought the pain and his addiction. She even moved into the Penthouse to help him. It wasn't long before they grew close, so close, in fact, taht they made love. They each believed their loved ones would want them to move on with each other. Finally, John proposed and Kate accepted! Little did they know that Roman and Marlena were arriving in Salem at that very moment.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-14_7fe1.html" title="Edit section: ALFRED ROGERS">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">ALFRED ROGERS</span></h2>
<p>[(Alfred Rogers)] – 1921-1992, Footballer with Sheffield Wednesday.</p>
<p>Alf Rogers scored 39 goals in 125 senior games for Sheffield Wednesday. He was born at Walkley, in Sheffield, a suburb adjacent to Hillsborough and was spotted playing for a local amateur side, Birley Carr.</p>
<p>He was invited to Highbury in 1939 for a trial with Arsenal and was told to return the following season. Alas the outbreak of World War 2 changed that particular arrangement and Alf signed-on for Sheffield Wednesday, part-time, whilst working at a local munitions’ factory.</p>
<p>Alf was a stocky inside-forward and one of his idols was centre-forward Jackie Robinson. In the first game after the war, in a League North fixture, Wednesday beat Sunderland 6-3 with both Rogers and Robinson each netting a hat-trick.</p>
<p>In the publication “The Jackie Robinson Story”, the authors recall: “Alf Rogers, another of Jackie’s inside partners was another player who found it hard to get first-team football, due to the wealth of talent in that position, but when he did he always took his chances and played well, partnering Jackie around 22 times.”</p>
<p>Just when Alf’s talents were coming to fruition, he received a blow in the groin on a pre-season tour to the Netherlands and arthritis cut short his career at the end of the 1949-50 season, a campaign which saw Alf play a part in the Owls’ promotion to the top tier, scoring four times in eighteen appearances that term.</p>
<p>Alf always remembered a goal he scored against Fulham in 1947 when he struck a shot which opened the scoring in a 2-0 win. On turning to receive his team mates’ congratulations, he noticed the ball was down by the corner flag.</p>
<p>Alf recalled: “The ball had hit a flaw in the net and broken it open. The nets were new that day and manager, Eric Taylor, joked he’d provide new nets every game if I could keep finding the flaw with a shot on target!”</p>
<p>After his premature retirement as a player, Alf was a regular attender at Owls’ games through the family shareholding. He worked for some local engineering firms before moving to the Physical Education department at the Goodwin Centre of the University of Sheffield, from where he retired in 1986.</p>
<p>On his visits to Hillsborough in later life, he was often asked by strangers his opinion of players being paid large amounts of cash? As someone who had played for a weekly sum of £5 a week, with perhaps a £5 win bonus, Alf would reply: “We never thought about the money. All we wanted to do was roll up those blue and white sleeves and run out and play for your local club!”</p>

<p>Big Bad Shakin' are a German Rock 'n' Roll/Rockin' Cartoon Pop band founded in 1997.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-14_7fe1.html" title="Edit section: Music">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Music</span></h3>
<p>Big Bad Shakin' play a modern style of Rock ‘n’ Roll music. They use components of the Revival Rock 'n' Roll of the 1970s, traditional 50s R'n'R mixing it with modern music styles such as Rap, HipHop, Skate Punk or Grunge. Amongst their main influences the band quotes Shakin' Stevens &amp; The Sunsets, Crazy Cavan &amp; The Rhythm Rockers, Big Joe Turner, Run DMC and Sex Pistols.</p>
<p>Big Bad Shakin' write and perform their own song material with themes ranging from the traditional love story to job loss to or the Saturday night binge at a working man's club. Mainly their fans refer to band's musical style as "Rockin' Cartoon Pop" referring to song titles such as "Crazy Pullover" or their stage action which often includes eating chocolade bars and drinking advocaat. Rockin' Cartoon Pop may be considered a side stream of the <a href="http://www.timidtiger.com/en/index.php" class="external text" title="http://www.timidtiger.com/en/index.php" rel="nofollow">Timid Tiger's</a> definition of "Cartoon Pop" music. Though a musical parallel can not be drawn, Big Bad Shakin' listeners claim having identified a new style of music in the band's performance. In the UK, however, Big Bad Shakin' are mostly announced as playing "Take no prisoners total Rock 'n' Roll" focusing on the powerfulness of the music style.</p>
<p>Their fans also call the four guys "probably the craziest band around" in reference to their stage appearance, show and, most likely, personality.</p>

<p>Big Bad Shakin' first got together in the summer of 1997 when they were asked to replace the headline Rock 'n' Roll act at an open air gig in Germany with an audience of about 2,000. After a period of solo projects they re-connected in late 2002 with a new bass player and began writing and performing self-penned material. In 2005 the band acquired a new drummer and had to replace the guitar player after he had left. Despite the necessary changes, their music remained the way it was.</p>

<p>It is said that he did the training of Nodachi-jigenryu in Enatsu Nakazaemon's dojo in Nishidacho.(There is a theory that the swordsmanship of jigenryu was learned from Ijyuin Kamoi, too.) He struck a tree 8000 times every day with the wooden sword with going to the dojo frequently, and many thick trees therefore broke.</p>

<p>In 1862, he went to Kyoto with Shimazu Hisamitsu who was father of the clan master. Then, he was awakened to "Sonno-jyoi" there by being concerned with the samurai of other clans.(The thought of "Sonno-jyoi" supports the Emperor and excludes a foreign country.) After that, he became the men of Saigo Takamori. He went into Edo in the Boshin war, and requisitioned the Aizu-Wakamatsujyo. He became the commander of standing army of Kagoshima in 1869. In 1874, he worked for the Ministry of Army, and became the officer of the army. After that, though he became the head of the army court, he came back to Satsuma with Saigo Takamori who was yielded in the Seikan dispute and who resigned government in 1876.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-14_7fe1.html" title="Edit section: Culture of crime">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Culture of crime</span></h2>
<p>The culture of crime has been an integral part of history; it has held the same presence as politics and war and therefore is a very large subject to undertake. From the lower classes to the upper classes, each one has conducted in criminal acts from the often false illusion of the highway robbers, who were in fact just muggers to upper class crimes like embezzlement, tax evasion and fraud. Therefore to look at power, law and authority you need to first have an understanding of why attitudes and laws were implemented plus why the law sometimes protected some but ignored others.</p>
<p>The pre-bureaucratic state very much depended on the threat of death to stop people from committing crime due to there being no criminal justice system and perhaps due to the state being weak and needing to show their authority in symbolic executions due to it being hard to pass information due to it being hard to travel, therefore easier to make punishment harsh and symbolic to act as a deterrent. The pre-bureaucratic state used torture frequently to punish those who broke the law and public executions were very much part of public life. It was not uncommon for thousands of people to attend the public executions and this also acted as a good deterrent for the state to strike fear into those who may have thought about breaking the law. But his system of law was abolished in 1790 with the last execution.</p>
<p>Once the bureaucratic state was implemented in the ninetieth century, it brought with it the police state. The implementation of the police state bought greater power to the state and therefore was no longer a need for the symbolic public executions that had been widespread in the previous centuries. Due to the large numbers of police and the implementation of the judicial system and the services and introduction of the penitentiary system resulted in a new system of punishing the mind of the criminal, which was an alternative way of punishment to the previous way of punishment which was to punish the body of the criminal.</p>
<p>The law has often been unfair towards the poorer citizens of a society, due to the power the richer members of society had and the relatively powerless lower classes. An example of this is that of an eighteenth century woman who stole a fish, she was caught and went to trial for hanging. The law was harsh for petty crime, thieves were easily caught and the trials very quick, some as short as five minutes long and many cases implemented no defence for the defendant. During and after the eighteenth century the law was intensified against the poorer classes due to societies view that the lawlessness of these classes were going against the society that was trying to be constructed, a society based spoken definitions of order.</p>
<p>Power, law and authority circled around crime and the laws passed to prevent crime were based on the power of classes and the states authority on its citizens. Crime in the eighteenth century was very much based around fear. The impact of crime was also pushed into the background while the need for reduction in crime was much about the fear it caused those it impacted upon and the fear of social change itself. ‘For a century and a half it has been next to impossible to perceive the meaning of crime except through ideological filters’ Therefore crime during this period was very much focused upon those people that the state deemed as vagrant and part of a deviant culture. This resulted in the formation of the police-state, which showed two faces of British law. The first was that to protect its citizens, the second was to oppress and curb popular feeling within society. But the latter point was not as unruly as it sounds due to there being a rule of law.</p>
<p>Power, Law and Authority were very much intertwined with crime and one another in recent history. Those who held power tended to fear those with no power and therefore influenced law to help protect themselves from lower class deviants. The law obviously is meant to be followed and those that don’t follow such laws should be punished but the question should be asked that were these laws there to protect every citizen of a nation or just those in power. Certainly before the bureaucratic state was implemented, the law does seem to punish those ‘deviants’ publicly as a symbolic act to strike fear into the other deviants such as thieves, prostitutes and drunks to not carry out such actions as to push those in authority and power to react. It is also an important point that crime was very much about fear in past centuries, not the impact it had upon society and the economy. Therefore in conclusion it is important to understand the way in which society was run when trying to understand such points. A society with has not yet embraced the enlightenment will therefore follow religious and authoritarian leadership which will include keeping the poor, poor, and the rich powerful and the law will be implemented and acted on to keep such structure in place to keep society running based on fear and authority.</p>

<p>Sirius:</p>
<p>Sirius is a unique partnership established by BP Chemicals at Saltend, Hull, investing in the economic future of the local area. Sirius can offer business loans for local people seeking to establish a business in the area, or to expand an already successful business in Hull and the surrounding areas. Launched in September 1999 with a £1 million investment from BP, Sirius has so far given help and advice to hundreds of people hoping to start up in business or to expand through start-up loans and free advice, and the demand for its services is still growing!</p>
<p>Since the first business loans were allocated in March 2000, Sirius has helped to create over 600 new jobs in over 125 very diverse organisations. Those who have taken advantage of Sirius’ free advice and support have created approximately 700 further jobs. It has issued £867k of loans, which has levered in a further £4.4m of investment from traditional sources. Sirius’ input has produced one job per £1406 invested.</p>
<p>The overarching aim of Sirius is to create sustainable local jobs in existing companies and to assist with the set up of new micro businesses. This is achieved by providing specialist advice and guidance on business planning, sources of financial assistance and by building individual capacity to deal with all aspects of business management. It is a community-based project aiming to assist those individuals currently at a disadvantage through lack of clear advice and guidance on business planning, basic business management skills and access to affordable finance. The project is dedicated to the creation of sustainable jobs in the relatively economically and socially deprived geographical area surrounding the BP site.</p>
<p>The type of business support offered ranges from advice on office rentals and business administration to guidance on imports, tax, marketing and cash flow management. Sirius also signposts applicants on to other potential sources of funding and has excellent working relationships with local banks and other traditional business support agencies. Sirius’ unique managed partnership approach allows a co-ordinated and focused delivery of a range of ‘in-house’ business support services. This includes an agreed ‘pick-and-mix’ approach to a managed range of monitored business advice and support, and continuous counselling for as long as the client requires.</p>
<p>As important as the initial seed money to clients is the advice, support and mentoring provided before, during and after start-up. This is what makes Sirius distinctive and precious to its clients. Sirius’ relationships with clients and partners are nurtured by confidence – our confidence in their plans; their confidence in our service - trust and long-term vision. Though an SME, Sirius is also an agent for change. Because it is supported by BP, with responsibility for enhancing BP’s reputation locally and is aligned with the values and standards held by BP, Sirius encourages its clients to be best in class, coaching them to continuous improvement whether in financial, HSE or social performance. It provides access to quality IT, business and financial training for these SMEs where appropriate.</p>
<p>From a shop front location on the local high street in Hedon, Sirius has achieved UK Enterprise Agency status, the only such agency in The East Riding Of Yorkshire. By creating Sirius, BP has changed lives and will go on changing lives for the good, providing local people with the opportunity to build for their own future through self-employment.</p>
<p>Sirius allocates business loans to those enterprises, approved by the Sirius board, which complement the overall objectives and relate to a key theme. Approved themes are:</p>
<p>• Local job creation • Development of young people • Local enterprise development • Training and education</p>
<p>Resources BP invested £1 million into a revolving loan fund at the start of the programme and committed a further £500,000 in 2005. This seed funding is intended to act as ‘pump-priming’ finance to lever other sources of funding from donor agencies. All loans are considered against strict criteria established by BP and vetted by Sirius before submission of any application to the Loan Board.</p>
<p>The diversity of small businesses supported by Sirius is impressive. They range from organic mushroom farming to commercial embroidery, garden furniture to interior design, nursery schools to IT businesses and garages. All comment on the invaluable support of Sirius, be it in terms of a loan, which leveraged other funds, or the very practical nature of the advice, which the programme offers.</p>
<p>Impact Traditionally, local employment has been dependent upon seasonal business sectors such as the agricultural and tourism industries. These sectors do not provide young people living in the target area with sufficient local opportunities to develop their full employment potential within other business sectors.</p>
<p>• We are fully integrated and play a very important part in the local communities’ enterprise organisations. We are also involved with many local investment steering committees, and work closely with the universities.</p>
<p>• Sirius has developed a strong reputation for partnership and inclusive working with other agencies, and for sharing information and financial risk, for example with local banks and The Prince’s Trust.</p>
<p>• Sirius offers a very flexible service to small businesses, responding to individual needs. This is possible because of close relationships, which Sirius staff have nurtured with the entrepreneurs. Should the initiative expand significantly over the next few years, this ‘personal touch’ may well be more difficult to maintain. However, the business manager is adamant that Sirius will remain free from those bureaucratic hurdles which, perhaps, deter small businesses from using some of the other available agencies</p>
<p>• Sirius does not offer generic training programmes on business matters such as cash flow and marketing - it signposts entrepreneurs on to other agencies which offer these courses. Rather, it focuses its efforts on practical, individually tailored advice for each business or loan applicant.</p>
<p>• Sirius’ visibility in the community has been identified as one reason for its immediate success. The office’s prominent high street location is considered a valuable asset, allowing potential entrepreneurs to drop in and ask questions in a “non-threatening” environment. It also reinforces the notion that the initiative is an integral part of the community and not tucked away behind BP gates.</p>
<p>The on-going management support of BP, beyond their initial financial commitment, demonstrates the company’s commitment to the community beyond its core operations and its supply chains. Sirius is a successful example of social investment, which has moved beyond straightforward philanthropy.</p>
<p><br />
Sirius’ comprehensive business support service, applicable to all applicants, includes: • Business start-up and planning • Advice, support and mentoring • Funding, loans for leverage • Business plan compilation • Market research • Financial planning • Grant applications and information • Finance procurement • Liaison with banks and other agencies • Encouragement • Negotiation for property • Acting as an information gateway • Sourcing specific training • IT support • Marketing, tax &amp; skills advice • Health &amp; Safety support • Mentoring &amp; support for existing companies • Financial advice in disputes, ombudsman, factoring, • Cash flow and debt recovery Society Benefits Partnerships with local enterprise agencies and financial institutions are key to success and sustainability, as are strong relations with local government. It would also be interesting to consider opportunities for collaboration with other large companies within the same region, whereby pooling resources can create a greater critical mass and so have a more significant impact on the local economy. Experience proves that it is possible to retain brand recognition and reputational benefits within a collective endeavour, even among competitors. Often, the fact that major competitors prove they are willing to work together on social investment projects can enhance ‘licence to operate’ and reputation with host communities and governments, while boosting local enterprise development and job creation.</p>
<p>Sirius business manager Alan Gordon-Freeman comments, “Our aims are to help to create sustainable businesses in the 'drive to work' area of Saltend. This creates local wealth, a better choice of career for future employees, local pride, ambition, a higher level of training and skills, reduced crime, and a better community in general.</p>

<p>Nerveseed is the modern rock group of the new millenia that the youth has been waiting for. In just a couple of months it's already showing signs of growing into a huge monster in the rock industry. Although still being an independent group they have already gathered quite a vast and loyal following in Finland and Europe. Their music can really be called the hottest thing around.</p>

Bergen County Academies China Care’s two main purposes are to support children in Chinese orphanages and families who have adopted children from China. Through fundraising events and volunteering, Bergen County Academies China Care takes a proactive approach in helping Chinese orphans through care, interaction, and education. Bergen County Academies China Care fundraises to help meet the costs of medical care for orphaned children with disabilities and sponsors them to live in foster homes. By hosting Dumplings, a playgroup for adopted Chinese children, Bergen County Academies China Care instills interest in and educates young Chinese children on Chinese culture and heritage.

<p><br />
<b>Vision Statement:</b></p>

In the process, a large community will experience the joy of bringing a life of love to Chinese orphans. Bergen County Academies China Care will also work towards and maintain a nonprofit organization 501(c)3 status.</p>

<p>Mr. Natural is a character created by the legendary underground cartoonist, <a href="../../../r/2E/_/R._Crumb_0f63.html" title="R. Crumb">R. Crumb</a>. Crumb has been drawing the adventures of this small, bearded street mystic since the mid-'60s, and still draws him today. First appearing in Crumb's sketchbook, the character made his public debut in the magazine "Yarrowstalks". Part wiseman, part con man, Mr. Natural has strange, magical powers and posseses cosmic insight, but is also moody, cynical, self-pitying, and suffers from various strange sexual obsessions. He is endlessly being accosted by would-be disciples seeking the truth (among them such long-running Crumb characters as Flakey Foont and Shuman the human). He typically regards them with amused condescention and a certain affection, although his patience often wears thin and he takes a sadistic pleasure in making them feel like idiots. While he is typically very cool and in control, he sometimes ends up in humiliating predicaments like getting tossed in jail for child molestation or languishing for years in a mental institution. In recent years he has entered into a tempestuous relationship with Devil Girl, another popular Crumb character. Enormously popular during the <a href="../../../u/n/d/Underground_comics.html" title="Underground comics">underground comics</a> fad of the '60s and '70s and still enjoying a cult following today, Mr. Natural has been endlessly merchandised, being sold as a plastic, decorative statue, on bumper stickers, posters, t-shirts, etc.</p>

<p>The Manager of Partick Thistle football Club who has past post at Dunfermailne and Brechin City, this was after a very unimpressive career as a player. To re use the word unimpressive would be perfect at describing his current form as manager at partick thistle. who he took over as manager in January 2005 following the departure of Gerry Britton and Derek Whyte,his goal to keep the Jags in the 1st Division and build a squad for next year. He was unsuccesful at both. The jags are now battleing for promotion back into the first division and Dick Campbell is still incharge wiht the same dodgey tactics dodgey substitutions and dodgey smile as ever.</p>

<p>In the early days of the new wave of abandonware websites, on October 26th 1999, Abandon 5000 was created, based on the new abandonware ideas. Only games that had been unavailable in stores for some time would make it to the download section. Webmaster DarKsiDe, who was just 13 when he created the first version of the website was a game enthusiast and as his website improved through the years, his dedication has diminished a lot lately. On June 29th 2002, the .com domain was registered and some real serverspace was rented, taking Abandon 5000 to a more serious level.</p>
<p>The website grew to be one of the most well known abandonware sources for enthusiasts, but has been overgrown lately, mainly due to some inactivity by the webmaster and the entire abandonware community.</p>

They are called the [Latigo CS] and the [Tramonto]*. the Latigo is a [BMW 650i] coupé with a 4,8 litre V8 engine developing 367 [HP] and a [0-62] ([0-100]) time of 6 sec, or you can get it as a [BMW M6] with a 5,0 V10 with 507 HP and 0-62 (0-100) in 4,9 sec. But both versions is limited to 155 [MPH] (250 [KM/T]) the Tramonto is a diffrent story with a [Kleemann]** tuned [Mercedes-Benz] 5,5 V8 compresser engine it develops 610 HP giving it a 0-62 (0-100) time of 3,8 sec and a top speed of 200 MPH (320 KM/T) and that makes it the fastest cabrio in 06'</p>

<p>&lt;Olaf Tomsson&gt;</p>
<p><br />
Born 898 AD in Oslo, Olaff was the son of a Norwegian fisherman and a local landlord's daughter. He travelled widely as a young man, visiting most of the Scandinavian mainland and eventually further West. In 950, he is alleged to have founded a colony in <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vermont.html" title="Vermont">Vermont</a>, before <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leif_Eriksson_d5e6.html" title="Leif Eriksson">Leif Eriksson</a>'s Vinalnd colony was founded. Cave paintings in the area suggest a relationship with the local <a href="../../../a/b/e/Abenaki.html" title="Abenaki">Abenaki</a> Indians that began as one of mutual suspicion, but ended in the near total destruction of one of their tribes. Tomsson left the colony circa 953, but mysteriously left a young Norse boy with the Indians.</p>

<p><i>Italic Rhia's Corner is a syndicated column that is printed each month in numerous publications in several countries. At times, the articles reflect the columnist points of view, concerning life, in a humorous context.</i> Her monthly column is featured in self-help, new age, and parenting publications. The articles have been collected and published in her book “Little Lessons on Love and Life”. Her writing, although edited by a prominent editor, still bear many trademarks of her southern heritage. She is noted as saying, “Listen to what I say, not how I say it”. The column always bears quotes from reputable and noteworthy people at the end of each article. The quotes range from The Dali Lama to down to earth Oprah Winfrey, yet all stay in tune with that particular article. Staying in tune with the column and her book, in 2006, Rhiannon Waits was asked to host a show “Lets Talk About You” that assists others through life’s perplexities as Rhia’s Corner is noted for doing.</p>

<p>Die Anne Rogosch (annes rogoschus) ist eine Vertreterin der zu den Vogelarten gehörenden Rogoschae und lebt meist in sandig-felsigen Trockengebieten Deutschlands. Der Name Anne bezieht sich auf die auffällige hakenförmige Nase im Gesicht, direkt zwischen diesen beiden hässligen Augen. Die Anne ist mit maximal 170 Zentimetern Körperlänge relativ klein. Sie ist rosa-weiß gefärbt und besitzt extreme ekelhafte lange Beine, welche denen eines Storches ähneln. Die Kehle ist gesprenkelt und kann besonders bei den Männchen einen großen Brechreiz hervorrufen, auf dem Bauch findet sich dagegen keine bunte Fleckung, erzählte uns ein Männchen, welches dem Brechreiz wiederstehen konnte und sie aus langeweile auszog. Diese auffällige Färbung erscheint erst im Erwachsenenalter. Die Rückenschuppen sind klein und unterhalb der Kehle sind Hautfalten ausgebildet. Die Anne ähnelt in seinem Aussehen dem Westlichen Storch (storchus rogoschus), welcher allerdings etwas größer und dunkler ist. <a name="Ristohonk_Bobbufinglestein" id="Ristohonk_Bobbufinglestein"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-14_7fe1.html" title="Edit section: Ristohonk Bobbufinglestein">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ristohonk Bobbufinglestein</span></h2>
<p>Ristohonk Bobbufinglestein was a human male who lived on <a href="../../../t/a/t/Tatooine.html" title="Tatooine">Tatooine</a> in the Naritus Universe. He was sighted constantly for well over a year on the <a href="../../../m/m/o/MMORPG_6790.html" title="MMORPG">MMORPG</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_Galaxies_aef1.html" title="Star Wars Galaxies">Star Wars Galaxies</a>.</p>
<p>Arriving as a refugee on <a href="../../../t/a/t/Tatooine.html" title="Tatooine">Tatooine</a>, he entered with no true understanding of what he was to do. However, through several near death situations fighting the nunas of <a href="../../../t/a/t/Tatooine.html" title="Tatooine">Tatooine</a>, he realised that his hands were not for hand to hand combat. Ristohonk took up the profession of Rifleman and quickly gained the basic skills required to survive. However, for too long he did not advance due to inerest in other projects. Due to his obsession with Tatooine, he adopted an all-white uniform, consisting of a headwrap, boots, shirt, jacket and a skirt, to help blend with the sand.</p>
<p>His side projects included working towards becoming a <a href="../../../j/e/d/Jedi.html" title="Jedi">Jedi</a> under the now forgotten <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocron.html" title="Holocron">Holocron</a> system. His first three holocrons were: architect, dancer and droid engineer.</p>
<p>Ristohonk however stayed an architect for months, enjoying his role of building structures far cheaper than most others. However, his windfall came in the introduction of paintings at Tatooine's central hub, <a href="../../../b/e/s/Bestine.html" title="Bestine">Bestine</a>. Ristohonk, due to his inquisitive nature was among the first to purchase the schematic, place it in his factory and mass produce hundreds of paintings. As a result of being the first, Ristohonk was able to sell at the price of 100 thousand credits per painting. A mere month later after everybody had realised where paintings came from, they were worth no more than 5 thousand credits each. Ristohonk was able to make 20 million credits from this venture in a short amount of time.</p>
<p>Ristohonk set up a business relationship with Thompson Jamoboree, who ran the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coronet.html" title="Coronet">Coronet</a> Mall, the biggest player-run shop in the Naritus galaxy. While Ristohonk supplied paintings for cash, he also did many loot runs for Thompson, which included pieces of <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Star_82ed.html" title="Death Star">Death Star</a> debris, broken [lightsaber]s, animal cages and many other easily attained yet secret loots which were easily sold for many thousand credits each.</p>
<p>Ristohonk's favourite early activity was slaughtering <a href="../../../j/a/w/Jawas.html" title="Jawas">Jawas</a> for the fact that they often carried force crystals, worth a lot of money. However, Ristohonk soon realised that <a href="../../../t/u/s/Tusken_Raiders_b96c.html" title="Tusken Raiders">Tusken Raiders</a>, otherwise known as <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sand_People_3c5e.html" title="Sand People">Sand People</a> carried far more crystals in their stronghold of <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Tusken_cdea.html" title="Fort Tusken">Fort Tusken</a>. Shortly before Ristohonk was due to flee, he carried in excess of 50 force crystals with him, as well as tens of millions of credits.</p>
<p>Ristohonk's disappearance however was unexpected and a sign of the Empire's will to destroy all rebels. Ristohonk, a devoted Rebel, broke the Empire's rules for mating by engaging in a one-night-stand with a Wookiee at the <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mos_Eisley_8048.html" title="Mos Eisley">Mos Eisley</a> Cantina. The wookiee as a result was pregnant with a child; a child of mixed kerra and human breed. It was shortly realised that the wookiee would be killed and Ristohonk tortured for his disrespect to the Empire's laws. Fortunately, he was able to go unnoticed up until his daughter's birth. Ristohonk named his daughter "Ploppy". To ensure that Ploppy's life would go unnoticed by the Empire, Ristohonk was forced to place her in a capsule and send her away to a far away galaxy.</p>
<p>Ristohonk himself was forced to flee, albeit via a different path, although he was forced to give up everything he had worked for in his house, treasures and money. Ploppy's mother was killed shortly after for fear of giving birth to a "freak". Little did the Empire ever find out that this "Freak", due to cross-breeding and galactic radiation became a cat-like creature. Highly fortunately however, Ploppy, after drifting in space for 25 years, arrived on the planet of Norrath. Frightingly, she encountered many other cat-like creatures, called "Kerra", who she identifies with. After being taken in by Norrath's most evil ruler, Lucan D'Lere, Ploppy's main focus now is to meet her parents, whom she has no idea are or what has happened to them.</p>
<p>Ristohonk vows to one day meet up with Ploppy. When that day comes in unknown.</p>

<p>AEMT-CC , Advanced Emergency Medical Technician - Critical Care, is an EMS certification unique to New York State. The curriculum is comparable to that of the national standard EMT-I/99 (EMT-Intermediate - I/99). AEMT-CCs are ALS, or Advanced Life Support, Providers. Becoming an AEMT-CC involves a great deal of work. The pre-requisite is that a person must pocess a current EMT-Basic certification, although it is recommended that they also have at least one year of experience at that level. They must complete approximately 240 hours of classroom time, in which they learn Anatomy and Physiology, as well as signs, symptoms, and treatments relating to Trauma as well as medical emergencies including but not lmitied to Respiratory, Cardiac, Diebetic, and OB/GYN. While in class they must additionally spend time outside of the classroom observing in various clinical settings such as the ER, the OR, the CCU, with a Respiratory Therapist, or in Labor and Delivery. Also outside of the classroom during the course, the AEMT-CC student must be precepted doing many calls in the field by a AEMT-CC or Paramedic. Lastly, they pass a state practical skills exam and a state written exam. AEMT-CC skills include venous access, medication administration, endotracheal intubation, ECG interpretation, electrical cardiac therapy, needle chest decompression, intraosseous access, as well as all BLS or Basic Life Support skills. In areas where there are few Paramedics, due to scarcity of EMS providers or a lack of an accessible Paramedic class, Critical Care Technicians may be the highest level of pre-hospital care. AEMT-CCs, like all EMS providers, work under the proticols of medical direction whether it be in the form of standing orders or the contacting of medical control. New York has 18 regional EMS councils, some of which are comprised of a single county, while others are comprised of many counties. Each region must establish its own medical direction and as a result the proticols which providers in the field must follow vary based on the needs of the region. In some regions there is a big difference between Critical Care Technicians and Paramedics with regards to standing orders and skills allowed to be performed, while in others the two levels function on or very close to the same level. A major reason why people choose a Critical Care class as opposed to a Paramedic one, is that the amount of time required is significantly less. That makes the Critical Care level more appealing for volunteers who want to go beyond BLS, but don't intend on making a career out of EMS. Also, many Critical Care classes are offered through county EMS offices and are free to people who are active members of agencies within that county. Many Paramedic classes within New York are held through community colleges and therefore are costly not only in time, but also money due to the cost of tuition.</p>

<p>Scott Mosher has been an independent self-financed musician for over 15 years, a professional graphic artist since 1997, a rabid idealist for longer than he can remember, and an allroundniceguy his entire life. In his creative exploits, Mr. Mosher employs a combination of elements, techniques and influences that pulls inspiration from the past yet looks forward to the future. The end result is an evocative mix of sometimes disparate musical genres and artistic motivation into an invigorating, dramatic whole. One could use the term experimental but his vision remains dynamic, progressive and modern.</p>
<p>Beginning with his first CD, Ambient Earth, released in 1996, Scott began to carve a path for himself regardless of boundaries, constraints and more fortuitiously, music industry support. He continued on this road with the release of Virtuality in 2001 and Inferno in 2004 and his fourth - and newest - CD, Deep Horizon.</p>
<p>Deep Horizon is a dynamic and ambitious musical journey, synthesizing a diverse range of musical influences under the mantle of contemporary progressive metal. Built upon a foundation of crushing guitar tones, subtle odd meter rhythms, atmospheric keyboard sounds, and powerful vocal melodies (courtesy of Wind Wraith/Live After Death/InnerStrength singer Scott Oliva) Deep Horizon breaks new ground in the world of progressive metal and makes for another distinguished artistic statement.</p>
<p>In addition to arranging, composing, and performing all the music on this self-produced CD, his creative vision is further solidified in his striking and symbolic artwork that serves as a visual reference point for the lyrics themes alluded to on Deep Horizon.</p>
<p>Although he has never appeared on the Arsenio Hall Show, won a Grammy Award, graced the cover of ROLLING STONE magazine or been involved in a corporate embezzlement schemes, Scott continues to ply his trade with determination and a great set of Ginzu knives. For all the emphasis placed upon his art as a hybrid of styles, ideals and emotions, his music stands as a personal artistic statement - yet fits all head sizes.</p>

<p><b>Theta Nu Xi Multicultural Sorority, Inc. ΘNΞ</b> is the first <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multicultural.html" title="Multicultural">multicultural</a> <a href="../../../s/o/r/Sorority.html" title="Sorority">sorority</a> founded in the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southeastern_United_States_e721.html" title="Southeastern United States">Southeastern United States</a> and the fastest growing of its kind. In the spring of 1996, Founding Monarch Melissa Jo Murchison-Blake was in search of sisterhood. She wanted to be part of a family that openly embraced all women and crossed cultural boundaries. As a bi-racial woman, she did not want to choose between historically Caucasian or African-American sororities. Founding Monarch Murchison-Blake felt that if she did choose one, she would be denying half of her heritage.</p>
<p>Still wanting to be part of a strong sisterhood, Founding Monarch Murchison-Blake recruited six other women to join hands in her quest to found Theta Nu Xi Multicultural Sorority. At first, the Founding Monarchs were discouraged from fulfilling their vision. The Director of Greek Affairs advised them to consider joining an existing organization, expressing his concern that a new Greek organization, based on the principal of multiculturalism, would not survive at UNC-CH. However, the Founding Monarchs believed there was a need for such a sisterhood. Their efforts set the stage for Theta Nu Xi's presence in the Greek, non-Greek, and surrounding communities.</p>
<p>After much work and dedication, the Founding Monarchs built the foundation for Theta Nu Xi. Finally, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill officially recognized Theta Nu Xi Multicultural Sorority as the Alpha Chapter on April 11, 1997. With the collaborative efforts of the Founding Monarchs and the Sisters of Spring 1998, the organization grew beyond our expectations. The Sorority incorporated on April 29, 1999, and with the participation of the Alpha Chapter and Beta and Gamma Colonies, the National Organization was founded at the first annual National Convention on August 21, 1999.</p>

<p>The Benjamin Bowen House was built in 1812 for the founder of Newport (originally called Bowen settlement) Benjamin Bowen and his wife, Ruth Watson Bowen. Benjamin Bowen came to New York from Rhode Island and established a saw mill, a grist mill, a distillery, and the Newport Cotton Manufacturing Co. The Benjamin Bown House was built in the Federal Georgian style and is the oldest original building in Newport. The front of the house is dressed limestone while the north, east, and south sides of the house are field limestone. Although the windows, roof and porch have been replaced, the outside of the house appears very much as it did a century ago. The inside of the house has been remodeled as a bed and breakfast and is called <i>What Cheer Hall</i>. The house is on the New York State and National Register of Historic Places.</p>

<p>Stanchions are posts designed as a barrier and guidance system for crowd control. Many systems like Xtenda-Belt and TensaBarrier use a retractable belt mechanism that allows for quick reconfiguration options. There are many different post colors and belt color options available. Stanchions for crowd control are often used in places like airports, banks, movie theaters and other high traffic areas.</p>
<p>The original stanchions used a rope and post system which does not seem to be as versatile as the newer retractable tape style systems because these are can be configured in an infinite number of lengths and positions as your needs change.</p>

<p>\</p>
<p>Tripplus Launches 5-in-1 'No Worries' Travel Card Innovative product combines key services that greatly increase safety and convenience for under-30 travelers LOS ANGELES, April 10, 2006 -- Travel services company Tripplus LLC, in partnership with Travel Guard(R), ekit(R), and Ecount(R), announced the launch of the Tripplus Travel Card. With an eye toward safety, security and convenience, no young traveler should hit the road without one.</p>
<p>"The Tripplus Travel Card pulls together a package of services which help any trip go smoothly," noted Nick Thomas, travel industry veteran and President of Tripplus LLC. Thomas, who has spent his entire career in youth and student travel, sees a growing need for added service and security for young travelers. "We want the young traveler to concentrate on having fun and maximizing their travel opportunities, knowing that they have all the back-up they need," he enthused. "Tripplus offers solutions to common issues confronting travelers, and the support and protection needed in the event of a problem, all bundled into one easy-to-use card. Tripplus covers the loose ends that are often forgotten, are expensive, or just too time-consuming and complicated to figure out."</p>
<p>The Tripplus Travel Card incorporates 5 key features:</p>
<p>T+ Protect - Travel Insurance</p>
<p>3 different packages providing coverage up to $1 million (for Emergency Medical Transportation).</p>
<p>T+ Help - 24/7/365 Worldwide Assistance</p>
<p>Toll-free emergency, travel and concierge assistance services.</p>
<p>T+ Pay - ATM &amp; Debit Card</p>
<p>Spend at millions of locations worldwide. Get cash from ATMs everywhere.</p>
<p>T+ Link - Phone Card</p>
<p>International calls as low as 3 cents per minute. Voicemail and email included.</p>
<p>T+ Safe - Document &amp; Information Storage</p>
<p>Keep vital information safe and accessible. Retrieve it online or by fax anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>According to Thomas, cost-effectiveness really makes the Tripplus Travel Card perfect for budget-minded young travelers who want to make sure their money is working hard for them. "Card prices start at just $25. It's incredible value," he noted, "especially when you consider that cards are valid for one year from date of issue, can be used for multiple trips and extended stays overseas, and are valid for both domestic and international travel. Stick one of these in your travel wallet next to your tickets and passport," advises Thomas. "Then get out there and have some fun."</p>
<p>Three Tripplus Travel Cards are available, based upon the desired level of insurance coverage. All persons under 30 years of age at time of application are eligible to use the Tripplus Travel Card.</p>
<p>About the Company</p>
<p>Tripplus LLC is a Los Angeles-based travel services company committed to developing and delivering innovative products for the youth travel market. Founded by former President of STA Travel America Nick Thomas, Tripplus offers proven experience and product development excellence in the quest to help young travelers maximize their travel experiences while minimizing the worry, hassle and expense often associated with hitting the road.</p>

<p>(To the editor: If you take a look at the website for Bad Twin, it mentions "The Valenzetti Equation" as a novel that is out of print... The reason this subject should be stubbed is because the excerpt deals with a theme (numbers, world defence/security, end of the world) that pop up in "Lost" and in "Bad Twin" - It's all part of the greater mystery.

<p>nano geek- collective intel assoc- fish[boy]Ai</p>
<p><br />
The issues around nanotechnology closely resemble those of GM crops, a powerful new technology being rushed on to the market by profit driven corporations before even basic safety concerns can be addressed. The dangers of getting it wrong with nanotech are far greater and wider ranging than they ever were with genetic modification.</p>
<p><br />
The UK government is currently running a consultation on the regulation of nanotechnology. The only proposal on the table is a voluntary notification scheme for new nanotech products. This will give nanotech companies free reign to introduce nanomaterials into consumer products - unlabelled, untested and unregulated.</p>
<p>It is important that the corporations do not have a free run on the regulation of this new technology, but that everyone has their say in how and whether nanotechnology is introduced into our world. Please take part in the DEFRA consultation, and ensure that every section of society has its voice heard.</p>
<p>Tell DEFRA that their voluntary scheme is unacceptable â€“ tell them that they should act in a precautionary way and heed the warnings on nanotech. Tell them that their voluntary scheme is not good enough, that they should stop giving a green light to nanotech. We need a moratorium on nanotech now!</p>
<p>You can contact the DEFRA Nanotech unit at: Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Chemicals and GM Division Zone 4/F3, Ashdown House, 123 Victoria Street, London SW1E 6DE Tel 02070828104 Â Nano.technology@defra.gsi.gov.uk</p>
<p>To take part in DEFRAâ€™s consultation download details at www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/nanotech-vrs/index.htm and submit your response by 23rd June. If you want to express your opinions in person DEFRA are holding nano consultation meetings on Monday 22 May 2006 in London, and Wednesday 31 May 2006 in Liverpool. If you would like to attend contact: Â nano.technology@defra.gsi.gov.uk.</p>
<p><br />
If you are unfamiliar with the concepts, issues and dangers of nanotechnology, please read the following short introduction to the current situation and follow up the links to further reading.</p>

<p>Ever heard of nano-technology? Chances are you are already using it on your skin, wearing it in your clothes or maybe even eating it in your food. Despite a long list of danger warnings on nanomaterials (products made from nanotechnology) the UK Government, under pressure from industry, has decided that it does not want to regulate or be careful with this new technology. The Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) has proposed a rule that would give nanotech companies free reign to introduce whatever nanomaterials they like into consumer products - unlabelled, untested and unregulated. Just as they did with GM Foods, the government is playing for the corporations over a risky new technology. Itâ€™s time to cry foul and send nanotech offside. Tell DEFRA today that you want nanotech products taken off the shelves until they have studied the dangers and are prepared to regulate and label them. Remind them they are supposed to protect the public not the nanotech companies.</p>
<p>What is Nanotech? Nanotechnology involves the manufacture of invisibly small particles and new materials designed so that the atoms are arranged in new ways. By rearranging matter at this tiny scale traditional materials change their properties. For example zinc oxide, a chemical used in sunscreens, becomes transparent instead of white when it is made out of nanosize particles. Other materials become explosive, reactive or extremely toxic as a result of shrinking particles to the nano-size</p>
<p>Which products will use nanotech? Nanotech particles are already being used quietly in a wide range of consumer products. L'Oreal and Boots use nanoparticles in sunscreens and cosmetics, the Gap and Next are putting nanoparticles in clothes to make them stain and wrinkle resistant, Smith and Nephew are putting them in bandages while chemical company BASF are putting nanoparticles in food additives into drinks. Meanwhile Unilever and Nestle are working on nanoparticle ice cream. Unfortunately products that contain nanomaterials do not have to be labeled and the nanomaterials are far too small for the consumer to detect. The companies who are developing nanotech hope to incorporate nanotechnology across all consumer products in the next ten years.</p>
<p>Is it safe? Nanotechnology is a new set of technologies and safety studies have only just begun. However there are already a lot of warning signs that nanoparticles in particular are more toxic than larger particles and show the same health problems as particles that come out of car exhausts. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metal oxide nanoparticles (such as Zinc oxide) used in sunscreens have been show to produce toxic effects in skin cells and studies are now ongoing to see how deeply they can penetrate the skin.</li>
<li>A class of nanoparticles known as fullerenes have been shown to cause toxic effects in the lungs of mice, brain damage in fish and kill soil bacteria.</li>
<li>The Royal Society (the leading organisation of scientists in the UK) has warned that new nanomaterials should be tested as new materials, that environmental uses of nanoparticles should be prohibited and that any nanoparticles escaping from factories should be treated as hazardous. The Royal Society also recommended that any products containing nanomaterials be labeled for consumers.</li>
<li>In April 2006 a nano cleaning product called 'magic nano' was recalled in Germany after 76 people were admitted to hospital with breathing problems. Itâ€™s not clear what caused this but the German Authorities suspect that the nanoparticles in the product may be to blame.</li>
</ul>
<p>Is it fair? Nanotech is already changing the way things are made and may put many workers and small farmers out of business. For example, cotton, rubber and copper, on which the economies of several developing nations depend, all stand to be replaced by new nanomaterials. Just as biotechnologyâ€™s ability to manipulate genes went hand in hand with the patenting of life, so too nanotechnologyâ€™s ability to manipulate molecules has led to the patenting of matter. Corporations are already taking out broad ranging monopoly patents on nano-scale discoveries and inventions.</p>
<p>Who's behind it? The usual suspects. This technology is being developed first and foremost by the worlds most powerful countries and largest corporations. Not only is nanotech being developed to make large companies bigger profits but will also be used to develop powerful new weapons. Nanotech is dominated by the Fortune 500 companies. From computers to chemicals, from oil to pharmaceuticals, from cosmetics to food the likes of IBM, DuPont, Syngenta, Exxon, Pfizer, L'Oreal and Kraft are all involved in nanotech.</p>
<p>What is the government proposing? To do nothing! The government admits there is a problem but is afraid to upset the nanotech companies - therefore it is only going to bring in a very weak voluntary registration of nano-products. If there could be a problem all nanotech products should be taken off the shelves until they are properly understood.</p>
<p>What can you do about it? Tell DEFRA that their voluntary scheme is unacceptable â€“ tell them that they should act in a precautionary way and heed the warnings on nanotech. Tell them that their voluntary scheme is not good enough, that they should stop giving a green light to nanotech. We need a moratorium on nanotech now!</p>

<p><br />
The issues around nanotechnology closely resemble those of GM crops, a powerful new technology being rushed on to the market by profit driven corporations before even basic safety concerns can be addressed. The dangers of getting it wrong with nanotech are far greater and wider ranging than they ever were with genetic modification.</p>
<p><br />
The UK government is currently running a consultation on the regulation of nanotechnology. The only proposal on the table is a voluntary notification scheme for new nanotech products. This will give nanotech companies free reign to introduce nanomaterials into consumer products - unlabelled, untested and unregulated.</p>
<p>It is important that the corporations do not have a free run on the regulation of this new technology, but that everyone has their say in how and whether nanotechnology is introduced into our world. Please take part in the DEFRA consultation, and ensure that every section of society has its voice heard.</p>
<p>Tell DEFRA that their voluntary scheme is unacceptable â€“ tell them that they should act in a precautionary way and heed the warnings on nanotech. Tell them that their voluntary scheme is not good enough, that they should stop giving a green light to nanotech. We need a moratorium on nanotech now!</p>

<p>Apotropaic Buddhism is a theoretical division in the practice of Buddhist rites, and is considered to be part of a trinity, the other two being Nibbanic and Kammatic. From the Greek <i>Apotropaios</i>, meaning (to turn away), Apotropaic Buddhism refers to Buddhist rites, mantras, and sutras designed primarily to turn or ward away evil. The phrase, along with its two counterparts, was originally coined by athropologist Melford E. Spiro and his celebrated book "Buddhism and Society: A Great Tradition and Its Burmese Vicissitudes".</p>

<p>The messages of this book, entitled; "The Little Book: The Sound of the Seventh Trumpet" as revealed to Alejandro (Henry) M. Hayrosa on August 27, 1983 in the island of Mindanao, Philippines by the seven holy angels of GOD, are in three parts. They are the Seven Thunders (as concealed in Revelations, Chapter 10), the Everlasting Gospel of GOD (also concealed in Revelations, Chapter 10, verses 2 and 7, Chapter 11 verse 15, and Chapter 14 verse 6), and the Visions of the LORD's Great Day (the 1,000 years reign of the Kingdom of GOD on earth). The introduction of this book gives the reader on how the messages were revealed to Henry Hayrosa.</p>
<p>The messages of the book opens the hidden mysteries of GOD, creation, man, government of GOD, government of man, and many more. They open the hidden treasures in the Old and New Testaments of the Bible; such that they finally resolved all conflicting issues, theological "positions", etc.</p>
<p>This book is a must to finally know the Truth; wherein religion and science are in harmony with each other.</p>

<p><b>Radiant Logic's Virtual Directory and Integration solutions</b> provide a flexible, secure, and high performance Service Oriented Directory infrastructure for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identity Management and Directory Services</li>
<li>Enterprise Information Integration</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Overview:</b> The Role of Virtualization for Identity Management and Enterprise Information Integration</p>
<p>No matter what type of identity, directory or enterprise information project you tackle, there are two fundamental, conflicting business requirements that must be resolved before deployment.</p>
<p>Identity projects must be able to cater to changing needs. Adaptability and flexibility are key in a world where business models and processes continuously evolve to match market demands.</p>
<p>Organizations have existing sets of applications and IT infrastructure in production that serves existing needs well, but cannot or should not be modified. However, these applications have valuable identity information may be essential in new projects, if it were accessible in some manner.</p>
<p>In addition, most organizations want to leverage as much of the original, native functionality of its "off the shelf" applications without resorting to complex, tightly bound integration.</p>
<p>Without a proper identity infrastructure, these constraints can tremendously impact schedule, cost, and effectiveness of an IdM deployment. Projects such as access management, provisioning tools, and other identity-driven software need complete and integrated identity data. Each application, however, wants data it its own schema and tree structure, with a set of attributes that it can control. This is why virtual directory services are so critical today. Solving integration challenges, without modifying the original data source or application, is best achieved through virtualization. This is driving principle behind the RadiantOne Virtual Directory Server. <b>RadiantOne Virtualization Benefits</b> RadiantOne combines Virtual Directory technology with high performance directory services, dynamic access, integration and synchronization to provide a complete identity infrastructure. By using RadiantOne, enterprises can: Speed deployment of identity projects and easily solve complex integration requirements. Reduce administrative effort and cost associated with administering data in multiple locations. Provide the right infrastructure to painlessly accommodate future identity requirements. <a name="Sources_144" id="Sources_144"></a></p>

<p>Hess Trucks were first made in 1964 when Leon Hess wanted to make a fun toy for families during the holiday season. For 1.29 you got the Hess Tanker Truck which you could fill with water then squirt out a hose. Nowadays these trucks go for 1400-2000 dollars depending on condition. Hess has been making these toy trucks for over 40 years with 2005 being there 41st year.Introduced in 1998 during late Ma and early june they started putting out Hess minis which were replicas of previous trucks. These can be purchased for 5.99. The models that are considered most popular are the 1966 Hess Voyager which is the one and only boat, the 1980 Hess Training Van which many consider to be the finest one yet, and the 1999 Hess Space Shuttle which marks the new Millenium. The Hess Truck has evolved over the years by including numerous firetrucks, tankers, tractor trailors, and even a plane and a helicopter. There also rarer trucks that are only given out to certain people like the '95 and 2002 chrome which were given out at a stockholder meeting. These now go for anywhere between 700-2000. More recently they gave out a 2006 commerative truck to all the workers for the NYSE for the changing of there name from Amerada Hess Corporation to just Hess Corporation. Hess Trucks have evolved over the years but the trucks still bring happiness to children on Christmas and even to adlts when they see a Hess Truck.</p>

During his campaign he was sanctioned by the <a href="../../../r/e/n/Rensselaer.html" title="Rensselaer">Rensselaer</a> Rules and Elections Committee for the unauthorized display of a large campaign poster displayed on the Low Center for Industrial Innovation. The poster was in the shape of the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a> symbol, a play on words of his last name. As a punishment, he was required to obtain more signatures in order to run. During the 2006 election campaign, many of his campaign flyers were defaced or removed by unknown parties.

<p>Nanjing is a port city on the Yangtze River and hence lies in an area outside of the birthplace of Chinese civilization on the plains of Northern China. Because of this it has no reliable history prior to the Han dynasty, the first to rule an area roughly equivalent to modern China. The first bits of clear evidence concerning the site appear during the Spring and Autumn Period. The town was an important site for the forging of swords by the kingdom of Wu and was known as Yecheng (city of metallurgy). It is said to have been located on and around Yeshan Hill near the present-day Chaotian Palace and operated between 495 and 473 B.C. In 473 B.C. the state of Wu was conquered by the state of Yue which built a town somewhere in the vicinity to the south of today’s Zhonghua Gate known as Yuecheng. And during the Warring States Period the state of Chu built a town in the area in and around Qinglingshan Park, known as Jinling (gold mound). Finally, during the Qin and Han dynasties the area was known as Moling (hay mound). The city on Qingliang Hill was expanded at the end of the Han dynasty and a city wall almost six miles in length was built around the Chu city. This city is popularly known as the Stone City, (shitoucheng) and its remains can be seen in at Qingliang Park. All during these periods Nanjing was of only small political importance.</p>
<p>It is during the period of the Three Kingdoms and the Six Dynasties (between the Han and Sui dynasties that ruled a unified China), that Nanjing first became a major political center. During these times it was known by the names Jianye and Jiankang. During the Three Kingdoms Period, the city was the capital of the Kingdom of Wu, though it lost this distinction in 280 when the Jin dynasty briefly reunified China. Tradition holds that the first Wu emperor, Sun Quan, was buried on Meihua Hill just to the south of the Ming tomb on Purple Mountain. In 317 the emperors of Jin fled to Nanjing and made it their capital. It remained the capital of the six southern dynasties until 589 when the whole of China was again united under the Sui dynasty. During this period the rulers in Nanjing viewed themselves as the repository for Chinese culture as non-Chinese ruled the northern dynasties. Nanjing flourished economically and became a major production center for silk, ceramics and metalworking. Estimates put its population in the neighborhood of 300,000 households during this time. Buddhism made huge inroads into Chinese culture during this period and Nanjing had scores of famous temples; three of these being today’s Jiming Temple, Linggu Temple on Purple Mountain, and Qixia Temple to the northeast of Nanjing. The earliest of the grottos at Qixia Temple date from its establishment there in 489.</p>
<p>Though the conquering Sui sacked the city in 589. The Sui rulers were very worried that Nanjing might emerge as a center of resistance. To prevent this, they completely razed the city and went so far as to plow under the foundations of the buildings. Because of this, virtually no trace remains of the city prior to the Sui dynasty. Despite this destruction, Nanjing quickly recovered during the Tang dynasty and was an important economic center. After being devastated during civil unrest at the end of the Tang, it was rebuilt anew in 920 to serve as the capital of a local dynasty, the Southern Tang. The square walls of this 10th century city were the base that the first Ming emperor used when constructing his walls around the city more than 400 years later. The old walls lay along the same lines as the current southern wall with the Zhonghua Gate as the main south entrance. The eastern outline of these walls can still be seen on a map of modern Nanjing as the moat has survived in the form of urban streams. They ran north from Tongjimen to the east of modern Longpan Road and then west to the south of modern Zhujian and Guangzhou Roads past the south entrance to Nanjing University. From here there is less certainty where they lay. Some studies show them running south along modern Shanghai and Muchou Roads where they joined up again with the Ming walls at Shuiximen. Others show them looping around Wutaishan and meeting up with the Ming walls just north of Hanzhongmen. It appears that these walls were largely left standing when the new, improved Ming walls were built. They are mostly made of stone, while the other parts of the Ming wall that were clearly new are mostly made of brick.</p>
<p>This city had an inner walled area called the zicheng where the Southern Tang emperor had his palace city. The exact location of this palace city is not known, but it is know that the court had a summer palace and temples built on Qingliang Hill where the old Stone City once stood.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Approximate Relation of Various Nanjing City Walls</p>
<p>Nanjing was captured in 975 by the Song dynasty. During the Song period Nanjing was a provincial capital. When the Song capital at Kaifeng fell in 1126 the Song court fled to Nanjing temporarily before establishing a new capital in Hangzhou. During this period and during the Yuan dynasty, the former palace city was used as administrative offices for the local prefecture. The Song emperors used it as a detached palace, however, and improved and expanded it during their rule. The site of Fuzimiao, the Temple of Confucius, was chosen during this period and it served as the local state-run academy then and later. Apparently Chaotian Palace was the site of an important Taoist temple during this period and was later the Central Taoist Registry for Nanjing during the Ming dynasty, though none of the literature on site indicates this was so.</p>
<p>The first Ming emperor was proclaimed in 1368 and a great deal of preparation was done prior to this to have an imperial city and all the imperial trappings ready in time. The name of the city was changed again to Yingtianfu (responding to heaven). A "new city" was built to the east of the old one to be used as a new palace or "forbidden" city. This city was laid out in much the same pattern as Beijing; indeed Nanjing’s was the pattern for Beijing’s Forbidden City.</p>
<p>Today little remains of the Ming palace. In Wuchaomen Park, the remains of one of the Wu Gate still stands, and the stream with its five marble bridges just to the north are still to be seen. Little else remains. The Temples of Heaven and Earth were located just outside the city wall to the south of the modern Guanghuamen area, roughly where the railroad runs now between the Qinhuai River and the old moat. The gate in the wall here was called the Chengyang Gate but the name was later changed to Guanghua Gate. From here a bridge led over the moat to the Hongwu Gate. This was the main entrance to the palace city. A broad boulevard lined with roofed corridors led north from here to the Forbidden City. Known as the Imperial Way (yudao), it was flanked on the east with offices for five of the six ministries and with the five military commissions on the west. This road is still called Yudao Street today. Somewhere near modern Ruijin Road, the Imperial Way passed through a second set of walls at the Chengtian Gate and then on through a third set of walls at the Wu Gate. Each of these inner sets of walls was roughly square and was pierced by four gates in each of the cardinal directions. The moat from the innermost set is clearly visible on a map as the canals that surround the Old Ming Palace Plaza and Wuchaomen Park. The Imperial Ancestor Temple (taimiao) was located inside the second set of walls in the southeast corner, somewhere in the southeast corner of Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.</p>
<p>In expanding the walls, it appears the Hongwu Emperor intended initially to simply add a bulge to the existing walls and encompass the New City to the east. The main north gate would have been the Drum Tower. However, a decision was made to bring Lion Hill to the northwest into the city defenses for strategic reasons, and this almost doubled the area the walls would encompass. In addition to the surviving walls of stone and brick, an outwall was built along the river and to the south as an additional defensive measure. Old maps show that there were close to twenty walls in this rammed earth wall. This outwall is long gone, but the names of the gates survive as local place names. Part of the wall on the south shore of Xuanwu Lake was built on the foundations of the old Stone City walls from the Six Dynasties period, and reused many of the bricks from that old wall.</p>
<p>Originally, thirteen gates were built through Nanjing’s walls, but this number had grown to eighteen by the end of the Qing dynasty. Of the thirteen original gates, only Zhonghua Gate in the south, originally known as Zhubao Gate, and Heping Gate in the north, originally called Shenci Gate, are still standing. Heping Gate is closed to the public as it is still used as an army barracks. Parts of other gates survive or have been partially reconstructed. The remains of a west gate, Hanzhongmen, originally called Shichengmen, stand in the middle of a plaza. These walls are part of the last of a series of three or four courtyards that made up the gate complex. During the Qing dynasty three more gates were added, including an entrance to Xuanwu Lake from the west built in 1910. Yijiang Gate on North Zhongshan Road was built in 1921, as was the major entrance to the city during Republican times when most visitors to the city arrived by boat at the docks just to the west. Additional gates were added in 1929, 1932 &amp; 1954 to improve traffic and older gates were torn down for the same reason.</p>
<p>In addition, a new Imperial University called Guozijian was built just to the east of Jiming Temple where the Nanjing City Offices are located today. Records indicate that this school had an enrollment of almost 10,000 in 1422, many of these from foreign nations such as Korea, Vietnam &amp; Thailand. The office of the Ministry of Justice was built on the northeast shore of Xuanwu Lake, to the north of the city. The Censorate and the execution grounds were here also. The archives for tax a census records were kept safe in special warehouses located on the largest island on the lake. The lake and its environs were used mostly as a retreat for the imperial family and important court officials. In 1381 the emperor began work on his tomb on Purple Mountain and was buried there in 1398. This is the only Ming Tomb not near the other twelve in Beijing. (The Hongwu Emperor’s grandson and immediate successor, the Qianwan Emperor, either burned to death in the imperial palace or was sent away secretly to a monastery and has no imperial tomb.)</p>
<p>In 1402 the fourth son of Hongwu, marched from his base near Beijing and seized control of the state from his nephew. During this campaign many of Nanjing’s historical buildings, including much of the Forbidden City, were destroyed. Though reconstruction was begun, it was never properly finished as the new Yongle emperor moved the capital to Beijing in 1421. One major architectural work that Yongle managed to finish was the famous Porcelain Pagoda, which stood outside the city walls just to the south of Zhonghua Gate. This pagoda was considered one of the marvels of China, but was destroyed by the Taipings during their occupation of the city in the mid-1800’s. All during the Ming dynasty, Nanjing remained a secondary capital and was given its current name, meaning south capital at that time. It remained an important center of government throughout the Ming dynasty, but was clearly a second city to Beijing.</p>
<p>When the Manchu’s seized China in 1644 they made Nanjing the seat of government for the Viceroy of Jiangnan, an area consisting of modern Jiangsu, Jiangxi and Anhui provinces. They also changed the city’s name to Jiangning. The Manchu’s were concerned about retaining their ethnic identity while ruling such a vast country as China, and in order to separate themselves from the ethnic Chinese they set apart portions of the cities they conquered where only Manchus could live. To do so in Nanjing they built a new wall inside the city that gave them the area of the old palace city. The second wall of the Ming palace city was gone by then, but apparently the innermost wall was still standing. This wall ran north and south along modern Longpan Road and then east and west along modern Houzaimen Street. The Viceroy’s office was located just outside these walls on the site of a Ming Prince’s Palace where the republican-era Presidential Palace stands today.</p>
<p>The urban-rural mix during the Ming and Qing dynasties was very interesting. It was not the case that urbanization occurred only inside the city walls and there were many open fields inside. The old city was the most heavily populated area and the northwest of the city was mostly vegetable gardens and barracks for the local garrisons. The area south of Zhonghuamen was heavily urbanized and was the site of several important Buddhist temples including Baoen Temple, site of the Porcelain Pagoda. The area around Fuzimaio and the Qinhaui River was where many wealthy families lived. Hongwu had ordered a series of 16 state-run brothels built in this area to aid in attracting people to his capital. The main docks on the Yangtze River were located outside the city walls, of course. They were massed in two main areas. One was near the present docks to the east of Lion Hill and just south of the Yangtze River Bridge. These were the subsidiary docks, however, and the main docks were located on the river to the west of modern Hanzhongmen Road. The main road from the docks followed a man-made channel for the Qinhuai river dug in the 1370’s and passed through the outwall somewhere near modern Jiangdong North Road. This is where the main tax office was located and there were a series of markets found here as well. This area was also notorious as a pleasure district and was crowded with brothels. It then ran along Shuiximen Road into the city through the Sanshan Gate. Outside the walls the road was bordered on the north and south by a series of lakes. Of these only Mochou Lake has not been filled up.</p>
<p>It is hard to find information on the location of other pre-Taiping buildings, but it is known that a temple of the God of Literature was located on Jiangbai Street somewhere in the vicinity of Zhenghe Park. The Confucian Temple (called Fuzimiao, to distinguish it from other Confucian temples) was originally the site of the state-sponsored academy for the Nanjing area, fed into the national universities in Beijing and in Nanjing, itself. To the east of this was the Jiangnan Examination Scholl which served as the site of the highest level of imperial examinations during the reigns of the first three Ming emperors, but which held lower-level examinations after the transfer of the capital to Beijing. The school was one of the largest examination sites in China and had over 20,000 cloisters for those sitting for the exams at one point. These were all torn down during the first two decades of the 20th century to make room for the market stalls that now crowd the area.</p>
<p>Two counties, Jiangning and Shangyuan, had their yamen offices inside Nanjing’s walls along with the yamen for Yingtian prefecture. The first two were located in the block bordered by Zhonghau Road, Shengzhou Road and Zhongshan South Road, and near the corner of Hongwu Road and Baixia Road. The latter was located on Zhongshan South Road just across from Nanjing 1st Middle School. In addition, the city itself was divided into five wards (East, West, South, North &amp; Central) with offices inside the wall just east of Guanghuamen, just outside Shuiximen, south of Zhonghuamen, north of the Drum Tower, and across Hongwu Road from the Shangyun County yamen. Major markets were set up by the first Ming emperor just inside Tungjimen, just west of Xinqiao, and near Wangfuyuan.</p>
<p>In 1853, the city was captured by Hong Xiuquan and became the capital of his Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Hong built a huge palace complex, complete with a Temple of Heaven on the site of the Qing Viceroy’s offices. In addition, Hong built palaces for many of his important followers. These were built at Zhanyuan (for the family of Xiao Chaogui), at Chaotian Palace (for Yang Xiuqing), near Fuzimaio (for the family of Feng Yunshan), near the intersections of modern Baixia and Jiankang Roads (for Wei Changhui), and just north of the Drum Tower (for Shi Dakai). Most of this building and much of the building that predated it was destroyed in a three-day fire that was set when Qing troops recaptured the city in 1864. The city was so devastated that it took decades to recover. For example, even though the city was opened up to foreign trade by the treaties following the two Opium Wars, trade did not actually start until 1899.</p>
<p>When foreigners began moving into Nanjing in the late 1890’s they were given a foreign concession inside the walls in an area that had been mostly farmland prior to this. The European style buildings built as the homes of foreign merchants and for foreign legations can still be seen in the area north of Beijing West Road and to the east of the Jiangsu Provincial Offices. In 1911 Dr. Sun Yat-sen led the revolution that overthrew the Qing dynasty and a new government was established in the newly re-re-named city of Nanjing. The offices of this provisional government were set up on the site of the Taiping Palace. In 1912, the first president, Yuan Shikai, moved the capital back to Beijing. In 1928 when the Nationalist Party took control of the government, they proceeded to move the capital back to Nanjing. It was during this period that the Presidential Palace on Jianggang Road was built (atop the site where Hong Xiuquan’s residence had once stood).</p>
<p>The Japanese captured Nanjing in 1937 in a bloody takeover known as the "Nanjing Massacre" or the "Rape of Nanjing". Several 100,000 Chinese were slaughtered in the taking of the city and its aftermath. From 1946 to 1949 it was once again the capital of the Republic of China. When Chairman Mao proclaimed the People’s Republic of China on October 1st, 1949 the capital moved once more back to Beijing. Nanjing suffered a great deal from the Cultural Revolution when many of its historical relics were damaged or destroyed and many of its leading intellectuals were sent to the countryside for "reeducation".</p>

<p>This manor “antiently called Sibetesdone” or Sibbesdon according to Nichols, was part of John le Poter’s inheritance in the time of Henry I. Like most manors it seems to have changed hands several times over the centuries, passing to Thomas Corbett of Legh in 1420 and purchased by a family called the Keytes from Gloucestershire, who held it in the early 1600s.</p>
<p>The census of 1801 records that the village had a population of 45 families, or 220 people, mostly employed in agriculture. In 1803 about 740 acres in the parish was enclosed by Pemdock Neale, the lord of the manor, leaving a proportion to the rector, Thomas Neale “equal to the value of his uninclosed glebe and right of common”. In 1810 the manor of Sibson with 880 acres of freehold enclosed land and the advowson of the rectory, a newly-erected rectory-house, coach-house, stables, and yards, altogether worth about a thousand pounds was again offered for sale.</p>
<p>An engraved illustration of the church from 1793 shows the rectory and perhaps one of Pendock Neale’s tenants carting hay. [Nichols p.954]</p>

<p>9 1/2 miles north of Sankagiri, on the north bank of the Sarabhanganadi, was once the Kasba of a taluk under Col. Read, which was abolished in 1803. The predominant caste is that of the Sembadavars who style themselves as Bhaktars and own several oil presses and looms About a mile east of the place is the hamlet of Vellandivalasai which is a very old Catholic settlement and appears to have survived Tippu's persecution. It is famous for its Easter festival which lasts for five days and attracts a large number of pilgrims. A special feature of the festival is the nighty procession of ten images in festival cars with pyrotechnic honors. A passion play is also performed on the night of Good Friday in the open space in front of the church. Behind the church is a tomb surmounted by a Mantapam. The earth beneath the floor of the mantapam is eaten as medicine by all castes as an infallible specific against gastric pains and a considerable hole has been excavated by persons so afflicted.</p>
<p>This is one of the biggest panchayats in Sankari Taluk to be raised to the status of a Municipality soon, as it had a population of over 23,000 in 1951. the town has urban characteristic of a high school, police station, dispensary, veterinary center, market, bus stand, cinema theater, a milk supply co-operative society, reading room, park and a rest house. A scheme is under execution to supply drinking water from the Cauvery river barely 6 miles west. The weekly shandy meets on wednesday. It is also the headquarters of a panchayat union. There are a large number of weavers many of whom are in the co-operative fold.There is a co-operative for hand pounding of rice, for production of vegetable oils and castor oil, and for leather tanning. There are three big power looms producing art and cotton mixed sarees, towels and kerchiefs. Sugarcane is cultivated in the area from which jaggery is extracted. There are a large number of carpenters and blacksmiths who besides castering to the needs of the weavers make country carts. About 3 miles from this place, in Kullapatti, the geologists are probing the earth for atomic minerals.</p>

<p>Determining the novelty of the selection invention The problem of whether a claimed invention in relation to a selection invention is patentable may arise not only in the chemical, but also in many other fields. The Tokyo High Court made the first decision to grant a patent for a selection invention in the field of chemical compounds about four decades ago. After that, many people published studies on the ground of patentability of the selection invention, and the Court examined many cases with relation to their inventions, but many decisions were adverse to the applicant´ s interests. Are there any difficult problems as to proof of whether a claimed invention constitutes a selection invention before the Court? In the case where there exists an invention which expresses in a generic concept all or one part of its constituent features in a prior art invention, an invention which is expressed in more specific concepts than covered by that generic concept and has a limitation which is not disclosed in the prior art invention but contains selected constituent features necessary for specifying the invention, such an invention is widely recognized to be a selection invention. And the selection invention is patentable as an independent and distinct invention from the prior art invention, in the case where there exists an advantageous effect different in the kind of an effect provided by the prior art invention or a conspicuously superior effect (but this is an effect of the same quality provided by the prior art invention) to that provided by the prior art invention. The patentability of the selection invention depends on the problem of whether this invention is identical with the prior art invention (identicalness), and also of whether this invention involves an inventive step when compared with the prior art invention. The cases in Japan where the claimed invention is an invention described in a prior art publication, are divided into the following categories: (a) The claimed invention is the same invention as the prior art invention described in the publication. (b) The claimed invention is described in the publication. (c) The claimed invention is not distinguished from the prior art invention described in the publication. (d) The claimed invention does not constitute a distinct invention from the prior art invention described in the publication. In case (a), both inventions have the same object, construction and effect of the invention. In case (b), both inventions have the same construction of the invention, but a different object and effect of the invention. If the claimed invention has the same constituent features as the prior art invention, other factors ie the object and effect of the invention are excluded from consideration. In order to avoid case (b), the claimed invention has to be changed into a use invention. In case (c), an applicant cannot amend the definition or scope of the invention apart from a written specification in order to establish another invention different from the prior art invention. In case (d), the problem of whether the claimed invention constitutes a distinct invention from the prior art invention will be discussed; that is, the central problem of the selection invention. Recently, the Court made a decision which denied the constitution of a selection invention (1995 (gyo ke) No.218 // December 10 1997). This case relates to a liquid fabric softening composition comprising: (1) an aqueous base; (2) cationic fabric softening agent (ingredient A); (3) fatty acid (ingredient B); and (4) a non-ionic surfactant (ingredient C), wherein the mole ratio of A to C is within a specific range. On the other hand, the prior art invention relates to a fabric softening composition comprising: (1) an aqueous base; (2) A; and (3) B. This cited invention discloses the addition and the amount of C as one of the well-known adjuvants in the specification, but does not exhibit an example adding C. In this decision, the Court stated that all constituent features which were substantially described in the cited specification if not constituting the selection invention, and if not described, there thus existed no conspicuously superior effect within the specific range of the mole ratio of A to C when compared with the effect beyond this range. Summary The problem of whether the claimed invention constitutes a selection invention depends on the disclosure of the invention including the superior effect in the written specification, and the applicant is to note that the claimed invention is an invention described in the prior art publication.</p>

<p>Private Hytti incident is the best known Finnish military incident where an officer has shot his own disobedient subordinate without court-martial.</p>
<p>The incident happened in 1944 during the Soviet Summer Offensive 1944 in <a href="../../../i/l/o/Ilomantsi.html" title="Ilomantsi">Ilomantsi</a>. The infantry regiment where private Emil Hytti belonged, had been badly mauled in combat, retreated for days and the morale was universally low. The regimental commander, colonel S.O. Lindgren, who was known as an impetuous and trigger-happy soldier, then attempted to organize the men into counter-attack. As the men disobeyed, Col. Lindgren shot the nearest man, private Emil Hytti, who died immediately. He was married, and father of nine children. No investigation or examination was later made, as the Finnish Military Criminal Act allowed the officers and NCOs to shoot any disobedient subordinates without consequences.</p>
<p>The widow of Pvt. Hytti was denied any compensations or pensions, because his husband was not killed in action but shot by his superior. His nine orphaned children neither ever received any compensation or welfare.</p>
<p>The incident appears in litterature as a scene in <a href="../../../v/%C3%A4/i/V%C3%A4in%C3%B6_Linna_0cf2.html" title="Väinö Linna">Väinö Linna</a>'s <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Unknown_Soldier_a7a3.html" title="The Unknown Soldier">The Unknown Soldier</a>, where Lieutenant Colonel Karjula shoots private Viirilä from disobeying his orders.</p>
<p>Colonel Lindgren became later dubiously famous for forcing people who had trespassed his lands, to strip down their pants and march on the road halw-naked while he toted them with a shotgun and yelled insults on them. One of them was the Olympic shooter Pentti Linnosvuo.</p>

<p>Lata Berkoh is about 8 kilometers from the Mutiara Taman Negara resort and then about a fifteen minute jungle trek is required to reach it.</p>
<p>Lata Berkoh is a place of many small waterfalls and a swimming point for visitors. It is truly refreshing to swim in the water after the jungle walk. If you don't want to swim, you can just enjoy the view or search for colourful birds, otters and water monitors. Water monitors can be easliy spotted along the coastline of the forest and a bit far from the swimming point. They can also be seen swimming on the way to the place by boat.</p>

<p>The hard disk drive Silent Mode is supported only in conjunction with hard disks conforming to the ATA/ATAPI 6 (or later) standard, and is part of the Automatic Acoustic Management feature.</p>
<p>This function is implemented in the mainboard BIOS or in the driver software of the hard disk controller. Enabling the function produces a change in the operating mode of the servo controller of the read-write head. This causes the head to be placed in motion and decelerated softer than previously. The "grinding" noise typical of hard disks is thus reduced to a minimum.</p>
<p>A hard disk having an average seek time of 9ms in normal (i.e. maximum performance) mode will see this value increase to about 15ms in silent mode.</p>

<p>Symarip was a well known ska / reggae band in England, in the late '60's. Their best known songs were 'Skinhead Moonstomp', 'Must Catch A Train' and 'Skinhead girl'. Symarip was also the first black pop-group to do national television shows in the England. Symarip is also known as 'The Pyramids', 'Seven Letters' and 'Zubaba'. The band quit in 1985, also the year of their last album 'Drunk and Disorderly' (Ariola, 1985). The album was produced by Stevie B. Nowdays all the members of Symarip live across the world, still working with music. One of the best known artist that came from Symarip is Michael "Mike" Thomas. Mike is living in Finland with his family, and doing music with his band 'Saganor'.</p>

<p>Prior to the 1980s, foot prostheses merely restored basic walking capabilities. These early devices can be characterized by a simple artificial attachment connecting one’s residual limb to the ground. Insert non-formatted text hereInsert non-formatted text here</p>
<p>The introduction of the Seattle Foot (Seattle Limb Systems) in 1981 revolutionized the field, bringing the concept of an Energy Storing Prosthetic Foot (ESPF) to the fore. Other companies soon followed suit, and before long, there were multiple models of energy storing prostheses on the market. Each model utilized some variation of a compressible heel. The heel is compressed during initial ground contact, storing energy which is then returned during the latter phase of ground contact to help propel the body forward.</p>
<p>Since then, the foot prosthetics industry has been dominated by steady, small improvements in performance, comfort, and marketability.</p>

<p>Most companies choose to focus on two areas of performance: energy capabilities and ground compliance. Two particular models exemplify the innovation in these areas: the Elite foot (Endolite) and the Venture foot (College Park Industries).</p>
<p>The Elite foot relies on a polymeric material with a very specific set of elasticity and resistance requirements in order to optimize energy storage and return. It also uses an unprecedented three-pronged foot, which allegedly allows the foot to closely mold to the contours of any surface.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Venture foot retains the common one-point contact with the ground, but seeks to maximize performance (in both energy and compliance) with a complex metal heel component. This heel is equipped not just with a standard compressible foam piece, but also hinges which allow rotation on three different axes, allegedly yielding superior comfort (ground compliance) and a more precise mimicry of native foot biomechanics (energy capabilities).</p>
<p>Many other foot prostheses employ other useful innovative technology and designs. No one foot is perfect for all transtibial amputees. Hopefully, however, each amputee can find a foot that is best for his or her particular pattern of physical activity.</p>

<p>Most companies choose to focus on two areas of performance: energy capabilities and ground compliance. Two particular models exemplify the innovation in these areas: the Elite foot (Endolite) and the Venture foot (College Park Industries).</p>
<p>The Elite foot relies on a polymeric material with a very specific set of elasticity and resistance requirements in order to optimize energy storage and return. It also uses an unprecedented three-pronged foot, which allegedly allows the foot to closely mold to the contours of any surface.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Venture foot retains the common one-point contact with the ground, but seeks to maximize performance (in both energy and compliance) with a complex metal heel component. This heel is equipped not just with a standard compressible foam piece, but also hinges which allow rotation on three different axes, allegedly yielding superior comfort (ground compliance) and a more precise mimicry of native foot biomechanics (energy capabilities).</p>
<p>Many other foot prostheses employ other useful innovative technology and designs. No one foot is perfect for all transtibial amputees. Hopefully, however, each amputee can find a foot that is best for his or her particular pattern of physical activity.</p>

<p>Pruning the Hibiscus is a very complex sexual position that few can perform. The female/gay male must start off flat on the floor or bed. Then hold themselves up off the ground with their right hand and right foot only. The left hand and leg must be floating freely in the air. The male/other gay male is behind the partner engaging in the duty of performing.</p>

<p><b>Gentle Wind Project (GWP):</b> Described as "a not-for profit world healing organization....[with] a healing technology....along with telepathic abilities....designed to restore and regenerate a person's energetic structure when used one time in a person's life."</p>
<p>GWP was founded circa 1980 by <b>John "Tubby" Miller</b> and Claudia Panuthos (now <b>Mary "Moe" Miller</b>) in Arlington, MA, relocating in 1984 to Kittery, ME.</p>
<p>John Miller claims to receive <i>telepathic impressions</i> from the <i>spirit world</i> to create <i>healing instruments</i> that donators receive as <i>gifts</i> for set donation prices varying from hundreds to thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>In May 2004 GWP leaders filed a lawsuit in Maine U.S. District Court, consisting of Federal RICO (racketeering) and Lanham claims, plus state claims such as defamation, against several international anti-cult educators and two former followers who published stories on the Internet about their personal experiences with GWP during seventeen years as followers and board members.</p>
<p>The former members won their <i>Motion for Summary Judgment</i> in January 2006, resulting in dismissal of GWP's Federal claims and remaining state claims by <b>Senior District Judge Gene Carter</b>. In January 2006 GWP leaders refiled their lawsuit in Maine State Court (York County, Alfred, ME), consisting of the remaining state claims, against the two former members and one anti-cult educator from New Zealand. This GWP lawsuit is scheduled for jury trial in late fall 2006.</p>

<p>EQUAL is one recent stream of ESF Funding that is intended to be a 'test-bed' or 'pilot' for future ESF interventions. Founded on Principles (Equalities, Empowerment, Innovation, Mainstreaming, Partnership, Thematic, Transnational), EQUAL Development Partnerships have lasted through 3 Actions (1st - Research, 2nd - Delivery, 3rd - Assessment &amp; Evaluation for Mainstreaming) over two Rounds, and in a variety of Themes (e.g. Gender, Employability, etc).</p>
<p>In each EU country, a lead organisation (chosen by relevant government department) takes an effective Project Management role over the various Development Partnerships that take place.</p>
<p>It is not clear how effective EQUAL Programmes have been, nor whether the wealth of information collected and 'mainstreamed' is actually taken on board by stakeholders.</p>

<p>Twin to twin transfusion syndrome, or TTTS, is caused by a transfusion of blood from one twin to another during the second trimester of pregnacy. Normally, the donor twin is smaller at birth than the recipient twin. There is a 60-100% fatality rate only if is the TTTS is serious. TTTS only occurs in about 3-5 of 1000 preganancies.</p>

<p>Jackson Marsteller was born on April 16th 1989 in a suburb of Los Angeles. He is a really really really good looking man at 6 foot 195 pounds. He has been called "The Rainman" for his great knowledge of history. He has been named by his teachers "The King of Multiple Choice." He is planing to start a web-site this summer titled www.therainman.org. "This is only the begining" one teacher said, "One day we will be able to say that 'Hey I knew Jackson Marsteller back before he was famous'. He has lots of potential and I can't wait to see what he does with his life."</p>
<p>Jackson also has a cornucopia of varsity letters as he is extremely athletic and coordinated. His way with females is also amazing--girls have been known to faint as he casually walks into a room. He has a PHD. LIT-RALLY!</p>
<p>Mr. Marsteller is also known for his wildly hilarious and original "your mamma" jokes. For example: "Your mamma's so fat that when I slapped her, I could ride the waves!" or "Your mamma so fat that when she sat on a chair it snapped in two!" and the granddaddy of them all: "Your mamma's so fat that when she applied for a job, they said 'NO, BECAUSE YOU'RE TOO DAMN FAT!'"</p>

<p>A cookie is a maneuver performed while driving an automobile.

<p>Cookies are more easily performed on wet surfaces and also in the snow. When performed in the snow it is more often done to have fun than it is to make an earnest attempt at creating the circular skid mark pattern.</p>
<p>In the Australian outback, cookies performed in the dust or mud areas of land are colloquially referred to as "circle work". Displays are usually performed at Bachelor and Spinster Balls.</p>

<p>[edit] To perform a cookie Turn the steering wheel fully left or right, select first gear, with the clutch still depressed increase the revs well above the maximum tourqe point which should be between 3000-5000rpm for petrol engines. For "smoky" results get the engine speed just below the rev limit. Holding it there pop the clutch and floor the gas. The revs should be kept as high as possible and should not drop below the engines maximum torpue point. When the revs drop, the clutch can be depressed allowing the engine speed to "shoot" up and then let go at once enabling one to keep the wheels spinning.Word of CAUTION, this habit puts a lot of strain on the drive train, avoid doing this on asphalt or any other hard surfaces and dont expect your tires to last as a "hard core" cookie on asphalt will burn out your tires in anything from 2 to 15min, depending on the power of the car and aggressiveness of the spins.</p>

<p>Standard car A standard car can be one comercially available or a champion event car that has no "auto pilot" controls as such unlike specialised cookie cars. With a standard car you cant do much more as you need access to the accelerator pedal to perform the stunt. One such stunt could be to roll down the drivers window and sit on the door frame with your body and one arm and leg outside and the other arm and foot on the accelerator and steering wheel. As the gear stick and clutch pedal are out of reach the car would need to be moving before the stunt. Once ready the throttle is pumped to initiate and keep the car rotating at the correct speed, for added effect waving to the spectators. For left hand drives it goes anti clockwise and right hand drives clockwise this ensures that the centrifugal force throw the driver toward the car rather than away. Occaisionally drivers open the door and holding on to the roof and door frame, this carries a higher risk.</p>
<p>Specialised car A specialised car is usually a champion event car that has been given a type of auto pilot control that locks the steering wheel and throttle allowing the driver to perform more daring but also more dangerous cookies. To iniate the cookie is the same but once achieved the steering is held in place and the throttle is locked at the maxinmum allowing the driver to release the controls letting the car carry on by itself. Some things that could be done is the driver opens both doors and climbs out one side across the roof and in the other. This is very dangerous as the only hand holds are either side of the roof (which is a fair distance to reach) and the sudden change in direction of the centrifugal forces could catch out an unprepaired driver and throw them off the car. Others include getting out and walking round with the car as this video shows, however it also shows one of the dangers by a lapse in concentration as he waves to the crowd but stops walking and unfortunatley gets ran over.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-14_7fe1.html" title="Edit section: Cornelius Killick">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Cornelius Killick</span></h2>
<p>Cornelius Killick is a fictional character in the 'Sharpe' book series. Although his only appearance is in Sharpe's Siege, he played a vital role in Sharpe's adventure during that time.</p>
<p>There is not a great deal of private information known of him. What we do know of him is that he is an American who comes from Marblehead, Massachusetts, and that he masters a New England schooner called the <i>Thuella</i> (her name meaning 'stormcloud' in Greek). He is described to be younger than Sharpe (who is around 38 at this time), so he is probably in his very early thirties or so. The first description of him we see is once he appears in front of Ducos after having caused the Royal Navy some grievances at St. Jean de Luz. The description is as follows:</p>
<p>"He had a cutwater of a face; sharp, lined, savagely tanned; a dangerously handsome face framed by a tangled shock of gold-dark hair. It was battered, beaten by winds and seas and scarred by blades and scorched by powder-blasts, but still a handsome face; enough to make the girls look twice."</p>
<p>Back home, people know him to be a 'reckless rogue' who simply has one consecutive adventure after another.</p>
<p>He appears to be known quite well amongst the Royal Navy as Horace Bampfylde expressed particular delight in speculating what he would do with Killick once he had caught him: his view of Killick is that of an ignorant barbarian who is no more than a 'common and vulgar pirate', although this is a contrast with how other people such as Frederickson, Harper and Sharpe himself all seem to be impressed with Killick's mastery at the helm, as he is demonstrated with a simple <i>chasse mareé</i> dancing scorn about the Navy at the St. Jean de Luz port in the first chapter or so.</p>
<p>The novel suggests that the Commandant of the Teste de Buch fort, Henri Lassan, and Cornelius Killick have had a friendship of some sorts for at least a while as they seem quite familiar with each other. This is suggested at various intervals such as Lassan commenting that he prays for Killick's soul and Killick yelling at Sharpe near the end during the escape for him not to kill Lassan. Killick also makes numerous visits to the fort and even volunteers to fight against the Riflemen/Marine group coming from the South in order to drive them from the Teste de Buch fort. Once Lassan agreed, he put the plan forward to his crew and said that any of them could simply not participate at all if they didn't want to, but such was their faith in their captain and such was their liking for him, that the majority of them remained to fight with him.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, during that time, he underestimated the Riflemen and he and his men lost the battle, albeit with no bloodshed, due to his uncertainty of how to act in land-based warfare. They were then captured and taken back to the Teste de Buch fort- now under British control- to be hung. During this time, Killick and his Lieutenant, Liam Docherty, were treated brutally by Horace Bampfylde in an interrogation session after they were asked whether there were any Royal Navy deserters amongst them. This came as much of a shock to Frederickson as he had promised the Americans good treatment.</p>
<p>After talking with Sharpe, however, the English Major agreed to release them without Bampfylde's agreement after Killick told him a (false) folk story stating that if one hangs a sailorman in still airs, his soul will come back and take another for revenge. Sharpe, worried about the health and safety of his current wife, Jane, submits to it.</p>
<p>This came to be a pivotal decision though, as Killick proves to be Sharpe's only hope of escape during the assault on the Teste de Buch.</p>
<p>After their release, Killick, deteremined to keep the <i>Thuella</i> out of British interest so as they would not attempt to capture it, managed to fool them into thinking that his beloved ship was 'a ruined hulk' lying in the tides of the shores near the village of Gujan, with no prizes or riches to be found amongst it. During this time, however, he was also turned it into a floating battery, a fortress on land with all their guns facing out to sea in case a British ship did try and take it. His plan worked and Bampfylde decided to leave it there.</p>
<p>After a series of events due to Ducos' trickery, Sharpe finds himself and his men (50 troops altogether) stranded in the Fort, alone, without any assistance from the Navy and soon to be facing an onslaught over over 2,000 French troops led by Gerneral Calvet. It is during the prelude of the attack, that Killick pays a visit to Sharpe and talks to him, in a somewhat offhand way, about releasing Killick of his oath (one he had taken in order for Sharpe to truly release the Americans: it stated that he would never fight the British again), about Sharpe's predicament, and (somewhat randomly) about oysters. It was evident there that there was some light banter exchanged between the two at this time; this is possibly due to Frederickson's earlier statement that he thought the two were alike in many ways.</p>
<p>Finally, Killick's role in this book is most evident in the last few chapters. Ducos, having blackmailed him into taking part in the assault against the British-held Teste de Buch, orders him to fire at the enemy until they surrender. Though unknown to him, Sharpe goes to see Killick after this and makes 'the devil's pact' by relinquishing Killick's burdensome oath and instead taking on one of his own, to never fight the Americans, in order to have Killick rescue his men from the fort.</p>
<p>Thus the battle played out. The <i>Thuella</i>, towed by two longboats due to lack of wind, was rowed down in line to the Teste de Buch fort, where they did indeed fire. It was a mere three rounds until the ememy surrendered: albeit to the United States of America and not the French. Thus Killick took the fort, though the French, infuriated, attacked anyway. It became a battle for survival as the British raced to the long boats to the <i>Thuella</i> with the French cavalry chasing them along the beach. With miraculously few casualties to show for this, Sharpe and most of his men made it aboard the <i>Thuella</i>, thus escaping a seemingly impossible situation.</p>
<p>After this, Killick and Sharpe drunk brandy in his cabin, Killick inviting Sharpe to Marblehead to drink more when this war was over. He dropped the English off not far from St. Jean de Luz, as close as he could get without running into trouble with the Navy. He also recruited one of the Rifleman, Thomas Taylor (an American), to take him back to America presumably on his request. The last we see mention of him in Sharpe's Siege is him sailing westwards towards America.</p>
<p>He is mentioned a bit in the next book, Sharpe's Revenge, though only fleetingly by Sharpe and Bampfylde concerning the confusion about the supposed whereabouts of 'the Emperor's Gold', which Bampfylde suspects that Sharpe and Killick split between themselves, even though no such event occured. This is what Sharpe's Revenge deals with.</p>
<p><b>Trivia</b></p>
<p>-A commonly-heard and frequently-used phrase is 'Bugger me'.</p>
<p>-He seems to be fond of both brandy and women.</p>
<p>-He smokes cigars (a lot), and seems to be at a loss without them.</p>
<p>-He lost a tooth during the beating Bampfylde's men gave him.</p>
<p>-He likes raw oysters.</p>
<p>-An insult that hits him particularly sharply is to mention him as a future traitor to the American people, such as being compared to <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benedict_Arnold_6b5d.html" title="Benedict Arnold">Benedict Arnold</a>. (As Ducos did.)</p>

<p>Francis Bamdelay Olushoogu Botu was born in 1988 in the heart of Harlesden, London.

He has played with various band including The Bamedelay Boys, The Flower Bros, Cheap Tit and the Legendary C.U.N.T. With the latter having their debut single "Get Up You Lazy Wanker" enter the U.K Charts at #242. Francis, like his idol Prince, is known for his outrageous behaviour: in a recent statement he claimed to be a flower rather than human.</p>

<p>This word arguably does not exit; however, it has been unveiled that this word thus dubbed "comfortability" should be incorporated into the official dictionary of the English language. People often use it in daily speech, not realizing this is not a real word. I propose this word should be used in sentences such as: "The comfortability rating level of this chair is beyond superb." "Are you having comfortability issues?" "Let us compare present states of being via a comfortability gradient."</p>
<p>The official definition referring to: "Comfort; the condition of being comfortable"</p>

<p>Ryanville's independence from the United States was declared on May 12th, 2006, during a fire drill at Episcopal High School. The drill was staged by Ryan's cloud father so he could transport him to Memphis to complete his third task. Ryan promptly extended his roots and unleashed his powerful branch attack on the citizens of the city, demanding that they surrender the area to him immediatly. Initially, there was some resistance, as two firemen and a giraffe attacked Ryan in a desperate attempt to stop him from seizing the city. Ryan merely turned his ass and farted in their faces, killing them instantly with the deadly toxic nerve gases contained in the fart. Ryan's father then build a palace of <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pie_floater.html" title="Pie floater">pie floaters</a> for Ryan to command his new country from.</p>

<p>El Cuarteto Latinoamericano, fundado en México en 1981, representa hoy una voz única en el ámbito internacional, difundiendo la creación musical de América Latina en los principales centros musicales del mundo.</p>
<p>Integrado por tres hermanos, los violinistas Saúl y Arón y el cellista Alvaro Bitrán, junto con Javier Montiel, violista, el Cuarteto Latinoamericano ha sido considerado por el Times de Londres como "poseedor de un instinto que definitivamente lo coloca en la primera división de los cuartetos de cuerdas" y por el Houston Chronicle como "uno de los mejores cuartetos que hayamos oído en años". Galardonado en 1983 con el premio anual de la Asociación Mexicana de Críticos y en 2000 con el reconocimiento especial que dicha Asociación le entregó por su destacada trayectoria, el Cuarteto Latinoamericano realiza con regularidad giras por Europa, Norteamérica y América Latina. En el año 2000 el Cuarteto recibió también la Medalla Mozart que otorgan conjuntamente la Fundación Cultural Domecq, la Embajada de Austria y diversas instituciones culturales mexicanas. El San Francisco Chronicle lo describió como "un conjunto de primera clase, de temperamento apasionado".</p>
<p>Layectoria artística del Cuarteto Latinoamericano ha sido reconocida por el Fondo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes de México (FONCA), a través del proyecto México en Escena, en el marco del cual ha desarrollado un intenso programa de trabajo que comprende actividades pedagógicas, de difusión, de investigación y de conciertos durante el periodo 2004-2006.</p>
<p>El Cuarteto Latinoamericano ha jugado un papel decisivo en la formación de instrumentistas de cuerda en México y actualmente realiza su labor pedagógica afiliado a dos instituciones de enseñanza musical en México: la Escuela de Iniciación a la Música del Conjunto Cultural Ollin Yoliztli y la Universidad Carnegie Mellon en Pittsburgh, Estados Unidos, donde sus integrantes han sido contratados como Cuarteto en Residencia y Profesores desde 1987, además de una serie anual de conciertos para el Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes. El Cuarteto dicta con regularidad Clases Magistrales de música de cámara así como conferencias sobre música latinoamericana en las principales universidades de los Estados Unidos y Canadá.</p>
<p>El Cuarteto Latinoamericano ha grabado gran parte del repertorio importante para cuarteto de cuerdas de compositores latinoamericanos así como obras de Ravel, Grieg, Borodin, Gershwin y Puccini entre otros y cuenta hasta el momento con más de 30 discos compactos. El Cuarteto Latinoamericano graba para los sellos Elan, New Albion, Quindecim, Luzam, Urtext, Innova, Opción Sónica y Dorian, para el cual grabó la integral de los 17 cuartetos de Villa-Lobos, mismos que ha presentado en un ciclo de 5 conciertos en diversas ciudades, incluida la Ciudad de México. El sexto volumen de esta integral recibió dos nominaciones al Premio Grammy en 2002: como mejor grabación de música de cámara y como mejor disco de música de concierto latina. Otras grabaciones integrales incluyen las obras para cuarteto de Revueltas, Chávez, Ponce, Ginastera, Halffter y Enríquez.</p>
<p>Su primer disco compacto con Elan (2218) fue seleccionado por el New York Times como uno de los mejores discos del año 1989 y fue altamente elogiado por las revistas especializadas Schwann, Music and Musicians y Fanfare, así como por Le Monde de la Musique.</p>
<p>En Noviembre de 1992, el Cuarteto llevó a cabo la primera grabación del Concerto Grosso para cuarteto y orquesta de Julián Orbón con la Orquesta Sinfónica Simón Bolívar de Venezuela bajo la dirección de Eduardo Mata, para el sello Dorian. Esta misma obra ha sido interpretada por el Cuarteto entre otras, con las Orquestas Sinfónicas de Dallas, San Antonio National Arts Center de Ottawa, Canadá y la Filarmónica de Los Ángeles dirigida por su titular Esa-Pekka Salonen.</p>
<p>Entre los artistas invitados que han actuado con el Cuarteto Latinoamericano, figuran el violoncellista Janos Starker, el guitarrista Narciso Yepes, el tenor Ramón Vargas y los pianistas Cyprien Katsaris y Rudolph Buchbinder. Por su contribución a la vida cultural de las ciudades de Pittsburgh y Toronto, sus respectivos alcaldes le rindieron honores en noviembre y diciembre de 1991, mediante sendas declaraciones de "DÍa del Cuarteto Latinoamericano" en ambas ciudades.</p>
<p>El Cuarteto Latinoamericano ha sido objeto de reportajes y artículos en las principales revistas especializadas de música tales como The Strad (portada en enero de 1997) y Chamber Music America, así como en las principales cadenas de radio y televisión de Norteamérica, Latinoamérica y Europa.</p>
<p>Dentro de los conciertos recientes destacan presentaciones en el Festival de Wellington en Nueva Zelandia, Milán (Teatro alla Scala), Amsterdam, Bonn, Bruselas, Luxemburgo, Montreal, Madrid, Buenos Aires, Caracas, Los Ángeles, Miami, Boston, Washington y Nueva York (Carnegie Hall), presentación de la cual el New York Times escribió: "Artistas soberbios, extraordinariamente versátiles en responder a las demandas de las diferentes partituras."</p>
<p>Con motivo de los veinte años del Cuarteto el Fondo de Cultura Económica de México publicó el libro Cuerdas Revueltas&#160;: Cuarteto Latinoamericano. Veinte años de música, de la musicóloga Consuelo Carredano.</p>

<p>Digital Delay Generators, DDG's, provide single or multiple pulses that time, synchronize, trigger, delay and gate events. The time is digitally controlled and resolution can be as fine as several ps. Because these generators provide a full-scale range to seconds, coarser resolution of ns, us and ms are achievable since digital delay generators have many digits of time control.</p>
<p>Early digital delay generators provided a single channel of delay. This was sufficient for applications such as optical fiber dispersion testing and testing of radar and lidar systems. Later applications required more channels of synchronized timing and multi-channel delay generators became the standard.</p>
<p>Recent designs now provide the capabilities of both digital delay and pulse generators. Earlier digital delay generators provided mere edges that triggered devices or electronics while pulse generators provided both delay and width control without the fine time resolution. Current digital delay generators provide multiple channels each with delay and width control and the fine resolution. Each channel may also have pulse polarities and amplitude levels that are independent of the others.</p>
<p>Digital delay generator designs have migrated from discrete, analog designs using ramps, start-up oscillators to largely integrated, digital designs using FPGA's and ASIC's. The latter method allows the DDG to have more funtionality such as selectable reference's, combining timing to create more complex waveforms and having independent channel timing properties. For example, one channel may output a pulse with each trigger, another may output a burst of pulses, yet another may output a pulse for every N triggers. Gating the output of specific channels or of the entire delay generator is also achievable with newer designs.</p>

<p><b>Ryan Hebert</b> is a tree-class <a href="../../../o/v/e/Overlord.html" title="Overlord">Overlord</a> who has just recently completed his Three Overlord Tasks. He is the emperor of Ryanville and the Vice Vice Vice Lower Chairman of the Lower Board on the Overlord Council.</p>

<p>Ryan Hebert was born in <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pangaea.html" title="Pangaea">Pangaea</a>, sometime around 10000 B.C. to parents Choo-choo-peekee Hebert and <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother_Nature_e5df.html" title="Mother Nature">Mother Nature</a>. As a very young child, he moved to <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venus.html" title="Venus">Venus</a> for a short time with his father. They returned to Earth in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>, the year of the fall of <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>. He served in the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_of_Bulgaria_6c20.html" title="Military of Bulgaria">Bulgarian armed forces</a> until <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a> as a tire-changer. In <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a> his parents seperated, and his father gained custody. They moved to <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memphis%2C_Tennessee_649e.html" title="Memphis, Tennessee">Memphis</a>, but after only one human second, Ryan's father got sick of him and he dumped Ryan in <a href="../../../b/a/t/Baton_Rouge%2C_Louisiana_6596.html" title="Baton Rouge, Louisiana">Baton Rouge</a>. This served two purposes: Ryan's father hoped that Ryan would return home as a fully-sprouted tree Overlord, and he was simply tired of dealing with the little shit.</p>

<p>In the year <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, Ryan's dad began to realize that his son would never become an Overlord without some assistance. Choo-choo, however, did not wish to spend anymore energy on his child, so he sent two hurricanes (<a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Katrina_e7df.html" title="Hurricane Katrina">Katrina</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Rita_540c.html" title="Hurricane Rita">Rita</a>) to destroy his son, both of which missed due to the fact that his meek little pea of a son was too small a target. Finally, a year later, Ryan's dad gave in, and arranged for Ryan's class to take a field trip to Memphis. There, he discreetly sent instructions to Ryan through his friends Tim Donald-Davis, Justin Ross, and Stewart Tassin. It took Ryan's unusually small brain a little while to comprehend what he was being told, but eventually he caught on and began his tasks.</p>

<p>Ryan's first task was to successfully eat the entirety of his chicken caesar salad, which he failed to complete due to the fact that some of his food went flying in the wind (which his father made on purpose to challenge him). As a replacement task, Ryan had to successfully toe into the waters of the <a href="../../../m/u/d/Mud_Island_9920.html" title="Mud Island">Mud Island</a> museum, which he completed, with some difficulty. His second task was completed just a few days later, when he succeeded in pulling down a mesh window cover on the busride home to <a href="../../../b/a/t/Baton_Rouge_2a4c.html" title="Baton Rouge">Baton Rouge</a>.</p>

<p>Ryan soon became disillusioned with the idea of becoming an Overlord, which greatly angered his father. Time after time, Choo-choo sent Ryan tasks, and Ryan ignored them completely. His father started to realize that Ryan was not meant to be the Overlord of Earth (as was planned for him); that the best he could do was rule a city. And then it struck him. Choo-choo planned to make Ryan's third task to defeat the city of <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokyo.html" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> with nothing but a basket of <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oranges.html" title="Oranges">oranges</a>. But Ryan ignored this task as well. Ryan's father had to give him an even more insignificant city to conquer, so he decided on Memphis. It took about a month to finally convince Ryan to get up off his lazy ass and go finish his third task, but Ryan finally completed it on May 12th, 2006. He was made a full Overlord (much to the dismay of his superiors) and became emperor of his new country Ryanville.</p>

<p>In his spare time, Ryan enjoys playing with his <a href="../../../n/i/n/Nintendo_DS_b235.html" title="Nintendo DS">Nintendo DS</a> games, especially the Polly Pocket series, and throwing frisbees like a total pussy. He also enjoys listening to techno remixes of <a href="../../../27/n/_/%27N_SYNC_b678.html" title="'N SYNC">'N SYNC</a> songs.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-14_7fe1.html" title="Edit section: DeepThinka Records">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">DeepThinka Records</span></h2>
<p>An independent record label consisting of talented emcees and producers aimed at preserving both the music and the culture of hip-hop, which are by nature inseparable.</p>
<p>Founded in 1997, DeepThinka Records' main objective from day one has been to differentiate itself among the overabundance of indie-labels by redefining what a hip hop record label is and can be. This redefinition effort is made possible in part by providing an environment conducive to artistic expression, minus business and politics. DeepThinka aims to bring the artist and their sound to the forefront, placing emphasis on the music rather than the business. DeepThinka's entire staff is composed of hip hop artists themselves, from the president to the promotion coordinator to the radio servicing director; we're all hip hop, we all place good music before all else. Over the years DeepThinka has dedicated itself to expressive artistic revolution, classic wordplay, skillful and innovative hip hop, industry revolt and reform, political/social development, and mental awareness and consciousness.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
DeepThinka: A History</p>
<p>1999/2000: DeepThinka first got on the map with O.R.I.O.N., a 12-track compilation from a collective known as the Immortal Micunion. The highly acclaimed CD came in an era known for sub par musical output and focused on awakening ourselves and our culture from the deep creative slumber we had fallen into. Following that was a 2000 release from the Cleveland duo Rime Royal, entitled Illa Godz. The CD expanded on O.R.I.O.N. and solidified metaphors and rhyme skills as the tools of the trade.</p>
<p>2002: After taking a year to assess the industry landscape and organize its efforts, DeepThinka came back in 2002 with four groundbreaking records in one year. First, the Immortal Micunion-showing no signs of a sophomore slump-released A Declaration of Independents, a scathing 20 track album and accompanying 12" that tore into the record industry and challenged the current social structure. Then the Cinemaddicts surfaced, combining jazz, funk, poetry, filthy graffiti mindsets and Dosteyevsky into an album entitled Notes from the Underground. Notes… brought us back to the early nineties hip hop, and this trip back in time gave way to a rebirth of hip hop, moving it forward and bridging the renaissance of 1991-94 with the current day. In July, longtime DTR fixture Rime Royal dropped the Royalties EP in limited release, and the only problem was that the demand exceeded supply. Finally, October saw Edotkom bring a whole new dynamic to DTR's discography. Their debut album Obsidian represented a dark and introspective look into the group themselves, as well as the hip hop landscape. The CD marked a next level of sorts for DTR, continues to receive acclaim throughout the industry, and is setting a new standard for all artists to follow.</p>
<p>2003: Started in typical DTR fashion, with two innovative new redefinitions of what hip hop is and can be. First, Brooklyn emcee Loki da Trixta cutting through the chicanery and falsehood of modern day hip hop with his debut LP, Mythology - a blend of quirky jazz, feel good humor, social statements, and clever historical references. Followed by Rime Royal's Furious dropping Beats to the Rime Vol. 1, a compilation of emcees repping 216, 716, and 718; all bringing diverse styles together over Furious' new breed of production. The year was capped off by X-Now's Boy Meets World EP; a superb collection of tracks from the Buffalo emcee featuring an all-star lineup of beats from T1X, General Spade, Tone @las, and Furious1. Among the tracks was the previously unreleased "Incident at 6/14/02", an T1X produced anti-police posse cut--actually recorded the morning after a melee involving the BPD and cast of emcees who blessed the track: X-Now, Ajent O, Rime Royal, Pseudo, Intricate, and Loki da Trixta.</p>
<p>2004: Kicked off but the much delayed and highly anticipated debut from Cleveland quartet Spittin Image, entitled Broken Mirrors. A grimey, intimate portrait of life, the album's production is handled mostly by groupmember Fitty, but also finds supporting beats from T1X &amp; Furious, Krossword, and Rough Draft. Spittin Image worked the entire 2003 to get the record ready, and it did not disapoint--winning Hip Hop Album of the Year in Cleveland. Additionally, just weeks before departing on a bicycle tour from Buffalo NY to Pine Ridge, SD (an on to Denver, CO) DJ Cutler dropped Lettuce Arise, one of the most prolific mixtapes of the last ten years, featuring classic renditions of Dead Prez/Bob Marley's "Hip Hop/Jammin" and Thelonius Monk's "Little Rooti Tootie". Rounding out the year was the Victims of Reality EP from former Spittin Image alum Analog, mixtapes from Rhyson Hall - The Sleeper, Vol's 1 + 2, Gr&amp; Phee - Hiezmen: Stone City, and the debut 12" from Siege Heart of the Game b/w Cyanide.</p>
<p>2005: DTR's most chaotic, and yet most progressive year to date. Expansion has sprouted a brand new movement of dedication and artistic integrity. Mix CD's were the key component early in the year with offerings from Gr&amp; Phee (Attack of The Fly Snuka), X-Now (On My Way To School), and DJ Cutler (Idle Records and Empty Growlers). Following this came the long delayed debut of Rhyson Hall, in the form of a 12" single entitled "STILL RAW", which ended the year #6 on college radio charts throughout the US and Canada. All to be followed up with Mr. Hall's collaborative CD release with Gr&amp; Phee, "Detained at the Border" in 2006. Be on the lookout!</p>
<p>Looking ahead, DeepThinka Records has reorganized its collective in preparation for the highly anticipated, REBEL RADIO II. New heads are on board, some of the familiar faces have departed, yet DTR still plans to change the way it all works. The team is organized, the masses are awakening, the world is challenging old thought, and DeepThinka is coming to the front lines. The entire roster is developing new ways to exist as a unique label, news ways to push creativity and innovation even further, new ways to redefine the record industry, and-most of all-new ways to bring dope hip hop to ears and minds everywhere.</p>

<p>IF YOUR NAME IS SKEET S. PLEASE LEAVE THIS PAGE,</p>
<p>ANYWAY, Devin Mullin is an interesting man whose name is not to be repeated, for fear of him hearing you and eating your heart/any small children that happen to be in the vicinity. He enjoys listening to music, particularly tunes about potatoes, women and violence, as he is Irish. If he ever asks for "pop" understand that he is making fun of you because you are from boston, not that he is pining for a soda. He also enjoys all forms of supervised study hall, and ms. adardour, as she comes in many shapes, sizes, languages, and varieties of breakfast cereals. He actually despises one person in our social group who is constantly on this site "wikiing" his way to spiritual and physical enlightenment (bobby the knuckles) but is afeared of him for worry that he will awaken one morning to find his knee and elbow caps broken. Never ever ever cut his hair, even if he asks you to, because this small act will relinquish him of his strength forever. If you ever hear these phrases:</p>
<p>"SNOOCH TO THE NOOCH"</p>
<p>"FAT BOTTOM GIRLS YOU MAKE THE ROCKIN WORLD GO ROUND"</p>
<p>"OG GLIMMER GLEN'S BLOCK IS HOT!!"</p>
<p>Then know that you are near, and take the time out of your busy hill school, chick chasin, or poser lookin day to meet this person. But beware the floating eye of death and the fierce midget pirates of willygoat.</p>

<p>The swap statement, variable&#160;:=: variable, is an alternative to the assignment statement commonly found in most <a href="../../../i/m/p/Imperative_programming.html" title="Imperative programming">imperative</a> <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer.html" title="Computer">computer</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/Programming_language.html" title="Programming language">programming languages</a>. If the assignment statement is used to copy the value of an object represented by a large data structure (e.g., a list or tree object), it is inefficient. If the assignment statement is used to copy a reference to a non-trivial object, instead, it creates an <a href="../../../a/l/i/Aliasing_%28computing%29.html" title="Aliasing (computing)">alias</a>; aliasing makes it difficult to reason about program behavior. A swap statement differs from an <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assignment.html" title="Assignment">assignment</a> statement in that it is both fast and avoids aliasing. This is because the swap statement, when implemented properly, exchanges references to participating objects in constant time, leaving objects with unique references if they start with unique references.</p>
<p>The swap statement is especially useful for inserting and removing objects of a generic type from a collection object, without having to copy values or references. However, when a swap statement is used to insert, for example, callers must be aware that they no longer have access to an inserted object unless they first remove it explicitly.</p>
<p>Resolve, an imperative language used in research and designed to build verifiable software, uses swap statements instead of assignments. Tako is a compiler for CleanJava that enhances Java with a swap statement. C++ standard template library classes include a swap method.</p>

<p>Gamma Squad had clone Vat error due to several Kaminoan mistakes, it is still unknown whether the "errors" were intentional or not. The Kaminoan had the aggresion of the Squad Sniper, Ripper, had his aggresion boosted ten-fold. the intelligence of Fiver, the second in command, had a surprisingly large intelligence boost. The squad leader, Sarge, had his file swapped with that of an ARC file. Arctic, the squad demolitions expert had, to the cloner's surprise, absolutely no error or damage to his file. The squad however went on to several succesful missions at Byss, Geonosis, and Felucia. However they were sent to follow and defend <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delta_Squad_43b3.html" title="Delta Squad">Delta Squad</a> at Kashyyyk, however they were cut off and unable to catch up with Delta. They got to the Anti-Aircraft gun area to look for Sev. Unfortunatley they never found him and were forced to leave Fiver, Ripper, and AJ behind. Three hours after the commando retreat, they were declared MIA. That was the final mission of Gamma Squad.</p>

<p>Le "vestraete" est une espèce sympathique et rare, on repeuple d'ailleurs actuellement les forêts de pyrénées de nounours a son image.Loin de montrer ses griffes, "Terry" est un être agréable, d'une extrême douceur et sans complexes académiques.</p>
<p>A l'initiative d'un des plus grand paradigme entrepreneurial contemporains, il est a l'origine de l'ecole de pensée néo-praxologique, et le chef de file d'un mouvement de deux chercheurs. L'un de ces fidèle serviteur, le "ptipion", est une espèce en voie de disparition. La particularité de cet animal est qu'il vit en parfait symbiose avec le "vestaete". Ce couple fonctionne a l'image de ce petit oiseau qui nettoie les plaies du rynocéros dans les contrées africaines. Ils constituent un véritable ecosystème à eux deux.</p>
<p>Trop peu étudié, leur étude ouvre la voie à de nombreux travaux universitaires et nous encourageons les zoologues à entreprendre des recherches concernant aussi bien les habitudes alimentaires que leur accoumplement qui n'a jamais été observé jusqu'alors.</p>

Thus, the andalites, compassionate as they are, bestowed him with fire and the body of a python. Now, he languishes about on his favorite branch in the Amazon, occasionally devouring a fortunate tourist.

<p>Maktab Sultan Abu Bakar, which is also known as English College(EC) is a premier school located in the southernmost state of Malaysia, Johor. It is located in the bustling city of Johor Bahru and caters for students studying in the secondary level of education in Malaysia.</p>
<p>English College was set up on the 21st of March, 1914. Its initial enrolment comprised 21 selected students from the Bukit Zahrah School. The first site of EC was in the area of the Sungai Chat palace. The students were to study under the tutelage of two European teachers namely Mr. Morrison and Mr. Holman. These 21 students were the pioneers of EC and they formed the nucleus of the present English College or Maktab Sultan Abu Bakar. Today, things are very much different, from the increasing number of students, to its expanding facilities and to its stature of being one of Malaysia's premier schools.</p>
<p>From the humble beginnings of the college, Maktab Sultan Abu Bakar has transformed itself into a college that is renowned not only in academia, sports but a variety of other areas, be it interstate or nationally. Many of its graduates go on to become national leaders, successful entrepreneurs and national athletes that not only do the college proud, but also the Malaysian nation.</p>

<p>The Jackpot is a circular double-walled pot which is placed on the top of timber mine props and then inflated using water at pressures of 120 - 140bar (~2000psi). Made from two steel pressings welded together and fitted with a non-return valve, Jackpots are an economical way of achieving "active" support underground at the time of installation - with pre-loads on the mine props of 15 - 60 tons. Invented in 1997 they are manufactured New Concept Mining in South Africa and are now used around the world to support the roof in underground mining operations.</p>
<p>The immediate roof support provided by Jackpots greatly reduces the chances of rock falls - the single biggest cause of fatal accidents in underground mining. Jackpots have a number of patented features which improve their performance - the "roll-over" design is very flexible and accomodates uneven rock and timber geometry. Newly introduced is a dual-purpose filling valve with an integrated pressure release valve. The PRV provides for controlled yielding of the mine prop at a set load thus preventing catastropic failure of the prop due to closure of the excavation.</p>

<p>Scat or 31 is played with two or more players. The object is to obtain a hand with all the same suite as close to 31 as possible. All number cards are worth their face value, picture cards are worth 10 and aces are worth 11. If you get three of a kind it equals 30 1/2. to end a round you must knock one your turn which gives the remainder of the players one more turn. If you have 31 with two face cards and the ace of a suite it is an automatic win or scat and that hand automatically ends. if you obtain 31 with one face card the ten and the ace of that suite you only have 31 and still must knock to end the game.</p>
<p>To begin everyone is delt 3 cards and the rest of the deck is left as a means of picking up cards, the first discard is also flipped by the dealer. Often the game is played for a few dollars based on knocks which is how you end a hand. So if you are the loser of a hand you lose a knock. if you knoock and still loose(have the lowest hand) then you loose two knocks. If someone scats then everyone except the person who scatted loosed one knock. the game continues untill only one person remains with a knock.</p>

<p>- Lowered blood pressure - Improved cholesterol profile - Supplement stronger bones - Younger, tighter, thicker skin - Hair re growth - Wrinkle removal - Increased muscle mass - Reduced body fat - Higher energy levels - Increased exercise performance - Re-generation of major organs that shrink with age - Greater cardiac output - Superior immune function - Enhanced human sexual performance</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jintropin.cn" class="external text" title="http://www.jintropin.cn" rel="nofollow">JINTROPIN</a> stimulates linear growth and increases growth rate in children who lack adequate endogenous growth hormone. In adults with growth hormone deficiency, JINTROPIN reduces fat mass, increases muscle mass and improves energy, vitality and subjective well-being. In patients suffering from severe burns, AIDS associated muscle wasting, or undergoing major operations, JINTROPIN promotes wound healing, attenuates the protein-catabolic response and improves whole-body nitrogen economy after operation. Bodybuilders use JINTROPIN because it promotes growth of new muscle cells and uses body's own fat as energy source.</p>
<p><i>Jintropin</i> and Lily's <i>Humatrope</i> use secretion technology which produces a 191 amino acid sequence growth hormone, with much less E.coli protein contamination and no side effects associated with injection, such as red painful welts. This technology also has the advantage that growth hormone produced using secretion technology is very stable; it remains stable at 37C (98F degrees) for over 30 days (45C degrees for over a week). While growth hormone with 192 amino acid sequence is stable at room temperature for only a few days.</p>

<p>The SMU Economics Society is the essence of student life in Bachelor of Science (Economics) Community at the Singapore Management University.</p>
<p><br />
Founded by the pioneer batch of economics undergraduates in 2002, the society has established itself as the student representative body of all SMU undergraduates reading the Bachelor of Science (Economics) Programme. All economics students in SMU are automatically a part of, and hence represented by, the SMU Economics Society. The society is:</p>
<p><br />
<b>1. The voice of all BSc (Econs) students in SMU</b></p>
<p>The society meets the needs of all econs students by being their voice to the faculty, school administration and external bodies. As well, through the society, students have access to a wide network of contacts in economic related fields, including the Economic Society of Singapore, the World Bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore etc.</p>
<p><br />
<b>2. The catalyst for camaraderie in the community</b></p>
<p>Dinners, End-of-Semester events etc, organized specially for students for them. These events serve as a platform to interact informally with faculty and fellow students. The student-faculty gap has since narrowed through the years.</p>
<p><br />
<b>3. The ones who bring Economics to SMU</b></p>
<p>The society organizes talks and seminars by prominent economists, agencies, and faculty to bring into campus the insights, updates and cutting-edge research findings of global economies. The peer-led online journal also presents students the chance to share their views and thoughts on current and interesting economic issues.</p>

<p>YahEh is coming along… slowly. I am not just updating my last version, but building a completely new one fresh. It should still look and feel like it used too, but be more efficient and not depend on the main chat window like most clients do. I would appreciate it if people would post on the forum any ideas or suggestions for the new version. Also I would like some feedback on an idea I have. If every day or two I posted an incomplete version of what I have done up to that day, along with a text explaining what I have done and left to do, would anyone even follow it? If nobody is going to, I don’t want to waste my time doing it.</p>

<p>In the computer gaming community, The Enclave is a semi-professional and multi-faceted gaming affiliation. The Enclave as achieved fame and infamy in a large amount of the games they have participated in largely due to their intrepid and at times bombastic behavior. The Enclave has won championships in <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rainbow_Six_ab0b.html" title="Rainbow Six">Rainbow Six</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/g/Rogue_Spear_1ac9.html" title="Rogue Spear">Rogue Spear</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_Fortress_Classic_5188.html" title="Team Fortress Classic">Team Fortress Classic</a>, and <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planetside.html" title="Planetside">Planetside</a>.</p>

<p>The Enclave was first established in January of 1998 as a Rainbow 6 gaming clan on Mplayer. The Enclave held the title of champions for 2 years in <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rainbow_Six_ab0b.html" title="Rainbow Six">Rainbow Six</a> and one in <a href="../../../r/o/g/Rogue_Spear_1ac9.html" title="Rogue Spear">Rogue Spear</a>. The simplistic style of gameplay and use of tactics of the Rainbow Six Genre appealed to many members of The Enclave.</p>

<p>Having completely commandeered the R6 scene and with <a href="../../../m/p/l/Mplayer.html" title="Mplayer">Mplayer</a>’s sellout to Gamespy Industries the Enclave looked towards Team Fortress Classic for their next game. However, The Enclave failed to achieve the instant success they had in Rainbow Six. After a few months the decision was made to join CLQ and start partaking in tournaments. Establishing soon after, SOPs or Standard Operation Procedures for TFC maps such as Well2, NML, CZ2 and others.</p>
<p>The Enclave were responsible in creating several of the most popular maps in TFC tournament history such as the Wstland series (1, 2, 3 and 4) and the ever popular and self titled map "Enclave" which was used in nearly every single league after the fall of the CLQ.</p>
<p>The climax for The Enclave in TFC was their victory in the 10v10 <a href="../../../c/l/q/CLQ_fe5f.html" title="CLQ">CLQ</a> championship match against "DNoD" - the top tier clan from QTF and previous CLQ champions for 99'. This was considered by many to be the most controversial championship of the CLQ in that the clan who won won it was on a map one of their members made. After a 2 year <a href="../../../c/l/q/CLQ_fe5f.html" title="CLQ">CLQ</a> championship reign, many of the members were experiencing severe burn out, many left and were never heard from again and the lost passion to play quickly lead to the Enclave becoming, according to many of its members, a shell of it's former self.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the Enclave's claim to MMO fame, The Enclave quickly became the most effective yet controversial outfit in all of Emerald/Konried. It’s reputation for being a brutally effective yet culturally uncouth group of players spread across multiple communities and their precense lives with the remnants of the planetside player base to this day. The Enclave pioneered and improved upon the most tried and true tactics and strategy on both a global and planetary scale. The Enclave unlike no other outfit was capable of pulling off impressive feats of organization, at it’s prime it’s numbers swelled to over 300 and with this they were able to run the most effective combined arms operations in all of PS. Early in 2005, with the advent of BFR’s and dwindling interest in the game, the Enclave decided to leave. In little over 1 year The Enclave accumulated 6.9 million outfit points, the highest on its server across all three sides to this day. Beating out outfits with twice as many members and who played for twice as long as The Enclave did.</p>

<p><a href="../../../w/o/r/World_of_Warcraft_d385.html" title="World of Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> was The Enclave’s first experience in MMORPGs. The Enclave played on the server Bleeding Hollow and later Mug’thol. The Enclave achieved numerous milestones such as becoming the first guild on #REDIRECT Bleeding Hollow with a charter and a tabard, as well as becoming the first guild to have 5, 10, 25, and then 50 level sixty characters. The Enclave focused almost exclusively on PvP. However, one and a half years after World of Warcraft’s release date it dawned on The Enclave's members that in order to compete in the game’s “endgame” they had to partake in raid instances. The Enclave eventually attempted raid instances but quickly "burned out" as it was not what many of its members wanted to do. The Enclave was soon after disbanded as its core membership lost interest in the game.</p>

<p>In December 2003 the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planetside.html" title="Planetside">Planetside</a> server Konreid was merging with its sister server Emerald as a part of the “Battle Concentration Initiative”. The leaders of each of the three empires staged a meeting on a small plot of land south of Planetside's largest landmass: Cyssor. The meeting was purely ceremonial and was meant as a place for all 3 sides to meet and take screenshots during the final hours of their server. The Enclave being strictly loyalist to the Terran Republic would not have any part in it. So during the climax of the event which was to be a massive screenshot, 3 liberators manned by members of the Enclave flew over the island and decimated everyone on it, thus beginning hostilities between The Enclave and some of the Planetside community.</p>
<p><br />
Late in 2005 a little known planetside player name Raider05 was reported to have “died”. A massive funeral procession was held for this in game. Former members of The Enclave, as the Planetside phase of The Enclave was officially disbanded, took it upon themselves to bomb the “ceremony”. The resulting debacle is considered one of the most intense in the history of online gaming. The situation eventually enveloped into the permanent banning and blacklisting of many The Enclave's members from all SoE games.</p>

<p>As of May 2006 the Enclave as an outfit is currently looking towards future MMO's for their next primary game. Warhammer: The Age of Reckoning is at the top of the list for its emphasis on PVP and the general appeal of the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warhammer.html" title="Warhammer">Warhammer</a> universe to many members of The Enclave.</p>

Whereas Copper Blue's sound could be described as <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_pop.html" title="Power pop">power pop</a>, with sharp hooks and well-crafted melodies, Beaster's focus was more on the power than the pop, with heavy guitars, thumping bass drum, and crashing cymbals throughout, and Bob Mould's voice pushed farther back in the mix.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-14_7fe1.html" title="Edit section: Changes in Rocket Technology">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Changes in Rocket Technology</span></h2>
<p>The Changes in Rocket Technology Over Time</p>
<p>Space vehicles have changed dramatically throughout the years. Robert Goddard began the space age in 1926 with the first liquid fuel rocket. As time went by Johannes Winkler began to make ballistic missiles for the German army in 1931. Now, rockets are able to carry loads out of Earth’s orbit and send satellites to the farthest reaches of the solar system. Obviously, rocket technology has changed greatly over time.</p>
<p>The first rockets were made very long ago and were basically mere arrows or fireworks launched with gunpowder. These primitive rockets were solid fueled. In other words, they were launched with a solid fuel that burns at a constant rate until the fuel runs out. Solid fuel rocket motors may still be found in the booster stages of the space shuttle and in some model rockets. As time progressed scientists realized that solid fuel rockets were not practical if a varied burn rate was needed or if they needed to save fuel for a later burn. Because of this shortcoming, liquid fuel rockets were developed.</p>
<p>Robert Goddard is considered the founder of modern rocket propulsion. This title was given to him for creating the first liquid fuel rocket. After being disgraced by the press in Massachusetts for believing that a rocket with sufficient propulsion could fly through the vacuum of space, Goddard moved away from the cramped east coast to the vast scrubland of New Mexico where people minded their own business and he could work in peace. After long experimentation, he developed rockets that climbed to altitudes of 9,000 feet and broke the speed of sound. He also made designs with fin stabilized steering, multi stages, and gyroscopic guidance systems. Out of all the nations interested in his rocket technology, Germany was the most interested. Occasionally the German government contacted him and he gave casual answers, but when communication fell silent Goddard began to get worried. He began to fear that the German government was planning to use the rockets as missiles to start a war. He took some videos of his rockets to U.S. Army officials in Washington, saying “We could slant it a little, and do some damage.” By this he meant that if the rockets were used as missiles and aimed at something, they could easily destroy hostile targets. The officials took little interest in the man’s comments until the murderous German V-2 rockets began to wreak havoc on London in World War II. After the war, Goddard inspected one of the captured V-2 rockets and found it to be basically the same design as some of his rockets. American scientists then worked alongside German scientists to incorporate Goddard's innovations into the V-2, turning the killer missile into the Redstone, which put the first Americans into space. The Redstone led directly to the Saturn moon rockets, and indirectly to virtually every other rocket the U.S. has ever flown.</p>
<p>Goddard’s Rocket was fueled with liquid oxygen and gasoline. These were combined in a combustion chamber to make an explosion that was directed through a nozzle. This generated thrust to propel the rocket against the force of gravity. By the time of the Saturn V and the Apollo missions, a different fuel was being used in the same way. This fuel was very similar in that it used liquid oxygen as the oxidizer, but it used kerosene instead of gasoline to create thrust and launch the rocket. Now, with the space shuttle and other modern rockets, liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen are combined to create an explosion to propel the rocket up into space.</p>
<p>After World War II the Cold War began. This was a race of arms. In other words, the United States and the Soviet Union were battling to have the best bombs, missiles, airplanes, and finally, rockets. In the latter part of the Cold War a space race began. This was a race to see which country would have the first person in space, the first docking maneuver, and ultimately the first man on the moon. The first man in space was not an American but rather a Russian cosmonaut named Yuri Gagarin who lifted off in a Vostok spacecraft. He stayed in space for one hour and forty-three minutes before reentering the atmosphere, jumping out of the capsule and parachuting down to earth. After this the U.S. sent Alan Shepard into space aboard a Redstone rocket. This suborbital flight lasted 15 minutes. This led to other flights in Atlas spacecraft such as when John Glenn became the first American to orbit Earth on February 12, 1962. Inside his Friendship 7 spacecraft Glenn circled the globe three times, marveling at the beauty of orbital sunrises and sunsets before sweating through a fiery reentry into Earth's atmosphere.Eventually, the Apollo rockets were developed to carry people to the moon. The first time this was attempted was on Apollo 8 when a crew was sent to the moon. At that point the Lunar Lander had not yet been developed so the astronauts orbited the moon several times before returning to earth. This led to Apollo 11, the mission to allow the first man to walk on the moon. The mission successfully allowed two astronauts, Neal Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to walk on the moon while the third crew member, Michael Collins, stayed in orbit around the moon controlling the command and service modules so that when the Lunar Lander returned to orbit it could successfully dock and return home. This decisive victory marked the end of the Cold War, but not the end of the space program.</p>
<p>After Apollo 11, ten more men walked on the surface of the moon as part of Apollo missions. No man has been there since. After the Apollo program NASA began to develop a reusable spacecraft to service space stations and do experiments in weightlessness. The result was the space shuttle which could launch vertically like any other rocket and would land like a conventional airplane. The first flight of a space shuttle was made on April 12, 1981 by an orbiter named the Columbia—20 years to the day after Yuri Gagarin’s historic flight — Shuttles flew two to nine missions a year, except in 1986 and 1987 when flights were suspended following the Challenger disaster. Although its cost proved to be much greater and its practical launch frequency much lower than originally anticipated, it did represent a giant leap forward in manned spaceflight capability. To this day the Space Shuttle Program has encompassed 114 launches, spanned 24 years, and deployed, repaired, and harnessed many satellites. The Space Shuttle has accomplished many things and made significant progress in human space exploration. Recent disasters such as the Columbia blowing up on reentry have forced the United States to create a safer, cheaper, and more reliable rocket for space travel.</p>
<p>The projected vehicle that will fulfill these requirements is the Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV). This is a rocket that is reusable for up to ten flights and uses a staged ascent aided by a lower stage made of a solid rocket booster previously used to get the Space Shuttle into orbit. This rocket will be used to launch normally four but possibly six astronauts in the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) to low earth orbit, where it may dock with the International Space Station or another craft such as the heavy lift vehicle. The heavy lift vehicle is boosted into orbit so that it can carry astronauts aboard the CEV to the moon. <a name="Sources_293" id="Sources_293"></a></p>

<p>15-Year Old Singing Sensation WHITNEY WOLANIN Moves to the head of the soulful class with "Funkology XIII"</p>
<p><a href="http://www.WhitneyWolanin.com" class="external text" title="http://www.WhitneyWolanin.com" rel="nofollow">Whitney Wolanin Official Website</a></p>
<ul>
<li>* *</li>
</ul>
<p>Working with Motown "Funk Brother" and bass legend Bob Babbitt, the wise-beyond-her-years vocal powerhouse mines a spirited handful of legendary R&amp;B classics, including her new single "It Takes Two," a duet with Survivor's Jimi Jamison.</p>
<ul>
<li>* *</li>
</ul>
<p>Wolanin, whose anthemic original "Good" Hit #7 on FMQB's AC40 chart, has appeared on the homepage of iTunes, sung the National Anthem for major league and NFL Games, and has headlined as guest artist with the Legendary Funk Brothers Band and Commodores at The Naples Music Festival.</p>
<p>The musical electricity in the Nashville studio was crackling that day in 2004 when 13-year-old Whitney Wolanin (pronounced WO-Lan-in) made her recording debut with a powerful and spirited rendition of the Martha and The Vandellas classic "Heat Wave" which she nailed brilliantly in one take. Legendary bassist and Motown "Funk Brother" Bob Babbitt, <a href="http://www.BobBabbitt.com" class="external text" title="http://www.BobBabbitt.com" rel="nofollow">Bob Babbitt Official Website</a>who gathered some of the industry's top session musicians to play with the young singer, turned to his cohorts and asked what they thought.</p>
<p>"Amazing for a 20 year old," they agreed. Then Wolanin spoke up and reminded them, "Guys, I'm only 13!" Reflecting later on her first session at the House of Bob studio in the vintage Victorian house whose vibe was very much like Grand Avenue in Detroit, where the early Motown classics were cut she says, "I went in there wanting to just be myself, and I was nervous at first working with all these great players. But the energy was high and the setting really inspired me. We cut four songs that first day!"</p>
<p>Those tracks quickly evolved the into the core of Funkology XIII, the singer's debut project whose title reflects the set's lively old school-meets-modern pop/rock grooves and the age Wolanin was when she recorded it. Produced by Babbitt with the singer's father, 35 year music industry veteran Vincent Wolanin, the collection is a fun-filled gathering of soul classics, some very familiar ("This Old Heart Of Mine," "What Becomes of The Brokenhearted," "Young And In Love") and others magical but a bit more obscure ("Martha and The Vandellas" "Quicksand," Smokey Robinson's "Head To Toe"). On "Quicksand," the singer pulls off the amazing feat of literally "swinging with her voice", along with the band.</p>
<p>Wolanin fashions another Robinson chestnut, "Mickey's Monkey," into her own thing with a whimsical reworking called "Whitney's Monkey," and she recorded Funkology XIII's new single (February 14, 2006 release to radio) "It Takes Two" (originally done by Marvin Gaye and Kim Weston) with famed Survivor lead singer Jimi Jamison. <a href="http://www.JimiJamison.com" class="external text" title="http://www.JimiJamison.com" rel="nofollow">Jimi Jamison Official Website</a>The lone original number, a self-empowerment anthem appropriately and simply titled "Good," has spent an astounding 45 plus weeks on FMQB's AC40 Radio Airplay Chart (peaking at #7 last November), and Wolanin's lighthearted holiday gem "Christmas (The Warmest Time Of The Year)" was the most added song at radio four weeks in a row. Both "GOOD" and "Christmas" appeared in the Top 100 Airplay Chart at the same time. On the FMQB AC40 Top 40 Radio Chart of Feb 14th 2006 "It Takes Two" was the number 1 added song and reached the Top 10 at #9 on the April 12, 2006 radio chart while "GOOD" was still on the Top 100 chart so both songs again duplicated the next to impossible feat of being on the chart at the same time.</p>
<p>"We picked the songs based on what I thought was best for my range and which allowed me to vocally be my best," says Wolanin. "I've always been told my voice had soul in it, so I thought it would be fun to focus on R&amp;B to establish myself. The best part of the whole experience was finally being able to record songs I love and get some music out there. From the time I started singing when I was two years old, I've wanted to sing for as many people as possible. It's not just about trying to be famous, but about my love and passion for the music."</p>
<p>"Still, I'm not limiting myself to old school R&amp;B, she adds. "I love all kinds of music, and some of the new original material I'm working on now is more modern, with a next generation Destiny's Child flavor. I'm also eager to do more pop/rock material."</p>
<p>At the tender age of 15, the charismatic singer with the four and a half octave range is developing into more than simply a star, but an artist of substance and an inspiration to young girls with dreams everywhere. On March 26, 2006 Wolanin, backed by Babbitt and many of the other "Funk Brothers," appeared and rocked the event as one of the headliners along with The Commodores--at the Naples Music Festival.</p>
<p>In 2005, she appeared on the front page of the Apple iTunes website twice. Wolanin also sang the national anthem before hundreds of thousands of people at Fenway Park, Shea Stadium and other major league parks, plus at a series of games for the Yankees, Red Sox, Twins, Phillies, Reds, etc. and also at Pro Player Stadium before a Miami Dolphins game. She has five baseball games scheduled already for the 2006 season.</p>
<p>At the National Girls Basketball Championship in Texas, there were 2,500 young girls on one side of the court and 2,500 parents on the other. By the time Wolanin who was at the event making a promotional appearance--performed her second song, hundreds from both sides stormed the floor past the security guards and were on the floor dancing. Her popularity on the teen basketball circuit which extends to being a starter on her own high school basketball team as well earned her a feature article in the national magazine Women's Basketball.</p>
<p>The University of Tennessee, which has one of the top women's basketball teams in the country, sponsored a nine game special event where they gave away 288 copies of "Good" at each game and put Wolanin's bright smile on the scoreboard. Each year, the Wolanin Family puts on a Rockin' Christmas Party for charity, featuring an All-Star band comprised of members of famous rock groups. At those events, Wolanin performs along with rockers from AC/DC, Survivor, Loverboy, Kansas, the Funk Brothers, and Starship; proceeds go to Cancer research, the local Children's Hospitals and to fund a permanent scholarship endowment for needy students. In 2005, Wolanin did a national campaign with every Children's and Shriners Hospital in every state in the US, whereby all the sick children received a copy of her Christmas record.</p>
<p>While Wolanin, currently hard at work on her second album and a Christmas album, is eager to go on her first full-scale tour, she is focused on maintaining a balance between making music and being a regular teenager. No matter where her career takes her, she is adamant about remaining enrolled at her high school, where she is in the International Baccalaureate World School Program, an intense course of study, which assigns college level work. Naturally, while playing on the basketball team and also playing softball and volleyball for fun, the singer maintains a straight A average.</p>
<p>"There are so many things in life that I enjoy, but ever since I can remember, singing was the one thing I knew I was going to do," Wolanin says. "It's a lot of fun to have all these things happening career-wise, but on a more meaningful level, I love having people relate to the music, and relate to what I'm going through in my life through the songs I sing. When they sing along, I know I'm reaching them, and there's nothing greater for me than experiencing that emotional connection."</p>

<p>Released in 1993, Beaster is a mini-album by the group <a href="../../../s/u/g/Sugar.html" title="Sugar">Sugar</a>. All songs were written by guitarist/vocalist Bob Mould. Although the 6 tracks were recorded at the same sessions as Sugar's debut album <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copper_Blue_157f.html" title="Copper Blue">Copper Blue</a>, and again co-produced by Bob Mould and Lou Giordano, the sound is vastly different. Whereas Copper Blue's sound could be described as <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_pop.html" title="Power pop">power pop</a>, with sharp hooks and well-crafted melodies, Beaster's focus was more on the power than the pop, with heavy guitars, thumping bass drum, and crashing cymbals throughout, and Bob Mould's voice pushed farther back in the mix.</p>

<p>Solange Tuyishime; is a 22 years old from Fredericton New Brunswick. She was born and raised in Central Africa. When she was 13 she escaped from the war in central Africa and moved to Canada. She continued her education at École Sainte-Anne (A well recognized French school in Fredericton, New Brunswick). In school she was a very active person. She played Basketball for two years, volleyball for three years and soccer all through high school and was captain of the girls’ soccer team during her last year. She was also part of the student union, the year book committee, theatre committee, and a cheerleader. She graduated from École Sainte-Anne in 2001 with a scholarship from the Knights of Columbus.

<p>“My life time experiences have made me the strong person that I am today. I am proud to be a Canadian, and being a survivor from the war, I’ve learned to be appreciative, to never take anything for granted, to help those who are less fortunate, to work hard in life and to never give up on my dreams.”</p>

<p>We can divide international relations' agenda into three theoretical groups: 1. "first" (security) agenda, i. e. terrorism, weapon of mass distruction (WMD), arms race, 2. "second" (economic) agenda, i. e. terms of trade, currency rates, development, poverty and 3. "third" (social) agenda, i. e. human rights, culture, ect. Definition is a part of international relations theory, which is aimed to explain foundations of states' activity in the field of international relations.</p>
<p>Which countries use which agenda? --Unated States uses "first" (security) agenda. --"Developing countries" from Asia and Africa (prieviously known as "third world countries") use "second" (economic) agenda. --Member states of European Union and Canada use "third" (social) agenda.</p>

<p>Bigger or Better is a (American?) game in which you -or each team- typically starts with one penny. The object of the game is to trade your penny for something "bigger or better". The game is over when you decide it's over. In other words: until you are satisfied with your final trade, or -in case of a team contest- have run out of time.</p>
<p>A Canadian guy, Kyle MacDonald, was the first to do this online. He started with one red paperclip. His object is to keep on trading until he gets a house. His most recent trade (May 2006) was a year free rent in Phoenix for an afternoon with Alice Cooper. His website: oneredpaperclip.blogspot.com. He can also be found on MySpace and has been discussed in media, CNN being one of them.</p>

<p>Charles R. Garry was the head attorney for the Oakland branch of the Black Panther Party in the 1960s. He was highly commended by the leaders of the party for his honesty and devotion to their cases. Garry was first hired to defend Huey P. Newton. The choice of Garry, a white man, over a black lawyer upset many Party members and other blacks in the community of Oakland. However, Bobby Seale stressed the importance of hiring the best lawyer for Newton's case, and justly denounced Garry's critics as black racists. Garry could be called a lawyer of the people in the truest sense. He worked tirelessly to do what was right, first risking his life defending a labor union, and later working for and sticking with the Black Panthers. Bobby Seale proudly called Garry the "Lenin of the Courtroom", and worked with him on many of his own cases. Charles R. Garry was certainly one of the finest lawyers to ever step into a courtroom in the name of justice in an unjust power structure.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-14_7fe1.html" title="Edit section: Terrorism In The 21st Century">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Terrorism In The 21st Century</span></h2>
<p>Today, we must ask ourselves a question; what is terrorism? This word has become a part of everyday vocabulary, yet many of us do not understand this word. Do not understand what grief and pain it causes to its victims, nor do they understand why people choose to destroy the peace of the world. ‘Terrorism’ is defined in the dictionary as “The unlawful use or threatened use of violence by a person or an organised group against people or property with the intention of intimidating societies or governments, often for ideological or political reasons”. However, this definition is only a sentence; it cannot possibly begin to convey the emotion, damage, conflict, and pain that terrorism can cause. Though terrorism occurs on all four corners of the globe, people only know what the biased media chooses to tell them.</p>
<p>Terrorism has occurred on Earth since early Roman times. Back then, there were no words for terrorism, although the acts imposed upon the ancient Roman world were similar to those imposed on the society of today. People were willing to inflict terror and panic on others, in order to make their voices heard. Today, America, as Ancient Rome was, is the single superpower of the world, therefore a great terrorist target. History is purely repeating itself. The word ‘terrorism’ comes with a dilemma; establishing what exactly terrorism is. Who is the one that decides what is terrorism and who the real terrorists are? Is one society’s terrorist, another’s martyr?</p>
<p>Through terrorism, a person’s life, family, and beliefs are destroyed in a split-second. In that split second, they are forced into a world that they thought they would never have to live in. Families are shattered; children are growing up with no parents, in a society full of fear. This message is illustrated in the poem ‘The Presidents Speech’, about September 11. “…The orphans whose mums or dads only went to work, the grandparents suddenly snapped from the tree of generations, their children, soft gray ash...”</p>
<p>Beliefs and faith of the youth are being destroyed along with their families and the normality of life that they have grown up knowing. Children have little knowledge of the world around them, they believe that their parents will always be there to protect them, and keep them safe. They have an illusion that the shelter of a parent’s arm means that nothing can hurt them. When terrorism occurs, children are forced to lose this illusion, and grow up fearing the world and its people. This is shown in the poem “Through the eyes of a child” by Kathy Tyndale, about September 11. “…Mummy, why would someone want to hurt my dad? He did nothing wrong and he is not bad. Will they come and hurt us too? I will be very scared if they do. Mummy, I don’t understand what has gone wrong…” However, it is not only young children that are affected but teenagers as well. Their faith in the government has declined rapidly since September 11. A survey conducted in the weeks following the New York attacks by New York City based company Harris Interactive showed that only 36% of American teenagers feel that the government will be able to prevent another terrorism attack. The survey also showed that 49.3% were fearful that a terrorism attack would strike near them. Today’s teenagers are growing up with a constant fear for their lives and the lives of their loved ones. This fear is also illustrated in youth literature, such as Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince by J.K Rowling. Though this book is fantasy, it shares parallels with recent terrorism acts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, adults are also beginning to question their government. In another survey by 911truth.org, 49.3% of New York City residents and 41% of New York State citizens believe that the U.S government failed to act on knowledge about September 11. Worldwide, people are slowly loosing their faith in their government. Additionally, this is related to media coverage of terrorism events.</p>
<p>Media in Australia mainly focuses on American, British and other Allied countries terrorism attacks. The Australian media alongside the government chooses to place Australia in a cocoon, protecting its citizens from the reality of terrorism outside its borders. John Howard, Prime Minister of Australia, chooses only to warn the Australian public of a terrorist threat when it is the best advantage to him. In 2005, there were over twenty-five terrorism attacks worldwide, many of them a series of suicide bombings. Yet, in Australia, only two of these were focused on by the media; July 7 London Bombings and October 1 Bali Bombings. Additionally, 21 of these attacks occurred in the Middle East, in which Australia and other Allied countries such as America and England are at war with. There have also been many terrorism threats within Australia, none of which have been disclosed to the public.</p>
<p>Furthermore, though George W Bush constantly declares that America is opposed to terrorism, research has proved contrary to this. An interview in November 2001 with Noam Chomsky, Institute Professor Emeritus of linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology revealed that, “The U.S. is officially committed to what is called "low–intensity warfare". If you read the definition of low–intensity conflict in army manuals and compare it with official definitions of "terrorism" in army manuals, you find they’re almost the same”.</p>

<p>The Da Vinci Code was indeed published as a fictional novel, and for good reason. Many of the "Facts" that Dan Brown claims are disputable when one does a little research behind the thin vail of sited text Brown uses for his basis. The basis for most of his facts are based on the Gnostic Gospels of Philip. These texts were written in the late third Century. The Criticism of the Gospel of Philip is a well written excerpt. A more compelling argument against this thesis is that the Gospel of Mary Magdelene does not mention her marriage to Jesus. Why would she not mention her marriage to Jesus? Because it never happened.</p>

<p>The University of Bristol Law Club is the academic and social arms of the School of Law. The Executive Committee of the Law Club consists of an elected body of students who, in conjunction with sponsoring firms, organise events for the student body. The social calendar is rich and diverse, varying from year to year as the Executive cCmmittee membership changes. Studying law is synonymous with hard work and dedication; so it is the overriding objective of the Law Club to introduce balance into students' lives. The Law Club's activities fall into two main categories. First of all, the organisation of social functions, including several highly successful balls. These events also provide an opportunity for students to socialise with members of staff and network with representatives of the major City law firms. Secondly, the Club is responsible for the running of the School's Mooting Competition and the Hunt Cup (debating competition). The competitions take place throughout the acdemic year with dinners and drinks receptions organised after each round of the competitions. Furthermore, the Law Club publishes the Survival Guide (Handbook) at the beginning of the academic year and Dicta (UBLC Law Journal and Annual Report) at the end of the academic year. Anyone, including non-law students, is welcome to become a member of the Law Club and students from all years are entitled to stand for election to the Executive Committee. Hustings are held at the end of the Spring Term and Executive Committee membership lasts for one academic year. For more information please do not hesitate to contact me.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-14_7fe1.html" title="Edit section: Winston Learning">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Winston Learning</span></h2>
<p>An Early Machine Learning approach to Concept Learning Consider the set of examples shown below. These are the kind of concept instances that were used in one of the first machine learning programs developed by Patrick Winston. ( P. H. Winston, Learning Structural Descriptions from Examples. In P. H. Winston (Ed.), The Psychology of Computer Vision. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1975. Pp. 157-209).This early machine learning artifact focused research attention on the importance of the training sequence in concept learning. Below is shown a particular training sequence. When you attempted to learn the earlier concept example you may have noticed that at any point in time you entertained very few hypotheses...often only one. This, despite the fact that the number of hypotheses consistent with the training sequence is usually very large. Our learning strategy does not at all appear to be one that is similar to an exhaustive breadth first search.</p>
<p><br />
Winston's learner shared this characteristic with us. In fact, this learning program never entertains more than a single hypothesis at a time. But what are some of the possible consequences of following a strategy such as this? Consider the figures below which depict some of the possible relations between the Learner's hypothesis and the Teacher's hypothesis. The yellow circle depicts the space of possible concepts. The green circle depicts the space of concept instances that are consistent with the Teacher's hypothesis and the blue circle depicts the space of concept instances that are consistent with the Learner's hypothesis.</p>
<p>In the first figure the Learner's hypothesis defines only a subset of the possible instances consistent with the 'true' concept definition. In this case the Learner's hypothesis must become more general in order to capture the concept that is being taught. In the middle figure the Teacher's concept defines a subset of the possible instances consistent with the Learner's Hypothesis. In this case the Learner's hypothesis is too general and it must become more specific in order to capture the concept that is being taught. And in the third figure the Teacher and Learner concept intersect. In this case both generalization and specialization are required in order to learn the concept that is being taught.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Learner's Concept defines a Subset of instances consistent with the Teacher's Concept</p>
<p><br />
Learner's Concept defines a Superset of instances consistent with the Teacher's Concept</p>
<p><br />
Learner's Concept defines a instances that are inconsistent with the Teacher's Concept</p>
<p><br />
Winston viewed the learning task as one that involved&#160;:</p>
<ul>
<li>representing the current example;</li>
<li>predicting from the representation of the current hypothesis whether or not the current instance exemplifies the concept;
<ul>
<li>if correct then retain the current hypothesis;</li>
<li>if incorrect then
<ul>
<li>identify the differences between the current example and the current concept;</li>
<li>choose from this set of differences and use the chosen differences to
<ul>
<li>generalize the concept hypothesis if the instance was a positive instance or</li>
<li>specialize the concept hypothesis if the instance was a negative instance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The figure below illustrates these actions for the first three examples of the training sequence show above. The first example is a positive instance of the concept of an 'arch' and the next two are negative instances. A positive instance is always presented first in the sequence to enable the learner to establish a positive hypothesis. The yellow square below the each of the examples contains a a description of the example in the representation language of the learner. These are illustrated as a graph in a form that was referred to as a semantic net. The gray squares at the bottom provide the representation of the learner's hypothesis after the example had been processed. The semantic net representation can also be expressed in the syntax of a predicate logic. However, viewing these representations in this graphical form may help you to mentally imagine matching the network representing the hypothesis against the network representing the example.</p>
<p><br />
Consider the first example above. The semantic net describes this positive example as consisting of three objects (B1, B2, and B3) which are all blocks. B1 and B2 support B3. The orientation of B1 and B2 is standing and B3's orientation if lying. Note this representation does not encode size, exact location, and color. If any of these features were a defining characteristic of the concept 'arch,' then this learner would never attain a completely accurate definition of the concept. Winston refers to the representations shown in the gray boxes as the learner's model of the concept. I have referred to this as the learner's hypothesis concerning the definition of the concept. I will use the terms interchangeably here. With only a slight change, the description of the example becomes the learner's initial model of the concept. The changes will always be shown in green so that you can easily identify them. Here the change is to replace the names of the specific blocks, B1, B2, and B3; with variables, X, Y and Z. This is an example of a generalization. The learner has assumed that objects other than these three blocks can be used to construct an instance of an 'arch.' This seems quite innocuous, but notice other possible generalizations were not made. For example, the constants 'LYING' and 'STANDING' could also have been replace with variables. This would have resulted in an overgeneralization since the orientation does matter.</p>
<p>Consider the second example. This is a negative example. If we match the current model ­ the first network shown in the lower left ­ against the description of the current example ­ the second network shown in the middle; we find two mismatches. The model contains two 'SUPPORT' relations whereas the current example contains no 'SUPPORT' relation. However, the learner does not know whether the presence of these relations is crucial to the definition of the concept. Consequently, the learner would guess ­ incorrectly ­ that the example was a positive example of an arch. On learning that this guess was wrong, the learner needs to revise the model. The constraint on the revision is that the new model must predict that the first example is positive and that the second example is negative. The revision shown involves adding to the model that the 'SUPPORT' relation must be part of the concept definition ­ it is elevated from a characteristic of one exemplar to a defining characteristic of the concept. Consequently, this model will now correctly reject the second example as an example of an arch.</p>
<p>The negative example has served to cause the learner to specialize the model. The third example, which is also negative, will lead to further specialization of the model. Again, the model predicts that the example is positive since nothing in the model precludes he supporting blocks from touching. The example is of course a negative example and the only aspect of its description that doesn't match the model is the 'TOUCHES' relation. Consequently, the revision involves adding to the model the requirement that the supporting blocks 'MUST NOT TOUCH.'</p>
<p>Notice that whenever the learner mistakenly identifies an example, the revision is selected from the set of mismatches obtained when the model is compared with the description of the current example. Winston's program classified the types of mismatches that could occur and based on this classification proposed an appropriate revision. However, if there are many mismatches, then the learner can be led astray. This is because the learner has no way of knowing whether all, some or only one of the mismatches led to the erroneous classification. In this case there may be several, perhaps many (the power set of the number of mismatches - 1), possible models that could be adopted. But the learner has been constrained to have only one model at any point in time. If the wrong model is chosen, the concept may never be learned.</p>
<p>For this reason, the training sequence can be the factor that decides whether or not the learner acquired the concept. Specifically, Winston argues that the ideal training sequence is one where each example is a 'near miss.' A near miss is a training example that is only minimally different from the learner's current model. Ideally the training example should differ in only one aspect from the learner's current model. In this case, only one revision is possible and therefore the learner can not make the wrong choice. If the entire training sequence consists of 'near misses' then the teacher can systematically guide the learner toward the correct model of the concept. Of course, this presupposes that the teacher have knowledge of the learner's current model at each stage in the learning. Reading learners' mind is not a skill that every teacher masters. Nonetheless, Winston's learning artifact has clarified for use when and why the sequence of training examples can play such a crucial role in learning.</p>
<p>This type of learning model is an example of what is termed supervised learning. There is a teacher that bears the responsibility for supervising the learning that occurs. But what happens when learning is unsupervised? Is learning still possible? Are there ways to alter the learning strategy to yield a learning method that is less dependent on intelligent and benevolent supervision? These are some of the issues that we will explore as we examine other research on machine and human learning.</p>

<p>Mohammad Mehdi Shamseddine Or Chamseddine (1936-2001) is a famous Shia Islam scholar of Lebanon from Khabrihka of Southern Lebanon. His lineage ends to Shahid Awwal who is also known as Shamseddine (Sun of the religon). He was born in Najaf as his father Ayatullah Abdul Kareem was studying there. At age 12 when his father decided to return to Lebanon,Imam Mohammad Mehdi decided to stay and finish his religious studies under famous scholars among them al imama al-Khoei and al imam Muhsin al-Hakeem. During his stay of over 30 years in Iraq he worked closely with Imam imam Musa Sadr, imam Mohammad Baqir as-Sadr, imam Mohammad Baqir al-Hakim among others. Upon his return to Lebanon in 1969 he helped Musa Sadr founding the Supreme Shia Islamic Council that came to light in 1975 and became its first vice-president. Later in April 1994 he was elected president of the Supreme Shia Islamic Councila its president, Imam Musa Sadr, has been kidnapped since september of 1978. He was a staunch advocate of Christian-Muslim coexistence in a country which has struggled to overcome confessional divisions since the devastating 1975-1990 civil war. "There is no Lebanon without its Christians and there is no Lebanon without its Muslims," he once said. Shamseddine was known for his moderation and diplomacy. He led the Shia Higher Council, the highest body for Lebanon's 1.2 million Shi'as, from 1994 until his death.</p>
<p>He was deputy to the council's founder, Imam Mussa Sadr, who disappeared in mysterious circumstances during a trip to Libya in 1978.</p>
<p><br />
He was staunch supporter of the resistance against the Israeli aggressions in the region. In Lebanon he formed the Wide Civil Resistance group after Ashura 1983 to counter the Israeli invasion of June 1982. He also established the Islamic University in Lebanon among many other institutions.</p>

<p>Autoimmune cardiovascular neuropathy disease (ACND) is a very rare condition occurring in 1 in 6 million.</p>

<p>ACND is an illness whereby the immune system starts recognising the heart and it's vessels as foreign objects and develops antibodies towards the organ. The disease also affects the brain, causing autonomic neuropathy, which is where the autonomic &amp; central nervous system works irregularly causing many problems to other systems.</p>

<p>There have been only 1092 reported cases of ACND in the past 10 years, a number that is predicted to increase rapidly over the next decade. Although the numbers seem low, there is some evidence that ACND may be more common with a prediction of over 10,000 undiagnosed cases in the world. There is also some evidence that some infants diagnosed with SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome) may have had ACND.</p>

<p>It is unknown what cases ACND, but the most common speculation is a virus. More than 98% of patients with ACND suffered from an infectious disease 5 months or more prior to the diagnosis. This is why many cases are diagnosed as <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chronic_fatigue_syndrome.html" title="Chronic fatigue syndrome">chronic fatigue syndrome</a> instead of ACND.

<p>A clone of certain elements of Taito's <a href="../../../j/u/n/Jungle_Hunt_a211.html" title="Jungle Hunt">Jungle Hunt</a> arcade game, mainly the vine-swinging part. It is a Flash based game, using a wrapping container developed by Phenomedia, utilizing prerendered 3D cute characters designed by <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guillermo_Mordillo_d0b5.html" title="Guillermo Mordillo">Guillermo Mordillo</a>.</p>
<p>The game play is easy: Jump from vine to vine, grab the girl, and go back the way you came. The challenge lies in the later levels with crocodiles, snakes, monkeys, and giraffes providing obstacles. The player automatically slides down to the bottom of elephant trunks. However, if you swing on a snake's tail, there is nothing to stop the player from falling off, so a jump has to be done when the tail is all the way onward. Crocodiles and monkeys will knock the player off the vine. In the water levels, if you fall into the water, you can pump the action key to make it to the other side. If you're carrying the girl when you get knocked off the vine, she is lost.</p>
<p>A very interesting and amusing game to spend a break on.</p>

<p>Future developments With the rapid development of the eastern Docklands as part of the ‘Thames Gateway’ initiative and London’s successful bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, several extensions and enhancements are under construction, being planned or being discussed.[3]:</p>
<p>[edit] New platforms at Stratford Status - Under Construction</p>
<p>Currently the DLR has only one platform at Stratford, which limits capacity and ease of interchange with other platforms. Two new replacement platforms are under construction and expected to open in 2007.</p>
<p>[edit] Woolwich Arsenal Extension Status - Under Construction</p>
<p>An extension of the London City Airport branch from King George V to Woolwich Arsenal is under construction. This requires a second DLR tunnel crossing of the River Thames. The projected cost of £150 million expected to be met through the Private Finance Initiative. Construction began in June 2005, and is due to be completed in February 2009.[4]</p>
<p>[edit] Upgrading Bank - Lewisham route to 3-car trains Status - TWA and financial approval given</p>
<p>There is formal approval to upgrade the lines between Bank station and Lewisham station to allow operation of 3-car trains and increase capacity. As an alternative, more frequent trains were considered but it was found that the necessary signalling changes would be as expensive as upgrading to longer trains, and provide fewer benefits. [5]</p>
<p>It is expected that the work will be carried out during 2007-2009. The work involves the lengthening of platforms on most stations on the route, together with viaduct-strengthening works to support the longer trains. Most of this section dates from the initial system originally built for single-car operation. South Quay station will require locating as nearby curves preclude lengthening. The below-ground Cutty Sark station will not be extended due to the cost and the risk to nearby historic buildings. Instead, use of Selective Door Operation (SDO) has been approved by the Railway Inspectorate at this station.</p>
<p>Although not on the Bank - Lewisham route, two other stations will be modified to improve operational flexibility. Poplar station will also be lengthened, whilst Tower Gateway is due to be converted from its current two-track terminal layout into a single longer platform. However the exact details of the Tower Gateway work are under review.[6].</p>
<p>[edit] Langdon Park station Status - Under Constuction</p>
<p>A planning application for a station at Langdon Park between All Saints and Devons Road has been submitted. The plan envisages the station opening in late 2007.</p>
<p>[edit] Stratford International Extension / North London Line conversion Status - Awaiting Transport &amp; Works Act approval from the Government</p>
<p>This will be an extension from Canning Town to the new Stratford International station, linking Docklands with domestic and international high-speed services on the Channel Tunnel Rail Link. Four new stations will be built, at Star Lane, Abbey Road, Stratford High Street, and Stratford International, with a possible fifth station between Cody Road and Canning Town. The branch will also serve London Underground and National Rail stations at West Ham and Stratford. All stations will be capable of accommodating three-unit trains.</p>
<p>As part of the TWA application the DLR station at Royal Victoria on the Beckton branch will be extended to accommodate three-unit trains. Additionally it will have a third platform. The extra platform becomes possible because the part of the North London Line due to be abandoned currently runs parallel to Royal Victoria station.[7]</p>
<p>The extension will largely run over part of the North London Line, which will in future terminate at Stratford. The extension is projected to open early in 2010 and is an important part of the transport improvement package for the 2012 Olympic Games, which will largely be held on a site adjoining Stratford International.</p>
<p>[edit] Upgrading other lines to 3-car trains Status - TWA application being prepared</p>
<p>Once the work to allow three-car trains between Bank station and Lewisham station hase been completed, the only parts of the network unable to accommodate longer trains will be between Poplar station and Stratford station, and between Poplar and Beckton station. There is therefore a proposal to upgrade the remainder of the line with the aim of carrying out the work between 2008 and 2010.</p>
<p>As part of this work, it is proposed to enchance the junction north of West India Quay station, which would preclude services on the Bank to Lewisham route from stopping at West India Quay station.</p>
<p>[edit] Barking Reach extension Status - Being planned, Route safeguarded</p>
<p>This is a proposed extension from Gallions Reach to Dagenham Dock via the riverside at Barking. This would connect the Barking Reach area, a formerly industrial area now undergoing major redevelopment, with the Docklands. This new route would cover major developments at Creekmouth, Barking Riverside, Dagenham Dock Oppotunity Area. The Extension is key if English Partnerships plan is to work. A possible opening date according to the DLR website is 2016.</p>
<p>[edit] Thames Wharf station Status - Proposed</p>
<p>This station had been included as potential future development on the London City Airport extension since it was first planned. It would be located between Canning Town and West Silvertown, due west of the western end of Royal Victoria Dock. Since the station's intended purpose is to serve the surrounding area (currently a mix of brownfield and run-down industrial sites) when it is regenerated, the development is indefinitely on-hold due to the area being safeguarded for the Silvertown Link, a new thames river crossing proposed for opening by 2015.[8]</p>
<p>[edit] Connaught Road\Silvertown Interchange station Status - Proposed</p>
<p>A site near to London City Airport has been at least been given provision of a future possible second station on the London City Airport extension. There, it will be a possible interchange with Crossrail. It is to be located between London City Airport and Pontoon Dock. However, no plans have emerged as to when this station is to be planned and built. The original extension was designed to allow a station to be built here in the future. It may be located south of the Connaught Crossing.[9]</p>
<p>[edit] Charing Cross extension Status - Proposed</p>
<p>In February 2006 a proposal to extend the DLR to Charing Cross station (running from either the Bank or Tower Gateway DLR branches) was publicly revealed[6]. The idea, originating from a DLR "Horizon Study", is in very early stages at the moment, but would involve extending the line from in bored tunnels under Central London to the Charing Cross Jubilee line platforms which would be brought back to public use. These platforms are now located on a spur that branches off the current Jublilee line and they are not now used by passenger trains.</p>
<p>While not specifically confirmed it is implied that the scheme would also use the existing overrun tunnels between the Charing Cross Jubilee platforms and a location slightly to the west of Aldwych. These tunnels were intended to be later incorporated into the abandoned Phase 2 of the 'Fleet Line' (Phase 1 became the original Jubilee Line as existed prior to the Jubilee Line Extension). However they would need some enlargement because DLR gauge is larger than tube gauge and modern safety regulations would almost certainly require a narrow walkway to be provided in the tunnel.</p>
<p>The two reasons reported as driving the proposal were capacity problems at Bank, having basically one interchange between the DLR and the central portion of Underground, and the difficult journeys faced by passengers from Kent and South Coast between their rail termini and the DLR.</p>

<p>"musicatwork – the sound approach to training" was formed in 2005 to bring arts-based training to the corporate/business world, using elements of Play/Music Therapy, cutting-edge training techniques and music to form a unique mix.</p>
<p>musicatwork deliver a range of different sessions, looking at areas such as team building, self expression, stress management, relaxation, and how the concept of Play can be used as a foundation for our work and lives. The sessions are for staff and employees. Sessions have been run for local councils, community sector organisations and businesses in the financial services industry. Participants do not have to have any previous musical experience to take part in the training sessions.</p>
<p>In the sessions, musical improvisation (playing together) is used to enable participants to hear/see/experience any blocks which are in the way of their natural self expression, creativity or ability to work in a group. Coaching interactions are then used to highlight themes, theories and models, which enable participants to understand, discover and benefit from the experiential element from the musical improvisation, thus causing change to occur in the participants and how they relate to themselves and others.</p>
<p>Dan Thomas is a professional music therapist, and the founder of “musicatwork – the sound approach to training”. He has had extensive training in music therapy and management coaching/mentoring methods his way of working and of being with participants is highly effective.</p>
<p>He is the Welsh representative for the Association of Professional Music Therapists. He began his career in the arts in 1994, working nationally and internationally as a composer and lighting designer for INequation Dance Theatre Company, a British Council funded company based in Nottingham creating non verbal physical theatre.</p>
<p>Having travelled widely in Central and North America, Dan started working as an Education Assistant for Heifer Project International (USA), delivering team building and personal development sessions for adults and children. This work continued in the UK for World Challenge International, working with children from deprived areas across the country.</p>
<p>Having trained as a music therapist in Cardiff in 2002, Dan has worked with children and adults with Autism, challenging behaviours, Cerebral Palsy, Schizophrenia and other mental health conditions and Learning Difficulties. He is a clear, passionate and inspiring stand for the power of music to transform people’s lives.</p>

<p>The Sonic World (TSW for Short) is a up and raising Sonic The Hedgehog Fan created series which is has a pseudo base on the hit TV Show 'Sonic The Hedgehog' by DIC, But in no way linked with the Comic 'Sonic The Hedgehog' printed by Archie Comics which was another thing based on the same show.</p>
<p>Most of the Episodes which run as part of the 26 Episode run are offically Cannon for this show but mostly have been changed to include comments on Fan Created Characters which appear in the TSW Series. The Show then comes into force as it carrys on as a 'Third Series' for the 2 Series run of Sonic the Hedgehog (13 episodes in each).</p>
<p>TSW first started with a few small Writen 'Fan Fic' storys which were re-writen into still small volumes. In 2004 an 4 part- half Hour Audio Drama was created and this launched TSW more then before. Since then, a Short Animated Episode Pilot 'TSWA' (The Sonic World Animated) was created as well as a Short series of Short musical Episodes showcasing different character historys. As Of late last year, a Short Series 'The Adventures of Mighty and Ray' was created to introduce classic Sonic Characters of 'Mighty' and 'Ray' into the TSW World along with a new character 'Valaria'. This characters are rumoured to re-appear in one of the current In Production Projects. At the Moment, a 10 Episode Series of TSWA is in Production as well as a Computer Game.</p>

<p>TSW was created by Two people Living in Hastings, England. Manic Man and Bluedude. They were School friends and big Fans of Sonic from a young age. As they grew up, they have been able to use skills they learnt to carry on and make there 'storys' and ideas into a full series. Though Bluedude has started his Name online, Manic seams to prefer not to give out much detail on his real life name, saying that 'it doesn't matter, it's the storys that count'. Though Bluedude hasn't been seen to do much on the series, Manic has always claimed that he is a major help on the project.</p>

<p>A Number of New Characters were introduce into TSW. Some are Completely new Characters, some have bases in already created Characters and some are new takes on Classic Characters.</p>
<p><b>Manic Man Hedgehog-</b> Although sharing the name with the Nickname of TSW Co-Creater, Manic was the first new wave of Characters for TSW. He is a Green Hedgehog which came from 'Lower Mobuis' and after a shaky start, joined the Freedom Fighters. Though Smarter then Sonic, he isn't as Smart as many and has been used as a character to help explain things to the viewers, for Scenes where Sonic isn't around. Most of his time is spent being tormented my Female 'Amical Nett', and shares a friendy enermy tie with Whirlwind Hedgehog, created by other TSW Co-created 'Bluedude'.</p>
<p><b>Amical Nett-</b> Amical Nett is a Young Brown Cat (Created has quoted as say she is a 'Mobuion Comman Brown') which joined the cast after being saved by Sonic The Hedgehog and Sally Acorn. She also came from Lower Mobuis and in the TSW Short 'A Manic life' it was show that she started off feeling Sorry for Manic, but this grew into a Major Crush. She Shared a Hut with Amy Rose.</p>
<p><b>Tiara Bobowski-</b> Although not a Completely New Character, Tiara is though as a New TSW Character. She was Oringal created for the Canceled game 'Sonic X-treme'. Only 1 Offical Image of the character was none to have been created and he design was taken from this. The Character Colours were created by Co-Created Manic Man and a few others. Later the Offical Colour design was found out in an Interview with Game Producer, but Manic has said this colour set up will never be used. Tiara is shown as being very shy after spending most of her life along with only a Computer for friendship but some of the others have been trying to 'help' her out.</p>
<p><b>Whirlwind Hedgehog-</b> This Character was created along time ago with Co-Creater 'Bluedude' was a kid and bought into TSW. Whirlwind is the Son of Sir Charles Hedgehog, which makes him a cosion to Sonic The Hedgehog. At a Young age he was kidnapped and returned when older. The Story meant to explain all this (Whirlwind's Story) has been in pre-production for almost 10 years, way before TSW was even created.</p>
<p><b>Valaria Renard-</b> Valaria is the Main 'Bad Guy' of the Mighty and Ray Mini-Series. Not too much about the character history is given in the show but she is shown to be very smart and carefully plans out her actions.</p>

She entered the <a href="../../../p/e/a/Pearl_Harbor_Naval_Shipyard_eec7.html" title="Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard">Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard</a> on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_21.html" title="November 21">21 November</a> and remained there until <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_23.html" title="December 23">23 December</a>. On that date, she reported to the Commander, Fleet Training Center, Pearl Harbor, under whose auspices she conducted refresher training and made a cruise to <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hilo.html" title="Hilo">Hilo</a>. <i>PC-1145</i> departed Pearl Harbor on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_27.html" title="February 27">27 February</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a>, and on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_4.html" title="March 4">4 March</a>, arrived at <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midway_Island_1096.html" title="Midway Island">Midway Island</a> where she reported for duty to the Commander, Naval Operating Base, Midway. There, she served as an air search and rescue ship until the end of the second week in May.

<p>For the remainder of her active career, <i>PC-1145</i> alternated between duty out of Pearl Harbor and service as an air search and rescue ship, at first based at Midway but later at <a href="../../../k/w/a/Kwajalein.html" title="Kwajalein">Kwajalein</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnston_Island_88eb.html" title="Johnston Island">Johnston Island</a>, Guam, and <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samoa.html" title="Samoa">Samoa</a>.
