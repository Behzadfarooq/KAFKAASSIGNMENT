<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> I'm inclined to keep this because it is undoubtably something that fans will be interested in and this isn't so detailed as to become cumbersome nor is it so detailed that it is part of the the mess <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterrobamf_9382.html" title="User:Interrobamf">Interrobamf</a> references. As for original research... the article doesn't reference a theory or method of solution; an oriignal idea; define a new term; presumes new defintions of pre-existing terms; introduce a argument w/o source; introduces an analysis/synthesis/or neologism. Thus, I don't see how it fits that criteria. The person did document it (although I'd move the reference explanations to the bottom.) Also, this issue will become more relevant with the announcement of the new Transformer movie next year.<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalloonman_3871.html" title="User:Balloonman">Balloonman</a> 21:49, 17 November 2006 (UTC) Based on fans below, will revise to <b>Delete</b><a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalloonman_3871.html" title="User:Balloonman">Balloonman</a> 06:25, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm a fan. I'm not interested in something that essentially amounts to fanfiction. It doesn't seem like a mess because, so far, it has only taken information from one continuity. When it includes the other ten continuities or so, it'll be ugly, especially to fans who are aware of the differences. It's original research because it cobbles together different continuities into one, which isn't indicated by <i>anything</i>. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterrobamf_9382.html" title="User:Interrobamf">Interrobamf</a> 23:19, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This reads (to me at least) like an essay rather than an encyclopedia article. Admittedly it's been improved a bit since I first made that comment to the article's creator, but I don't feel that it's entirely salvageable. The title, for example, is quite POV ("Imposed"), and the introduction reads like a term paper. More than likely, this is an important subject, although in its present form it's not a good way of covering it. It also may be that there are other articles which already cover the same ground in a more neutral manner, but I'm not sure of that. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 00:06, 17 November 2006 (UTC) <s>**<b>Comment</b> if an admin gets the chance to fix this one up, the Talk page has been moved to a separate location, which is odd to say the least. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 05:41, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</s></p>

<li><b>Keep - but overhaul</b> - This is indeed a very important issue. As nom stated, the title is POV, &amp; needs to be changed to a neutral word (for example; stench, smell, aroma...). Other than that, I feel that the article can be rewritten, although it may take a while. It needs to be wikified too. With a bit of tender care, it should become a good article. I would have had no hesitation to delte the article had it been unreferenced, but as it is, it has a number of citations. So because the article only needs to be rewritten, i cast my vote as a keep. Maybe send it to a wikiproject that specializes in the topic, or get someone interested in the subject to work on it. If no progress is made, or it's too big a task, send it back here for a second look...

<li><b>Comment</b>: the article repeats itself multiple times, and it needs a lot of work to get it up to an acceptable level of quality. I do not mean to be harsh. This is just an honest assessment.

<li><b>Comment</b> I understand the impulse to overhaul this article, but really this reads like a "C" paper someone wrote for school and then pasted to the internet. It is very tendentious throughout, with the author making many assertions without much reflection, let alone evidence or sourcing: "Consequently, Romania is today in the stage of development considered by experts as post-communism capitalism. So is the education. The government tries to keep up with European Union goals, and education is parts of its effort to realize a definitive departure from the communist style." If these types of conclusions are to be drawn, there needs to be more thought given to them. While I could imagine an encyclopedia article focusing on the Romanian educational system (and indeed I have no doubt that the Romanian educational system under the Communists was deficient and used for propaganda purposes, as this author asserts), I think in doing so we are well-advised to start from scratch, with a new title but also entirely new content. Thus I vote <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a> 08:47, 17 November 2006 (UTC)Allon Fambrizzi</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> A potentially useful article could be made out of this, but at the moment it's too much like an essay. Inline citations might help (though they certainly aren't necessary to save this article from deletion). You also need to put a few more dates in. The scope of the article needs defining properly. The title should be something like "Communist education policy in Romania (1946-1989)" (or whatever the correct dates are). Then you'd need sections on "Education policy in the Stalinist era" and "Education under Ceausescu", for example, to show the differences in policy between those two periods. Finally, you could have a section on "Legacy in post-Communist Romania" or whatever to show the continuing effects today. I'm not sure words like "impose" are POV in this context; after all, we're talking about characters like Stalin, Gheorghiu-Dej and Ceausescu, who weren't the world's greatest consensus-seekers to put it mildly. --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 14:55, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Thank you for reading my article. I believe this is not a 'POV'. Stalinism could hardly be viewed as 'neutral'. It was not good or bad; it was only bad and it should be mentioned real facts. It is not an eassy. There were too many historical parts,and I agree with this point but I thought it was required to explain why so many things changed so fast. I changed the title and could be improved it again. I still wait for suggestions. Any changes to transform it into a real wiki are very wellcommed. I could use these parts in "History of education in Romania" or "Education in Romania". But it could stand also as an independent article because this topic is something different from the rest. And it is important not only for Romania but for any East-European country or for those who want to know sad facts of communism.</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Dorian, while I heartily concur with you that Stalinism was by no means a good thing, that doesn't mean that an article can blatantly be anti-Stalinism. As an encyclopedia, Wikipedia must remain <a href="../../../o/b/j/Objective.html" title="Objective">objective</a> and utilize value-free language. The article does have some POV problems, though I don't think they are too substantial. I still think the article should be renamed to something along the lines of <b>Education in Soviet Romania." --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 20:39, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</b>

<li><b>Two things</b>. First, just because Stalinism is a bad thing, it doesn't mean any article making the point "Stalinism is a bad thing" is okay. Despite whatever laudable moral purpose you may have in writing the article, it still is conclusory and not backed by any apparent research into the subject. Indeed, the article is still a series of general conclusions about the subject instead of anything providing actual information. Second, the article makes claims about things other than Stalinism, including Romania today. So your conclusions may be true, but you need to back them up. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a> 02:07, 20 November 2006 (UTC)Allon Fambrizzi</li>

<li><b>Still Delete, strongly</b>. Every single paragraph is almost 80% strongly POV. There continue to be phrases like <i>In Romania the socialist regime tried using education chiefly as a main way to justify it. They tried to instil passion only for manual labour and discourage intellectual pursuits.</i>, which are not backed by inline citations, and are frankly disputable as billy-o. Two of the minimal references discuss the Republic of Moldova, not to Romania, as the essay purports to discuss. One of the remainder is a study of <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roma.html" title="Roma">Roma</a> education in particular, not relevant to the article as a whole. In addition, there's a link to the Library of Congress site and the Church. This is someone's college essay. If a freshman handed it in to me, it would be given a C. The only thing saving it from a C- is that there arent that many spelling mistakes. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 09:52, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Not much in the way of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> that mention him on his own, I added the only one I could find quickly. Normally I'd say "redirect to his (more <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">famous</a> than him) band but hard to make a redirect since there are two possible targets. Still, he appears to satisfy the fairly stringent guidelines for the inclusion of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">musicians</a> in that he "was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable." - 152.91.9.144 02:10, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> based on the fact that there <i>are</i> two possible targets for a redirect.

<dd>I really don't have a horse in this race, but a couple of comments on that suggestion: Delete and merge is problematic with regards to <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a> and is only done in dire cases. Further, if this page were merged, a <a href="../../../r/e/d/WP%7EREDIRECT_245d.html" title="WP:REDIRECT">redirect</a> stops someone from re-creating this if they put the guy's name in and find there is no article. Finally, I'm not sure how the <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#Articles" title="WP:CSD">"A1" speedy deletion criterion</a> applies. It says, <i>"Very short articles providing <b>little or no con<u>text</u></b>."</i> This article has plenty of that.<br />

<dd>I understand your concern regarding my statement. I reread it a second ago and I agree that it sounds a little funny.

<li>I strongly disagree with the view that wealth is inherently notable. Notability arises from actions, not accidents of birth. He was born into the business (he was put on the board at the age of 20, which doesn't suggest he worked his way up the hard way), and has simply lived with it. If he has done something notable let's hear about it, but on the basis of this entry he has done nothing that another businessman wouldn't also have done. I also fail to understand how he can have been awarded the DSC in 2004: no military career is noted. With this in mind, I vote to <b>Delete</b>. I also suggest we extend the voting on this one, and actively seek broader input; I feel the larger question of whether wealth alone is notable is worth broader debate, and this looks like a good test case. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 17:43, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>WP:INN is not policy though it is, of course, a consideration. In fact if WP:INN was a ploicy then a large chunk of railway stations would become candidates. I think other discussions are relevant as a consensus was formed on as as notable (nor not dependent on your point of view) - if this didn't apply then, again, the stations would be up for a cull. A quick google search has resulted in <a href="http://www.classiccafes.co.uk/motorway_panel.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.classiccafes.co.uk/motorway_panel.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a>. There is no doubt more to be found - I have not seen a reference to an earlier installation of microwaves at a UK motorway services - something that makes it notable. <a href="../../../r/e/g/User%7ERegan123_9441.html" title="User:Regan123">Regan123</a> 23:27, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The reference you provide states the cafe of the station used to be more or less Space 1999-themed for a while. Good for Wikitravel, maybe, but hardly a proof of encyclopaedic notability per se. Other AfD discussions indeed serve to establish a consensus - bot on whether to delete or keep <i>the article(s) being nominated</i> in those cases. They are not inclusion criteria or notability guidelines, which still exist as separate entities. An article proposed for deletion must be evaluated on its own merits, and must establish its own notability. This page is not for discussing the concept of notability for a whole category - it is about one specific article and whether it has sufficient proof of notability to avoid deletion or <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a>-style merging.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Agree with everything Regan says, plus the fact that they are stubs, we have not yet had time to expand them (there's lots of 20th Century history to chronical), and they form a part of the 20th/21st Century which in all likelihood will not be with us forever. Already some have been rebuilt, there have been fires, shootings, prostitution, asylum scandals, others have won awards for design or food quality. South Mimms, which is one that has been marked (again) for deletion has had a TV documentary shown about it, and books written which reference it. My feeling is that these service areas, as unpleasant as many of them are, have their own stories to tell, and one day when we're long forgotton about probably will be wiped from existance altogehter, making this the perfect place to detail their histories. <a href="../../../c/2/r/User%7EC2r_192d.html" title="User:C2r">C2r</a> 23:01, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Motorway services in the UK are very notable as they are used by maybe a million+ people each year. This isn't just a petrol service station on a minor road or in a town, this is a motorway service station which are of massive use and necessity to the millions of drivers who use the UK motorway network each day. Also these services, as they are on the A1(M) are most likely one of the busiest on the network. There are also two hotels at the services which can be added to the article if people think it's too stubbish. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 07:22, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> OK, so it's a <i>big honkin</i> petrol station. Again, we don't have such stub articles for service areas on any number of very busy highways you want to name, like the <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illinois_Tollway_a71e.html" title="Illinois Tollway">Illinois Tollway</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indiana_Toll_Road_0e05.html" title="Indiana Toll Road">Indiana Toll Road</a>, or <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highway_401_%28Ontario%29_4303.html" title="Highway 401 (Ontario)">Ontario 401</a>. Sometimes there's <i>lists</i> of service areas (such as in the ON-401). I think your interest in documenting all these motorway details is blurring your perspective a bit. If this trend follows through to its logical conclusion, we're going to wind up with hundreds or thousands of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">NN</a> stub articles like this.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I wish people would stop nominating these without any apparent knowledge of their significance within British culture. Motorway service stations are not ordinary service areas. Their names are very well-known to British people all over the country - they are not just local institutions. There was even a programme about them on the BBC the other night. Such areas may not be notable within America, but they most certainly are in Britain. Comments like "very ordinary gas station" just show that many people have no actual idea what they're commenting on. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 09:31, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Uh, what? Please don't make overblown claims like that. The vast majority of service stations are <i>not</i> notable, even in Britain. I can name... uh... maybe a grand total of <i>one</i> service station, and that's only because I personally stop off there regularly.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I don't believe <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a> can possible apply here anyway, Motorway Services aren't just petrol stations used by local people, they are more commonly used by non-locals, people passing through on long trips. As a result they are know by people up and down the country, not just local people who may not actually use them at all. The Motorway Services on the UK network aren't like the ones you tend to find elsewhere, these are usually large complexes with hotels, restaurants, shops and many other facilities designed to assist and aid motorists on long journeys up and down the nations network. They are very much a part of UK life and are used by millions of people every day. We're not talking a little petrol station in a town used by a couple hundred locals every week, and we're not suggesting making articles about each of them. Many of them are household names, many documentaries have been made about then, even entire series based around the everyday activities of them. Why should articles like <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hotel_Canberra_05af.html" title="Hotel Canberra">Hotel Canberra</a> which is a hotel used by no more than a couple hundred people a day be more notable than something used by thousands, maybe tens of thousands. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 11:24, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

That is likely to be reached in a week at many UK service stations. Why is one more notable than another? Why is one deemed appropriate for an article and the other not? Why does two strips of concrete and an out house open around 4 hours a day become encyclopedic and a place used by millions every year not? What is so notable about the railway station that allows it to stay on here and yet a service station is deemed to be so unnotable that it must be deleted? And on culture, yes these are part of the cultural history of the UK, for better or for worse. I personally spend as little time as possible at service stations, but they were once gleaming symbols of modernity in transportation (I know it is hard to believe). <a href="../../../r/e/g/User%7ERegan123_9441.html" title="User:Regan123">Regan123</a> 14:22, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Service stations are not necessariyl linked to individual roads, however, some are on multiple - therefore by putting ones like this into the road article (which would be the A1), and ones like south mimms which aren't on an individual road (it's on three), it becomes confusing as to where the articles might be found. Furthermore, this article and articles like these aren't like Joes Esso on the relief road... they're actually created at the time the special orders are passed for the motorway or afterwards as they're specified by the government - you can't just come along and build one anywhere. It's also interesting that Railway Stations and airports are deemed to be automatically notable while motorway service areas are not, which seems to be a very perculiar (political?) ruling - could someone direct me to the page where this was discussed and deemed to be the case, as I'm sure the same reasoning could apply to motorway service areas as applies to railway stations.... As far as I'm aware there's absolutely nothing of significance about either (for example) Bayford or Crews Hill stations that could not be included on the 'locality' page about the villages.... whereas Motorway Service areas exist independently of location (they may be near none, and those that are near towns or village have nothing in common with the town/village, so probably don't belong on the pages for the town or village), and as stated previously I don't think they really belong on the motorway pages either; the A1 page, for instance would become incredibly crowded with information about the motorway sections, the historical sections, the different routes as the road has evolved over time.... Having said that, I've got better things to do with my time than argue over the deletion of stubs, as they're fairly easy to put back again once sufficient information on them is found (o; <a href="../../../c/2/r/User%7EC2r_192d.html" title="User:C2r">C2r</a> 20:25, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> This is not a vote to delete - we need to find a solution. <b>Merge</b> to what? Perhaps I'll need to create the solution. This article needs improving, since those who have never been to it can't get a sense of it from the article. These are multi-business landmarks on the motorway network. Not gas stations. The comparison with rail stations is close. But does each still need their own article? I think better to create one big article describing these in general, with a list of them perhaps as a sub article. There are not that many of this size in Britain - I think one article or two might work. Or perhaps one artcle for each major motor way. We need a place to work this out, not to argue about deleting.<a href="../../../o/b/i/User%7EObina_7738.html" title="User:Obina">Obina</a> 22:07, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>How about each major motorway just having a list, like, say List of service areas on the A1 and A1 (M). No doubt these are areas with multiple business generating multi-millions of pounds, but so are shopping centres and many US tollway service areas, and not all them are notable, either. The argument that railway stations each get their own article doesn't hold water, not all railway stations <i>do</i> get their own article, and not all <i>should</i> get their own article, however, (a) there's already been a precedent set in the case of RR stations, and (b) Generally, there's only one railway station in each town or neighborhood, and they're often a transportation hub, rather than a stopoff. Many railway stations are historically or architecurally significant, few service stations or service areas are. (Some railfans have their own bent perspective on the importance of railway minituae as well)
<dl>
<dd>The problem with that solution is you'll end up with articles that are just the same. The reason being that motorway services are actually not that common and the vast majority of motorways only have 1 MSA on them. The M2, M20, M27 (I think) only have one on their entire length, even the M25 only has two Motorway Services (I think. It could be three but I'm not sure). Some motorways don't have any. So you'd end up moving them to articles with different titles but end up with the same information in them and the same arguments. However maybe there is a solution that involves combining them together in some form, and redirecting from the individual names, I just can't think of the best way to do that. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen_W_Bell_a229.html" title="User:Ben W Bell"><font color="blue"><b>Ben W Bell</b></font></a> <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBen_W_Bell_4407.html" title="User talk:Ben W Bell"><i><font color="blue">talk</font></i></a> 07:21, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, since the people wanting to keep are predominantly British, that's not really a useful question. As a Briton, I don't know whether articles on service stations in other countries are worth keeping or not, which is why I wouldn't express an uninformed opinion on them in an AfD basing their worth on the perceived worth of <i>similar</i> (but probably not identical) facilities in my own country (comments like "it's just a big gas station" just go to show that many people commenting here don't actually know much about the subject at hand). Why should we be comparing them with service stations elsewhere? That's not the issue at all; the issue is their significance in their own milieu, not somebody else's. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 00:11, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, this <i>is</i> the <b>English language</b> Wikipedia, not the <b>British</b> Wikipedia, so how this all fits in the overall WP context does count, at least IMHO. I'm still a little puzzled as to why these are considered notable in their own milieu. It's not like Britain isn't loaded to the gills with notable places and structures (it is). Also, if someone later decides to put up similar articles in other countries, they're going to point to this kind of article out as an example to justify it.

<dd>You're completely misinterpreting what I said. I can't compare British service stations to American service stations because I have no knowledge of American service stations. All I can do is give my opinion as to the significance of British service stations in British culture, not how they compare to vaguely related institutions in other countries. To ask me (or anyone else) to compare them to something I/we know nothing about is ridiculous. But I do know how significant they are to many people in Britain, and how well-known many of them are. A lot of people here seem to be comparing them to ordinary "gas stations" or diners, and that's not what they are. Coincidentally, here's an <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6157806.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6157806.stm" rel="nofollow">article</a> about them that featured on the BBC News website today, which highlights a particular service station. Are there articles about American service stations on national American news? And anyway, of course subjects' significance in their own milieu counts; American state representatives have absolutely no impact on or interest to most people outside the USA, or even their own state, for instance, but they still all have their own articles, as justified by <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 17:34, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think there really needs to be a substantive discussion on an overall policy on inclusion of waysides, MSA's, <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illinois_Tollway_oasis_cf89.html" title="Illinois Tollway oasis">tollway oases</a> and roadside whatnot, as there is on railway stations, see: <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangoe_Wikipedia_is_not_a_timetable_2ab6.html" title="User:Mangoe/Wikipedia is not a timetable">User:Mangoe/Wikipedia is not a timetable</a>. I would note in the tollway oasis article, one of the first things that's said about them is that they're similar to British MSA's, which is the impression I also had when I visited an MSA. The first line of the BBC article is <i>Motorway service stations have become a byword for bad food at top prices</i>, a charge that was levelled in the past at tollway oases, too. (Now they have <a href="../../../m/c/d/McDonalds_bd82.html" title="McDonalds">McDonalds</a>, which is some improvement) Yes, some gas stations, truck stops and so forth get media mentions in the USA if they're notable, eg: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=20&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;rls=GGGL%2CGGGL%3A2006-19%2CGGGL%3Aen&amp;q=%22dixie+truckers+home%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=20&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;rls=GGGL%2CGGGL%3A2006-19%2CGGGL%3Aen&amp;q=%22dixie+truckers+home%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Dixie Truckers Home</a>.

British peers automatically get in, too. Lastly, at this point, <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorway_service_area.html" title="Motorway service area">Motorway service area</a> redirects to "Rest area", which really isn't the right place for an article on MSA's, if you ask me. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 19:54, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>There used to be a UK MSA article, but it got merged into the general Rest Area article. It might be worth considering a demerge and reinstating the UK specific article. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSG_062d.html" title="User:MarkSG">MarkSG</a> 15:10, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, I only said it "might be" worth considering - I'm not making a definite argument in favour of doing it yet. But it's a suggestion which might be suitable as a compromise here, as it gives a place for all the information in these stubs to find a natural home without having to delete it altogether.</li>

<li>Having said that, I think there are good reasons for demerging it from Rest Area. For a start, an MSA is a very specific type of Rest Area, which operates under specific government guidelines and regulations. It's not just a big gas station on a major road - it's part of the UK motorway infrastructure. The current Rest Area article is somewhat misleading, in that it implies that MSAs are what Brits call facilities that elsewhere would be called a Rest Area, when in fact they are more specific than that. It's a bit like having an article on roads which suggests that "Interstate" is what Americans call roads that elsewhere are called "major roads" - sure, an I-road is a major road, but it's more than just being major that makes it significant. An MSA is a subset of rest areas, rather than just being the British name for them. And, as far as I'm aware, the UK concept of a motorway service area is unique - one of the things that makes them controversial in the UK is because they are regulated in a way that equivalent facilites elsewhere, such as the US and mainland Europe, are not. So, taken as a group, they would satisfy the Wikipedia requirements for notability even if an individual site would not. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSG_062d.html" title="User:MarkSG">MarkSG</a> 15:29, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Not all of them are worthy of article. I do not know about Washington, but I am not convinced that <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a> would necessarily apply. Firstly because some of these are enormous franchises granted by the government, and their existence can be verified on every UK road map. These are often much more than service stations, sometimes incorporating shops, restaurants (sometimes with starbucks, mcdonalds) and motels. They may belong to chains such as Granada, but whole motorway service network of motorway services are not under single ownership. We are now seeing a proliferation of articles on shopping malls, where we already see very passionate debates about their notability or otherwise, MSA may well fall into this category should we perhaps draw up a guideline called "WP:MALL" to cover these?&#160;;-) As most of these articles are pretty much stubs, they could be merged and populated if people think worthwhile. Per above debate, it may be useful to have these as sections in the relevant motorway, or include them as part of the relevant franchisee, with a navigational page List of United Kingdom motorway service areas.

<li><b>Delete</b>. First of all, the information in the article is not verified by sources independent of WXYK. Heck, it doesn't even seem to be verified by (the non-independent) WXYK website, which is the only non-trivial reference listed in the article. So I looked on Lexis-Nexis, and surprise surprise, there is no coverage of WXYK, like most radio stations. So we have a clear failure of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> like the nominator said. Now, in response to all the keep voters above who cite "precedent" or claim that "notability patterns have been set": please note that precedent is not an argument for automatically keeping or deleting anything. If there have been good <i>arguments</i> made in past AfD's that apply to this AfD, then make those arguments. Simply citing the <i>results</i> of past AfD's is not convincing. Next, in response to the keep argument "Do we need to delete all the other [local radio stations] as well?": Yes. Those that have no reliable independent sources that establish notability (i.e. most of them) should be deleted. Finally, in response to the claim that there is "consensus" that "all licensed full-power radio stations are notable": this is not true (witness the delete voters here). Consensus about this radio station will be established in this AfD. Consensus in past AfD's has nothing to do with consensus in this one. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 17:08, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Concentrate upon finding and citing sources instead. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:04, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Alright, no trolls, but what about the above comments by Spawn Man? That's not fair... I have found some sources but I don't have time to add them to the article at present.

<li>They clearly indicated that <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpawn_Man_fbc1.html" title="User:Spawn Man">Spawn Man</a> is not doing the research that is necessary for participating in AFD. The correct response to them is not, as you did, to talk about "bashing" but to point out that counting search engine hits is not research. Research involves <i>actually reading</i> what the search engine turns up.
<p>AFD discussions last for at least 5 days. Although if you've found sources, it should be a matter of a mere couple of minutes to cite them. All that the primary <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> criterion requires is citations, so that editors can confirm that the published works exist, and read them to determine the depth of material that they contain (i.e. that they are non-trivial and not simply directory entries). <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:00, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Speaking of hard-working men, four years ago two renowned University Professors and an enthusiastic reporter started an effort to get more students interested in the "boring" subject of math. It was called "Neuron-ey Anuronon", a math puzzle column different from the more conventional ones. They never disclosed the answers, and all those who could solve a certain number of the problems were given certificates. Slowly, they began arranging real contests. In time, the two professors, Dr Kaykobad and Dr Zafar Iqbal, applied to the International Math Olympiad (IMO) for membership.</i></dd>

<li><i>Being a Brigadier General alone should be notable enough</i> Well, I'm in the military and I can tell you that 1 stars are not at all uncommon. But you don't have to take my word for it: <a href="http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/2003/cb03-ff04se.html" class="external text" title="http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/2003/cb03-ff04se.html" rel="nofollow">According to the Census bureau there are 873 active duty admirals or generals currently serving as of Jan 2003</a>. That's not even including the Generals in the Reserves and National Guard which would easily push that number over the 1,000 mark. Those are just Generals who are still in the service. Now imagine adding not only all of the retired Generals, but the ones who have passed away such as General Schmuck. And let's not be US centric! Throw in the equivalent Generals from all of the world's major armed services. Rank is obviously not a feasible test of notability.</li>

<dd>All I'm saying is that if this person cannot be established as singularly notable, there's no reason to have the article. A line has to be drawn somewhere of what people are to be included in an encyclopedia, as wikipedia is not a repository of biographies. None of the references in the article establish notability. The USMC bio is not independent of the subject, neither is the article from the website of Arlington National Cemetary where he's buried. The article you mentioned is independent but does not feature Schmuck anymore than it does the Colonel, Lt Col, Captain, Lieutenant or NCO also discussed in the article. <a href="../../../j/g/a/User%7EJGardner_e1b0.html" title="User:JGardner">JGardner</a> 07:12, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>SPEEDY KEEP</b> The present nominator was in the minority in the very, very recent AfD discussion, and IMO seemed to be expressing somewhat of a bias against military people in general during that discussion. I think when the numbers reflected 7-3 the Admin made a mistake by calling it "no consensus." <i>Consensus does not mean that everything must be unanimous.</i> Donald Schmuck is notable. Regardless of the way that the Admin marked the closing remarks of the AfD, there was a consensus to keep.

<ul>
<li>On a second look, I bascially agree with Night Gyr's perspective on this point - though I would say that its more of a merge of text from two or three sources than a rewrite as such <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 03:26, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Procedural Keep with Total Rewrite advised</b> On the one hand, I don't see any solid claim of encyclopedic notability (as per nom) in the article. It's certainly possible that one or several can be made, but the article simply doesn't do it. I would tend towards Delete in such a case, unless substantive claims can be made and proved. On the other hand, Night Gyr is right to say that it is too soon to renominate the article after the first afd (Bottesini, please wait a couple of months or so). (However, Wikipedia is not a memorial, and should avoid the appearance of plagiarism - the article should be rewritten to avoid sounding like the obituary an bios it is derived from). <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 03:18, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> but I might change my mind if those who are arguing Keep so emphatically would actually make an argument for why this career military man is notable. I disagree with the idea that "the question of notability is there to ensure that we have enough reliable sources to write a good article about the guy" -- besides the fact that this argument is a blatant ploy to avoid the issue, the question of notability has always been a stand-alone requirement as opposed to a function of the sourcing requirement (after all, it is relatively easy to source an article about a non-notable subject-- not everyone mentioned in judicial records and newspaper articles deserves an encyclopedia article). <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a> 08:29, 17 November 2006 (UTC)Allon Fambrizzi</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I find the arguments raised above in the nomination by JGardner compelling: brigadier general is not on its own grounds for notability per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>; neither is leading a brigade in the Korean War. Suggesting this be kept without making reference to those arguments is lazy. The nominator has laid forth perfectly legitimate reasons to remove this on grounds that the subject fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

<li>I have nothing against the military <i>at all</i>, but no, being a one star general does not satisfy notability requirements. There are over 800 generals serving actively right now.

<li>Is it your serious contention that anyone who has ever attained the rank of brigadier general is automatically notable? For what reason? Aside from the fact that you've now just opened the door for the multiple thousands of living and dead US one stars and higher, not to mention the tens of thousands of brigadier and higher equivalents from other major world militaries, current and past; I must ask, why stop there? Why not include every Colonel? How about every Lt. Colonel? Major? We can continue to go down the military hierarchy, but the point is that whatever rank you draw the line is wholly arbitrary. The sole factor it should come to as to whether a person of whatever title or rank should be included in an encyclopedia is: <b>has this person been established as a singularly notable figure?</b> If that can't be established, why on earth should an encyclopedia care about him? <a href="../../../j/g/a/User%7EJGardner_e1b0.html" title="User:JGardner">JGardner</a> 07:12, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I feel nothing but sympathy for all of those that are saying keep just on the sentiment of this man's impeccable military service record. Yet, sentiment is not notability. The <a href="../../../n/a/v/Navy_Cross_2803.html" title="Navy Cross">Navy Cross</a> is the second highest US military medal awarded and is the equivalent of the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Force_Cross_e62d.html" title="Air Force Cross">Air Force Cross</a>, and the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distinguished_Service_Cross_f9eb.html" title="Distinguished Service Cross">Distinguished Service Cross</a> of the Army. A career making highlight for any military member -- yet, not exceedingly rare. Here are the numbers for each award: Navy Cross <a href="http://www.homeofheroes.com/navycross/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.homeofheroes.com/navycross/index.html" rel="nofollow">6,920</a>, Distinguished Service Cross <a href="http://www.homeofheroes.com/distinguishedservicecross/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.homeofheroes.com/distinguishedservicecross/index.html" rel="nofollow">13,449</a>, Air Force Cross <a href="http://www.homeofheroes.com/airforcecross/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.homeofheroes.com/airforcecross/index.html" rel="nofollow">191</a>. All of those men and women are no doubt courageous, but certainly not all of them are notable. An impressive military record is not, by itself, notability anymore than an impressive career at a major corporation is, by itself, notability. Show me evidence that this man had a singular impact on the military or on history at-large that is somewhat widely recognized and I would be all for keeping this article. As it is, however, Schmuck is just coming off as one of the many thousands of highly decorated military officers who have also remained historically anonymous. And also as it is, the article (originally created by User:FrankSchmuck), looks like little more than a memorial to a relative. Please, prove me wrong; if this person is so notable where's the independent sources confirming it? <a href="../../../j/g/a/User%7EJGardner_e1b0.html" title="User:JGardner">JGardner</a> 05:21, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Although clearly the current article doesn't do a lot to show notability, he definitely is. The Sonic comic is both long-running and popular, but he's done quite a lot of other work as well, including the Star Trek and ST:TNG comics, and plenty of other work for just about every major publisher including Marvel, DC, Archie, Disney, and Image. He's also a regular speaker at cons and such, including the really big ones like the San Diego Comic Con, the biggest one in the world.

<li><b>Delete</b> No references are provided to show he is notable except for work on the comic.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Converting into a category will lose data, for instance the date the game was released, and for what platform it was released for. The game output of one single company is not untrackable; I'm not convinced this is unmaintainable.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>.

Also, I find the argument stating that it's already in categories to be invalid -- a lot of these games simply do not even have their own articles, and the information would not exist elsewhere on Wikipedia if not for this article. --<a href="../../../c/z/j/User%7ECzj_f490.html" title="User:Czj">Czj</a> 06:19, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> as it's already been said the genre of items that can go in here are quite narrow. Only games that nintendo has actually published can go in here. Given that Nintendo themselves publish (I think) abouit 10-20 games per year at the most it's not likely that this is going to become unusable. Not to mention the games are uite nicely partitioned by year so it is useful for research if needed, or just browsing Nintendo's history <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHairRef_3d4b.html" title="User:BigHairRef">BigHairRef</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHairRef_5c72.html" title="User talk:BigHairRef">Talk</a> 10:59, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thank you Steven. I am more than willing to take any advice to edit my work on Alfonso Faustino so that it complies to the Wikipedia guidelines. I interviewed Alfonso in 2004 and have been tracking his work to date. I corroborated my sources and found the information I wrote to be accurate. The reason I felt that Alfonso should be included in Wikipedia is because of his ongoing accomplishments as an actor, his interest in animals, and his use of keeping a positive attitude to get to our dreams -- in my interview with him back in 2004, I found him to be extremely inspirational and having the ability to motivate people to be their best.Melissakavanaugh 06:04, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I see no independent sources (IMDB doesn't count, they list everyone that's ever set foot on a soundstage, and the Oracle bit is a press release for the project and it's not even <i>about</i> him; it's about Oracle looking good for the investors). <b>Delete</b> as a NN actor trying to hit the big time. --<b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumblefool_50e8.html" title="User:Humblefool">humble</a></b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumblefool_8320.html" title="User talk:Humblefool">fool</a><a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandompage_5bbb.html" title="Special:Randompage">®</a> 06:14, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>The reason I felt that Alfonso should be included in Wikipedia is because of his ongoing accomplishments as an actor</i> What accomplishments would those be? The IMDB listing shows two films, both shorts -- and he's not even the major part in one of them. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 06:15, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually in my experience in the film industry IMDB is probably the most reputable internet movie database around because no one can be added without having credits to a film or television project -- it's really tough to get credits for a film project, but to those film people, it's really important, and they fight to get credits on the projects that they work on. I read the Oracle source that the user listed, and it states that Alfonso was a major player in the Tanzania Project of which the user wrote about. True he is not a big-named actor, but I like the way the user wrote about things that he's done outside of acting. I found it refreshing to read about touchable real person doing some cool things. If he was a big-named actor, then his accomplishments would be all over the place. I vote to keep him in because the information is truthful and he is a registered actor regardless of his star power.Sara32870Esq 06:35, 17 November 2006 (UTC)<small>User's <b>very first</b> edit</small></p>

<dd>Your first sentence, being false in practically every way, fails to impress. Start with IMDB being a user-edited/added database, include the business side which accepts fees for enhanced listings and photos, and mention Hollywood's trend for crediting practically everyone below-the-line including the freaking <i>caterers</i>, and your whole assertion falls apart. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 07:13, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Steven, I appreciate the WP:BIO link; I agree with you, so I'm fine with the Speedy Delete. I will select another person to add to this environment. As a budding journalist, I met Alfonso on the set of a movie, and I really enjoyed getting to know him, so I thought it would be a refreshing subject, but my article and subject just doesn't have the punch.&#160;;-) Take care, Steven.Melissakavanaugh 07:04, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Speedy Keep</b>, close per it being a bad faith nomination. The only time the user ever suggested that the article should be deleted is because a website, VGCharts, had been proven to be a poor source for Wikipedia, and when that happened, the user talked about deleting it if they are removed. And how can you not see how it can be salvaged? Just because a page which is no better than a Geocities page isn't verifiable does not mean that NeoGAF, IGN, GameSpot, et al. are suddenly not verifiable.

<dd>First of all the only reason I suggested the article be deleted is because most of the entries are unsourced due to the fact that the majority of the entries were sourced by VGCharts which was recently removed by <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a>. Secondly, I was not the only user to suggest the article be deleted, several users have recently stated that they think the article should be deleted due to unverifiability. If you or someone can greatly improve the state of the article, I'd gladly remove the nomination, unfortunately I do not think that is possible. <a href="../../../d/i/o/User%7EDionyseus_52e5.html" title="User:Dionyseus">Dionyseus</a> 06:17, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And you can prove it unverifiable how so? We get NPD, Media Create, Famitsu, etc. information every week (NPD every month). And VGCharts was deleted because no one could prove verifiability and the one supporting it the most more or less gave up.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Whew. I was really, really tempted to vote speedy keep on this because I am positive this is a bad faith nomination (if you have a lot of time and a strong stomach feel free to see the talk page of this article to see what I mean), but I think that the article as it exists must fail for lack of verifiabilty and therefore is against policy. Now I have no problem with an article about best-selling games, but even after endless rounds of discussion, no one has come up with a good source for most of this material, while all attempts to remove the bad material and leave what is verifiable has failed and led to edit wars. The fact of the matter is that video game sales data is jealously guarded by the NPD, and virtually the only time reliable data comes out is when a company wants to tout its own success (see this article for more background: <a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_zd1up/is_200401/ai_ziff117173" class="external autonumber" title="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_zd1up/is_200401/ai_ziff117173" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>.

<p><b>Strong and Speedy Keep</b>. 1) The whole point of Wikipedia is to improve articles, and this article has plenty of room for improvement. Our goal should be to fix the article. 2) If the article doesn't have sources, find some. If you can't find them, then nominate it for deletion. If no sources can be found by anyone who's read the nomination for deletion, then it should be deleted. However, I can't imagine that this information isn't out there in one form or another from a reliable source. 3) On the talk page, I found this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AList_of_best-selling_computer_and_video_games&amp;diff=88364020&amp;oldid=88336906" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AList_of_best-selling_computer_and_video_games&amp;diff=88364020&amp;oldid=88336906" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> post by <a href="../../../d/i/o/User%7EDionyseus_52e5.html" title="User:Dionyseus">Dionyseus</a>, in which he states, "The article looks rather empty and silly right now, perhaps it should be deleted" and "if the state of this article doesn't improve soon I will nominate it for deletion." Although I firmly believe <a href="../../../d/i/o/User%7EDionyseus_52e5.html" title="User:Dionyseus">Dionyseus</a> has the best intentions, the reasoning behind this article's deletion is flawed for two reasons: a) It is based on some sort of "invisible timer" by which someone has to improve the article to avoid a deletion nomination and b) An article's "silliness" is cause for deletion, and although I certainly agree its current format is anything but helpful, I would argue that that's more of a cause for Wikification. Thus, I cannot support this nomination in its current state while the article remains salvagable. --<a href="../../../h/e/m/User%7EHemlock_Martinis_534d.html" title="User:Hemlock Martinis">Hemlock Martinis</a> 07:07, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>To add to the above, this is by far the most reliable source for sales of video games in North America and the primary source used by everyone from the media to the video game companies themselves.

<li>Indeed. This sentence is taken from that very same Assume good faith policy: <b>This policy does not require that editors continue to assume good faith in the presence of evidence to the contrary.</b>. I think the evidence does indeed lead me to a bad faith nomination conclusion.

<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b> This is one article that I have personally found useful on a number of occasions, as I'm sure have others. The "original research" claims are ridiculous: <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> prohibits <i>unpublished theories</i> and <i>self-conducted experiments</i> and such. For this to qualify as original research, perhaps the authors have secretly installed hidden cameras in every retail outlet in the world so they know who sold how many of what? Far more likely, these are sourced either from gaming magazines or reports such as NPD group's annual overview of the video game industry. I agree there should be more of a push to determine sources on these, but the article itself must be kept. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 15:14, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We do not judge the sources from the source, but the source itself. As an example, suppose blogger ZZZ says "YYY sucks". Now, we would not go to article YYY and add a controversy section stating that "ZZZ thinks YYY sucks" or "YYY sucks" and referencing such blogger, because the blogger is not reliable. However, if IGN or Gamespot have an article that reads "Initial response about YYY is negative, with even some bloggers like ZZZ stating it sucks", we would be add such information to the YYY article. ZZZ, the blogger, is still a unreliable source. However, IGN or Gamespot are considered reliable in terms of video games, and although the fact they quoted ZZZ does not make the blogger more reliable than before, at least we now can quote a reliable site with basically the same information from the blogger. VGCharts hasn't got the reputation from IGN, Gamespot or Gamasutra, thus it is not considered a reliable source and should not be quoted directly. However, if IGN posts VGCharts numbers, we would be able to quote IGN using VGCharts numbers, but not VGCharts directly. -- <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyBrujo_ebf1.html" title="User:ReyBrujo">ReyBrujo</a> 20:18, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I've always had a bit of trouble applying WP:V to an AfD debate.

But <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_best-selling_computer_and_video_games.html" title="List of best-selling computer and video games">List of best-selling computer and video games</a>? That seems much less clear - there are obviously such things as computer and video games. They're sold. Some sell better than others. Some sell best...ergo, there are best-selling computer and video games, and it's possible to make a list with the proper information. So it's only a question of what to include, how to cite it, and how to format it. That's the proper dispute, and it's the dispute A Link to the Past and Dionysus were in before this was taken to AfD. (I agree that the AfD was almost certainly done in bad faith. Any AfD that follows three reverts is almost always going to be in bad faith.) There's a good question of how to cite these things - but as the above discussion illustrates, there are ideas. Someone has this data - as discussed above, it exists. The question is how to access the proper data, apply it, cite it, etc. That's not a verifiability dispute; that's a citation dispute.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 21:07, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. First of all, aggregating and ordering material from sources is not Original Research; it's <i>not</i> original research if your sources say "Game X was produced for console Z", "Game X sold W copies", and you order all games for console X by number of copies they sold. Original research implies <i>conclusions</i> and allegations not explained anywhere; it doesn't mean you can't put work in the article and organise it in a manner that makes it more useful for the reader.<br />
Secondly, this is a classic case of information for which verifiable sources <i>can</i> be found, and anyone who claims otherwise is obviously not thinking big enough. Seriously, now, what would deleting this article really prove? That we're utterly paranoid about everything, and can't even think of the possibility that there might be reliable lists that list this stuff? That we cannot let <i>potentially</i> badly sourced material live in article history? I'm not pointing you to a source for this stuff because I have no idea where to find the source myself, all I have is a gut feeling that <i>someone just might have compiled such list</i>, <b>duh</b>; all I'm saying is that it's ridiculous to delete the article if people haven't bothered to find <i>that</i> source yet. We're making a mockery out of how Wikipedia is supposed to work in a <i>sane</i> world. This nomination proves <i>exactly</i> what's wrong with the current delete-happiness based on "lack of sources". If I were in a worse mood (and in one of these I might), I might make this AfD the poster-boy.

<li>And please save your over-the-top rhetoric for an issue you have some understanding of. Unfortunately sales information is not available in a reliable way for most games. For every game we have concrete sales figures there are many more which we do not. As a result, the list fails to have meaning. What information we have on game sales is better conveyed in individual articles and perhaps an article, as opposed to a list, on video game sales. At present, this list can never hope to serve its purpose of identifying best-selling video games with any regularlity or accuracy, and it therefore fails to be verifiable, which is the big no-no of wikipedia. While some may have dragged original research into this debate, that is not the policy that is actually impacted here. This is not the movie or music industries, where this stuff is reported all the time. This is also not an industry supported by much secondary scholarship, so I doubt anyone has already put together the big list you speak of. Your vote is your vote, and I know I am not going to change it, but I hope I can point out how your little rant casts you in a somewhat poor light (though, to be fair, I have certainly enganged in worse rants from time to time myself&#160;;) <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 18:57, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

It is not the responsibility of those voting delete to provide sources. It is the responsibility of those who wish to keep this article, including you.

<p><b>Nomination for Delete <s>Transwiki</s></b> Delete <s>and transwiki to Wikinews</s> as breaking news item with no claim of encyclopedic notability. Newsworthy but not encyclopedically notable individual/incident. Fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> - Wikipedia is not a news service or a place for articles about news events without encyclopedic significance. (On the other hand, Wikinews IS the proper place on Wikimedia for broad news event reporting). Plus let me emphasize that news coverage does not automatically translate to encyclopedic notability.</p>
<p>I'm sympathetic to the victim here (plus my best friend is a student at UCLA). There are many incidents of police brutality - unclear what makes this one special enough (plus though its a serious incident, there are many worse cases too) for an encyclopedia article of its own. Potentially there could be sufficient encyclopedic notability from this incident in the future e.g. if this case leads to some major change in Californian law - but Wikipedia is not a crystal ball. It's way too early to tell.</p>
<p><s>Finally, let me make a plea on behalf of Wikinews. When news events happen, people always seem to rush off to create well referenced, detailed articles on Wikipedia at the expense of Wikinews (the proper site for wikimedia news service reporting), which ends up being a somewhat neglected backwater - it's a shame that Wikinews suffers from the good faith mis-impression that Wikipedia is a news service.</s></p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Notable. Has been reported in major mainstream media. A unique and interesting case in that a six-minute video of the incident exists. Another example of misuse of Tasers, which is a hot topic. One of three similar incidents reported in LA this week, each one with accompanying cellphone footage. Wikipedia isn't paper.

<dd>I stated in the nomination that the incident is newsworthy and emphasized that what I doubt is whether this incident is <i>encyclopedically notable</i>. Wikipedia is not a news service for breaking news and "hot topics". Wikipedia isn't paper but it's also an encyclopedia and news coverage - yes, even in major mainstream media - doesn't automatically translate to encyclopedic notability. I doubt that countless similar articles exist, but that's the usual <a href="../../../p/o/k/WP%7EPOKEMON_abf7.html" title="WP:POKEMON">Pokemon defence</a> anyway. Can you substantively suggest how this day-old incident falls under, as <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> describes valid articles related to news events, "<i>encyclopedia articles</i> on topics of historical significance"? <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 07:27, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I doubt that it will survive for long on the UCLA page either. Unless this incident turns out in the future to be a defining moment in UCLA history (and predicting Rodney King riots or whatever now would be crystal balling), this incident does not belong on the UCLA page.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. Well, this is still a current event - so it might have some historical/political/cultural/etc significance. Or it might not. I'd say to maybe let it stay for now. On a personal level, it makes me suddenly feel insecure and a little paranoid about the police force here and their use of power. I think many others feel the same way too. In that regard, I think this is where its point of signifance may particularly grow upon as the situation develops. At the very least though, this event does deserve a menton in the UCLA page under the controversy section... I personally like how is is expanded upon. I don't know if putting it under the student's name is the best way to explain the event in whole however, but there isn't exactly a real given name (that I'm aware of) to the situation either quite yet. -- <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowolf_ffd9.html" title="User:Shadowolf">Shadowolf</a> 10:40, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Both the Prussian Blue and USA for Indonesia articles went through this same similar thing at its time of controversy, and many memes go through the same process as they suddenly come out (but may/may not become a cultural artifact later on). People still read and edit them. I'm saying you should consider that the importance of the subject now, does not mean it will not be important, or even at least relevant, later. People still refer to them. That said, Wikipedia isn't a crystal ball, and neither are we.

<li><b>Keep</b> It's clearly encyclopediac. Lots of people are aware of the story, and interested in learning more from an encyclopedia article about Tabatabainejad. It's not an either/or choice with respect to wikinews. It can be in both places, with appropriate treatment in each place. To indulge for the moment in imputing motives, I think this is a good example of how people go overboard in trying to make wikipedia seem more important by imposing an inappropriately high standard of notability. Yes, a person who is notable only because he (or his mom, or his friend) write a blog post about him, sure, delete away. Someone like this? Please. Electrons aren't in such short supply that we need to be so zealous in conserving them. If this article had been deleted, it would have been a real inconvenience to me, and probably a fair number of other people, who are interested in what a wikipedia article on Tabatabainejad would contain. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Callender_e1e2.html" title="User:John Callender">John Callender</a> 01:55, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm not disputing the point you're making. Wikipedia shouldn't be a respository of news articles; agreed. I just don't think that point supports the deletion of this article. When I went looking for it, I wasn't looking for a news article. I can get any number of those from any number of sources. I tend not to use Wikinews for that, because I think there are things about wiki technology that work really well for an encyclopedia, but don't work particularly well for a news site. But that's a completely separate issue. And if the point about calling for this article's deletion is to somehow help Wikinews get traffic it wouldn't otherwise get, well, I don't think the cost is worth the benefit. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Callender_e1e2.html" title="User:John Callender">John Callender</a> 06:26, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> My main concern is that some reliable information on this very important incident be easily "findable" on Wikipedia. This situation is currently of global interest and could be a breakthrough or watershed in terms of Taser misuse finally getting on the "radar screen" of many, especially in the US. Our world is changing rapidly, and Wikipedia is becoming one of the world's reference sources for people trying to keep up with, and make sense of, the changes. A factual, verifiable article on the Tabatabainejad situation is a must. Wikinews is not yet nearly as well known as Wikipedia. I looked here first, and I've been involved in the Wiki community for a while. It honestly didn't occur to me to check Wikinews. The information needs to be where people go to find it, and at the same time some "education" regarding the role of Wikinews should be taking place. - <a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmarco_b7e5.html" title="User:Elmarco">Mark Dixon</a> 02:45, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Agreed. It could be argued that it's the position Bwitth is advocating that is relying on crystal-ball gazing, to determine, in advance, that the incident is destined to be viewed as insignificant. Yes, there are a lot of other similar incidents that could be covered in Wikipedia in the same fashion. And yes, it may be only an odd side-effect of the posting of the video on YouTube that has led to the degree of notability the incident currently appears to have. Regardless of the reasons for its notability, though, it seems pretty clearly to have achieved it, or at least gives preliminary indications of doing so. Lots of people have contributed to the article, and continue to update it. Maybe those people, and some of the people stating positions on this page about dramatic historical significance, are overstating things, and will tone down their views with the benefit of hindsight. I'd agree that that's probably likely. But it doesn't mean the article fails a notability test. At least as I see it, it's way, way over that bar already. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Callender_e1e2.html" title="User:John Callender">John Callender</a> 19:15, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>KEEP - We should definitely keep this up until we at least know what the outcome of the situation is. If those police officers are found to be guilty of violating this man's right or if they are found guilty of police brutality then this incident becomes significant when discussing the subject of police brutality or for that matter police brutality and the LAPD/UCLAPD. So until we learn more about the situation and more importantly the outcome, I think we should have this article on Wikipedia. -DAN <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 128.180.192.61 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.180.192.61_94d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.180.192.61">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> - With all my respect to the previous comments for deltion of this entry fully understanding the concerns and agreeing that wikipedia is not a new story repository.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Wikipedia does not, to my knowledge, require a level of popularity before an article is kept. I can find articles on obscure alien races from obscure 1990's video games; I don't think an article on a guy who got famous for being tasered warrents a deletion simply because it's not big enough for an encyclopedia to cover. I would suggest if this entry is deleted, then the entry for <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rodney_King_f40c.html" title="Rodney King">Rodney King</a> should also be deleted, for the exact same reasons.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think it's a bit premature to be drawing conclusions about the historical significance before the fullness of time has made it apparent, and to be making comparisons to events whose historical significance are already clear, the subject of this article is significant enough for inclusion on Wikipedia on the basis of the broad-based national news coverage he is receiving right now. As a side note, if the subject of an article is very recent, then perhaps it would be a good idea to give it a week or so before trying to decide whether it is noteworthy enough for inclusion, rather than to immediately start deletion proceedings. I think it's quite clear at this point that this article is going to stay, and a whole lot of unnecessary rhubarb in this discussion could have been avoided if we had just waited a few days. <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 08:19, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> although WP is not a crystal ball and without evidence we have to assume that it is not noteworthy. This should be a wikinews entry first and foremost, but this is the kind of articles we should have links to under police brutality, tasers, etc. That these kinds of things happen are not <i>only</i> news, they are also a fact about how things seem to work in the world (including democracies) - saying they are only news and thus not encyclopedic is saying that they are unique occurences. Its notable because it is so damn important.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this is deleted all the same, I suggest we link to a mention somewhere under police brutality (and have a link there to the wikinews article which we certainly should have). <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELundse_a2f1.html" title="User:Lundse">Lundse</a> 08:41, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is a noteworthy and probably historic event. Discussion has been heated and there is a need for a neutral collection of the facts. Whatever anybody thinks of tasers, it's doubtful we'll ever hear of one used in a library ever again. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevolute_58f9.html" title="User:Revolute">Revolute</a> 09:39, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Although we can't be 100 % sure, the amount of coverage and exposure would suggest this incident will be remembered as a noteworthy event for a very long time (although Revolute's suggestion that it will become a historic event is pushing it). To debunk the Crystal Ball/News event argument: often elections (just an example, other kinds of events too) have an WP article dedicated to them, that was started the moment the event was ongoing, and for which deletion was never considered. Several of these elections/events proved to be less noteworthy than this incident. Still, they have some importance, and merit a WP article. On a side note, I would suggest renaming the article to <b>Powell Library Incident</b>. The article is about the incident rather than about the victim; and that's just fine: the incident is far more noteworthy as the person Mostafa Tabatabainejad. — Adhemar 11:13, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'd suggest splitting into two articles, one on the incident and its aftermath, as well as the current one with biographical information on Tabatabainejad. The biographical one will be fairly short for now, but it could be expanded as new information comes to light. And running another call for deletion on the biographical article will give all of us something to do with our time.&#160;:-) -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Callender_e1e2.html" title="User:John Callender">John Callender</a> 14:57, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - Do you really want to start an article for everyone that happens to make it onto someone's cell phone camera? This started as a violation of college policy that was escalated to what amounts to a misdemeanor. The ruckus that took place is no more notable than any other resisting arrest. It's always ugly from the outside. How about the black guy in New Orleans post Katrina that was captured on tape being beaten by NOPD? How about every car chase that makes it onto a news helicopter camera? Just because this is a UTube/blog phenomena doesn't make it encyclopedic. -- <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeneb1955_ac1e.html" title="User:Geneb1955">Geneb1955</a> 11:30, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Of course we should not include everything caught on camera, nor should every piece of news have an article. But important court cases, good examples of a phenomenon (such as police brutality) should be included. Not because they are caught on tape or good news, but because they are important culturally, legally or otherwise. If this was just a misdeameanor, a ruckus and someone resisting arrest, then I would agree. But I see it more as an instance of misuse of force, taser used for punishment of a handcuffed subject and police brutality. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELundse_a2f1.html" title="User:Lundse">Lundse</a> 14:04, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Article highlights a shocking event that there is interest in, and a need for correct information on. The article also documents the aftermath of the event, which is important to be noted and held on record. The ongoing legal case will also develop with time, and the article should serve to provide users with access to the latest developments and truth about the issue. I would, however, recommend that the article is moved from "Mostafa Tabatabainejad" to "Mostafa Tabatabainejad Tasering Incident" to ensure that the person and the event (which fills the entireity of the article) can be logically seperated. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamSebWolf_543a.html" title="User:AdamSebWolf">AdamSebWolf</a> 00:09, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

When we say two things FACT-1 <a href="../../../o/i/c/OIC_56f1.html" title="OIC">OIC</a> has all Muslim majorty countries and FACT-2 same <a href="../../../o/i/c/OIC_56f1.html" title="OIC">OIC</a> recognize <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_mosque_627e.html" title="Al-Aqsa mosque">Al-Aqsa mosque</a> as third holiest site. Then why this article should remain kept? To annoy all the Muslims or to achieve some other hidden objectives. If you do not want to change it back I will request someone else. I believe there are still neutral persons in wikipedia and someone can do that edit for me. --- <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EALM_scientist_afc8.html" title="User:ALM scientist">ALM</a> 18:35, 17 November 2006 (UTC

<li>Unfortunately in your case, wikipedia is not a vehicle for disseminating the opinions of the OIC. The OIC carries significant weight, which is why it is the only organization mentioned in the lead of the article, but as there are plenty of reliably sourced and verified statements that there are valid alternatives, to delete it because <b>you</b> do not like it is a violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Similarly, adding extra sentences in the lead to (not-so-subtly) try to push one POV over another would also be a violation of NPOV. The OIC is given the weight it deserves by being in the lead. Our job here is <b>not</b> to appease the worlds Jews, Muslims, Christians, or animists; but to create a fair, impartial encyclopedia that bring suitably notable, reliable, and verifiable sources as devoid as possible from the specter of editor bias, <b>and let the reader decide, and not decide for them.</b> Threatening to violate wikipedia policy by using another editor is not an appropriate step in the dispute resolution process.

You seem not to understand wikipedia as well as you claim. 3RR warnings are given to people to <i>prevent</i> them from violating <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. You do not have to be a sysop to give the warning, that is what <a href="../../../a/n/3/WP%7EAN3_1491.html" title="WP:AN3">WP:AN3</a> is for. There was no threat anywhere about banning, unless you have a guitly conscience, perhaps. Also, doing it again here? Can you point it out to me? I merely said that <i>your</i> threatening to violate wiki rules by enlisting the help of others is not a step in the wikipedia <a href="../../../d/p/r/WP%7EDPR_0351.html" title="WP:DPR">dispute resolution</a> process. I fail to see a threat against you. Also, you should read up a bit about the difference between a <b>ban</b> and a <b>block</b>, you are interchanging the two improperly. <s>But, as I mentioned earlier, I am finding it harder and harder to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> based on your proven track record of misquoting cittations, adding POV's, delivering threats, misunderstanding editors, and <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">lack of civil</a> replies to those who would attempt to talk with you reasonably; but I will continue to try. So, I would suggest that 1) you may wish to study up a bit on wiki policies and guidelines more, as I think it is <b>you</b> who may not have a full understanding of the many policies of wikipedia and how they apply and interrelate, and also the definitions of various terms such as ban, block, 3RR, NPOV, RS, CITE, CIVIL, NPA, etc. Secondly, I think you should relax a bit about the block; it's very simple, no sysop should ban anyone unless guidelines and policies were violated, although warnings <b>should</b> be applied for the education of the editor and for tracking for sysop purposes (e.g. new users should not be blocked for WP:3RR without sufficient warning, etc.).</s> Lastly, I think you should once again read about the <b>purpose</b> of wikipedia, and how it is not to push one POV over another, but to provide a fair, impartial encyclopedia that brings suitably notable, reliable, and verifiable sources as free as possible from NPOV. You have much to offer, but please do so in accordance with policy. Thank you. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 19:59, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Conditional keep, based on cleanup</b> Further research for me has shown that while there exists disagreement over the identity of the site, academic support in English is weak. I've removed most of the "tourist-guide" stuff, but I'd prefer to see the article be culled from more obvious POV mentions and stick with the sites that are actually considered such as Imam ALi and Hala Sultan. At this point, I most probably could live with a <b>redirect</b> to Islamic holy sites with the following two caveats 1) The notable entries here are brought there in their entirety, without hiding or deleting the information, and 2) if more notable information is found, that the article get recreated as a non-POV fork per <a href="../../../s/u/m/WP%7ESUMMARY_66b7.html" title="WP:SUMMARY">summary style</a> -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 14:32, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> The point is not that the article has tourist guide information or not, but the point is that how much is it related to mainstream Islam and would it support that.

<li><b>Delete</b> If that is a dispute between Shia/Sunni then many Shia should be editing here and voting for keep. Where are they? I found no Shai but only people related to Israel editing there. Obviously, we all Muslim think Jerusalem as our third holiest site and very important for Muslims and it used to be our first Kaba. In the early days of Islam prior to the <a href="../../../h/i/j/Hijra_%28Islam%29_85e0.html" title="Hijra (Islam)">hijra</a> and until the beginning of the seventh month after hijra Muslims offered salat facing towards Jerusalem. <sup id="_ref-james_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-james" title="">[1]</a></sup> . These people related to Israel want to make it disputed using fake media/travel-websites sources. Those sources are already discussed in above AFD. Do you think the article name is right? <b>Third holiest site in Islam..</b>??? Should we also create articles about <b>First holiest site in Islam</b>, <b>Second holiest site in Islam</b>, <b>Fourth holiest site in Islam</b>, <b>Fifth holiest site in Islam</b> and so on? All Muslims in last AFD have voted to delete the article hence apparently they do not think the information mentioned in this article is right. Which Shia is fighting to keeping this article? However, some people <s>like <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a></s> who had never worked in any Islamic article and active in Jews article become interested in this one? Mostly Jew editors in last AFD voted for Keep. Do not you smell that something here is extremely wrong and they have created this article to deny Jerusalem importance in Muslims eyes? Oh I should be stupid and continue to assuming <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> despite all the things I see open and clear?

In general, although there is no strict policy or consensus for a specific time between nominations, articles that have survived a nomination for deletion should not be immediately renominated. Please ensure that nominations to delete an article which was previously voted "keep", are carefully considered, and are based upon policy. Repeated attempts to have an article deleted for non-policy reasons may sometimes be considered abuse of process and/or disruptive, and the article may be speedy kept.

<li><b>Keep</b> Rightly or wrongly, controversial or not, the term is often used in the American media to describe the Al-Aqsa Mosque. If this assignation is not controversial, the phrase should a redirect to that Mosque -- it seems to be controversial, though, and thus the a full article is warranted. The reason that "first holiest" and "second holiest" do not merit full article is that those phrases are not commonplace in the media (at least AFAIK, if they are elsewhere, then we <i>should</i> have articles for them.) Mecca and Medina are the subject of less Western media coverage than Jerusalem, given the media's obsession with conflict. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 02:34, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>, there is no question that anyone who is expert on Islamic subjects will find this article confusing. For every article, there should be some information that is conceived and passed. Based on my experience working on this article, and based on other comments made by other editors, I can give the following comments:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1- Some editors think that the message from this article, and they edit with this assumption in mind, that Mecca and Medina are not disputed, and that their place in Islam is not disputed. Well, I would like to see from them a proof that Mecca and Medina are not disputed particularly given that several of the citations included in this article here mentions Jerusalem as the second holiest for example. These editors who believe in this message are hunting for any mere mention of the word Third in Islam just to include it in this list of sites shown in this article. If the article is written to de-rank Jerusalem from its status in the religion of Islam like here, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Third_holiest_site_in_Islam_%28expression%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88381656" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Third_holiest_site_in_Islam_%28expression%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=88381656" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> and here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Third_holiest_site_in_Islam_%28expression%29&amp;diff=88066284&amp;oldid=88025948" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Third_holiest_site_in_Islam_%28expression%29&amp;diff=88066284&amp;oldid=88025948" rel="nofollow">[36]</a> and this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Third_holiest_site_in_Islam_%28expression%29&amp;diff=87879366&amp;oldid=87877008" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Third_holiest_site_in_Islam_%28expression%29&amp;diff=87879366&amp;oldid=87877008" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> then this is called bad faith editing if indeed this is what is intended by these users. Certainly, If one is to exclude the scripture, Quran and Hadith, which is the reason this site is third Holiest for Muslims, then one may argue not only the status in Jerusalem, but also whether Mecca is the first holiest or whether Medina is the second holiest, and so forth. I believe that these issues should not be exposed to erroneous materials found on the web or misinterpreted by some writers. Instead people look for an Enclopedia to tell them the truth about something and not confuse them more. This is a topic that should be treated with more respect. Having what qualifies for WikiPedia as resources on the internet here and there is not enough for this Article to claim precedence on this issue. Finally, some one added that a city in Tunis was the third holiest sometime in the past <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Third_holiest_site_in_Islam_%28expression%29&amp;diff=88209671&amp;oldid=88135314" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Third_holiest_site_in_Islam_%28expression%29&amp;diff=88209671&amp;oldid=88135314" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>. Well, let me tell you that this is wrong again, and that the two references brought here are copy paste of each other, therefore passing the same mistake. To correct you, Kairouan was a notable Islamic city at the time with one of the oldest universities built in the Islamic history. The same can be said in regard to <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Azhar_ee7d.html" title="Al-Azhar">al-Azhar</a> in Egypt. These mosques were the main destination of scholars for them being centers of science and knowledge at the time. Actually al-Azhar continues to be so even today. However, saying that they are the third holiest is again a mistake which only shows the confusion by some who are not familiar with Islam or with its correct terminologies.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2- Another message that might be conveyed through this article is whether the term Third Holiest is political or religious. This is of course a point raised by anti-Islamic editors like Daniel Pipes and Joseph Farah. Those editors, not only question the Holiness of this site to Muslims, they also question whether if this site was at all the one intended to be in the Quran. They also questioned whether there is anything holy for Muslims in Jerusalem. And finally, they questioned whether ‘Palestinians” ever existed at all. Some say what about Islam's holy sites? There are none in Jerusalem. See this <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=15066" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=15066" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> and <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=28222" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=28222" rel="nofollow">[40]</a> <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=15029" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=15029" rel="nofollow">[41]</a>. See these for denial pipes <a href="http://www.meforum.org/article/490" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.meforum.org/article/490" rel="nofollow">[42]</a>. Well, of course these editors never discuss if the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_of_Holies_cc94.html" title="Holy of Holies">Holy of Holies</a> term used by Jews to refer to the same site is also political or religious, particularly that the oldest continuously existing Jewish community of Palestine refer to a place in Nablus as the Temple that is the one meant to be in the Bible and Torah <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritan#Samaritan_Temple_on_Mount_Gerizim" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritan#Samaritan_Temple_on_Mount_Gerizim" rel="nofollow">[43]</a>. I do not see a discussion on whether the Holy of Holies is a political or religious one. I do not see an article therefore written to discuss the Disputes regarding the Holy of Holies. Also, I do not see any written articles to discuss First Holiest and Second Holiest in Islam.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think that the second point or the second message is a valid one, and may easily go to the Aqsa mosque article. Of course, this should be done by deleting all the other sites mentioned in that section because most of them are based on erroneous reporting or wrongly perceived reporting.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, it is wrong to conclude based on the material in this article that since the Ummayid Mosque is the third holiest by Syrians and since the Eyup Mosque is third holiest that this is the case for Sunnis given that Turkey and Syria are mostly so. The same can be said regarding the other sites attributed mainly to the Shiites. I see that this article is basically surviving by a material that at best can be described as erroneous and inaccurate reporting by some Journalists or visitors. This NOISE is only amplified by this WikiPedia article, and it is basically adding more confusion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally a remark by many Iranian newspapers confirming the confirmed: <a href="http://www.irib.com/worldservice/imam/palestin_E/default.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.irib.com/worldservice/imam/palestin_E/default.htm" rel="nofollow">[44]</a> <a href="http://www.geocities.com/ahlulbayt14/khom-quds.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/ahlulbayt14/khom-quds.html" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> <a href="http://www.geocities.com/ahlulbayt14/quds-grief.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/ahlulbayt14/quds-grief.html" rel="nofollow">[46]</a> <a href="http://www.iranmania.com/news/ArticleView/Default.asp?ArchiveNews=Yes&amp;NewsCode=46563&amp;NewsKind=CurrentAffairs" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iranmania.com/news/ArticleView/Default.asp?ArchiveNews=Yes&amp;NewsCode=46563&amp;NewsKind=CurrentAffairs" rel="nofollow">[47]</a> <a href="http://www.irna.com/en/news/view/menu-236/0610198285132713.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.irna.com/en/news/view/menu-236/0610198285132713.htm" rel="nofollow">[48]</a> <a href="http://english.irib.ir/political/palestine.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://english.irib.ir/political/palestine.htm" rel="nofollow">[49]</a> <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15343184/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15343184/" rel="nofollow">[50]</a> <a href="http://www.iran-press-service.com/articles_2000/july_2000/iran_peace_talks_28700.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iran-press-service.com/articles_2000/july_2000/iran_peace_talks_28700.htm" rel="nofollow">[51]</a> <a href="http://www.iqna.ir/en/news_detail.php?ProdID=76022" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iqna.ir/en/news_detail.php?ProdID=76022" rel="nofollow">[52]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Quds_Day" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Quds_Day" rel="nofollow">[53]</a></dd>
<dd>I appologise of course if some of these links included hateful language and were offending. The point here is that the official stand in Iran is that Jerusalem is the third Holiest.
<ul>

</dd>
<dd>Please note that most citations in the article are messed up and contradict each other which proves they are mostly erroneous reproting by non experts on the issue.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Oh by the way, the sites of the Mosque of Mecca and the one in Jerusalem were chosen and used so before birth of the prophet Muhammad. This is clear from <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/022.qmt.html#022.026" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/022.qmt.html#022.026" rel="nofollow">22:26</a>||}} and from <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahih_Muslim_6c10.html" title="Sahih Muslim">Sahih Muslim</a> <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/004.smt.html#004.1056" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/004.smt.html#004.1056" rel="nofollow">4:1056</a>. I am saying this because I noticed those not familiar with the Islam do not understand this fundamental issue. It is only the Mosque in Medina which was estaablished by the Prophet Muhammad out of these three sites. This is really a reason why such things like Holiness are not going to be sufficiently addressed with out referencing Muslim authorities or scholars on the issue.

<li><b>Expand</b> into Holy sites of Islam. Alternatively <b>keep</b>. Plain deleting seems out of place. The expression is very correct in my understanding (and Islam is by definition not "Pagan", as someone posted over there, but a Judaism-derived religion like Christianity, I protest as Pagan myself) but the entry seems to have little merit by itself. It does not seem an ecyclopedic entry and its content should be in other articles (but I think the same of all those articles about videogames' or TV series' characters, you know). I think that Muslims' opinions should be considered primarily (as long as they are consistent) when making the decision, as other people may have some vested interest in negating the Muslim holiness of Jerusalem, which is beyond doubt. --<a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESugaar_6002.html" title="User:Sugaar">Sugaar</a> 23:51, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Chess players' abilities are indeed quantifiable (ie: how many games won, how many errors made, etc., etc.) however how does one quantify "holiness"? <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott">→</a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span style="background: white; color: grey">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 00:51, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Scott, in that case, are you willing to remove the "holiness" quantifier from all Mosques, shrines, Temple mounts, Western Walls, Churches, Cathedrals, Sepulchers, etc. in wikipedia? Granted that is <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, and I'll agree that holiness may not be quantifiable in terms of photons or grams, but I think that there does exist a hierarchy in all religions, and there is a significant debate about what comes after Mecca and Medina in Islam. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 01:19, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't see any "debate" there... Based upon what you are talking about Avraham we can conclude that this article is nothing more than <b>original research</b> in that the article <i>itself</i> is framing a debate. Now you and I both know that is totally against Wikipedia's policies. I'd be curious to see if you in fact could produce a preferrably scholarly theologian link or links that specifically expound upon the idea that this is some sort of a "debate" about the "third holiest". <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott">→</a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span style="background: white; color: grey">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 02:07, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, Avi, I mainly meant western academic sources&#160;:) But I had a look at the link. It is not a *debate*: one that in which one scholar argues that for this and this reason X is the third holiest shrine and the other one contends... To shias, in practice the third holiest shrine is indeed Karbala; if you ask a shia where do you want to go: aqsa or karbala, I won't be surprised if he says karbala. But to be honest with you, I don't understand what is going on here. Honestly I don't understand why it matters to know which shrine is the third one. I have done some research on Islam and this question was by no means something important to be answered in academic papers. I feel there is something more to this and that academics are not concerned with that something. This is to the best of my knowledge, tomorrow it may turn out to be such a hot dispute... but then I'll ask what is it supposed to <b>mean</b> that "the third holiest shrine is X or Y". --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 02:13, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This started in the Al Aqsa Mosque - Ithink someone wrote a section in response to claims made there that AL Aqsa Mosque is the third holiest and he said that this view is not universal - it was them moved to a differnet article after claims this was undue weight on the al aqsa mosque article - so I don't see what the problem. If it's not for shia like you say it might not be and then Jerusalem too isn't 3rd holiest like claimed on other articles but it's rather KARBALA, then you can see why it's interesting to know and write about.

<li>Well, the more research I do does imply to me as well that the academic portion is rather weak, at least in English.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This article cannot be maintained in a NPOV state. The reason for that is the fact that the article was created to settle scores in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The fact that you could in principle have a bona fide article on this subject doesn't mean that we should keep this article. Similarly, if Neo-Nazis were to create an article about genocides with the intent of diminishing the Jewish Holocaust, you would have little chance that the usual wiki procedures would be effective in producing a NPOV article on that subject.<a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECount_Iblis_817f.html" title="User:Count Iblis">Count Iblis</a> 02:57, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Yes, but that indicates an inadequacy of the Wikipedia model that should be addressed (or at least acknowledged) rather than waved away.

<dd><b>Reply to Comment'</b> There is certainly a need for new wiki policies to deal with this. But until such policies are developed, we should use the existing wiki procedures to improve articles and delete those articles that wikipedia cannot handle. We can handle genuine POV disputes that are about the content of the article itself. That is no reason to delete an article. What we cannot deal with are are articles that are created as "weapons" to fight a conflict. The edit wars that you then see are not driven by a genuine difference of opinion on the subject matter itself and therefore cannot be resolved (at least not before the underlying conflict is resolved, in this case the Israeli-Palestinian conflict).</dd>
<dd>Should we tolerate articles on wikipedia that are in a permanent "State of War"? My opinion is that we should not tolerate such articles, because they damage the reputation of wikipedia. We shpould, of course, give the article the benefit of the doubt when we first suspect this problem.

<dd><b>Reply to Reply</b> "Should we tolerate articles on wikipedia that are in a permanent state of war?" As I already argued, yes. There are actually many articles in Wikipedia which are heavily controversial. Some of them are IMO excellent (not this one, but that's just my POV). Controversy, even radical controversy, is an essential component of scholarship. Moreover, you may have noticed that, beside trading accusations and not-so-veiled insults, some of the participants to this debate are stating their methodological assumptions, raising issues and discussing the validity and admissibility of the sources presented. In other words, they are talking across the fence. That's a good thing, at least far better than other types of confrontation around <a href="../../../a/e/l/Aelia_Capitolina_8545.html" title="Aelia Capitolina">Aelia Capitolina</a>. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStammer_f699.html" title="User:Stammer">Stammer</a> 11:21, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I have changed my mind to delete, after having actually read the article. The article gives an undue weight to random non-scholarly things. It would be comparable to having Bush is a fuckup (expresion).

For example, it uses one unsourced/unrated hadith from a non-Muslim scholar and some random quote from some guy in television and some random websites, and then proclaims proudly that <i>"With an estimated 130 to 200 million followers worldwide, this accounts for approximately 15% of all Muslims.[15] It is estimated that only Mecca and Medina receive more Muslim pilgrims.</i>. Im sorry, but at the very best, this is missleading, my father who is well read confirmed to me that the Al-Aqsa Mosque is the third post holy site among Shi'as, and i go by that over some random guy, random website and random scholar any day. Maybe if the article would be renamed to Ignorant claims about the third holiest site in Islam i would vote keep, but than we would have a notability issue. So, delete the article. If it gets delete, i truly feel sorry for the well intended guy who spent so many hours creating it, may it can be userfied? --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 13:27, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Very good comments? Hmmm… “you wont find real high level scholars maintain such a view/expression” and he goes on to say his father “confirmed to me that the Al-Aqsa Mosque is the <i>third most holy site</i>” … so the expression is used! His father may not be a high level scholar but it’s good enough for him! This is not about high level scholars, but about what the world at large refers to as Islam third holiest site. Maybe your father disagrees, obviously a good enough reason for you delete the page. I’m just sorry that the only other expression you could come up with contains foul language. You state “undue weight to random non-scholarly things.” Well wikipedia provides for such pages, as it was considered Undue weight on the <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Aqsa_Mosque_4de2.html" title="Al Aqsa Mosque">Al Aqsa Mosque</a> page where this info was originally posted and was therefore moved in accordance with <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html#Undue_weight" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">W:NPOV</a> where pages can be made to express minority held views. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChesdovi_1392.html" title="User:Chesdovi">Chesdovi</a> 14:11, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>"so the expression is used"</i>, yes, just as most holiest site in Islam (expression) and second most holiest site in Islam (expression). Why don't we have article on them? <i>"This is not about high level scholars, but about what the world at large refers to as Islam third holiest site."</i>, ok then name it to Misconceptions regarding the third holiest site in Islam and i will vote Keep, just as we have <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_misconceptions_about_HIV_and_AIDS_98d6.html" title="Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS">Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS</a>. <i>"I’m just sorry that the only other expression you could come up with contains foul language."</i> most secure place in the world (expresion) <a href="http://www.google.se/search?hl=sv&amp;q=%22most+secure+place+in+the+world+%22&amp;btnG=S%C3%B6k&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.se/search?hl=sv&amp;q=%22most+secure+place+in+the+world+%22&amp;btnG=S%C3%B6k&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[61]</a>, were is that article? <i>"where pages can be made to express minority held views"</i>. That is the best argument so far. However, i have not been convinced that a notable minority view holds such a belief.

The key is <b>scholarly</b>, you find a prominent scholar, knowing that he is talking about, that X is the third most sacred, and not the consensus one, then you have notability.

<li>Please explain to me on what basis your father believes it’s the third holiest. Is it based on that random verse in the Koran or other random Hadiths? Wikipedia is not only for including the majority held view but also other views. There is no compelling reason to subdue the contents of this article. Where do you think journalists and news websites get their information from? Maybe the attacks they report on are also unreliable? They usually glean information from the area of the attack interviewing the “natives” who will provide them with the details for their report, and if they say the site is third holiest, why should you dispute their beliefs? People have a right to know that the third holiest site in Islam is contested.

<li>He holds the view, referring to consensus.

And even humans are humans, maybe they interviewed some ignorant kid, or maybe his translator screwed up and was talking out of his hat? Maybe they want to boost the coolness of their tourist resort? Who cares, none of them were scholars, we are not talking about news and eyewitness credibility, rather on the "sacredness" of something according to Islam. You think you will be born with that knowledge, or empirically observe the "sacredness" with your own eyes in all three sites and conclude that "Oh yes yes, i now <b>see</b> clearly that X is most sacred"? This is a scholarly issue, not a "i'll ask some eyewitness about it" issue.

<p><b>Delete</b> or <b>Rename to <i>Third Holiest Site in Islam Controvery</i> and Rewrite</b>. This article has gone through several transformations.</p>
<ul>
<li>In it's original form, the <b>subject</b> of the article was the third holiest site in Islam. With that as the subject, it should be clear that the consensus of Islamic scholars would determine <i>which</i> site qualified. Giving significant weight to views which are not accepted by Islamic scholars would be giving undue weight and a violation of NPOV.</li>
<li>The article has been significantly revamped to remove some of the most dubious sources, such as travel sites. In its current form, the article is a <b>POV Fork</b> ostensensibly about an <i>expression</i>. However, the article does not clearly explain the notability of that expression. Instead, it pretends to present, in a pretended neutral fashion, some collection of statements about on an expression, without giving a clear explanation of why the expression is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">Notable</a>. Without such a clear exposition of the Notability of the phrase, the article qualifies for deletion as failing to properly assert notability. Also without a clear explanation that there exists an overwhelming consensus amongst Muslims regarding the third holiest site in Islam, and a clear explanation that the main proponents of the theory that the third holiest site in Islam is not in Jerusalem, then the article would not be an encyclopedic article about a controversy, but would be re-enacting that controversy in the guise of reporting objective facts. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> <font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../b/o/s/User_talk%7EBostonMA_e998.html" title="User talk:BostonMA">talk</a></sup></font> 04:20, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The notability problem could be remedied. The phrase is in fact notable, because it is central to a controversy. The article could clearly explain the notability of the phrase, if the subject were about the controversy, rather than a pretense at an objective inquiry into which is the third most holy site in Islam. However, to cover the controversy in an encyclopedic fashion, the article would need to identify who are the main protagonists in the controversy. On one side of the controversy is the overwhelming consensus of Islamic scholars. On the other side is predominantly non-Muslims. The editors who have demonstrated <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">Ownership</a> of this article have yet to allow such an encyclopedic treatement of this controversy.

<li>The controversy is this. <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Farah_7f95.html" title="Joseph Farah">Joseph Farah</a> wrote an article Myths of the Middle East, appearing in the <a href="../../../w/o/r/WorldNetDaily_c1c3.html" title="WorldNetDaily">WorldNetDaily</a> on 11 October 2000, which claimed that Jerusalem is not the third most holy site in Islam, because, according to him:

<dd>"What about Islam's holy sites? There are none in Jerusalem." <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=15066" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=15066" rel="nofollow">[63]</a></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>I don't think there is any significant controversy amongst <i>Muslims</i> regarding the third holiest site in Islam. However, there are <i>non-Muslims</i> who claim that the third holiest site in Islam is not in Jerusalem. I think it is appropriate to report on <i>that</i> fact. However, I think it is inappropriate to conceal the fact that it is non-Muslims who are primarily, and quite vocally, putting forward this claim. It is inappropriate to mix in a lot of non-notable opinions to conceal the fact that there is virtual consensus amongst Muslims regarding the third holiest site. It is inappropriate to conceal the historic record of this consensus. I hope this helps to explain my position. By the way, I am also for delete. --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> <font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../b/o/s/User_talk%7EBostonMA_e998.html" title="User talk:BostonMA">talk</a></sup></font> 04:11, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It seems from the above discussion and previous discussions that while Al-Aqsa is most commonly cited as the third holiest there are enough varying claims such that there is no undue weight issue with discussing them as long as the article makes clear that to the majority of Muslims, Al-Aqsa is considered to have that position. As observed by Theron above, at this point in the discussions there is no dispute that there are <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> that list locations other than Al-Aqsa and assertions that those are wrong are not relevant. Furthermore, as observed by others above the difficulty to make an NPOV stable article is not a reason for deletion - this applies to all Wikipedia topics that are controversial. The argument that other encyclopedia's don't have articles on the topics at hand also is not an argument for deletion- Wikipedia has and should have many more topics than a paper encyclopedia. I'm also troubled by the religious and ethnic tensions that this discussion has brought up. It is illogical to think that somehow whether Al-Aqsa is the third or the fourth or the oth or the [i]th most holy location changes anything in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in so far as no one would seriously argue against the statement that Al-Aqsa is one of the holiest locations in Islam. We should be able to make an NPOV article on this topic. This article needs careful discussion by a variety of other editors in a calm fashion without attempts to POV push, not deletion. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 15:28, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment:</b> It is again obvious that this article is just confusing the average reader with totally false statements. The latest invention we have here is that <b>"While Kairouan is considered today as Islam's fourth holiest city, some secular scholars have noted that during medieval times Kairouan was regarded as the third holiest city in Islam.[3][4]"</b> <a href="../../../s/f/r/Image%7ESFriendly.gif_0945.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/5/58/SFriendly.gif/18px-SFriendly.gif" alt="" width="18" height="18" longdesc="../../../s/f/r/Image%7ESFriendly.gif_0945.html" /></a>. This is a wrong statement even if one finds what supports it on the web. The matter is that we need to emphasize that this whole article neglects <a href="../../../r/e/l/WP%7EReliable_source_43d0.html#Beware_false_authority" title="WP:Reliable source">Beware of False Authority</a>. It does not need a rocket scientist to realise that the article is totally confusing the average reader and gives the impression that Muslims do not know their religion and claim anything to be Holy based on the politics of the Day. Merge with <a href="../../../z/i/y/Ziyarat.html" title="Ziyarat">Ziyarat</a> and with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_holy_cities#Islam" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_holy_cities#Islam" rel="nofollow">Holy Cities in Islam</a>, and delete this article, and keep a small discussion at al-Aqsa mosque page to discuss whether the Third Holiest attributed to it is religious or political. That should be encyclopedic enough. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmaqdisi_042d.html" title="User:Almaqdisi">Almaqdisi</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/l/m/User_talk%7EAlmaqdisi_ed6a.html" title="User talk:Almaqdisi"><font color="DarkBlue">talk to me</font></a></small></sup> 09:37, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>With a slightly sick feeling in my stomach I say <b>Weak Keep</b>. Just scrapes into the notability club, largely on the strength of being a big gay church. If it weren't for the particular ministry I'd vote the other way: ideally I think we shouldn't care about whether people are gay or straight or whatever as individuals, and I feel pretty queasy singling out groups that have a particular orientation just because they have that orientation, but are otherwise unremarkable. (To see what I mean, consider PTAs: I don't believe we should cover PTAs in general, and a PTA all of whose members live in <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castro_Street_928b.html" title="Castro Street">Castro Street</a> is no more noteworthy than one all of whose members live in <a href="../../../h/e/t/Heterosexual.html" title="Heterosexual">heterosexual</a> <a href="../../../s/u/b/Suburbia.html" title="Suburbia">suburbia</a>.

<p>As per the "verifiability policy" it clearly says "Self-published material may be acceptable when produced by a well-known, professional researcher in a relevant field", and Material from self-published sources, and other published sources of dubious reliability, may be used as sources in articles about the author(s) of the material, so long as: it is relevant to their notability; it is not contentious; it is not unduly self-serving; it does not involve claims about third parties, or about events not directly related to the subject; there is no reasonable doubt as to who wrote it. ". I feel that I am within the guidelines of the "verifiability policy". Please talk with me if you feel otherwise, and I guarantee that I will work with you to maintain the utmost credibility, reliability, and integrity of Wikipedia's policies.</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> I see no evidence of a "well-known professional researcher" in these self-published sources. Moreover, you left out " These may be acceptable so long as their work has been previously published by reliable third-party publications." I see nothing to indicate that this is true here.</dd>
<dd>The points about using self-published sources in articles about the author(s) clearly does not apply here, since this article is not about any author; it's about a gas. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETengfred_5c80.html" title="User:Tengfred">Tengfred</a> 00:19, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> This article no longer lacks reliable resources. Note that I have added many items in the "references section". The Korean manufacturer in particular is a company filled with Phd's and reliable resources, and while their English is not optimal they are capable of getting their points across. Please refer to these "references" prior to considering this article for deletion. These companies substantiate all the properties of Brown's Gas that are now posted. I have also added in text citations to help better substantiate the claims in this article. One addition that must be made is a citation for the "perpetual motion" claim. Now that a reference section has been added, it is only right to show the reference for such an obsurd claim. Note that all the companies in the references section don't even adress the notion of perpetual motion because it is truly something that should not even be considered; the term obsurd is overwhelmingly appropriate.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I still se no reliable sources in the article. <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable_sources</a> says "Caution should be used when using company or organization websites as sources. Although the company or organization is a good source of information on itself, it has an obvious bias." Also, the section on physics articles in the same page, points out the importance of using peer-reviewed scientific publications. As far as I can tell, there are no such sources in the article. Right now, the article is a mess of controversial claims, with almost no inline citations and a pile of obviously biased sources. From <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable_sources</a> again: "Exceptional claims require exceptional evidence". It is possible that a coherent article can be written per <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a>, and if so, that article might be useful.

<li><b>comment</b> There will never be exceptional evidence for using Brown's Gas in an over-unity fashion because it is impossible; <b>I have addresses this bogus claim with the "note"</b>. I would remove this blatentlt erronious claim due to its impossiblity, but it is crucial to document all prevailing stereotypes about a scientifically straight forward technology. As for the "semi-rational" claims, these are not totally outragoues. These claims are reasonable, and highly substantiated by the videos sections where users can observe the claims first hand; Brown's Gas can be visually seen behaving in a novel fashion as compared to Oxy-Hydrogen or a pure Hydrogen flame. Also, the reliable sources policy says "take caution", it dousn't say that the references cannot cannot be used because they are company websites. Also, the fact that multiple website, and multiple companies exists across the planet establishes a greater level of credibility as compared to if only one website or only one company was listed. <b>Please note that I have clearly distinguished and defined Brown's Gas production as compared to Oxy-Hydrogen production and pure Hydrogen production; the method is obviously novel.</b> <a href="../../../n/s/e/User%7ENseidm1_feee.html" title="User:Nseidm1">Nseidm1</a> 08:19, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes the claims might be exceptional, which is why I have placed them in sections title "over-unity claims", and "semi-rational" claims. The section "properties" is a section that is based on measurable phenomena. Such a section its not biased, as they are intuitive and rational inclusions based on observable and measurable properties, hence why the section name is "properties". It's ok for a topic to be controversial, and have controversional claims, the reason this article is now informative and un-biased in because the claims that are controversial are marked as such. <b>The main reason this article should remain is because I have specifically clarified the exact difference in how to produce Brown's Gas as compared to Oxy-Hydrogen and pure Hydrogen.</b> The difference is clear and distinction is well defined. Brown's Gas is clearly a separate phenonema as compared to Oxy-Hydrogen and pure Hydrogen; the unique production method dictates so. I still support <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../n/s/e/User%7ENseidm1_feee.html" title="User:Nseidm1">Nseidm1</a> 07:48, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> Note that the Oxy-Hydrogen article does not have any references other than another third party source. Even considering such a lack of references the article remains. The point is that an article does not have to have an overwhelming amount of references to still be considered a credible article. I would argue that the most important aspect of a credible article is how rational and how objective the text is. In the case of this article, there are many points of view considered, and the text specifically considers the dubiousness of the claims. This article is objective, rational, and references real companies that are researching, patenting, and marketing <b>common ducted electrolytic technologies.</b> <a href="../../../n/s/e/User%7ENseidm1_feee.html" title="User:Nseidm1">Nseidm1</a> 10:04, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This article is now clearly in compliance with Wikipedias deletion policy and therefore should remain. As for the tone of the article, I agree that others should be participating and contributing to establish better compliance.

<dd><b>Additional Comments</b> Administrator please take note. The reference of "hoax" and "fraud" are mere terminologies and are not inherently substantive. Individuals that utilize these terms do not make any citations and they have no substantiation for their claim other than their own <b>opinion</b>. Opinions are not enough of a reason to discredit the novelty of a phenomena that is clearly distinct from Oxy-Hydrogen; the distinction has been defined specifically within the text of the article; Brown's Gas is clearly produced in a novel fashion as compared to Oxy-Hydrogen, and pure Hydrogen for that matter. The attacks on rational statements, that are obviously logical, are inconsistent with the substantiation required to discredit the phenomena of Brown's Gas. Please also note that the BEST Korea Company and Arizona Hydrogen Company, both cited in the references section, are multi million dollar companies that have overwhelmingly mainstream clients. Arizona Hydrogen Company sells products to NASA, Ratheon, Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, GE and Motorola. BEST Korea Company is laying the foundation for fuel consumption on the Korean peninsula as the distribtuion of liquid fuels is impractical as compared to on-site generation. <a href="../../../n/s/e/User%7ENseidm1_feee.html" title="User:Nseidm1">Noah Seidman</a> 14:41, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You mention that Arizona Hydrogen Company sells products to NASA, Raytheon, Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, GE and Motarola. Could you provide a citation where any of these companies, including Arizona Hydrogen Company make any claim about the existence of Brown's gas? --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> <font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../b/o/s/User_talk%7EBostonMA_e998.html" title="User talk:BostonMA">talk</a></sup></font> 21:59, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

And Kim was a great, and intelligent man who deserves more than a simple article here, and rather a website dedicated to him. Please all those not from Reddam House would not understand the importance of such a man, and thus i feel should not put any input into this matter!</li>

I'm from Australia as well, although a different state, and follow the news closely - and wouldn't know this man or the events in question from a bar of soap. I'm also not sure about the idea of opening an AfD on an article which was prod'ed when the nominator wants it kept.

<dd>The merging is only with something sourced. Right now it's not sourced and not true, no need for the merge. It can be deleted, this material exists already when it's true like argentina and uganda and russia. In fact all this information exists already, also Ararat. Some of it just isn't true and serves no further encyclopedic material. <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> 12:19, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's not the case that material can only be mentioned once in an encyclopedia. Detailed treatment should take place in only one place and <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">Zionism</a> is as good a place as any unless a Proto-Zionism article is created.</dd>
<dd>In what articles does the true information exist already?</dd>
<dd>If any of the material isn't true, you or any other editor who knows it not to be true can remove it. The only reason that I merged the material into <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">Zionism</a> instead of voting to keep this article is that there isn't enough content in this article to warrant a separate article. If it's all false, it obviously should all be deleted. If only part of it is true, then the true part should be in <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">Zionism</a> and the false part should be deleted.</dd>
<dd>I notice that you have removed the material from the <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">Zionism</a> article. I think this is a mistake but rather than edit war over it, I will open a discussion on the <a href="../../../z/i/o/Talk%7EZionism_e758.html" title="Talk:Zionism">Talk Page</a> to see what other people think.</dd>

<dd>A further explanation of my position. It seems to me that some mention of these proposals (the ones that are true) belongs in the Zionism article.</dd>
<dd>There is no mention of David Nassy's efforts to colonize Curacao and Cayenne in the articles for those locations. However, there is an article on <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Cohen_Nassy_9677.html" title="David Cohen Nassy">David Cohen Nassy</a> which does mention those efforts.</dd>
<dd>I noted that there is no mention of a proposal for a Jewish state in the <a href="../../../p/a/v/Pavel_Pestel_3641.html" title="Pavel Pestel">Pavel Pestel</a> article. Perhaps this information is false?</dd>
<dd>Mention of these pre-Zionist proposals for a Jewish state are clearly relevant to understanding the Historical Background of the Zionist movement. That's why I moved this material there.</dd>

<dd>Sorry I have no problem to move the material to zionism article - there's a section there called alternate proposals so please move anything useful there. I just want to make sure it's accurate or sourced. From the <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Cohen_Nassy_9677.html" title="David Cohen Nassy">David Cohen Nassy</a> I don't see any proposals for a Jewish state. Jews moving somewhere is not the same as a Jewish state, but I may be mistaken about his intent. At any case, we agree to delete the new article and merge any useful information to Zionism, no problem.

<dd>the article is a redirect now, so it's why I think discussion should close (was a mistake)... if one wants to make the redirect to something else in the future he can do so I guess, and it will be analysed then. Also if it were to be deleted it can't mean it can't be re-created in the future. As it was, the article was compltelely pointless. For example, if the article was talking about proposals not of Jewish origin but of Soviet/Nazi origin etc then the title could be a better one too, if btw it would add anything to existing articles. <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> 21:06, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Unlike, say, US supermarkets (with the exception of Trader Joes), UK supermarkets are quite versatile and inventive with their seasonal gimmicks and new products. However this sandwich is essentially just a <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey_Sandwich_1b6f.html" title="Turkey Sandwich">Turkey Sandwich</a> (often or even typically found made with cranberry sauce in supermarkets at any time of the year without special Christmas branding) with the "special seasonal" addition of stuffing. That's it. There is no indication, even after Uncle G's edits (the article is now a well sourced advert/nutrition info article), that this recent sandwich "innovation" (branded as an "old favourite" apparently - which I can only think is a reference to the practice of using up leftover Xmas turkey scraps in sandwiches and that's about it) has any cultural significance sufficient for its own article. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 18:58, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>All I see there is that the nominator mentioned an intention to nominate this article before hand. Then another editor agreed. This does not show any sort of ulterior motive to me. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 22:00, 18 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Forgive me for being cynical, but what I see is a user positioning him or herself for an eventual RfA by doing the bidding of other users. Given the amount of activity on Mr. Stabby, it is clear that tens of admins and thousands of normal users have seen the article and not felt that it required any kind of deletion nomination. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_b339.html" title="User:Dave">Dave</a> 22:44, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You are forgiven(for being cynical). I disagree with your interpretation. Often users will ask others opinions before taking an action, that is all I see going on. Neither positioning, or favour trading is evident. Also, consensus is not gained by observing users lack of action(such as not nominating this page until now), instead we start an AfD and discuss it to gain consensus. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 22:50, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Frankly, there is no reason to delete this. Why delete it? It contravenes no wiki rules to my knowledge. It seems to me that the whole "Delete things that aren't noteworthy" attitude flies in the face of everything Wikipedia stands for. Sure, this kind of thing wouldn't be written about in the Encyclopaedia Britannica. But this isn't Britannica. This is Wikipedia. It is our place to have articles written about the little stuff, the stuff that people want to read about. I urge you to keep this artlcle. --Jake Papas 20:43, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

If we are to accept that <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> has any meaning at all, then we must keep this article. Also, see <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22Mr.+Stabby%22&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22Mr.+Stabby%22&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8" rel="nofollow">[71]</a> for excellent demonstration of how many people it has touched and motivated to write about it at one time or another. Nevertheless, my reason for keeping the article is at present a procedural one, as noted above. I offer this note to assist other voters. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_b339.html" title="User:Dave">Dave</a> 21:49, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Good point. Though <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is a guideline and thus subject to consensus. I find that criterion a bit odd, does that mean every flash cartoon they carry is notable? Considering the number of toons this site carries I consider this to be a trivial reference. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 21:56, 18 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My personal opinion is that common sense needs to applied. A 'major' cartoon series, widely distributed on the internet, and with over 10 million views on weebl's stuff <i>alone</i>, like Mr. Stabby deserves its own article. Something like Dumb Dinosaur, less widely distributed and with less views does not (but should be mentioned in the main Weebl's Stuff article. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_b339.html" title="User:Dave">Dave</a> 22:05, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I don't believe in common sense. What I would beleive is multiple, independent, non-trivial references. Show me the links, and I may change my vote. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 22:26, 18 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To clarify, I was talking about applying common sense to WP:WEB. <a href="http://www.8sided.com/article.cfm?blog_id=6274" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.8sided.com/article.cfm?blog_id=6274" rel="nofollow">[72]</a> <a href="http://photos.jml.net/photo.php?o=109&amp;id=692836" class="external autonumber" title="http://photos.jml.net/photo.php?o=109&amp;id=692836" rel="nofollow">[73]</a> are both evidence of Mr. Stabby being a meme, in that they refer to it indirectly (I took those two links from the first ten hits in a google search for "Mr Stabby" - the other eight hits are the cartoon itself). The number of views that the cartoon has attracted has made it notable enough any how. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_b339.html" title="User:Dave">Dave</a> 22:44, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If anyone ever asks me for an example of a trivial reference, I will probably use those diffs as an example. See <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> to see why I think this way. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 22:54, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>I propose this article, and all of the other articles tagged along with it, be deleted. Each article is a biography of a fictional character in three separate continuities. However, most of these characters are minor in all of the continuities. All of the characters have appropriate descriptions each of the separate continuities <b><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_in_Battle_Royale_%28novel%29_f9cf.html" title="List of characters in Battle Royale (novel)">here</a></b>, <b><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_in_Battle_Royale_%28film%29_c9d0.html" title="List of characters in Battle Royale (film)">here</a></b>, and <b><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_in_Battle_Royale_%28manga%29_b902.html" title="List of characters in Battle Royale (manga)">here</a></b>. All of the articles in question have cluttering problems, resorting to "In the film, the character does this. In the book, the character does this. In the manga, the character does this..."

<dd>At the top of the character pages you can add a {{mergeto|articlehere}}. If you want a specific section merged, you can add the same template to the section. Normally you would add a mergefrom to the anime, manga, and film pages, but since there are so many a mergeto on the character pages would be more appropriate. <a href="../../../v/o/r/User%7EVoretus_d72f.html" title="User:Voretus"><font color="green">Voretus</font></a><a href="../../../v/o/r/User_talk%7EVoretus_e700.html" title="User talk:Voretus"><font color="purple"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 21:10, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Speedy Keep All</b> Firstly, I'm not at all convinced these are non-notable. The Battle Royale movie, while probably not familiar to most US audiences, was an enormous hit in Japan and is amonth the top 10 highest-grossing Japanese films of all time. Secondly, any AfD in which a huge number of articles are suggested for deletion is pretty much doomed to fail and also be a complete and total mess. Simply put, AfD is supposed to be a discussion, and it's unreasonable to expect participants to read 43 different articles and vote on all of them at once. Try listing one first to get a sense of whether deletion of the rest is possible, or try to get consensus on the talk page to merge them or something, but a meaninful discussion for more than 40 articles all at once just isn't going to work. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 16:58, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> To a single list of characters, and delete the plot summaries and pictures. For each character to have an article, I would expect to see multiple independent mainstream coverage of each one cited in the article for that character. Much of the material in each article is duplicated. The individual ized content is just plot summary, and I see no point in taking every notable work of fiction or movie and having an article with pictures and a plot summary. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:13, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy keep</b> per Andrew Lenahan.

<li><b>Speedy Keep all</b> There is no reason to delete them. All the characters have had articles for a long time and have all been this way for a long time. Why should it suddenly be a problem now? There is no need to delete the articles. Although a clean up and maybe merging some of the articles would not be a bad idea. But to just delete them would mean lots of peoples good work would go to waste, plus don't forget the articles would not have been left up in first place if they had not been relevant. <a href="../../../u/r/r/User%7EUrrgh5591_fa2b.html" title="User:Urrgh5591">Urrgh5591</a> 22:10, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It looks like the articles will be <i>kept for now</i>, but only if some cleanup is involved.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a very important event. Illegal immigration is one of the hottest political topics today. This woman is at the forefront of that debate and she has become a symbol. She came into the United States illegally and gave birth to her son here. While she is holed up in that church and sending her son to Washington and Mexico to plead on her behalf, there has been talk about whether U.S. born children of illegal immigrants should be automatically afforded U.S. citizenship. This woman is making history. There is something about her or illegal immigration in the newspapers at least once a week. At first, it was only in the Chicago papers, but now that it has been picked up by CNN, I think the article deserves to stay. If she is not notable, then I'd say at least 20% of the articles on people in Wikipedia also deserve deletion.Crazydog 18:23, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> the current version of the Elvira Arellano article is much different from the one I voted on this morning. I based my vote on the (23:03, November 15, 2006 68.166.88.10) version. That version only had 5 paragraphs and contained 11 links to the same three sources, one of which was an editorial damning Ms. Arellano. That version did not assert importance nor significance and had been marked for speedy deletion earlier. Since my vote, the article has been significantly improved and I believe that the current version establishes that this is a watershed case regarding the civil rights of children and of immigrants. Elvira's son is 7 years old, is a U.S. Citizen, and his mother and primary caretaker is being deported. If that's not significant then what is it?

<li><b>Very strong keep</b> -- after my experience with the deletion of <a href="../../../b/e/s/Best_Day_Ever_bf22.html" title="Best Day Ever">Best Day Ever</a>, I think it would be pointless to delete this. In that case, the article was deleted because it had no content and was about a future episode. Even there, it was constantly recreated but the whole thing was moot anyway because the episode aired relatively soon afterwards and then things changed. Here, those arguments don't even apply, and we have a clear source, some actual info, and the article would be recreated in a few weeks even if it is deleted, so there's not much point. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 05:58, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"The various gathering professions are all means to an end, never an end in themselves. A player may take a gathering profession to supplement his crafting profession, or simply to sell the items he gathers, but the products of these professions are never directly beneficial in and of themselves." All that is what I would expect to see in a game guide. It is total junk of no encyclopaedic benfit whatsoever. Wikipedia is not here to tell people what to do to get through the next level.

<dd>That's not a game guide to me, since it merely describes how Professions function within the game. If anything, that introductory paragraph is essential to understanding professions within World of Warcraft, so that you would pick it out as a problem makes me question your definition of a game guide. How is understanding what professions are within the game total junk of no encyclopaedic benefit whatsoever? How does that even tell anyone how to get to the next level? It doesn't even tell you how to advance within levels, or provide advice about the best things to do with a given skill. Nor do I concur with your <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> complaints. This isn't a plot summary, and the article clearly distinguishes between this world and the World of Warcraft. It even provides some context within the game for the perceived value of certain skills.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> I would love for anyone here to give me an example on <i>what</i> in this article actually reads as a game guide.. It doesn't tell you how to play, only what each profession is. If this is a game guide, then we must AfD almost all game/movie and book related articles on Wikipedia, as they also tell you about their subject matter. A most pointless AfD by a user who started by prodding it, which I removed as someone changed the entire article. And now, he AfDs it.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Hey there Havok. I'd just like to clarify that my nomination is indeed in good faith. I'm honestly concerned about how the article sits with <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>. I don't feel that the professions in the game are any more notable than, say, the types of armour or the weapon proficiencies. As best I understand it, a game guide covers the mechanics of a game and an encyclopedia covers what makes a game special and noteworthy.</dd>
<dd>As for <a href="../../../g/a/m/Wikipedia%7EGame_guide_7d71.html" title="Wikipedia:Game guide">Wikipedia:Game guide</a>, when I read the <i>"...certain attacks by the opponent will trigger a visual cue, a vibration of the controller, and a chime. Attacking at that point causes Link to dodge or parry then counter-attack from the rear"</i> it sounds very much like the kind of content that defines a game guide. Yes, it's written in a much better tone, but the information it carries doesn't seem encyclopedic.</dd>
<dd>Clearly though, we disagree on what should be included here and I don't believe that we'll come to quick agreement either way. Still, I wanted to clarify my reasoning for nominating this article. Hopefully we can get some other users to look at this and provide some external perspective. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradBeattie_1142.html" title="User:BradBeattie">Brad Beattie</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBradBeattie_69e6.html" title="User talk:BradBeattie">(talk)</a></small></sup> 10:43, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Really, I think covering the mechanics of a game is part of what makes a good encyclopedia. For example, you make an article about <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Mario_Brothers_d04e.html" title="Super Mario Brothers">Super Mario Brothers</a>. It helps to explain how the game is played. Same goes with sports like <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">Football</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball.html" title="Baseball">Baseball</a> and even <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess.html" title="Chess">Chess</a>.

<p><b>Keep</b> - Forked out of the main article to an article for each profession, then was condensed into one page to remove game guide content. The content here is what would be relavent to the main article without getting into too much gamecruft.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I totally understand where confusion could arise from those examples. In the articles covering sports it is vital to descibe these sport's rules in order to differentuate them from others. They easily fall under <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> and the guildline (and it is just a guildline) of <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMMON_9dc8.html" title="WP:COMMON">WP:COMMON</a>. You <i>have to</i> have a basic understanding of the rules of these games so you can understand what makes it "football" or "soccer" or "chess". In addition these are famous and influential sports and games, their influence streches back hundreds of years and their impact is incalcuable. The need to descibe the diffrence between the specific rules and game play mechanics of "World of Warcraft" and "<a href="../../../e/v/e/Everquest.html" title="Everquest">Everquest</a>" don't quite equate. Videogames can be given an encyclopedic overview and all cheats, in depth game mechanics, game play points, etc can and should be covered for interested parties with a few simple lines of external links to the sites that are devoted to that: Game Guide sites. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 08:08, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I still fail to see the relevance of what you are saying. Basically what you are saying is "computer and video games are unimportant". At least that's what it looks like. As you brought up chess in your example, I would say it's equally important to describe the rule set of a video game as it is a board game or sport. The only difference between them is that many people don't see computer and video games as a "notable" hobby so to speak. And I would also think <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> applies to CVG just as much as chess and soccer. Oh, and this article doesn't fail <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> in any instance. <strong><a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_a4f2.html" title="User:Havok">Havok</a></strong> <a href="../../../h/a/v/User_talk%7EHavok_0d43.html" title="User talk:Havok">(T</a>/<a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_Contributions_37ac.html" title="User:Havok/Contributions">C</a>/<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Havok_0d4d.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Havok">e</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" rel="nofollow">c</a>) 10:20, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> BTW, you say that those games impacts are incalcuable. Well, maybe. Does that mean we can't decide what articles should or should not be kept on them, or that WOW's 7.5 million players don't matter? Isn't that enough of an impact for a few articles? Football has over a dozen just describing gameplay. Chess even has an article on <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess_strategy_and_tactics.html" title="Chess strategy and tactics">strategies and tactics</a>. Not to mention several spin-offs from there. Why does Wikipedia get to be a gameguide for Chess? (And that's not even bringing up the huge <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_chess_players.html" title="List of chess players">list of chess players</a>.) WoW has less than 50 articles. What is wrong with this one? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 16:19, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Game play mechanics&#160;!= instruction manual. Saying something exists in the game is fine. Saying how to do something is not. "Engineers turn ore into explosives" is fine because it explains, in general, what Engineers do. "Goblin Engineers with 235 skill can turn 1 Mithril Casing, 1 Goblin Rocket Fuel, 6 Solid Dynamites, and 1 Unstable Trigger into The Big One" is not because it explains how to accomplish something, namely how to make The Big One. -<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanbomber_10a1.html" title="User:Ryanbomber">Ryanbomber</a> 18:10, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I disagree with Andries rationalization. By Andries reasoning, then all staunch critics of Sai Baba's that became followers would also be very notable. Who are they and where are they mentioned in Wikipedia? This is another of Andries' ploys to push his anti-Sai agenda and nothing more. The MOST notable thing Priddy ever did was get a very well respected book publisher (Samuel Weiser) to publish his pro-Sai Baba book. This is NOT an easy thing to do as these publishers only pick so many books per year and they must believe they will make back their investment by selling millions of books. But Priddy had to go to an unknown independent publisher with an anti-Sai agenda to get his anti-Sai Baba book published because NO reputable publisher would touch it.

<li>Hello, based on your helpful feedback, I have added citations referring specifically to Alert Logic from <s>three</s> two of the top publications in the high tech world: Computerworld and eWeek. <s>and CSO</s>. From my understanding this meets Wikipedia notability guidelines. Is this correct? I have also included attributed information about topics that are highly relevant to a wide audience. The reason I was drawn to post a profile of Alert Logic is because I was researching the topic of <a href="../../../s/o/f/Software_as_a_Service_f407.html" title="Software as a Service">Software as a Service</a> and noted that there are 25 profiles of companies in this space with profiles on Wikipedia. I used them as a template for the Alert Logic profile but made an effort to focus on research and information about network security as opposed to product features.</li>
<li>Thanks the advice on the notability guidelines. Any further help/advice would be most appreciated. Tallik 18:24, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak keep</b>I saw Alert Logic mentioned in ref 1 and ref 4. Ref 2 is broken ("Could not find" error message). ref 3 and ref 5 did not mention Alert Logic anywhere I could see. Ref 1, eweek, and Ref 4, Computerworld.com, seem like reasonable mainstream online and online/print, respectively, sources. This is weak support for notability, but probably enough. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 20:10, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Thanks to all for the helpful feedback.</b> The Computerworld article is a bylined article based on an interview between the reporter and a company executive. It is not a press release. Computerworld would never, ever go for that. The Computerworld article is based in its entirety on information supplied by Alert Logic to the Computerworld reporter. WAVegitarian did indeed give me the good advice to add some third party citations and that's what I did by adding the eWeek and Computerworld references. I will also link to several other citations as well. Thanks again!</li>
<li><b>I've added an additional citation</b> to an article that was published in the Houston Business Journal about a $5 million round of Series B funding for the company.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The interview seems not to have gone much past the press release that is referred to in the article. A bylined article like this isn't independent. With another truly independent source I would change to a weak keep. The article also needs to be rewritten to be expository rather than persuasive. The current form has a very nice persuasive essay structure of: what the company is and what it provides, why its products are vitally necessary, how the need is growing, specifics about the awesomeness of the product, concluding with a summary of the product and a brief note about further use and need. It is the "you need their services" tone that makes it read like an advetisement, alternating threats with protection services. The most recently added reference lifts a quote directly from <a href="http://www.alertlogic.com/news/press_releases/Alertlogic_Press_Release_07-14-06.php" class="external text" title="http://www.alertlogic.com/news/press_releases/Alertlogic_Press_Release_07-14-06.php" rel="nofollow">a press release</a> without attribution: "make that all-important leap from an early-stage company to being a real player in the IT security market." This is something that houston.bizjournals.com has done with a number of other Alert Logic press releases. Looking back at the eWeek article, it seems to be mostly "company/representative said..." I'm not going so far as to call either one trivial or not independent, but it isn't the strongest coverage I've seen. —<a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWAvegetarian_a804.html" title="User:WAvegetarian">WAvegetarian</a>•<a href="../../../w/a/v/User_talk%7EWAvegetarian_1514.html" title="User talk:WAvegetarian">(talk)</a> 22:18, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>I've made some changes per your recommendations, WAvegitarian.</b> I revised the article in an effort to be expository and non-promotional. I included an additional citation to CRN, a well-known national business publication. To me, the article in the Houston Business Journal is important because of the news that it contains: $5 million from well-known venture capital firms is "notable" news. Thanks again for your help and advice.</li>

<li><b>Definition of sources per Wikipedia</b></li>
</ul>
I'm struck by the broadness of the definition of sources considered adequate per the Wikipedia guidelines:<br />
None of the citations for Alert Logic are "self-published." They are all by independent reporters from publications that have good reputations for accuracy and fact-checking. However, Wikipedia says that ....<br />
Material from self-published sources, and other published sources of dubious reliability, may be used as sources in articles about the author(s) of the material, so long as:<br />
it is relevant to their notability;<br />
it is not contentious;<br />
it is not unduly self-serving;<br />
it does not involve claims about third parties, or about events not directly related to the subject;<br />
there is no reasonable doubt as to who wrote it. <i><br />

<p>This is an article on a keyboard layout first released this year. I have doubts as to its notability. Wikipedia doesn't have any guidelines on notability for keyboard layouts, but if the other articles in <a href="../../../k/e/y/Category%7EKeyboard_layouts_53cf.html" title="Category:Keyboard layouts">Category:Keyboard layouts</a> are taken as representative of notable layouts, then <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colemak.html" title="Colemak">Colemak</a> is clearly the odd one out. I'm not aware of any published studies on the Colemak layout in the ergonomics and HCI literature; the author's own web page seems to be the only significant source of information on it. <a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 18:13, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This keyboard layout is less than a year old, and has not had sufficient time to have been the subject of studies or serious reviews.

<li><b>Delete</b>, as per previous posters. I originally created the article earlier, around when it was first released. It made a slashdot mention, so I decided why not.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Already there are 60 000+ hits on Google for Colemak. The fact that it is a fairly new product does not detract from the usefulness of the information about the product.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Talk:Space Tree has raised the issue of the article being speedied before only because someone inserted tons of copyvio from somewhere. I think it might have some merit since the article had existed since February <b>2005</b> and no concerns were raised that whole time. This needs to be investigated further IMHO. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 18:56, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Whether or not the text reads like an ad, this place is of major importance in the digital arts scene. How about changing the text instead of deleting the entry? I created this entry originally because there are very few places in the United States that host and promote interactive media arts. Eyebeam is one of the most notable institutions in that regard.

<p>Whoever advocates deletion please contact colin@thewhiterosesociety.org Calling The White Rose Society a non-notable student group is arguably calling its namesake, The White Rose, a non-notable student group. The White Rose Society is a national student organization started at the University of Texas in Austin (UT). It was named the Best Political Organization at UT in 2006 and won the Hillel Foundation's William Haber Award for Excellence. Over 300 members are reported as members. The White Rose Society is the Save Darfur Coalition of Austin, a chapter of Challah for Hunger, a chapter of Students Taking Action Now Darfur, and now a partner of the Sudan Divestment Task Force. The White Rose Society is the leader in the Sudan Divestment Task Force of Texas campaigning the State of Texas to remove investments from companies supporting the government of Sudan. If you think that the HOLOCAUST and GENOCIDE IN DARFUR are not notable then feel free to delete this wikipedia page. Frakk</p>

<li>If you mean that there is a precedent that other deletionists have trivialized the award, you're unfortunately correct. If you're citing precedent to justify deletion, I don't think you can find a single school in which recognition as a <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_Ribbon_Schools_Program_4a5b.html" title="Blue Ribbon Schools Program">Blue Ribbon Schools Program</a> has been cited in both the article and in the AfD, has ever been deleted. The "Blue Ribbon Schools Program" defense seems to have a perfect track record.

<li>I keep bouncing back and forth about the Blue Ribbons. On the one hand they are the highest generic award given to schools. On the other hand, it is a generic award and almost by definition if it doesn't receive any coverage the award shouldn't mean much. On the other hand, if a school is a blue ribbon school such coverage almost certainly does exist if we searched hard enough and the school likely has other notable achievements so we may see that as a reason for temporary reprieves until more investigation can be done. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 04:35, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The Blue Ribbon is the "highest honor" that an apple pie can receive at the county fair, too, but so what? As already deconstructed on other AfDs, the schools nominate themselves for the award.

<p><s>While there were indeed Ottoman Muslim casualties during World War I, I don't think that it would warrant an entire article as if to imply that it was a massacre or genocide.

<dd>Could be, but not neccessarily since many Ottoman Muslims also died during the First WW. Look man, these will be talked about sooner or later, all the nations of Eastern Medi have this victimization sentiment, but none of them are clean either. Some might be dirtier than the rest, but if someone can come up to me and tell me with a straight face (or hand&#160;:)) that no Turk was every killed by an Armenian or a Greek, they should go back to the primary school. So let's just work to make the article NPOV and sourced. That's all. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 01:15, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not denying that there were Greeks or Armenians who killed Turks, but all I'm saying is that creation of an article such as this seems to imply that there was some sort of great massacre or genocide against the Turks when there clearly wasn't.

<dd>Look.. I know people in the city I am living in France whose grandparents in Kars told them how Armenian gangs killed Turks in their villages. My family is from Istanbul, so I cannot confirm or deny, but brushing aside their stories as fables of the Turkish government is neither fair nor balanced. There is no implication from the title that they were massacres or genocides, where did that come from? It is clearly titled "Ottoman Muslim <b>casualties</b>", hell, they could even be wartime casualties. It is not titled "Turkish genocide by Armenians". There have been Ottoman Muslim casualties, and Wiki doesn't have a policy against the exploration of such a subject, even though it might put some people at unease. You know, maybe some people should get used to the idea that Turks and Kurds were also killed during the First World War. They were not "untouchables"&#160;:)) So the best way forward is not the deletion of the article, but efforts to keep it NPOV and scientific. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 11:35, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I will disagree with Clevelander in the sense that, the question of if there were Ottoman Muslim deaths is not relevant to the Armenian Genocide. The existence or non-existence of Armenian Genocide have nothing do with this, since Ottoman Muslims could have died any Armenian casualties not withstanding. Look, I don't want to offense anyone but, the better course would be to check the article for POV and source it rather than delete it. In any case, it is common knowledge that many Ottoman Muslims also died, what is wrong with exploring that? We should be inclusive and not exclusive. That's all I am saying. You have an extremely inflammatory tone, exploration of the issue of Ottoman Muslim casualties has nothing to do with denial or "Turkish excuses". Please refrain from such blanket accusations, neither of us were alive back then, so let's just chill and relax. I had read a very interesting exchange between you and marshallbagramyan about how you would like to convert people in Eastern Turkey back to Christianity by Armenian missionaries and not American ones since they don't seem to work and what pieces of Turkish land you would like to have the most, a conversation that I had found extremely racist, nationalist, ignorant, orientalist, living-in-the-past and unhelpful. So I would really appreaciate it if some people would show a real constructive approach to matters at hand. People living in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. So the article should stay, and if people here, especially Armenians and Turks, are interested even a bit in any sort of reconciliation, they should work together with a constructive approach since it is also common knowledge that many Ottoman Muslims died in Eastern Turkey during First World War. I hope that nobody is "denying" those either. Right? <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 01:15, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>And how do you know that there weren't any massacres? I don't understand why you are taking such an offence at this. I know people from Kars, Turks, who tell me that their grandparents saw Turks getting killed by Armenian gangs. But my family has been living in Istanbul for generations, so I am not in a position to pass a judgement on that one, but I wouldn't dare call their grandparents liars just because I feel like it. <b>AND if you cannot admit the fact that conversing with someone about how best to convert people in Turkey to Christianity is racist and orientalist, don't expect others to assume good faith. Not even Grey Wolves have conversations on how to best convert Armenians, so I find it appaling that you and Marshall were able to talk in such a nationalist, racist and condescending way about people that you don't even know about and passing judgements about how to "show them the light"</b>. If you cannot tell all the other contributors here that that conversation was wrong by nature, than I will bring it up all the time, and I will assume that this is a bad faith nomination.

<dd>Great. But do you even know which minority we were discussing? <b>The Hamshenis - Black Sea Christian Armenians who were forced to accept Islam (or to "show them the light" as you would say) under the Ottoman Empire. Like it or not, they exist and they're still there. The concept of re-Christianization is not a new thing, my friend. It's occuring in Georgia with the Muslim Georgians of Adjara (who too who forced to convert under the Ottomans). Please don't act as if you're appalled or as if you have a reason to be appalled.

<dd>So that gives you the right to propose that people you don't even know about should be converted to a particular religion?? An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind my friend, just because your great-grandfather was in the genocide, that doesn't give you the right to treat people you have not even met with such a condescending attitude today.

<dd>Whoa. I did not accuse any group of being inferior because they followed a certain relion. I have at least ten friends who are Arabs and devout Muslims as well as friends who are Jewish. In fact, I'm really close to most of them and I accept their beliefs and even have learned about them. Its interesting you bring up the Nazis in this and their pure-Aryan ideology. The Grey Wolves preach the same thing - of a purely Turkic Turkey. No Kurds, no Armenians, no Greeks, no Jews, no Zazas, no Laz, no Georgians, no Assyrians, no Arabs, no Bulgarians, no Serbs. Just Turks. Phase one of the "great plan" has already been executed. The near-annhilation of the Armenian race (what was termed in the Ottoman Empire as the "Armenian Question" - sort of like the "Jewish Question," eh, Baristarim?). You say its a crime for Armenians to re-Christianize fellow Armenians from Islam, but yet your government puts pressure on Christians to convert to Islam (AND to adopt the Turkish language) all the time. -- <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7EClevelander_3c35.html" title="User:Clevelander">Clevelander</a> 04:13, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just a quick reply: Anyone forcing anybody else to accept a religion is wrong. And if you have any evidence that the Turkish government is forcing people to accept Islam, please take it to the appropriate page. But also keep in mind that more churches have been built in Turkey in the last ten years that mosques in Armenia since 1920. In my native district in Istanbul, a protestant church just opened up a few months ago.

So, there is enough mud to go around. Please let's not have this attitude that Armenia (or any country) is at the helm of some coalition of the "just and righteous". In the light of this article, I think that we can assume that there is a good probability that this article can explore many serious and academic issues of Ottoman Muslim (Kurdish and Turkish) casualties. A much more constructive approach would be to work together to make this article NPOV, instead of simply deleting it. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 07:52, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>???? How dare you even compare the Turkish and Kurdish civilians that died during the First World War to Nazi soldiers??? The level of hate and racism is simply astounding. i know in the very city I am living in France whose grandparents told them how Armenian gangs killed Turkish civilians in their villages in Kars, even though I am not in a position to deny or confirm those stories, I wouldn't even dare compare them to Nazi soldiers. Isn't it clearly racist to equate "Ottoman Muslims" to "Nazi Germans" as you just did??? Where does this hate come from? <b>The title of the article is clear: Ottoman Muslim casualties</b>. We all know the definition of the words Ottoman, Muslim and casuality. This is a very valid topic even though, as witnessed by certain condescending comparisons taking place, it puts some people at unease. If there are POV issues, they can be addressed, but the idea underlying the article is completely valid and, yes, Ottoman Muslim deaths are notable as well, even though some people do not consider them to be so. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 11:51, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: As an attempt to cut through some of the vitriol on both sides, may I ask those arguing for the article to be kept to explain why an <i>article</i> on the number of casualties of the First World War on a particular side (and bear in mind that the article title doesn't exactly say that), as against inserting a <i>paragraph</i> on this same fact into a broader article on the War itself is a good idea? That Ottoman Muslims died is hardly in question, but surely it would be more useful to add this to an article on the war in which they died. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 12:06, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Because casualties in WWI is a global article, its incompleteness would not stop the development of its sub-articles. Because that article covers German, Arab, Greek, Spanish etc. casualties, and as such there should be one or two sentences introducing the Ottoman Muslim casualties in that article and, hop, it should give a "see also" to this article (along with other casualties to their respective articles). That's all.. The incompleteness of the main shouldn't lead to the deletion of its subs. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 12:14, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, it depends on the amount of information that can be brought to the sub article. I have not written the article myself, so I cannot be an authoritative source on the (eventual) scope of this article. I also see your point, but, even in its current state, the idea of removing an article that talks about real-world Muslim casualties of the Ottoman Empire whereas much shorter articles about fictional Pokemon or Star Wars characters or planets can stay seems simply not right to me.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Who are you to say that his bands were non-notable? Timescape Zero was very influential to early 90's Miami-style Hardcore.

<p>Marked as speedy but a "hangon" was placed on it by its creator. It was created during the debate on afd for the identical ASU Herald.

<dd>As I mentioned before, right now I cannot name the awards because the awards are located in the office. However, I do know that none of the awards came "from the school" since the school has no awards to give to its own student run newspaper. My question to you is, what makes my article less notable than the article on the <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Sundial_7a26.html" title="Daily Sundial">Daily Sundial</a> or the <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairfield_Mirror_c6c6.html" title="Fairfield Mirror">Fairfield Mirror</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> Thanks. I added "unreferenced" and "cleanup" tags to the <a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Sundial_7a26.html" title="Daily Sundial">Daily Sundial</a> article. The <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairfield_Mirror_c6c6.html" title="Fairfield Mirror">Fairfield Mirror</a> article has some content and cites a source for its claim of notability, so without further investigation it looks like the former might be due for an Afd as well but not the latter. You should have several days to improve your article by making sure there is a claim of notability with multiple reliable and verifiable sources to back it up. Take a look at some other college papers for examples. As for what to call the article about your paper, what does its masthead say? What is it commonly called on the campus, if different from the above? Redirects can be added. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 23:41, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Give it a chance, for crying out loud. It was VFD'd within minutes of creation, let her add some info to prove it's notability. <a href="../../../t/1/g/User%7ET1g4h_aad4.html" title="User:T1g4h">T1g4h</a> 03:03, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The reason it was VFD'd within minutes of creation was because that it's a clone of ASU Herald, which is also up for deletion. <a href="../../../v/e/i/User%7EVeinor_0082.html" title="User:Veinor">Veinor</a> (<a href="../../../v/e/i/User_talk%7EVeinor_8b70.html" title="User talk:Veinor">ヴエノル<sup>(talk)</sup></a>) 03:28, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Then <b>Delete</b> the clone but <b>Keep</b> the original for aforementioned reasoning of giving it a chance. <a href="../../../t/1/g/User%7ET1g4h_aad4.html" title="User:T1g4h">T1g4h</a> 09:37, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Because I can't imagine anybody calling it 'The Herald of Arkansas State University'.
