<li><b>Strong keep</b> - Dado nominated the article for deletion because "the side who started this article has not presented valid claims and/or answered the issues raised on the discussion page". However, he doesn't state what are the issues. Claim that serbophobia can not be characterized as psychological disorder (phobia) is answered by the fact that the article does not characterise it that way (see <a href="../../../s/e/r/Talk%7ESerbophobia_bbf8.html#Disputed" title="Talk:Serbophobia">Talk:Serbophobia#Disputed</a>). Claim that the term is not notable is answered by presenting some 1500 Google hits in various languages, and showing that, comparatively, it is used as much as <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russophobia.html" title="Russophobia">russophobia</a> (see <a href="../../../s/e/r/Talk%7ESerbophobia_bbf8.html#Not_Notable_.2F_Neologism" title="Talk:Serbophobia">Talk:Serbophobia#Not Notable / Neologism</a>). Claim that there is no definition was answered by providing a source with a definition (see <a href="../../../s/e/r/Talk%7ESerbophobia_bbf8.html#Sources" title="Talk:Serbophobia">Talk:Serbophobia#Sources</a>; definition referred to can be found f.e. in <a href="http://www.antiwar.com/malic/m040501.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.antiwar.com/malic/m040501.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). Claim that the term is neologism is answered by finding a reference to its use in 1986 (after the nomination, though I found the reference before; see <a href="../../../s/e/r/Talk%7ESerbophobia_bbf8.html#Neologism" title="Talk:Serbophobia">Talk:Serbophobia#Neologism</a>). <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a> 04:12, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - See <a href="../../../s/e/r/Talk%7ESerbophobia_bbf8.html#Disputed" title="Talk:Serbophobia">Talk:Serbophobia#Disputed</a>. I have raised several issues and no one has responded to those issue. In fact few have outright ignored them by reverting suggested edits. In addition to my comments on the talk page, the claim "Serbian Writers Association also organized a meeting on February 28, 1989 with the theme of "Serbophobia" that discussed Croatian genocide of Serbs" fails to note that around same time Serbian nationalism (as other nationalisms) in the Balkans was on the rise and portraying Serbs as victims of phobia was one of the tools to raly Serbian nation into Yugoslav Wars that followed. In fact the article as it currently read does a very similar thing. Ironicaly, most victims of Serbophobia in last 20 years were non-Serbs. I don't see this article being able to overcome these problems while it is obvious that its purpose is to continue the politics of spreading fear among Serbian people and non-Serbs as a reflex to former, and as such presents an article of no value or even damaging to Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 05:53, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Dado makes a good point; but I am generally against deletion of articles. They should be, rather, improved. If we would delete every disputable article, there would be less than 10 wiki articles alltogether&#160;:))) <a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolyRomanEmperor_2aac.html" title="User:HolyRomanEmperor">HolyRomanEmperor</a> 14:02, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Could you enumerate the issues? And, when you say that "Most victims of Serbophobia in last 20 years were non-Serbs", do you acknowledge that it exists or otherwise it couldn't have victims? <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a> 06:00, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. This word does not deserve an article of its own, it’s a term devised for explicitly political purposes during the late 80s and early 90s. It can not be compared to "Russophobia" or "Islamophobia" because both of these deal with prevalent general social attitudes against ethnic and religious groups based on their culture and heritage. The term Serbophobia, on the other hand, is used virtually exclusively in a political context, in either an accusatory manner or as a justification. To say that it is "comparatively" as common as the term "Russophobia" is ridiculous, and based on some shady calculation certain users made involving army size and GDP. A simple Google search shows that the term "Russophobia" is far, far more common than "Serbophobia". Of the results that do show up on Google, I think they adequately manifest the nature of this term and exactly why it does not belong on Wikipedia. Of the initial 10 results that come up on the first page:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The #1 result is the respective Wikipedia article</dd>
<dd>2 come from a radical right political site</dd>
<dd>6 of them come from the same two Serbian political writers and analysts.</dd>
<dd>1 comes from a book on Serbian propaganda efforts during the late 80s and early 90s</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If this all wasn't enough, the single legitimate source provided has been completely misinterpreted. The quote reads as follows: "Furthering this incipient nation-fever was the extraordinary memorandum issued to the public in 1986 by the prestigious Serbian Academy of Arts and Sciences, condemning the perceived presence of <b>"Serbophobia"</b> in the central government of Yugoslavia." The use of this as a reference for some traditional use of the term would be fine and dandy if the word wasn’t placed in quotes; but it is. This is because the author views the term with skepticism and questions its validity, implying (just as Dado mentioned) that the word was used by Serb officials to drum up support amongst the populace for their nationalist policies. I challenge any neutral observer to read the context of the word, notice the tone of the passage, read the preceding paragraphs, and not reach the same conclusion as I did<a href="http://print.google.com/print?id=be2UW6NyposC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;lpg=PA283&amp;dq=serbophobia&amp;prev=http://books.google.com/books%3Fq%3Dserbophobia%26lr%3D%26start%3D10&amp;sig=bDNV8ev7gaG8ugflcWk5U2Emwiw&amp;auth=DQAAAHAAAAAktZCq-3ZfkRqCnubp4FnSrgsYSU-5isjUsRSBiTae3HOp-DT96fi8pdhDcWkw4XM5cjejdv3-uKflMJnYMWFK1UGTWMWcY09UpVKyF1R94F29JmQCOAEmwjyzwxL-2jpFb2D6P2haOAQR6ubU4IOl" class="external autonumber" title="http://print.google.com/print?id=be2UW6NyposC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;lpg=PA283&amp;dq=serbophobia&amp;prev=http://books.google.com/books%3Fq%3Dserbophobia%26lr%3D%26start%3D10&amp;sig=bDNV8ev7gaG8ugflcWk5U2Emwiw&amp;auth=DQAAAHAAAAAktZCq-3ZfkRqCnubp4FnSrgsYSU-5isjUsRSBiTae3HOp-DT96fi8pdhDcWkw4XM5cjejdv3-uKflMJnYMWFK1UGTWMWcY09UpVKyF1R94F29JmQCOAEmwjyzwxL-2jpFb2D6P2haOAQR6ubU4IOl" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. <a href="../../../a/s/i/User%7EAsim_Led_0836.html" title="User:Asim Led">Asim Led</a> 06:53, 17 December 2005 (UTC).</dd>

<li>
<ul>
<li>Asim, you are trying to mislead people. The quote was given as evidence that the word was used in 1986 and so is not a neologism, not as evidence that it is valid.</li>
<li>For use of the word in various contexts by non-Serbian authors you may refer to <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serbophobia.html#Use_in_various_languages" title="Serbophobia">Serbophobia#Use in various languages</a>. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a> 10:19, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Should we have articles about words that don't really exist and are only (rarely) used by pro-Serb political commentators? Thats what the source you provided argues, and I have to say no.

<li>Asim Led makes a good point here; and if not for my general disliking of plain deletion of articles; I would most definately vote "<b>Strong delete</b>". It is to my opinion that articles have to be improved rather. Additionally; this article should belong to the <i>wiki dictionary</i>, rather then here if it's nothing more then a term... <a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolyRomanEmperor_2aac.html" title="User:HolyRomanEmperor">HolyRomanEmperor</a> 12:03, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. I think, this is a pathetic "article" based on well-known Serb nationalistic propaganda. The word "serbofobia" or similar word constructions were used by Serb war criminals to justify their war crimes during the war in Yugoslavia e.g. <a href="../../../r/a/t/Ratko_Mladi%C4%87_262d.html" title="Ratko Mladić">Ratko Mladić</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Biljana_Plav%C5%A1i%C4%87_66d1.html" title="Biljana Plavšić">Biljana Plavšić</a>, <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slobodan_Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87_0fcd.html" title="Slobodan Milošević">Slobodan Milošević</a>...--<a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmir_Arven_887c.html" title="User:Emir Arven">Emir Arven</a> 09:13, 17 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Could you point to a quote by any of them where they do so? Regardless, why would such use of the word justify deletion of the article from Wikipedia? Isn't such use something worth informing the readers about? <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikola_Smolenski_0d21.html" title="User:Nikola Smolenski">Nikola</a> 10:19, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> - this is pure politically-motivated absurdity; the term is not in current usage anywhere, including Serbia. Instead it emanated from Serbian propagandists atempting to cover up the Serbian poitical establishment's disregard for international law, human rights and human dignity. The simpple test is: do the authors really believe that people would go out of their way to criticise or oppose Serbian politics if it did not engage in genocide, ethnic cleansing and racism? I think not. This kind of article represents a mis-use of wikipedia as it has no practical informational or educational benefit.

What this term was used to justify in the near history is a topic for the talk page of this article and not an argument for deletion. Whether somebody is afraid of Serbs, just hates them for no reason or perhaps both, is again their own psychological issue and a topic for this article rather than a reason to delete an article about this term.

<li>I am perfectly fine with my vote not being counted despite my bureaucrat status and 1000+ edits on Wiki. At least I never contaminated the English Wikipedia with poor language, semi-truths, images violating copyright, and nationalistic deletion votes like some others.

<li>(The copyvio comment was in particular motivated by the image showing Ratko Mladić in Srebrenica, which was uploaded by user Edvin with no source information at all and who could never be bothered to answer my question about the source so that I could perhaps use the image on Serbian wiki.)

Some groups in Serbia really cannot deal with the facts of the wars in the 90's, but sure they can make the victims out of themselves, arguing "everybody's against us!". No, nobody's against a common Serb, but the Serbian people must face their own history and recent "doings" of their state/government, just like the Germans did after the WWII. When they do that, they will throw the ugly nationalism away that poisons not only the society in Serbia, but the neighbouring countries, as well (this goes for these countries, too).</li>

<li>You have used triple negative. Could you clarify your comment. Also can someone answer me following questions as this is quickly becoming a sort of a current issue and this term (which is being disputed may I remind) is now being used on this page to attack users who are merely posting their comments. The same accusations are being used to gather defensive or "politically correct" support by others. Some perhaps think that if they apply this emotionally charged word in a real situation, such as in their minds is this situation, that it will justify the common use of the term and as a result the article on Wikipedia: Following questions should be the only guideline to settle this issue: 1.Who are people that hate Serbs 2.Why do they hate them 3.What specifically have they done that can be caratherised as phobic behaviour towards Serbs.4. If so how can such behaviour be caratherised as phobic. Thank You --<a href="../../../d/a/d/User%7EDado_beb9.html" title="User:Dado">Dado</a> 04:08, 19 December 2005 (UTC)
