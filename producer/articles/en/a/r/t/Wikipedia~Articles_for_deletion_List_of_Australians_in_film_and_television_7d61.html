<li><b>Keep</b> lists can give further information than categories; this one gives job types, which can be useful for someone trying to look up a name they don't quite remember.

See <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7ELists_of_Australians_884c.html" title="Talk:Lists of Australians">talk:Lists of Australians</a> for more info. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 13:04, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I missed this comment sooner - sorry. The process so far has been to delete the completely useless article that was called "List of Australians" as most of us weren't on it, create a new article <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_Australians_a5aa.html" title="Lists of Australians">Lists of Australians</a> with as many lists of people as we could find, then start to sift through which ones are valuable to the project. A number were already accurate, complete and maintained, so are not treated further here. Some have been improved, either through initiative, discussion, or AFD (yes it does happen that articles are improved and kept after nomination). Some have been nominated for deletion and been deleted. These have been lists with overly broad definitions that to become "complete" would have thousands of entries, many not notable, or were lists of "notable people" without a reliable source for the list. These are better served by categories that are magically kept up to date as new articles are written. Redirects have been left in place for any lists that have been merged or renamed. See <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7ELists_of_Australians_884c.html" title="Talk:Lists of Australians">Talk:Lists of Australians</a> to see how we're going and if you'd like to help. The underlying purpose is to remove lists that reflect poorly on the project as a whole or the Australian part of it, and avoid lists that attract vanity or attack entries. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 13:08, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have to wonder why it is that when people want to keep an article because "it needs cleanup" there are almost never 1) suggestions on how the article can be cleaned up, 2) actual attempts to clean up the article during the AFD, and 3) commitments on the part of the cleanup advocates to actually clean up the article. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 00:11, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Your statement is an inaccurate generalisation. Please see such cases as <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_What_is_black_and_white_and_red_all_over__ba99.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/What is black and white and red all over?">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/What is black and white and red all over?</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Extreme_Pizza_1381.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Extreme Pizza">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Extreme Pizza</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_films_featuring_United_States_Marines_23b0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of films featuring United States Marines">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of films featuring United States Marines</a>, which show that in many cases actual improvements are made.

<ol>
<li>Not true. Suggestions are often given on how to cleanup. In this case, I can suggest converting this into a table to provide dates of birth/death, place of birth, and a "notes" column listing awards, major roles, etc.</li>
<li>Please see the 3 examples above. Moreover, when it seems likely that an article may be deleted, no one has particular incentive to even try to fix it. If the issue was raised in an environment other than <i>"Du hast fünf Tage diesen Artikel zu verbessern oder es wirt getötet. Verstehst du? Arbeit, Arbeit, Arbeit!"</i>, that might be more conducive to improvement.</li>
<li>Wikipedia is a community effort, is it not? Articles tagged with cleanup will undoubtedly catch someone's attention. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 08:15, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I was paid to be an extra in a movie once - does that mean I should be in this list? If these sorts of open ended lists of names have only blue links, they are already like a category. If they have red links, either an article should be written (so they appear in the category), the link added to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Australia_To-do_b327.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Australia/To-do">Wikipedia:WikiProject Australia/To-do</a>, or removed if it is just a vanity entry.
