<p>Very nice list of areas comprising the Washington DC MSA. However, there is only one person in the list, and it duplicates <a href="../../../p/e/o/Category%7EPeople_from_Washington%2C_D.C._19d6.html" title="Category:People from Washington, D.C.">Category:People from Washington, D.C.</a>. Therefore this article needs either a lot of TLC, or it needs to get tossed. Considering we have a category already, we can probably toss this one. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuminweb_da4b.html" title="User:Schuminweb">SchuminWeb</a> (<a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchuminweb_e3cb.html" title="User talk:Schuminweb">Talk</a>) 17:47, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../c/c/c/WP%7ECCC_b716.html" title="WP:CCC">WP:CCC</a> notwithstanding, the list's creator left a note on the talk page directing folks to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_people_from_San_Francisco_f545.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of people from San Francisco">this AfD</a>.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 17:57, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Mild keep</b> - I've been working on creating the various <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Council_Directory_fb19.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Directory">Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Directory</a> pages for a while now, which is why I haven't been keeping up the lists lately. Most of the other lists I created were directly mentioned to the WikiProjects of the states. Washington, D.C. has no such project. As soon as I'm done with the directory, I'll be adding the names to the various lists of notable residents, in the pages if the lists are small enough, in separate pages, like this one, if the lists are expected to get so long that they'll require a page of their own. And I just added the names of the people already listed in the various suburban areas of Washington, to indicate that work had continued. You are, of course, free to do as you will. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 19:15, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> isn't this why we have categories? If it's kept (seems likely), I would expect that a list with this title to not include the DC equivalent of the "bridge and tunnel crowd"; if someone wanted a List of people from the Washington, D.C., Metro Area they could look it. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 02:25, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I think too many at these discussions are unclear or ignorant of why lists exist at all so they end up making unintentionally absurd AfD choices, like this one. If you'll check <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_notable_people_of_Oakville%2C_Ontario_0aab.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of notable people of Oakville, Ontario">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of notable people of Oakville, Ontario</a> you'll see it survived easily even though there is a <a href="../../../p/e/o/Category%7EPeople_from_Oakville%2C_Ontario_259f.html" title="Category:People from Oakville, Ontario">Category:People from Oakville, Ontario</a>. See also<a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_people_by_U.S._cities_caa8.html" title="Category:Lists of people by U.S. cities">Category:Lists of people by U.S. cities</a> and read <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_guideline_8973.html" title="Wikipedia:List guideline">Wikipedia:List guideline</a>.

<dd>That stated if you want to find nonsensical or unnecessary lists for deletion look through <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_of_lists_uncategorized_4b1f.html" title="Wikipedia:List of lists/uncategorized">Wikipedia:List of lists/uncategorized</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/c/Category%7EIncomplete_lists_82b1.html" title="Category:Incomplete lists">Category:Incomplete lists</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> - In response to <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Calossuarez46</a>, the convention at the time the list was created was to not separate the residents of the "suburbs" out from the major city in such lists. I received a rather pointed comment to that effect (probably justifiably) in regards to one such existing list. I would have no objections to either the creation of a separate page detailing the composition of each MSA, or to explicitly retitling many of these pages for the MSA's rather than the cities. As indicated before, I had more recently been adding the name of each individual to the list of people from the city, town, or other specific location of their residence, intending to collect them all in lists such as this MSA list later, if at all. This page and others like it could alternately eventually become simply a list of people from the central community with links to the various lists of people from the individual suburbs. In some cases, such activity has already been started. Also, there is a real question as to which such listing someone who lives in or was born in, say, Alexandria, Virginia, because their job or that of their parents was in Washington, D.C., should be placed in. I would tend to think that for such people as that lists of this kind are probably the best reasonable alternative. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 15:33, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
