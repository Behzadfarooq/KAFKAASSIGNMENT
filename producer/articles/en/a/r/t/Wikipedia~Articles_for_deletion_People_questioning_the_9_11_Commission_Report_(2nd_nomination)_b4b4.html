Since we have the citations for the people being kept on this list it's not original research. It's as simple as that. <b>2</b> - <i>"POV"</i> - What POV? How is the article expressing a POV by listing those who question the report? It's not. <b>3</b> -<i>"redundant see:9/11 Truth Movement, Scholars for 9/11 Truth, and Researchers questioning the official account of 9/11"</i> - The people listed on this page need not be part of the Truth Movement, need not be scholars or reaserachers. So how is it redundant? This is a much more inclusive list, therefore it doesn't fulfill the functions of more specialized lists. <b>4</b> - <i>"vague requirements for inclusion"</i> - If people question the report they're in.

<li><b>No vote yet</b>. Question: can you answer the assertion that the article is an "indiscriminate list with vague requirements for inclusion"? Because it seems like one to me.

<dd>It is a lot easier to judge whether someone is say "a christian" or "an anarchist" because they would refer to themselves as being members of these groups or ideoligies.

<dd>Those are ideologies. Criticising the 9/11 Commision report is not an ideology. i.e. Anarchists and Christians share a set of world views and philosophies on life.

Even the mainstream media has problems with cherry-picking quotes from what people say, and out of context they can imply something different than what the person really intended and not capture nuanced views well. This issue of cherry-picking, misinterpretations, and misrepresentation is all the more serious with sources used in this article, such as prisonplanet.</li>
<li>Some users have attempted to clean up this article, but nonetheless its daunting and a problematic article for Wikipedia. Maintaining this article requires extreme due diligence, as these are all <b><a href="../../../l/i/v/Category%7ELiving_people_7259.html" title="Category:Living people">Living people</a></b>; I'm concerned a list like this may misrepresent some people's viewpoints, or mistakenly include people.
