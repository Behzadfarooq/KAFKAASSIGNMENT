<p>I don't think anyone knows what this is. It is unencyclopedic and it may qualify for "speedy deletion", but I can't "speedy delete" by my values.

<li><b>Comment</b> The problem I have with this article is that it doesn't appear to me to have any special significance. There are some binary compounds that are important, but are all important enough on their own to warrant a separate article? Then why arbitrarily draw the line there, why not include tertiary compounds as well or go even higher? What I am trying to say is that certain compounds are important through the properties they possess or their history but we shouldn't generalize notability criteria for an entire class. Can anyone who voted to keep the article please explain why this specific compound is of special interest? <a href="../../../t/s/o/User%7ETSO1D_9399.html" title="User:TSO1D">TSO1D</a> 04:49, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't think there is a 'notability criteria' for chemicals. <b>Keep</b>, and please don't rename&#160;:) Copper(II) fluoride is very different to copper(I) fluoride!

<li><b>Comment</b>: I removed the disclaimer that it's not advertising from the page, as it appeared to be a pre-emptive AfD comment, and instead I'm posting it here. While it was in the original edit, I felt that it violated the general practice of not posting content disclaimers. If it is truely not advertising, then it's <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Neutrality</a> should be apparent from the article itself. The disclaimer read (for information purposes) as follows: "There are pages for the Bedazzler and Magic Bullet appliance with the same general information and they are not deleted. This is an article that provides information on the product. It is not a form of advertising" To me this is an AfD comment made before the fact, and not appropriate for a mainspace article, as they attempt to cite comparisons in the introduction to the article itself. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 02:02, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article was first expanded from the original <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_Denial_7a44.html" title="Holocaust Denial">Holocaust Denial</a> article because the article itself was focusing too much on the arguments against denial, and not on the aspect of holocaust denial itself (its history, repercussions, etc.). It has existed on Wikipedia for over two years, and since that time its POV has <b>not</b> seriously challenged until now, with this AfD. As the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Examination_of_Holocaust_denial&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Examination_of_Holocaust_denial&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">edit history of the article itself</a> shows, nearly all of the disputes involving the articles POV have been from anonymous (or short-lived) users who popped up to declare the article biased -- because it supposedly didn't present detailed equal time "questioning the Holocaust." The issue here is that this article is inherently biased against Holocaust deniers -- which is as it should be. Why? Not because of POV or my own or anyone's despising of Holocaust deniers (deserved or not); rather, because Holocaust denial is itself a hate-spawned, primarily anti-Semitic belief based on wild conspiracy theories. This is not a statement of bias, but rather a statement of fact -- one that has been proven again and again over the years. It <i>is</i> NPOV to state this, because it is a proven fact, backed up by considerable arguments against denial that vastly outweigh the feeble arguments presented by deniers. Consequently, I believe the article <i>is</i> NPOV, because debunking of Holocaust denial as a lunatic fringe belief <i>is</i> a historical fact. --<a href="../../../m/o/d/User%7EModemac_38eb.html" title="User:Modemac">Modemac</a> 01:31, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, this is a useful and interesting article and looks well on its way to being well referenced. The <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">holocaust denial</a> article focuses on the movement, personalities involved and the history, this article is about the claims made by the movement and the evidence rebutting them. Seems a significant enough movement that one article isn't enough to cover it. NPOV is good but does not mean giving equal time to fringe theories while leaving them unrebutted. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragomiloff_1fd6.html" title="User:Dragomiloff">Dragomiloff</a> 02:07, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - This article is Original Research and POV. The nature of this article wishes to argue something, and is mostly argument with some sparse quotes.

So must POV. Even if there is POV on other related cites, that doesnt justify creating more POV to balance it out.

<li><b>Keep</b> with indifference to renaming. Although a decision for or against merging here wouldn't be binding, I'll opine that merging doesn't seem viable due to the length of the two articles. I read the nomination as being that the article is too detailed for an encyclopedia. Maybe... However, Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia, which gives us the opportunity to have more depth of coverage on important topics, not just more topics of marginal importance. This much content is not too much in my opinion. (And I note that to the best of my knowledge we don't have any community standards for what constitutes "too much information" on a topic of agreed importance.) I also don't see the original research concern as being real; my read of the article is that the refutations are generally cited to a prior source that used them the same way, which makes the analysis not original. Could more be quoted and cited - sure, but the article wouldn't need to change significantly. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 06:05, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b>. This article is better written than 90% of the articles on Wikipedia, and contains vast amounts of valuable information.

If the consensus is to keep, I will gladly spend a few days properly wikifying the article. As to the claims above of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, I must respectfully disagree. I know a lot about this subject, and everything I read in this article I have also heard or read elsewhere. In closing, I would like to add that Holocaust denial is a longstanding concern of mine.

As the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">Holocaust denial</a> article is most likely the more commonly read of the two it would be a shame for readers to miss the material contained in this one.

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Rename</b>. The article is sound, although it is in desperate need of inline references to clearly demonstrate that it is not OR, e.g. that it is a summation of arguments made in other contexts to refute the claims of Holocaust deniers. To that end, it should also be renamed. <i>Examination of Holocause denial</i> suggests that this is an article that will examine and refute certain claims; it would be more neutral to call it <i>Criticisms</i> or <i>Refutations</i> instead. - <a href="../../../e/r/o/User%7EEronMain_e7ee.html" title="User:EronMain">Eron</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/r/o/User_talk%7EEronMain_52bf.html" title="User talk:EronMain">Talk</a></sup> 17:19, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Rename</b>. In light of recent comments I am changing my opinion to one of <i>keep</i> and supporting a rename to <b>Criticisms of Holocaust denial</b>. But it should be stressed that the article needs considerable work to reference the content and avoid POV and OR criticism. Contrary to what has been said above, Wikipedia should not set out to <i>rebut</i> notable theories, however objectionable- that sets editors up as critics, something to be avoided. However I accept criticisms of Holocaust denial are widespread and well founded and do deserve to be covered <i>neutrally</i> by Wikipedia. - <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WJB</b><i>scribe</i></a>&#160;<sup><small><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe">(<b>WJB</b> <i>talk</i>)</a></small></sup> 17:39, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

To merge the three together would be an impossible task, without sacrificing important content. It has already been agreed that the referencing needs work; I have said earlier I am happy to undertake the referencing as a project if this article is kept. It seems logical and important to me that this article remains distinct from the denial article, since they, though related, are on decidedly different facets of the subject. To make an analogy, the articles on <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halloween_%28film%29.html" title="Halloween (film)">Halloween</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halloween_2.html" title="Halloween 2">Halloween 2</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halloween_3.html" title="Halloween 3">Halloween 3</a> are all featured articles, yet some people could easily say to save space they should be merged into one article about the series.

Media coverage (the WSJ carries at least one "human interest" or "funny-strange science" story on its front page every day) of limited academic studies is not sufficient to prove encyclopedic notability.

<li><b>Keep</b> Analysis of how the game is played has attracted both scholarly and press attraction, as noted and referenced in the article. It may not have the volume of scholarly attention that Monty Hall has received, but that is due to the facts that it hasn't been around as long and it involved more complicated mathematics than the simple Monty Hall problem. This article is still in need of improvement, but it is a far cry from what it once was, which was more like a guide to playing the game. The modeling section is in need of being improved, preferably by someone who is very familiar with utility theory and thus well suited to integrating the appropriate external references into the article. The comparison with Monty Hall is about as good as its going to get, and it limits itself to explaining how the two problems differ with a straightforward comparison of the mathematics behind the two problems. It's not advancing any new theories or the like, and as it serves as a comparison to the other major mathematical problem to have received scholarly attention, I think it belongs in the article. Even if don't belong, that problem could best be solved by deleting the Monty Hall section, not deleting the entire article. <span style="font-family:cursive"><a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a></span> <a href="../../../c/a/e/User_talk%7ECaerwine_f9c2.html" title="User talk:Caerwine"><small style="font-family:sans-serif;color:darkred">Caer’s whines</small></a> 03:05, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Point taken, but it seems to me that we still need to find references - I was unsuccessful. That "many Alaksans" might consider the building historic simply because of its age is not exactly a reason to keep it here, unless we can locate a newspaper article or something that says just that. Otherwise, it's just another building, and probably not the only one in Juneau that is 60 years old.--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5">Dmz5</a> 21:24, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

My contention is that while this journal may be known and well established within Brandeis University, it remains a non-notable student journal as far as the world at large is concerned per plenty of consensus here; sister Brandeis journal The Hoot appears to be <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Hoot_2ce9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Hoot">headed that way</a> too.

<li><b>Keep</b> Most college newspapers do have a mention. Just because "the Justice" happens to be a common name doesn't mean the newspaper should lose its site. futhermore, it's not like people type in "the Justice" if they are looking for information about a justice or judge. It seems like whoever wants to delete this is making a problem out of nothing.

<li><b>Keep</b> If you merge or delete this, then you'll have to do the same to every other campus newspaper page on this site. That is, unless you're a hypocrite. And also, for those of you who say "the Justice sucks," you clearly don't know how much time and effort goes into creating it. Maybe it doesn't live up to your high standards, but do the Justice a favor and do one of the following: 1) shut up, and don't share your opinion until you have a valid one based on tangible facts, 2) join the Justice and help make it better, since you seem to know so much about journalism, and 3) shut up, because you probably don't know a thing about journalism. Don't insult the people who take the Justice seriously by writing "the Justice sucks" because it only makes you look bad. Anyway, keep the page as is, because there are people in the community who read the Justice on a regular basis, and it will save you the time of deleting or merging every other campus newspaper listed on the site.
<ul>
<li>Seriously, who said this article should be deleted because the Justice sucks? I think that person abstained. But to answer your 1, 2 and 3 (just so you know I'm in favor of keeping it)...1) Just because a lot of effort goes into making it, doesn't mean it doesn't suck. How do you know this person doesn't base his/her opinion on facts...he does go to Brandeis and does read the paper. 2) Easier said than done. It's one thing to write articles...which not even everyone can do, but to actually be in a position to help make it better...well that a) takes time b) requires getting past many other editor's egos who think they are the Gods of journalism. 3) speaking of tangible facts...which tangible facts to you base this assertion from? "Don't insult the people who take the Justice seriously by writing "the Justice sucks" because it only makes you look bad" It's not an insult if it's true. "keep the page as is, because there are people in the community who read the Justice on a regular basis" doesn't address the assertion that no one outside of the community knows or cares about it (not saying it's true). Anyway...you probably should have thought a little before posting what you did since it made you sound childish and defensive.</li>

Mermaid and Lamia are not substantially better articles than Centaur, which so far has nothing but delete suggested.

<p>This article was nominated earlier today, but the nom was quickly withdrawn. However, for the life of me, I cannot see what is notable about this person other than the fact her son was famous.

<dd>Well, the linked news article says that they're spending about US$20mm (their conversion rate is wrong) over 4 years to renovate an entire historic site which includes the mother's tomb but also includes 3 or more villages of historic importance (so multiple buildings across multiple locations), at least one temple, a monument, other family tombs/graves plus there's plans to create 4 or 5 new museum houses. (the wikipedia article says that this four year project was completed in 2005 but references the news article which says the 4yr project began in 2004).

<dd>Wikipedia's coverage of eastern anime/videogame culture is far more comprehensive than its coverage of Vietnamese traditional culture or political history.

<li><b>Comment</b> Please <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. This nomination has nothing to do with "eastern culture". I don't care what part of the world someone is from, we don't need articles on the mother (or father) of every famous person unless that person has done something notabile in his or her own right. If the tomb is the big deal, then an article on the tomb <i>might</i> be encyclopedic. The article itself continues to lack or denote any notability. As for Ho Chi Mihn being "one of the most influential historic figures of the twentieth century", that's a matter of opinion. I suggest he's much further back in the queue. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 02:33, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There is a clear double standard here. Consider the well-written article on <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia_Clinton_Kelley_8338.html" title="Virginia Clinton Kelley">Virginia Clinton Kelley</a>, whose only notable achievement was giving birth to Bill Clinton. By the way, asserting that being the mother of a notable historic figure does not confer notability is also a matter of opinion, many biographers would staunchly disagree with such dismissal. ˉˉ<sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnetode_cbff.html" title="User:Anetode"><b>anetode</b></a></sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User_talk%7EAnetode_6721.html" title="User talk:Anetode">╦╩</a> 02:44, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>No double standard here. I was unaware of the Kelley article, and if it were up for nomination I'd be saying delete it, too. Two non-notable persons do not make a notable one. As for what most biographers have to say, argument ad nauseum does not prove anything, but to be more to the point, if you're writing a biography, the mother is <i>relevant</i> (not necessarily notable) to the subject matter of the biography. In that case, anything that can be said for any of these non-notable mothers can be said in their children's articles. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 08:05, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Too many details about family members would bog down the main article. However if there is enough well-sourced information to create a succinct biography of an immediate family member of a historic figure, then creating a short supplemental article will improve the overall coverage of that figure. In any case it seems clear that we are looking at this issue from two completely different vantage points, so I'll just say that I don't agree with your reasoning. ˉˉ<sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnetode_cbff.html" title="User:Anetode"><b>anetode</b></a></sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User_talk%7EAnetode_6721.html" title="User talk:Anetode">╦╩</a> 21:51, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not giving an opinion in this AFD, but I have to respond to your comment "please stop relisting this for deletion." There's nothing procedurally wrong with this AFD -- it raises a valid notability concern that has not been discussed in almost a year. Note that the first AFD was in January and resulted in no consensus, and the 2nd AFD didn't address notability (it addressed verifiability due to my stupid mistake and was quickly and trivially resolved). <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 03:12, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I simply disagree. the relevant section here is&#160;:<i>Articles about first team squad members who have not made a first team appearance may also be appropriate, but only if the individual is at a club of sufficient stature that most members of its squad are worthy of articles.</i> That is a weasel guideline if ever there was one and represents a non-compromise compromise between people like myself who consider r-o-t-m college athletes unnotable and those who argue otherwise. To argue notability through the simple fact of playing on a college team as a starter and garnering media attention as a result is gaming the system wrt various guidelines (BIO, V), the spirit of which to assert a greater notability. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 13:37, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The Railway Mission has not been good at promoting itself over the years. But has begun to do so. Individual chaplains are often sited but this has not always highlighted the Railway Mission. See Links and read below and what they are about. Thanks. I wanted to add more about the mission but have been trying to work out how to add pictures. I hope that rather than just deleteing this you could help put things right.</p>

<li>If mention of the chaplains and organisation they work for by the internationally recognised media does not verify the organisation what would.

(although at this time the Railway Mission Home site is not much Cop) How else can I verify the organisation? Even their calendars that are given away free are sold on ebay! And thanks for puting in the logo, I could only get it onto a seporate page as you know. I also want, if the page remains and I can get it right, pictures from ufton nervet train crash and 7-7, but who knows. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_88.106.160.184_8960.html" title="Special:Contributions/88.106.160.184">88.106.160.184</a> (<a href="../../../8/8/2E/User_talk%7E88.106.160.184.html" title="User talk:88.106.160.184">talk</a>) 00:25, 14 December 2006 (UTC).</small></li>

<li>Wiktionary is "the lexical companion to Wikipedia", and the way to do this is to link from the encyclopaedia article to a category of words on Wiktionary, such as <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_three_letter_words" class="extiw" title="wikt:Category:English_three_letter_words">wikt:Category:English three letter words</a>. There's even a template, {{<a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWiktionarycat_fc58.html" title="Template:Wiktionarycat">wiktionarycat</a>}} for this very thing. A category of words is unworkable on Wikipedia, because on Wikipedia individual words don't get individual articles. On Wiktionary, however, they do, and a category of words is quite natural. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:04, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Another neologism for a mixed ethnic group. Yes, there are people in the Philippines with American ancestors but there appears to be no consensus on the meaning of this particular term. American-Filipino, as far as I know, is not a mainstream term like Filipino-American is. And it seems like people use American-Filipino in the sense of Filipino-American; i.e. Filipinos in the US.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> the fact of the matter is, "American-Filipino" was just coined to fit this definition. It is a definition that has not even been heard of in the Philippines or even among Filipinos in the United States. I mean, I myself have never heard of the term before seeing it on Wikipedia. FWIW, my own mother fits the definition of "American-Filipino" and she's never heard of the term. The term used is <a href="../../../a/m/e/Amerasian.html" title="Amerasian">Amerasian</a> and that's where the contents of the article should go until a more commonly accepted term comes into existence. A Google search of the term "American-Filipinos" garners only 21 results on Philippine sites and none of these are used in the way that the article defines the term. On the other hand, there are over 116 hits for Amerasians on Philippine sites. And as one can see, that is term used by the Philippine press. Another place for this subject is <a href="../../../f/i/l/Filipino_mestizo.html" title="Filipino mestizo">Filipino mestizo</a>. My point is that there are already a number of articles that address this topic and another one isn't needed especially under a concocted and obscure name.

<li><b>Comment</b> Albanian-American is most certainly not a neologism. On the other hand, Montenegro has barely been an independent country for a year and in my view, I'd probably vote to delete its page. You also have to realize, that there are no droves of US immigrants to the Philippines just as there have been droves of Filipino immigrants to the United States. Very few if any of these so-called "American-Filipino" identifies themselves as such (you and I had this discussion before as far as other ethnicities were concerned). Do we seriously have to have an ad nauseam amount of American-XXXXX articles just because some American servicemen went to that country and impregnated the women there? American-French, American-British, and American-Mexican anyone? --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Sundita_7a61.html" title="User:Christopher Sundita">Chris S.</a> 22:30, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> In many cases, as I have come to realize since our discussion, you do not willfully choose to identify as a member of an ethnic group. You simply are. And even <i>if</i> you were to choose <i>not</i> to identify with your own people, well, put a Han Chinese man who speaks Filipino in a room filled with other Filipinos and he is automatically labeled “Chinese-Filipino”. —<a href="../../../l/a/g/User%7ELagalag_0ace.html" title="User:Lagalag">Lagalag</a> 23:01, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Follow-up</b> Given that there seem to be no American-XXXXX articles, as you have pointed out, I would just then probably propose a <b>merge</b> into <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americans_in_the_Philippines_fc54.html" title="Americans in the Philippines">Americans in the Philippines</a> and having Category:American-Filipinos deleted. —<a href="../../../l/a/g/User%7ELagalag_0ace.html" title="User:Lagalag">Lagalag</a> 23:11, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: That sounds more sensible, thanks. Going off-topic... As for my ethnic group, it's situational. In the end, I am a Filipino American and I'm a part of the long-established Filipino-American community. In certain situations, I simply say Filipino especially when saying American is redundant. With foreigners, I usually say I'm American. I'm all three, really. But, I don't say that I am a Cornish-Swiss-Tagalog-Bicolano-American or whatever especially since whatever culture that my Cornish great-great-grandfather or Bicolana grandmothers brought over to the US is largely unknown to me and thus not a part of my identity. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Sundita_7a61.html" title="User:Christopher Sundita">Chris S.</a> 23:39, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article obviously has had a great deal of work and has sources, but I just don't feel it's maintainable enough. Plenty of cities, I imagine, had trolleybuses at one point but no longer do; it could easily get unmanageable.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't understand the logic: because this list is historical, it cannot be outdated--records don't change. Unless you have cities that can't make up their mind about trolleybuses (highly unlikely in my mind, due to the infrastructure needed to run a system), this page is not going to fall into inaccuracy (it may be inaccurate to begin with, but that's not the issue). Now you can have cities that tossed their trolleybuses and not make it into the list, but the list already looks useful even if it is a incomplete list. <i><a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a></i> 04:09, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>comment:</b> My main concern here is that there will be so many cities that once had trolleybuses but no longer do that the list will become large and unmanageable. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrystallina_cbad.html" title="User:Crystallina">Crystallina</a> 04:15, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Then the list becomes outdated and in need of expansion, which merit cleanup tags. Worse case scenario is that the list becomes incomplete; It won't accrue <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> issues by aging.

<li><b>Delete</b> Unmaintainable listcruft of an arbitrarily chosen, single-aspect characteristic of cities. Why does a cities once having had trolley buses have to do with anything of encyclopedic note? It's a random way of organizing cities and would create a precedent for other "List of cities that no longer have..." articles.

<li>This list is primarily relevant to the history of trolley busses, and as such it is very much encyclopaedic.

<ul>
<li>There are no problems with getting an accurate list, nor with maintaining it. A city either had a trolley bus system that it got rid of or it didn't. Trolley bus systems require significant investment of time (years) and money (£ millions) to construct and significant (although less) of both to remove. This means that very little, if any, maintenance is needed because the entries on the list do not change. The major change to infrastructure means that finding sources is not difficult. 02:34, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

A list of anything should therefore include former examples as well as current ones. It may be suitable to split a list of current examples from the list of all examples, but the historic list should continue to include the current examples.

<dd>To just address one small point - to the extent that the concern is that information about the Supreme Court case needs to be "housed" somewhere other than in the companies' articles, might I suggest that the case have its own article? That's pretty standard practice - see, e.g., <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_cases_from_the_Hughes_Court_through_the_Burger_Court_df81.html" title="List of United States Supreme Court cases from the Hughes Court through the Burger Court">List of United States Supreme Court cases from the Hughes Court through the Burger Court</a>. If it also turns out that Whip Jones is only notable as part of that case, he should just be mentioned in that article. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 04:20, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Bob, addressing your comment here and the one below. Whip Jones, the individual, is the one who started the legal action against ASC in 1979. There would be no case without him. He is the one who had the gumption to accuse the ASC of violating the Sherman act. In the Supreme court, it is an appeal, and the ASC is listed first. Whip was still running the company during the action and the appeal. Even without the supreme court case, I do not think it makes sense to delete this bio, and I do not think it makes sense to cram it back into the AH article, as Whip stopped any involvement in the AH in 1993. He founded, ran it, and fought off his rivals for 35 years. I only wish the bio wasn't so impersonal now that we've pruned it and pruned it.<a href="../../../b/m/c/User%7EBMcCJ_d979.html" title="User:BMcCJ">-BMcCJ</a></dd>

Wikipedia will have an entry for Aspen Highlands (one of only four ski areas in the famous <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspen.html" title="Aspen">Aspen</a> resort for longer than the next 100 years. The first sentence of the Highlands entry references founder <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whip_Jones_36c0.html" title="Whip Jones">Whip Jones</a> so I would aggue that the <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whip_Jones_36c0.html" title="Whip Jones">Whip Jones</a> entry completes and gives detail and background to the <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspen_Highlands_8447.html" title="Aspen Highlands">Aspen Highlands</a> one. Originally the Jones BIO was stuck into the Highlands entry and I thought I was helping by moving it out and making it separate as it makes the Highlands entry cleaner.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>PLEASE RE-READ ACTUAL WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE</b> <a href="../../../b/m/c/User%7EBMcCJ_d979.html" title="User:BMcCJ">BMcCJ</a></li>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Based on feedback, I have revamped this article to bring the significant and relevant information to the top. This AfD is confusing as it is based on the original article and tried to address AfDing two people at once. As the <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whip_Jones_36c0.html" title="Whip Jones">Whip Jones</a> article under debate has been 'revamped' with significant information about the groundbreaking antitrust law and the US Supreme Court Case added. Also the personal, family background color information has been moved to the bottom (and could be deleted, if necessary, to keep the article).<a href="../../../b/m/c/User%7EBMcCJ_d979.html" title="User:BMcCJ">-BMcCJ</a></li>
<li><b>Questions:</b> How many people have founded and run an independent Ski Resort in Aspen for 35 years? Created a world famous resort that has lasted 50 years (so far)?, Fought the competition in the <b>US Supreme Court</b> and won? Set long standing antitrust law? Been inducted to the Colorado Skiing Hall of Fame? Made the second largest donation (handing over a a Ski Resort) ever to Harvard??? How many people in the world have done all those things? Seriously? <a href="../../../b/m/c/User%7EBMcCJ_d979.html" title="User:BMcCJ">-BMcCJ</a></li>
<li><b>Revote?</b> Because the article has been totally revamped, sourced and revised for relevance and NPOV, I'd like to propose cancelling the AfD or start a revote. I'd love help making the article better. I think the <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whip_Jones_36c0.html" title="Whip Jones">Whip Jones</a> article is a great addition to Wikipedia and adds to other entries: <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspen.html" title="Aspen">Aspen</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspen_Skiing_Company_d727.html" title="Aspen Skiing Company">Aspen Skiing Company</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspen_Highlands_8447.html" title="Aspen Highlands">Aspen Highlands</a>, <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_Supreme_Court_76bb.html" title="US Supreme Court">US Supreme Court</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard.html" title="Harvard">Harvard</a>, Colorado Skiing, <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitkin_County_61d7.html" title="Pitkin County">Pitkin County</a>, Economist <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrei_Shleifer_ccdf.html" title="Andrei Shleifer">Andrei Shleifer</a><a href="../../../b/m/c/User%7EBMcCJ_d979.html" title="User:BMcCJ">-BMcCJ</a> 06:21, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>RE-EXAMINE</b> I have now further edited and cut down to an appropriate size, with only appropriate links, even though this removed a good deal of what had just been added-- perhaps because I am not associated with the family&#160;:). I urge the original editor to examine and learn from other similar articles when working on future articles.
<ul>
<li>WJ is clearly a prominent businessperson and sports executive, having been a pioneering founder of major ski areas in Aspen. There is adequate documentation, including a US Supreme Court case. I urge those previously voting to re-examine the article and perhaps change their vote.<a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 07:08, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>&#160;??? <b>Quoting the WP:BIO Criteria:</b> <i>The person made a widely recognized contribution that is <b>part of the enduring historical record in their specific field</b></i> Jones's two widely recognized contributions in Colorado Skiing: <b>Aspen Highlands</b> and the <b>US Supreme Court Case</b> <a href="../../../b/m/c/User%7EBMcCJ_d979.html" title="User:BMcCJ">- BMcCJ</a> 01:17, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, but...the WP:Bio excerpt you cite has its limitations. There are three moving parts here: A widely recognized contribution, that is part of the enduring historical record, in a specific field. Here the concern is that the field may be too specific; the contribution not widely enough recognized. Is this person notable outside of the local Colorado skiing industry?
<dl>
<dd>Yes and the achievement is as well. The Colorado Ski Industry is huge (in customers, narrow in terms of owner/operators) and internationally recognized. I suspect that none of the people favoring a delete are members of the ski industry. But, we have evidence that in his field he was recognized twice and inducted into two industry halls of fame. <b>His industry recognized his lifetime achievments and lasting contributions ~ TWICE.</b> And I don't know of anything more enduring than a mountain. <a href="../../../b/m/c/User%7EBMcCJ_d979.html" title="User:BMcCJ">-BMcCJ</a>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that a mountain is enduring - and please don't take this the wrong way, but, come on - he didn't build the mountain. "God" did. Forget to oil the gears on the chair lift for a few years, and it would be back to God's Mountain rather than Whip Jones's. (Sorry - I know that's rhetorical.) So you're right that the industry considers him a hall of famer. The problem comes if the industry is too narrowly defined to have "wide recognition." An inductee into the Kansas Electricians Hall of Fame would probably not be notable, for example, if no one in Missouri had heard of him. So although I hear your point about the Colorado ski industry, it's not open and shut. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 17:16, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>I'm not sure, so I definitely see the argument that this fails WP:Bio. I think the Supreme Court case is a red-herring because the importance of that case has nothing to do with the personalities underlying it - it was something the Court did, not something notable that Jones did. I don't see any reason to think that a person, who founds a company, that becomes a party to a case, that makes it to the Supreme Court, which then creates interesting law, is therefore notable (sorry - that was a lot of extraneous commas).
<dl>
<dd>ok, I get your point. It isn't that he founded a company that later went on and became party to a case. He was the party that initiated the case, through his company. big difference.<a href="../../../b/m/c/User%7EBMcCJ_d979.html" title="User:BMcCJ">-BMcCJ</a>
<dl>
<dd>Not really. First off, he didn't change the law - the Court did. Still, if he had been the named party, there might be some minimal value to having an article so that someone could look him up for more information. (Just as someone might, for example, look up who that "Brown" or "Roe" or "Lochner" person was.) But he wasn't - and involvement in a case that goes to the Court does not seem to me to create notability in itself. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 17:16, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Or, to put it another way, thousands of pages of legal commentary have been written about the Aspen Skiing case - but I've never seen one that discussed Whip Jones.
<dl>
<dd>When a case is presented from one company sueing another AH vs ASC and then again an appeal ASC vs. AH. The AH is Whip Jones. It was a small front office, with only one owner. From 1956 through to 1993 Whip personally signed every paycheck, and ran the place, skiing nearly every day, meeting for photos with nearly every celeb from 1956 through to 1993. They wanted their picture with him hanging on the wall in the Merry-go-round lounge midmountain. He was the man, in separable from the company and the mountain. Again, '<i>he was the man</i> with the gumption to start the action. I can tell you from spending time with him, that he really didn't publicize himself very much. It was all about the mountain.<a href="../../../b/m/c/User%7EBMcCJ_d979.html" title="User:BMcCJ">-BMcCJ</a>
<dl>
<dd>The AH wasn't Whip Jones for the purposes of the case, as above. As a result it is the case, and sometimes the company, rather than the man that has been discussed in outside sources. If we were weighing his value as a person, it wouldn't matter whether it was the mountain or the man that got the press. He is most definitely impressive. But we're discussing notability - and notability requires outside sources. And while having gumption is impressive, that's not the same as notable. If he sat quietly back in the shadows, always making it about the mountain rather than him...then he probably let the mountain become notable without becoming notable himself. (Though, just to reiterate, I'm not sure that this is the case - he may have become independently notable. I'm neutral on how all this weighs out.) --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOther</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheOtherBob_cb4a.html" title="User talk:TheOtherBob">Bob</a> 17:16, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Arthur, I've only voted once, and yes have moved from my original user ID: SavageGecko to one I prefer to develop in the future: BMcCJ. I am open about it on my User page and have the old one redirecting there. And I've taken my "Soapbox" thoughts and my personal opinions about you and your own supposed "notability" there as well. Feel free to take the personal discussion to my page, where I'll be glad to talk to you there. Let's stick to the merits of this biographical entry and whether or not it stands on its own or should go back into the Aspen Highlands entry where it came from. I didn't create this content, I moved it from an existing Wikipedia page. You know this is a legit article, stop roasting the newbie. I get the feeling you would rather win the debate than do what is right. This should be a KEEP (bold removed), period. Look at the article, is it ok or not.

The man's claim to notability, besides being a fan of <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swindon_Town_F.C._93eb.html" title="Swindon Town F.C.">Swindon Town F.C.</a>, appears to be that that he is some sort of a functionary at <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Who_Magazine_e936.html" title="Doctor Who Magazine">Doctor Who Magazine</a> - which, not to put too fine a point on it, ain't the Economist or the New Yorker.

<li><b>Keep</b> I've added news paper article links to the article which show that journalists have been talking about BoyChat since 1998.

The article still needs a lot of a work and seems to skirt around the issue that all the reliable sources say that BoyChat is chat for pedophiles. This article seems to avoid stating verifiable facts about the website. Then on a non-policy note I'd like to say that having an article on BoyChat on Wikipedia allows people to read about it without actually going there.

<li><b>Hmmmmm.</b> On the one hand, the article has been sourced. I mean, realistically, granted that BoyChat is just another internet forum and and a small fringe one at that, the nature of the board is such that it's not surprising that it would attract a small amount of notice, if only for the shock value. There's more citation here than for a lot of other small fringe entities that have articles, I guess. On the other hand... it <i>is</i> true that the article was created by BoyChat members to promote BoyChat. That also is <i>why</i> the net has been combed so thoroughly to provide references. That in itself is not reason for deletion, though. The article is hardly a paean to BoyChat, after all. But... we know that Wikipedia is a target for <i>many</i> types of people to promote their fringe ideologies. Simply getting an article in, even if it's not especially positive, is a "win" for these fringe ideologists, conferring a certain level of legitimacy. My experience with what I'll call the <i>sex-with-children-normalization</i> ideology is that this is no exception, and indeed exponents of this ideology have shown considerable determination to get this ideology certified by inclusion in the Wikipedia in various ways. This <i>has</i> been a problem, and the Wikipedia has been criticized with some cause as "Wikipedophilia" in the past, which is <i>not</i> a good thing, and could become a Very Bad Thing if a lid is not kept on it. Per <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> commentors are permitted to transcend policy if doing so to prevent the Wikipedia from being hijacked for use in a way that is detrimental to the overall long-term public perception of the Wikipedia (and per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_EVIL_85b9.html" title="WP:NOT EVIL">WP:NOT EVIL</a>, to prevent the Wikipedia from being hijacked to promote <i>any</i> evil end regardless of direct harm to the project). Is this such a case? I don't know. But I for one don't have a problem with requiring a higher standard of notability for inclusion than I would for, er, other subjects. (FWIW <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_GirlChat_d73c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/GirlChat">GirlChat</a> was deleted earlier this year.) <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 14:07, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I agree that is pretty obvious that pedos have combined forces to prove this article (they say so on the talk page) and topic meets <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> but I don't appreciate the accusation that anyone arguing for this article or adding references to this article must be a pedo. The fact is they have already been given "legitimacy" by the news media and various govt research groups. I'm just annoyed that you're suggesting this rather than putting your foot down and pointing out that a majority of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> edits on behalf of pedos are not <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and only represent a minority opinion. If you want to be a good admin you should go through and apply <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> to the article and the edits which people suggest they revert for <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. The first thing to be done is make sure all the pedo language is inline with the wikipedia pedo watch group that <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> is part of. Then second to make sure and watch the article when it gets edited that language isn't weakened and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> isn't abused to promote a fringe minority opinion. This is not a case of pro and anti-abortion this is a case of a case of FRINGE opinion, this means labels like <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophile.html" title="Pedophile">pedophile</a> will stick because all but the very fringe agree.

<li>I didn't at <i>all</i> mean to leave the impression that anyone working on sourcing the article or arguing for its retention is <i>anything</i>, sorry! if I did. (I would differentiate between <i>pedophile</i>, a person with an affliction, and <i>sex-with-children normalization advocate</i>, an ideologue. The two populations overlap no doubt but each group contains many members not in the other.)

<li>I'd rather speak for myself, in reply to your claim that I'm more concerned about the topic than the relevant guidelines regarding articles on Wikipedia. I think that the site is not notable enough, despite the references. The given references are few and not from sources that I trust (for example, if there was a big article in the <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wall_Street_Journal_599f.html" title="Wall Street Journal">Wall Street Journal</a> I would react differently). This is also true for many other web sites that have articles on Wikipedia, and they should also be deleted, in my opinion. If I had time, I would list them all (yes, I am a bit of a <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/deletionist" class="extiw" title="m:deletionist">deletionist</a>). On the other hand, many such sites (including BoyChat) deserve some mentioning in a relevant "parent" article, and the main entry can be a redirect to that article. So just <b>Delete</b> and go on. --<a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabi_S._4020.html" title="User:Gabi S.">Gabi S.</a> 06:54, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yer darn right I'm concerned about the topic. This forum only gained the references it did because the subject of the forum is so reprehensible. Wikipedia's purpose is to provide a service to its readers. I believe this article provides a <i>disservice</i> to its readers.

<li><b>Speedy delete</b> because the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_censored" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not censored</a> section explicitly says that articles may include objectionable text only if they do not violate the law of the U.S. state of Florida. Having the BoyChat article on Wikipedia can be seen as a form of advertising its services (for instance, it becomes available on many search engines), and I'm pretty sure that the law of the U.S. state of Florida has some clause prohibiting advertising of such services.

<li>This is silly. It would not be illegal to host BoyChat in Florida, so why would "advertising" it be? I'm sorry, but this article is going to get deleted as soon as the AfD period ends, so there is no need to come up with policy loopholes and weak conjecture about laws you are pretty sure exist. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClayboy_b087.html" title="User:Clayboy">Clayboy</a> 20:18, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've seen no third-party sources stating that the FBI monitors BoyChat. As well, a quick check of BoyChat's DNS shows that it is currently having to flee to Russia due to it's content being kicked off of Canadian, Swedish and American webhosts. If it were not illegal to host BoyChat in a state like Florida, why is the site currently being hosted in Russia? <a href="../../../x/a/v/User%7EXavierVE_7768.html" title="User:XavierVE">XavierVE</a> 12:26, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>It's being hosted in Russia because US/Canadian/Swedish hosts are more likely to be bullied by vigilante groups. Perverted Justice threatened previous ISPs (Verizon/MCI) with negative publicity and you've used tactics which have been described as harassment and spam, even by non-paedosexuals.

<li>RE: monitoring, good point. Re: not illegal: With the exception of certain regulated industries, most businesses are free to do business with who they want to. Many businesses do not want to associate even marginally with pedophile-related, pedophile-run web sites, either out of personal moral conviction or because they fear for their business's reputation should their client list become public knowledge. At least one host in the United States took on BoyChat but later removed for reasons the leaders of BoyChat have not announced or do not know. The removal came after pressure from third parties who claim similar goals to Xavier's group. I'm not saying Xavier's group had any hand in this disconnection, but I am saying Xavier's actions with MCI/Verizon inspired the third-party pressure on this American hosting service. <a href="../../../d/f/p/User%7EDfpc_1ac6.html" title="User:Dfpc">Dfpc</a> 13:49, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>"The right for an article to exist is to be judged by its notability alone." Um, no. "George Bush's homosexual relationship with Kim Jong-Il" is a notable topic, but it's completely unverifiable and thus inappropriate for Wikipedia. "The complete shooting script of <i>Superman Returns</i>" is notable and verifiable but still inappropriate for Wikipedia. This article may be notable (although it's certainly debatable), and it may be verifiable, and it's certainly not a copyright violation, but it's still inappropriate for Wikipedia because it does a disservice to Wikipedia's readers. It legitimizes a topic that rightfully belongs on the fringes of decent society (if even there); to claim it meets notability guidelines because of multiple third-party sources is to give its controversial nature too much influence over its notability. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> <sup><small><small><a href="../../../l/t/p/User_talk%7ELtPowers_d522.html" title="User talk:LtPowers">T</a></small></small></sup> 15:23, 16 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I see your point but I think you picked a bad example with the movie script. The circumstances which might make it notable enough to be in Wikipedia, for example, if a copy marked up by the director sold at auction for a record price, or if it were in a noteworthy court case, would IMHO make it worthy of an entry here. Perhaps a better example would be a movie script with no notability outside of the movie industry or fan clubs. But IMHO that wouldn't meet the notability requirement so we are back to square one: looking for a notable, verifiable event that does not belong in Wikipedia. Remember, since October, BoyChat/Free Spirits is notable for reasons outside of pedophilia, namely, attempted suppression of legal speech online and Net Neutrality. Such suppression is NOT a fringe issue. Even within the pedophilia arena, BoyChat has some minor notability/notoriety in scholarly and legal circles. Whether that rises to a "general interest" level common in Wikipedia is a matter for continued discussion. <a href="../../../d/f/p/User%7EDfpc_1ac6.html" title="User:Dfpc">Dfpc</a> 16:05, 16 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My intention with the example was simply to show that notability and verifiability, while necessary conditions, were not <i>sufficient</i> conditions for inclusion. We have many other criteria that also need to be met. If "BoyChat/Free Spirits is notable for ... attempted suppression of legal speech online and Net Neutrality", then the article needs to be about that suppression; BoyChat is hardly the only service affected by those attempts. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> <sup><small><small><a href="../../../l/t/p/User_talk%7ELtPowers_d522.html" title="User talk:LtPowers">T</a></small></small></sup> 16:46, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - We are 3 days into the AfD discussion. Take a look at the current content. Now, why Delete or Keep the article? What Would Change Your Mind? To those who propose deletion: <b>What specific items need to change?</b> More/better citations? More notability/notoriety? Is the topic completely unsalvageable? Other? To those who propose keeping: <b>How do you respond?</b> Whether this deletion goes through or not, these answers will prove useful should there be another call for deletion, or should the article be deleted and it or a similar article be created a year or two from now. I do hope the administrators keep this discussion. <a href="../../../d/f/p/User%7EDfpc_1ac6.html" title="User:Dfpc">Dfpc</a> 02:08, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I favor KEEP or MERGE with <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophile_activism.html" title="Pedophile activism">Pedophile Activism</a> and/or <a href="../../../n/e/t/Net_Neutrality_1a75.html" title="Net Neutrality">Net Neutrality</a>. So far, I've seen calls for verifyability, notability, and WP:WEB. The article is vastly improved on both counts since its first version, but can always use more improvement. As long as the Net Neutrality factor exists, the notability standard is met and the WP:WEB is less of a factor. After that dies down, merging may be in order. In an article on a topic like this, NPOV is a risk with every edit, but the community will take care of this. I've also seen a few comments that this article violates WP:NO_EVIL. In part, this can be addressed by expanding it to Free Spirits and including material about how Law Enforcement and others use Free Spirits as an example in training and policy materials. I started this process by adding a "BoyChat and Free Spirits citations in the press, academia, and policy-making" section. I think Xavier might have a few useful things to add to that section. As for GirlChat, at the time, neither it nor BoyChat met the notability criteria. I missed the GirlChat content, but I hope some of it was salvaged for related topics. <a href="../../../d/f/p/User%7EDfpc_1ac6.html" title="User:Dfpc">Dfpc</a> 02:08, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>In addition to the NOT EVIL concerns I mention above, the article also does not in any way assert the notability of its subject. It's not enough to simply cite third-party references; an explanation of why this topic is notable is necessary. Reading this article, my biggest question is "So what? Why is this important enough for an encyclopedia article?" <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> <sup><small><small><a href="../../../l/t/p/User_talk%7ELtPowers_d522.html" title="User talk:LtPowers">T</a></small></small></sup> 15:27, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Question</b> for long-time Wikipedians: What is the proper way to start an article for the now-mostly-online phenomenon of "Pedophile Peer Support" as distinct from "Pedophile Activism" or "Pedophile Peer Therapy." This article encompasses the non-activism aspects of NAMbLA, such as their prisoner-letter-writing program, pure support online resources such as <a href="http://www.cblf.org" class="external text" title="http://www.cblf.org" rel="nofollow">Christian Boylove Forum</a>, and real-world and online-world ways and means that pedophiles use to support each other. In this context I include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephebophile" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephebophile" rel="nofollow">ephebophiles</a> in countries where they are not socially tolerated, which is most of the world. Such an article would encompass BoyChat's and <a href="http://www.annabelleigh.net" class="external text" title="http://www.annabelleigh.net" rel="nofollow">GirlChat</a>'s peer-support roles, but would not necessarily encompass their place in the <a href="../../../n/e/t/Net_Neutrality_1a75.html" title="Net Neutrality">Net Neutrality</a> debate, the use of BoyChat as a law-enforcement or pedophile-awareness educational tool, or any other role. For the most part, BoyChat could be merged into this topic. <a href="../../../d/f/p/User%7EDfpc_1ac6.html" title="User:Dfpc">Dfpc</a> 03:01, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>True enough. However, that does mean I do not try to look at things objectively. On the Talk page you mentioned you planned to enrich this article if it passes the deletion vote. Assuming the fact you are adding are verifiable from public sources and in keeping with Wikipedia content policies, they should improve the article overall.

<li>Are you saying Jim Burton is a single-purpose account? I checked his Contribs history, he's been around since September '06. True, he's focused on pedophile issues, with less than a handful of edits on other subjects, but if he is an SPA it's pedophilia-related material in general not BoyChat in particular. It could just be that Mr. Burton has a strong interest in editing this material. His page calls himself "Neutrality Editor on Wikipedia." Calling an established account a "SPA" without explaining why hurts ones credibility. <a href="../../../d/f/p/User%7EDfpc_1ac6.html" title="User:Dfpc">Dfpc</a> 21:10, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Consensus not reached, article is new and deserves a chance</b> Scanning through the above it looks like there is a strong majory, somewhere in the 60-80% range, who favor deletion. Some of the votes both ways appear to be okay with some form of merge or redirect. However, there are enough Keep's around who haven't agreed to a merge or deletion that it's fair to say there is no consensus. My personal recommendation: keep the article for a few months, if necessary revisit the keep/delete/merge/redirect issue and refer back to this archived discussion in the next go-around, if there is one. It is likely that over the next few months, the issues that prompted this AfD will change. Notably, pardon the pun, BoyChat's relatively low notability outside its own community, particularly with respect to <a href="../../../n/e/t/Net_Neutrality_1a75.html" title="Net Neutrality">Net Neutrality</a> is likely to either go up if the case gains publicity or down if it fades into the history books, making it either clearly notable or not notable. The other reasons for notability, such as use in law-enforcement training, are also relatively low but are not likely to change quickly. The issues with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Neutral Point of View</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a> are VERY likey to be improved given a few months' time.

No consensus was reached, although there was a small contingent of users who supported keeping the articles on China and the European Union and deleting the rest. In a <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Russia_as_a_major_power_4519.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Russia as a major power">second AfD</a> in July, the articles on Russia, Brazil, and Japan were deleted as largely original research, leaving China, India, and the European Union, which consensus seems to be should be kept for now.</p>
<p>I hereby nominate United Kingdom as a major power based on its similarity to those articles deleted in July.

<dd>The implication of the comment above is that even though the band is not notable (and therefore does not meet explicit wikipedia guidelines), it is important to "share their story somewhere" because they don't have a website. In other words, the user wants to use the wikipedia entry as a website or "substitute myspace page" rather than as an objective, third-party-generated article about something that is notable. Many editors mistakenly believe that wikipedia is an appropriate venue to promote new acts or generate attention/buzz about something that is not <i>yet</i> notable. This is not the case. Also, please note that it is considered good form to end each post with four tildas (this thing ~) to add a signature, even if you are unregistered.--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5">Dmz5</a> 00:53, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>He never said this once, I think he meant because of CT's strange performance style it's important to have these exploits as a resource. There are far more trivial things on Wikipedia. If the band were very concerned about internet publicity I suspect they would have got to work on that years ago. Fans such as myself don't expect any further publicity from a wikipedia article and frankly just think the weird shit they do should be accounted for for documentation's sake at least, which again, doesn't hurt anything. The idea of commercial success equaling notability falls short to categorize things that could be considered art or conceptual exploration. Please note that this band does not sell records, does not have any label affiliation and has only produced profit for the sake of charity: the WP:MUSIC guidelines certainly seem applicable to the majority of music acts but here I feel that they fail to define importance or noteriety. 68.58.153.227 08:24, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> with cleanup to make it more than an advertisement. The thing that I think makes the company notable is the shock value of the name.

<li>Let me get this straight. You rent a car, practically trash it, then expect the rental agency to take it back (with the damage covered by the CDW, presumably), and not <i>one</i> insurance or rental agent or rental car company lawyer calls you out on this obvious violation of contract? Many rental cars are equipped with GPS tracking and you'll get nailed with fees if you take a car off road. Rental car companies are somewhat <b>noted</b> for nailing people for fees on even minor contract infractions, let alone nearly trashing a vehicle. <i>to acheive this form of gladin you must drive down the Alaskan Highway at high speeds (100+MPH)</i> Yeah, right.

<li><b>Delete</b> - This is not only not a sport and destructive of our vanishing natural resources, not to mention destructive of private rental property, it is damaging to the people who do offroad responsibly and follow the "Tread Lightly" offroading philosophy that encourages the protection of wild areas for future enjoyment. It damages the reputation of offroad clubs and groups that go out and clear trails, pick up trash and take good care of the wild areas of our country. Another thing including this article does is damage Wikipedia. When young, bored and incompetent people can come on Wikipedia and post up their irresponsible behavior then a precident is set and Wikipedia becomes a version of MySpace or YouTube to post up ever escalating versions of destructive "one-upsmanship." Wikipedia needs to be cautious about its reputation as it will soon be facing competition. Wikipedia is already suffering slights to its credibility and doesn't need spoiled grown children to further trash its intellectual stock. Should this article stand, I will cease to use Wikipedia. I can't in conscience use a website that promotes wantonly destructive behavior while promoting itself as an intellectual resource. Oh, and hope some kids don't find this article, commit the same acts and the parents hire a lawyer. Must watch what you put on the net these days. Qwiksilver 20:02, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You have come to the wrong place for a rant. Wikipedia does not and has not endorsed any activity whatsoever. Adding an article to wikipedia, whether its illegal or not, has nothing to do with endorsement.

<li><b>Comment</b>:Wonderful teacher, good with freshmen, but notable I'd say mainly as a teacher rather than as a researcher. He's taught MIT's very influential intro linear algebra course for decades, IIRC; Proftest doesnt take into account people who have influenced a vast number of undergraduates like that.

<dd>Deciding to vote <b>Strong Keep</b>: following GRBerry's intervention below. <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> clearly states that if the author has published a notable work that is "prescribed as a textbook, a reference work, or required reading in an undergraduate- or graduate- level course; which is not taught, designed, or otherwise overseen by the author; at several independent accredited universities", then the individual is notable. Mattuck's introduction to Analysis is a standard textbook for (difficult-ish) first courses in undergrad analysis. In particular, <a href="http://www.math.cornell.edu/Courses/Textbooks/fa06.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.math.cornell.edu/Courses/Textbooks/fa06.html" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>, <a href="http://www.math.luc.edu/academics/booksF06/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.math.luc.edu/academics/booksF06/" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>, <a href="http://www.math.luc.edu/academics/booksS06/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.math.luc.edu/academics/booksS06/" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>, <a href="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/hpollats/m301descr_06.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/hpollats/m301descr_06.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>, and literally <i>dozens</i> of others. I cant believe I didnt think of this earlier. This explains why most academics notable as good teachers do eventually meet wp:prof - they tend to write good textbooks that are prescribed. I'd urge the closing admin to note that this realisation comes a little late in the deletion process. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 04:51, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Minor nitpicks: I don't know how often that really happens that good teachers end up writing textbooks. Often I don't think they do. Also, your first link shows that Mattuck's book is actually used for the easy analysis class (311), not the "difficult-ish" one, which is 413. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 05:00, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I suspect that he does meet <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>, but can't see the evidence on Google Scholar. His primary work would be in the pre-Web era, so I don't know how much would be on line. (I remember a line from one of my fellow students - in Math, if you haven't done anything particularly noticable by age 25, you won't, and he was a tenured professor when there were only 100 web servers in the world.) I never had him as a professor, taking the theoretical variants of calculus, while he was a teacher for the applied variant. I thought the book with 256 cites would put him over the top, but that one is by his brother and his name appears as a thank you in the intro. His textbook does appear in 74 libraries, so it may meet the textbook test of WP:PROF, but I can't prove it. <a href="http://worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/oclc/39235704" class="external autonumber" title="http://worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/oclc/39235704" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 05:41, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: He has done high-quality research early on in his career, much better than many of the mediocre mathematicians put on Wikipedia simply because of some bias like nationality. Unfortunately, if this time around, people are going to apply some kind of stringent requirement to him, he probably fails, as his interests have switched a long time ago to educaation and service rather than purely research. And that kind of thing is harder to document notability in, unless he has won some teaching awards or the like. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 11:36, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b> - I agree that this article needs work. That is why the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Cocktails_78a4.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Cocktails">WikiProject Cocktails</a> has it flagged for improvement. As it <i>clearly</i> states on the articles talk page, the Project members are currently working on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Cocktails_78a4.html#Cleanup" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Cocktails">cleaning up and improving</a> a large number of articles. <b>This one certainly qualifies as one worthy of keeping, and improving.</b> Despite the fact that some may not have heard of this particularly showy drink, and despite the tone of the article (which I personally find highly irritating), the drink is very notable and rather unique. It could be argued that 50% or more of the various cocktail-related articles could be condensed down to a recipe. This is one cocktail that certainly could not qualify for that. First, the method of preparation is quite complicated and potentially dangerous. Second, the physics of the drink is included, making it remarkably interesting (despite the tone) compared to the hundreds of other drink articles I've been reading through. We have requested that everyone relax and let the Project members do their work on these articles without deleting them until we have had a chance to do whatever it is we need to do with them to make Wikipedia better. In many cases, that will be requesting deletion <i>AFTER</i> we merge the useful information into other articles (and figuruing out the best place to move it to is partly why it takes time). This is one article that I doubt would ever be considered for deletion due to the wonderful uniqueness of the drink AND its notability. Just because few people order one and suffer the effects of such a hideous drink does not mean it is not notable. Verifiability should be easy to do, but again, it takes time to sift through several hundred articles with a small team of people working on it. Instead of deleting clearly tagged <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Cocktails_78a4.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Cocktails">WikiProject Cocktails</a> articles while we are actively in this <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Cocktails_78a4.html#Cleanup" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Cocktails">Cleanup Project</a>, consider pitching in and helping us improve them.

<dd>So, it would appear that after a quick 3-page search of google, there is definitely a drink (and fairly popular according to 1001 Cocktails) called a <b>Backdraft</b>. The ingredients, manner of preparation and presentation vary, and I could not find the exact methods mentioned in this article. However, it is still a fairly interesting cocktail, and with work (that I will be happy to do between now and <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_28.html" title="February 28">February 28</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>, which is the deadline for completing the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Cocktails_78a4.html#Cleanup" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Cocktails">Cleanup Project</a>), it could be a good article.

Many wonderful people have done that before, and it has really been a benefit. However, there is more to this drink than a simple recipe. One thing I am considering is merging several smaller articles into one larger one discussing flaming cocktails and using specific examples. This article (with work) would fit that bill, but we need the extra time to complete this process. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillscrlt_a1d7.html" title="User:Willscrlt">Willscrlt</a> 15:31, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That would work. I tend to think that a cocktail needs to have something notable about it to be listed in Wikipedia. All else that can be verified can go to Wikibooks. If a case can be made that this cocktail is part of a larger notable method, then by all means <b>keep</b> in Wikipedia somewhere. Cheers. --<a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowrealisreal_0e4e.html" title="User:Howrealisreal">Howrealisreal</a> 15:49, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with you. Admittedly, the majority of people researching drinks are doing so specifically to find a recipe. That's great. We can easily point them to the complete recipe archive in Wikibooks. However, a brief very listing of ingredients is actually helpful for distinguishing between the various drinks, much as the mollecular weight and other identifying aspects of a chemical compound or the characters in a film. Yes, Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not a cookbook</a>, but that does not mean it must exclude all references to the component ingredients that identify a particular beverage. What <i>is</i> important is that the article must be <i>more</i> than just a recipe or process by which to make the drink. The article should focus on the cultural and historical nature of the drink, for that is what exerts the notability of the drink. This particular drink is notable, I'm fairly sure, but the article is poorly written and does a lousy job of explaining or proving that. If it cannot be proved within a reasonable time, then deletion is one logical decision. I am not arguing with the deletion process; I am just concerned about the timing of this (and other) deletions in cocktail-related articles.

<dd>I never meant to claim that the Project should have any impact on the perceived value of an article. The article must be able to stand on its own just as any other article in the Wikipedia. I'm sorry if anything I said appeared to indicate otherwise. All I am requesting is a little time (and a definite time at that) in which to complete the research and improvement of this and the other articles on which the Project members are working. At the completion of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Cocktails_78a4.html#Cleanup" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Cocktails">WikiProject Cocktails Cleanup Project</a>, if it turns out that this article is still substandard, the Project will nominate the article (along with many other articles) for deletion and will offer no objection to deletion at that time. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillscrlt_a1d7.html" title="User:Willscrlt">Willscrlt</a> 01:07, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The quality of an article is not really a basis for deletion or retention. It is all about encyclopedic value. A well-written and well researched article can still fail the policies and guidelines for inclusion, while a poorly drafted article can still meet the criteria for inclusion. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 20:30, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed. An article that requires three pages to print, is witty, provocative, titilating, and enjoyable to read about my right foot still does not belong in the Wikipedia no matter how important that appendage might be to me personally nor how well I write the article. The <a href="../../../b/a/c/Backdraft_%28drink%29.html" title="Backdraft (drink)">Backdraft (drink)</a> is a fairly notable drink (not in the same league as a <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martini.html" title="Martini">Martini</a> or a <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_Island_Iced_Tea_eb7e.html" title="Long Island Iced Tea">Long Island Iced Tea</a>, but then few drinks are. As long as the notability, popularity, and relevance of the drink can be established, and hopefully the tone quality of the written article is improved, I think the article deserves to be saved. Again, all I am asking is the time to figure out if that can be done through research (no, not "original research", but researching what's already out there). Come February 28th, if the article does not meet standards, I will be happy to nominate its deletion myself, because by then I will have had the opportunity to do the research necessary to make that determination and update the article or salvage any useful bits if that is more appropriate. It is not the deletion of the article for which I am objecting, but the haste in which the decision is being made. Just give the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Cocktails_78a4.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Cocktails">WikiProject Cocktails</a> members the time to complete their work and help improve Wikipedia overall within our area of concentration.

<li><b>Delete</b> couldn't disagree more with the above. Reality contestants are certainly not inherently notable. Passive viewing by lots of people is irrelevant.

<li>I simply disagree, and thanks for citing <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>; I would advise the same: <i><b>Notable</b> actors and television personalities who have appeared in well-known films or television productions.</i> Reality show contestants don't meet that standard. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 13:32, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As they're quite notable, reaching the standard that WP:BIO requests for "notable...television personalities," it absolutely qualifies. You can disagree, but you're disagreeing with the guideline. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 14:02, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>No they certainly do not and insisting that your reading is indisputably correct in the face of clear disagreement from a number of editors is silly. Anyway, whatever - we disagree and that's fine.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. I cannot agree more with <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a>. Most so-called "reality" shows are nothing but prime-time overblown game shows. While the pool of contestants might be smaller, unless the person has won really big or done other things beyond being on the game show, reality show losers are really no more notable than the person who didn't win the <a href="../../../s/h/o/Showcase_Showdown_%28The_Price_Is_Right%29_bb09.html" title="Showcase Showdown (The Price Is Right)">Showcase Showdown</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> I would like to clarify something. I said weak keep because I believe Sara meets the criteria for WP:BIO, but just barely. It says that notability can be established through multiple non-trivial works, which Sara has done. I also believe Sara meets the criteria for "notable actors and personalities in well-known films and televison productions," which says that notability can be established through a large fan base and name recognition (which are both something Sara would meet). The comparison of reality contestants to contestants on <a href="../../../j/e/o/Jeopardy%21.html" title="Jeopardy!">Jeopardy!</a> or <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Price_is_Right_eae9.html" title="The Price is Right">The Price is Right</a> would seem logical for some reality contestants, but in Sara's case, it's not. <a href="../../../e/l/c/User%7EElcda0_03b8.html" title="User:Elcda0">Elcda0</a> 15:53, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, most of the article is unverified speculation. The dates given for the generation are unverified speculation, the sources on the camera technology has to do with speculation related to the 360 only and is therefore no source at all, making the camera information unverified speculation, and the timing of any attempt by Apple to enter the market and therefore what generation a console by the company would belong to is not known, making that unverified speculation. This bascally leaves the article with the only verified information that a PS4 will exist and that a next-gen Nintendo console will include high definition.

<li><b>Delete</b> While i am a fan of video game consoles, i agree with the points stating that it is far to early to create an article on a generation of consoles that haven't even been released yet, and will not be until the distant future. Given the article is based on <i>History</i> of gaming consoles, it seems to me ridiculous to classify yet-to-be released consoles within a history-based article.

<li><b>Keep</b> - per <a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase T</a>.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> - I initially thought this page was a bit pointless - I thought it was just ropey speculation about stuff that doesn't exist yet - but it's got sourced statements and there definitely is some useful content. The gaming companies are already planning ahead to the next-gen and as time goes on more and more solid facts will arise. Cut out or source the more ropey speculation about names and particularly speculation about Apple - there's barely any evidence at all for an Apple console. <a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESum0_5bbc.html" title="User:Sum0">Sum0</a> 20:00, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong neutral</b> There's no doubt that there will be another generation of consoles, so this article will eventually have content and importance.

<dd>Gaming companies plan their next system many years in advance. By having this article readers will know what information is available. We will not know everything for sure until these systems are released, but we can mention they companies have planned.

<dd>Except that this page is not needed to get that information. There is nothing wrong with the pages on Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft including what little information is known about next-gen systems. This page, however, will never consist of more than idle speculation for several years and therefore goes against the crystal ball policy. Besides, I think a member of the general public looking for this information has no idea what "generation" of systems we are currently in and is more likely to look on the company pages anyway. When the generation exists, or at the very least has taken a concrete form, then we can have this page. An enclyclopedia is about facts, not rumormongering. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 04:35, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>According to <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>, future events should only be included if the event is notable, is almost certain to take place, is verifiable, and is not original research. The eighth generation of video game consoles is notable, and it is almost certain to come about, so we just have to make sure to include verifiable sources and exclude original research from this article.</dd>
<dd>I don't think an article being hard to find is grounds to remove it, but we can make redirects from "Xbox 720," "Xbox 3," "PS4," "PlayStation 4" Playstation 4," and "Wii 2" to this article until there is enough information available on the individual systems to warrant separate pages. Also, if we let this article remain Google will index it, allowing this article to show up in Google searches for the queries "Xbox 720," "Playstation 4," and "Wii 2." Many users of the internet use Wikipedia as a primary source for information as it is much easier to find information on Wikipedia than it is to search through a bunch of web pages for it. <a href="../../../j/e/c/User%7EJecowa_587b.html" title="User:Jecowa">Jecowa</a> 05:12, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In which case, wouldn't an article of this sort be better suited in a <b>Future of video games consoles</b>? The current title and significant quantities of the information are, as stated in above arguements, speculated, and are of little or no use to someone reading it, given the information could completely change when we reach closer to this generation. When we have some concrete information about this generation, i would support such an article, but again along the lines of <b>Future of video game consoles</b>. I may have even supported a rename of the article if there was less speculation and more concrete information. <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBungle44_50ba.html" title="User:Bungle44">Bungle44</a> 09:26, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I would support a movement of the current article to a title which doesn't portray the information as past tense (e.g: Future of..). However, speculated information (such as some console names and dates) should be removed, even if that leaves only a stub of information which is at least verifyable and can be confirmed. As for those who say changing the name of the article would disrupt the sequence, I would much rather support an article with a name that reflects the information contained within it, as opposed to an article name which is misleading (History of), with content which is of the complete opposite. <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBungle44_50ba.html" title="User:Bungle44">Bungle44</a> 13:24, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Yeah, I see how the word "History" in the title would confuse people. Maybe we should move it to "Future of video game consoles" like Bungle44 suggested. It would make the History of videogame consoles infobox more clear to have generations of the past labeled "History" while the generation of the future is labeled "Future." Maybe along those lines we should also move "History of video game consoles (seventh generation)" to "Presence of video game consoles (seventh generation)"</dd>

I still support deletion of the article, but maybe a rename with unverifyable information removed might be a fair outcome.

<li>Its not all speculation, its not even half speculation. with the exception of the names, the entry on the Wii 2 is pure fact along with the one on the PS4. the speculation that is included is backed up with 2 or more sources. the names aren't speculation as no one is saying they will be called by these names. all the article says is that these are names that are being used for the systems at present. If i were to include all the speculation you guys seem to think is in this thing it would be longer than the one on the Wii.<a href="../../../j/2E/l/User%7EJ.L.Main_6c6b.html" title="User:J.L.Main">J.L.Main</a> 22:10, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

The entire article is pure speculation, no one knows what can happen a year from now, much less 7 years from now. I remember when Nintendo said the Gamecube would be their last console, and now we have the Wii. I remember when Sega said Dreamcast would not be their last console, but that certainly changed when the PS2 launched. <a href="../../../d/i/o/User%7EDionyseus_52e5.html" title="User:Dionyseus">Dionyseus</a> 22:22, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>first, i have moved the article to "Future of..." and i checked all of the pages that link to it. if i broke some rule than i'm sorry and will be happy to put it back if i did. second, Dionysius, you just dislike me, it has nothing to do with the article, but i will humor you anyway. it has already been agreed by every user on here but you that this is not crystal balling. it is well sourced and verifiable. And when a company says that they will do something it is not speculation for you or me to then turn around and tell someone what the company said it would do. also, speculation can not be done on fact. that is to say, i would not be speculating if i said the sun is going to rise to marrow. It wouldn't be specializing because we all know the sun is going to rise tomorrow. The statement "the Eighth Generation will start at the completion of the Seventh" is a fact, not crystal balling. if you don't believe me than go read the article on it.<a href="../../../j/2E/l/User%7EJ.L.Main_6c6b.html" title="User:J.L.Main">J.L.Main</a> 22:35, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Far too many things can change in what we currently have many years until we can at least expect concrete information as to whether these consoles are going to be developed, and who by.

As stated in previous comments, the article should remain non-existant until we are well into the current console generation, when there is more of a likely chance that external sources (and console creators for that matter), have a better idea of whether they are going to participate or not, and with which consoles. <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBungle44_50ba.html" title="User:Bungle44">Bungle44</a> 17:23, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Keep</b> Regarding the crystal ball, "Individual scheduled or expected future events should only be included if the event is notable and almost certain to take place. If preparation for the event isn't already in progress, speculation about it must be well documented. Examples of appropriate topics include 2008 U.S. presidential election, and 2012 Summer Olympics. By comparison, the 2028 U.S. presidential election and 2036 Summer Olympics are not considered appropriate article topics because nothing can be said about them that is verifiable and not original research. A schedule of future events may also be appropriate." It's notable, certain to happen, and there is certainly preparation going on.

</dl>
<ul>
<li>On the term: the cycle has been known "forever", but does not appear to have had a proper name. Karl Palmen needed a name to refer to this particular cycle so he invented one; mind that originally we called the article "fumocy" but that was changed to "full moon cycle" just because the term was not well known, even though the cycle is. A similar example: the term <a href="../../../s/n/o/Snowclone.html" title="Snowclone">snowclone</a> was recently minted on an on-line forum to describe an existing phenomenon, got an article on Wikipedia, which was submitted for deletion, but apparently prevailed. I propose to separate issues with using a neologism, from the subject and its Wikipedia article itself.</li>
<li>On original research: The variation in the apparent size of the Moon has been discussed in recent popular-astronomy publications as referenced in the article. The latter part of the "full moon cycle" article on using the cycle to more accurately predict the syzygies is recent "original" work (application or invention rather than "research"), but that happened among some people on a mailing list and not in the context of the Wikipedia. So I ask these questions: what is considered research (as distinct from other original work) and when does it stop to be "original" and becomes acceptable to each and every editor on Wikipedia?</li>
<li>On acceptance: googling shows many rip-offs from Wikipedia. Of potential relevance to this discussion is that the article has been translated into several other languages, so obviously several people found it of sufficient interest to bother doing a translation. The first non-wikipedia use of the term that I found was <a href="http://individual.utoronto.ca/kalendis/hebrew/suggest.htm" class="external free" title="http://individual.utoronto.ca/kalendis/hebrew/suggest.htm" rel="nofollow">http://individual.utoronto.ca/kalendis/hebrew/suggest.htm</a>&#160;; admittedly that is on the website of a member of the same mailing list so he was familiar with the term; but again I think we should separate use of the neologism from the use of the cycle.</li>

<dd>Some popular literature is listed as such under Literature in the article, and referred by author and year within the article; the cycle seems to have remained unnamed until Karl Palmen started using a descriptive one. The ideas of applying the cycle to calendars and syzygies have been developed on the CALNDR-L mailing list, and can be retrieved from its listserver: LISTSERV@LISTSERV.ECU.EDU . To get the most relevant posts, send this message to that list server: "GETPOST CALNDR-L 15949 15950 15958 16044 16322 17855 17944 18058". To search for "fumocy" send the message: "SEARCH fumocy IN CALNDR-L"; since that is &gt;&gt; 100 posts, better specify a date range, e.g. "SEARCH fumocy IN CALNDR-L FROM 20030201 TO 20030228". You will find more material on Victor's website at <a href="http://www.the-light.com/cal/" class="external free" title="http://www.the-light.com/cal/" rel="nofollow">http://www.the-light.com/cal/</a> . We never bothered to try publish this in a paper journal: it is, as stated by a commentator, pretty obscure (the mailing list counts ~150 members), and electrons are so much cheaper than cellulose. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_Peters_0511.html" title="User:Tom Peters">Tom Peters</a> 01:17, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

Are there any verifiable sources (books, astronomy publications/journals for example) that refer to this cycle? If so, what do they call it? I don't see the popular literature you refer to. Are you talking about the references section? If so, aren't those references just being used as sources for two or three sentences and a table, as the article seems to indicate? <a href="../../../g/z/k/User%7EGzkn_c916.html" title="User:Gzkn">Gzkn</a> 07:31, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, the two Sky&amp;Telescope articles. The old one from Meeus discusses the <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anomalistic_month.html" title="Anomalistic month">anomalistic month</a> and its effects; the one from Sinnott notices the 413d = 14 lunation period in lunation lengths, but he does not name it. Already <a href="../../../k/i/d/Kidinnu.html" title="Kidinnu">Kidinnu</a> of 4th cy BC knew that 251 lunations form a more accurate cycle, I'll have to look up if older clay tablets containing the 14-month cycle have been preserved.</dd>
<dd>So can't we have an article about a cycle that is of some interest but has not (yet) received a commonly accepted name? The article actually was renamed from "fomocy" to the descriptive phrase "full moon cycle", and the Wikipdedia is full of such lemmata (which I deplore). Again, the use of this cycle to compute syzygies was original research, but took place outside of Wikipedia. So I think from a policy point of view the issues are: when does research stop to be original and is suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia; and what is an acceptable reference? Incidentally, the chance that any editor will publish a paper on this is zero, because they will Google, find all the stuff has been on-line for years and translated into several languages, and will accuse us of ripping off from Wikipedia. Anyway, I believe the NOR policy exists to help maintain NPOV and verifiability: and the contents of this article are not controversial, and can be verified by anyone with moderate arithmetic skills and the interest to follow the steps. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_Peters_0511.html" title="User:Tom Peters">Tom Peters</a> 09:30, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Remove all original research, or delete</b>. I do not have a problem with the content of this article, and I suspect that it is probably correct. Therein lies the problem, it is probably correct, but unverifiable unless one redoes the calculations himself. Nevertheless, it is wikipedia policy that encyclopedia entries should not contain original research, or even a synthesis of established facts (see <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No_original_research</a>). If this article was <i>only</i> a synthesis, I would not care, even though this goes against their policy. However, much what is written is describing new work, albeit, probably uncontroversial. Some of the work on <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lunar_phase.html" title="Lunar phase">lunar phase</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_moon.html" title="New moon">new moon</a>, and <a href="../../../f/u/l/Full_moon.html" title="Full moon">full moon</a> has similar concerns. I propose (1) removing all original material or deleting, and (2) I propose that the authors publish this somewhere. Publishing does not have to be in a scolarly journal, and could be in a popular journal like Sky and Telescope (as one example among many). Publishing might also mean a web site describing the calculations in more detail, but this would be more <i>gray</i>. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunokhod_6b37.html" title="User:Lunokhod">Lunokhod</a> 00:26, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I take issue. First, AFAIK the Wiki policy on original "research" serves to maintain a NPOV on possibly divergent opinions. The policy exists to prevent what is essentially an encyclopedia to be mis-used as a forum for discussion or propagation of certain opinions. Therefore there is no ground to declare that policy applicable to just any article that just applies well-known concepts and data in a verifiable manner to obtain some possibly new results. However I would agree that Wikipedia ALSO should not be a place to develop or publish uncontroversial but original work. But second, that is not the case in this instance: stuff was done in some on-line forum. So I repeat my question: when does new stuff stop to be "original" and becomes acceptable for Wikipedia? Also, I find your requirement that it be published in a paper journal (refereed or not) ludicrous in this Internet age. Third, those other articles you mention are off-topic here, but I do remark that it shows that you take the concept of "original research" much too far: those articles have some numerical expressions that have been derived from published sources by simple arithmetic (and in one case even bothers to explain the steps in some detail to help verify the result). Since when is doing multiplication and addition "original research" that threatens the NPOV character of Wikipedia? <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_Peters_0511.html" title="User:Tom Peters">Tom Peters</a> 10:32, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please read <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No_original_research</a>. There are three pillars to Wikipedia policy, No original research, neutral point of view, and verifiability. All material that could be questioned needs to be referenced. If you can not find a suitable reference, then this is a good indication that the first and third points are being violated. I also did not imply that material needs to be published in a scholarly journal: popular magazines or even a web site could be appropriate. The point is that the reader must be able to go to some form of "source" to find the details laid out in a coherent manner. As I said above, I suspect everything in this article is correct, it is just that it is the first time that it is being presented, and is therefore new. I quote from Wikipedia policy</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- I participated in much of the original research starting in 2002. I have not participated much in crafting this wikipedia article, because I'm not very comfortable with the format. Furthermore, I consider Tom Peters to be eloquent and thorough. By the way, in response to why this wasn't caught before -- it was. The entire article was deleted once before as I recall, and then restored after some discussion. If there was consensus to restore it before, what has changed to merit removal once again?</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding the comment that "full moon cycle" more commonly refers to something else, my response would be that the appropriate action would be not to remove this page but to add a disambiguation page forking to both meanings. The meaning described here is a valid meaning. If "full moon cycle" is not the appropriate term, then I ask (as I did in 2002) what the appropriate term is. The concept is clearly valid, confirmed, sound, and useful. As to the original research objection, there is a large volume of original research off of wikipedia. This article is not a forum to advance the original research. Rather, the original research was conducted off-list. Tom Peters and I did most of the analysis to design the procedure, numbers used, etc. TP's techniques were different from mine. We used different epochs, methods, etc. yet arrived at similar results. In other words, we confirmed each others' research. Publicatio was to the CALNDR-L email list, whose archives are available to subscribers. I think publication elsewhere is a good idea, and I will work on doing so as I have time. I will also post an archive of relevant discussions on CALNDR-L, if for no other purpose than to provide a usable citation to web references to this topic. Further suggestions on this are welcome. Victor Engel 17:18, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would not consider a list of emails on a listserver to be a publication; this material needs to be presented somewhere in a coherent manner. I think that a web site would be a first attempt, but this would not represent a consensus of the scientific community. For wikipedia, though, this might be ok: At least in this case one could honestly debate the issue. (The question of original research, which was the grounds for proposed deletion can not honestly be debated by anyone who has read wikipedia policy.) <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELunokhod_6b37.html" title="User:Lunokhod">Lunokhod</a> 17:42, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I think my viewpoint is harsher than Lunokhod's. Engel and Peters have effectively self-published their own results in an email list. This is not at all comparable to publication in a scientific journal, where the journal needs to agree that a paper's analysis is valid before publishing the paper. Placing their derivations on a personal website is also inappropriate, as this is still self-publciation. (I could write an external web page that says "the Moon is made of brie" and cite it in Wikipedia, but my web page would not be a valid, reliable reference in that case.) Moreover, the research needs to be critically reviewed. Two individuals that discussed their own derivations with each other could have made identical key errors in their derivations. Their derivations need to be rigorously evaluated by an anonymous third party to check for errors (just as scientific journal articles are refereed by anonymous scientists that are uninvolved with the research but knowledgable enough to comment on it). <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Submillimeter_7547.html" title="User:Dr. Submillimeter">Dr. Submillimeter</a> 20:40, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fine: Wikipedia is being peer-reviewed constantly, so why don't you just do that? As far as I am concerned, the whole project was to make the thing (finding the times of syzygies) "as simple as possible, but not simpler". It is not relativity theory. It is a simplification of well-established ephemeris procedures, all the details are there on the Wiki page, and earlier this year I elaborated on some of the (apparently non-obvious) steps in response to someone who studied the page and found it interesting enough to want to understand it. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_Peters_0511.html" title="User:Tom Peters">Tom Peters</a> 21:26, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps I should have mentioned that an implementation of this procedure has been online for some time. It is the new moon calculation for my 28/293 calendar at <a href="http://the-light.com/cal/ve28293.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://the-light.com/cal/ve28293.htm" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>. Unfortunately, I don't think all the code works properly in Firefox. Just click on a link on a new moon to see the calculations involved for that day. It uses a different epoc than Tom Peters' example, but that was just an example, as I see it, to help illustrate the discussion. Victor Engel 21:32, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I do not care about how long the implementation has been online.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a bad idea to get rid of such parties' articles. They should be kept and expanded with citations of their histories of violence and anti-liberty rhetoric. Sunshine hurts.

<p>I looked around, and there doesn't seem to be anything notable about this award. The <a href="http://wampum.wabanaki.net" class="external text" title="http://wampum.wabanaki.net" rel="nofollow">site</a> that hosts the awards pulls in a 1,376,468 on <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwampum.wabanaki.net" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwampum.wabanaki.net" rel="nofollow">Alexa</a>, and I have not found any non-trivial coverage of the award outside of the blogosphere.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a part of the blogosphere -- and things in the blogosphere are NOT <i>a priori</i> non-notable -- that draws 134,000 Google hits. And I fail to see the relevance of the award's website to the significance of the award, since the website isn't what's under discussion. For example, traffic ranking for "pulitzer.org" (for the <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulitzer_Prize_e802.html" title="Pulitzer Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>) only hits 170,449, "themanbookerprize.com" (for the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Man_Booker_Prize_c5b1.html" title="Man Booker Prize">Man Booker Prize</a> hits 283,803, and "mysterywriters.org/pages/awards" (for the <a href="../../../e/d/g/Edgar_Allan_Poe_Award_7e7e.html" title="Edgar Allan Poe Award">Edgar Allan Poe Award</a>) hits 830,450.

<dd><b>Comment</b>, it only pulled in a little over 500 unique Google hits, and they were almost exclusively surrounding discussion within the blogosphere. I haven't seen a claim of notability made, it doesn't look as though the award has been subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself, it doesn't seem to have won an award itself, and it doesn't seem to be distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster.

<dd>Unique Google hits are only calculated on the first 1000 Gogle hits, and are thus a near worthless indicator of net existence for any search term that gets more than a 1,000 results (like this one clearly does).

<li><b>Delete</b>. Lack of reliable sources indicates that the "award" has achieved no prominence in the real world beyond a handful of blogs.

We don't change the notability rules just because there are a few searches about him for a few days. Part of our <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability rules</a> is to ask "will anyone care about this person in another 100 years?".

<li>Verifiable? So how widespread must the meme be before it is accepted? 10 users recognizing it? 100? 1000? 1000000? You cannot draw such "lines in the water". You must have something concrete. So many times have i seen people ask what someone meant with "run your boy", and thats why i initially created the wiki article.

<p>which I hereby all nominate for <b>deletion</b>. While I recognize the enormous effort Smbarnzy has made, the level of detail is both unprecedented and unencyclopedic. There are no external sources whatsoever given for any of these articles, and while the Aquinas College sources may be accurate enough, this lack of secondary sources may serve as a sign for the lack of notability of the information. As an extreme example, most of the Academic Studies article is a list of the subjects students may choose to take in grades 10-12. If there is anything extraordinary in this list (such as, say, "Religious Formation"), the article offers no information about it (while the main <a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquinas_College%2C_Perth_1a25.html" title="Aquinas College, Perth">Aquinas College</a> article does). Concerning a possible merge, I feel that for each of the topics the main article already contains an adequate summary. <a href="../../../h/u/o/User%7EHuon_18c0.html" title="User:Huon">Huon</a> 14:20, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> while I recognise that <a href="../../../h/u/o/User%7EHuon_18c0.html" title="User:Huon">User:Huon</a> has acceptible/valid reasons for requesting deletion, some of these articles are expandable to encompass more than just Aquinas College. Merging back into Aquinas College isnt an option as these are the result of stripping Aquinas College down from this version <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aquinas_College%2C_Perth&amp;oldid=93790646" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aquinas_College%2C_Perth&amp;oldid=93790646" rel="nofollow">diff</a> only a couple of hours before they were nominated for deletion. I had just suggested User:Gnangarra/Aquinas as a way forward for the Aquinas article to those editors, that included making these daughter articles. In this case <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> should also be considered and give the editors time to address <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> reqiurements. <a href="../../../g/n/a/User%7EGnangarra_faa9.html" title="User:Gnangarra">Gnangarra</a> 23:18, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom, no merge. The material in these articles is likely verifiable only at the school's website and other outlets associated with the school itself (e.g. the Hockey Club website). Information that can only be verified at primary sources should, in general, not be included at Wikipedia. External sources must take note of any information before we consider it notable enough for inclusion here. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 23:27, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Keep, Merge &amp; Delete</b></s> - If you think the page should be deleted then merge it into the Aquinas College, Perth page.

<li>I am willing to accept that some of these articles may be deleted. But i think four of them must be kept; boarding, infrastructure, house system and most importantly sport. All others can be merged back into the main article. But to the person who put them up for deletion - "Doesnt the article look alot better with all of the daughter articles? it makes it look encyclopedic and well groomed. Please re-consider on those 4 i suggested, AT BARE MINIMUM. Thanks =) <a href="../../../s/m/b/User%7ESmbarnzy_fe50.html" title="User:Smbarnzy">Smbarnzy</a> 12:42, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>'<i>strong merge</i>. Looking at the must keeps listed,keeping would require that these particular spects of A.C. be notable in their own right--for example, if their house system was a precdent for many other schools &amp; this had been discussed by 3rd party sources. This is obviously not the case, and no such assertions are made. They are just lists of the names similar in organization to all similar places. Even the school's stength, sports,--it lists in detai every single team, giving the record year byt year, even those that have never made it beyond 5th place. This is absurd. WP has a separate article for Ohio State athletics, and I suggest that OSU is about what it would take to justify such an article. As a closer comparison, Rugby doesn't have one--it's just in the main article. <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 01:29, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Although i thank you for recognising that i have made alot of effort here, i would like to clear up one point: i have added alot of content to the Aquinas College Page, i practically added all of it.

<li><b>Keep</b> These articles are essentially valuable, athough the academic one is too focused, i think the rest should be kept. They are a valuable resource and by deleting them you are not encouraging this new user to keep editing and making new pages. Keep them. And if the decision is to delete them, them atleast keep the sport page, that had been up for some time, and is quite extensive. If all get deleted, then merge back to Aquinas Page. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/m/b/User%7ESmbarnzy_fe50.html" title="User:Smbarnzy">Smbarnzy</a> (<a href="../../../s/m/b/User_talk%7ESmbarnzy_6a65.html" title="User talk:Smbarnzy">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Smbarnzy_651f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Smbarnzy">contribs</a>) 08:13, December 15, 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Keep and merge where possible</b> - agree strongly with Gnangarra's comments. Obviously not all of these areas requires an article, but that should be discussed on the talk pages of the articles concerned rather than sent straight to AfD. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 08:51, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Merge wherever possible</b>, there's way too much detail here, but also a lot of stuff that can probably be kept. Use all this info to make <a href="../../../a/q/u/Aquinas_College%2C_Perth_1a25.html" title="Aquinas College, Perth">Aquinas College, Perth</a> a featured article, or something. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankiveil_3447.html" title="User:Lankiveil">Lankiveil</a> 05:16, 16 December 2006 (UTC).</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The more detail the better. If they can be merged into the parent fine. But the topic deserves an articles so these sub articles fall more into the realm of editorial discussion than deletion. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 22:04, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

"Just a listing of podcasts having to do with F1. Too specific a topic to ever have a decent article on." And other area's of Wiki are any different? Folk's are very eager to delete information, but why not try to increase the wiki by adding to it. This page is a legitimate page, has legitimate information, just not much of it. So why don't you add some instead of deleting it, right..??? <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMaltadawes_08db.html" title="User:Maltadawes">maltadawes</a> 22:00, 13 December 2006 (EST)</p>

<li>Yes, other areas are different. I don't want to add to it because I don't think it's a good idea for an article but even if I did, there probably aren't many more F1 podcasts that exist, which is why I'm saying it's too specific. <a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecury_0e54.html" title="User:Recury">Recury</a> 14:22, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Alexa rank is unreliable and easily faked (like getting visitors to download the Alexa toolbar). Google searching the site itself <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=link%3Awww.i-am-bored.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=link%3Awww.i-am-bored.com" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> shows a way too low count for this rank, proving the Alexa rank is very inflated. Wikipedia policy says google hits and Alexa rank are not great enough indicators to keep sites per WP:WEB, only to exclude them and Wikipedia goes based on WP:V and WP:RS, not popularity. Article has no reliable sources or anything for verifiability.

<p>Prod removed without comment. Supposedly a film. I can find no indication it even exists. Certainly appears never to have been released. Based on 15-minute length, and the plot summary involving orphans, communists, and a Ninja overseer who turns out to be a wizard, I'm guessing amateur production by very young filmmakers.

<p>I submitted this to proposed deletion, on the grounds that the article cited no sources, and there is no indication that the single movie prop mentioned was even called an ice helmet. The linked-to article doesn't even contain the word "helmet", and doesn't support this article at all. At the time, I also added a request for sources.

<p><br />
My comments - Tony Zirkle is mentioned on both the Wikipedia article about Representative Chris Chocola and appears to have been a topic of discussion within the Talk section. Within the talk section (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chris_Chocola#Tony_Zirkle" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chris_Chocola#Tony_Zirkle" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chris_Chocola#Tony_Zirkle</a>), Bachs states "If someone wanted to link to a Tony Zirkle wiki entry that lists all of his known political views that is fine".</p>
<p>You do not have to win to be notable for a political activity. Cite Wikipedia's <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> sub page on Candidates and Elections -- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Candidates_and_elections" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Candidates_and_elections" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Candidates_and_elections</a> -- "This is not a reason to delete candidate articles if the only problem is that the election article has yet to be written. Merger of the candidate articles into the election article may well improve Wikipedia."</p>
<p>Although the article is not as complete as I'd like it to be, it does provide preliminary documentation of Zirkle's views.</p>
<p>Also cite an "accepted" losing candidate page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Forchion" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Forchion" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Forchion</a> ~~ <a href="../../../j/c/l/User%7EJclayc_1021.html" title="User:Jclayc">jclayc</a> ~~</p>

<li>I'm on the fence. Ambient music has been around awhile, but it's still pretty obscure. It would be hard to prove even more well known musicians. Example, i just did a search for steve roach and it comes up with the same references cited in this article. But roach has been at it for 30 years and has several cd's. So, I'd say keep in maybe in a few years if this person is still around, but maybe not now. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.211.247.112_5619.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.211.247.112">71.211.247.112</a> (talk) 20:48, 18 December 2006 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> <s>The nominator has clarified that the AfD nomination is based, not on a POV fork, but on a personal religious disagreement witht the subject of the article. The nominator wants this article deleted because he believes that "Halakha is not a concern in Conservative Judaism," and has gone so far as to clarify that he believes that articles on "<i>decision-making bodies</i>", such as the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Committee_on_Jewish_Law_and_Standards_b696.html" title="Committee on Jewish Law and Standards">Committee on Jewish Law and Standards</a>, also "qualify for an extra speedy delete", not because they fail to meet <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, or other legitimate Wikipedia policy criteria, but because the nominator personally disagrees with them on religious grounds.

<li><b>Comment</b>: <a href="../../../f/r/u/User%7EFrummerThanThou_10f7.html" title="User:FrummerThanThou">User:FrummerThanThou</a>'s blanket statements, such as&#160;:"Conservative Judaism and Jews rely on traditional <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halacha.html" title="Halacha">Halacha</a> when they seek a ruling" and that they "are entirely dependant on Orthodox Jewish halachic decision-making bodies and rabbis for their ruling, when they seek one" reveal an utter lack of familiarity with the present-day Conservative movement and if anything only reveals the nominator's POV tilt (it's there if you know the issues well.) But it's all done by a kind of twisted faulty logic, which goes something like this: "Conservative Judaism uses Halakha like everyone else (meaning like the Orthodox, because the Reform don't use it at all) in that they 'rely' on the same (read: 'Orthodox') Halakhic books and rabbis in making decisions, which means that their 'Conservative Halakha' is really 'the same' as the standard (read: 'Orthodox') Halakha and should not be classed differently. Real-world issues and facts that the Conservatives dispute, such as accepting the Divine origins of the Torah, that it was given in its entirety by <a href="../../../n/a/m/Names_of_God_in_Judaism_474b.html" title="Names of God in Judaism">God</a> to <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moses.html" title="Moses">Moses</a> at Sinai, the sanctity and observing the <a href="../../../6/1/3/613_mitzvot.html" title="613 mitzvot">613 mitzvot</a>, and very up-to-date issues such as ordaining gay rabbis, are either not mentioned or overlooked, because, after all, the Conservatives do give official <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lip_service" class="extiw" title="wikt:lip_service">lip service</a> to (read: 'Orthodox') "Halakha" even though as the Conservatives go about their lives in reality they <b>neither</b> respect <b>nor</b> practice <i>any</i> Halakha the way <a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthodox_Judaism_0be8.html" title="Orthodox Judaism">Orthodox Judaism</a> does." The point here being, that one cannot at the same time do contrary functions: To <i>claim</i> absurdly that the Conservatives practice a Halakha that is also central to Orthodoxy at the same time that they (the Conservatives) openly and publicly break with the Halakah (as understood and practiced by Orthodoxy) and that is the very <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lifeblood" class="extiw" title="wikt:lifeblood">lifeblood</a> Orthodoxy -- but not of Conservatism since they are not bound by the <i>literal</i> strictures of the Halakha and the <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shulkhan_Arukh_691a.html" title="Shulkhan Arukh">Shulkhan Arukh</a> (how many Conservatives even know what the <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shulkhan_Arukh_691a.html" title="Shulkhan Arukh">Shulkhan Arukh</a> is or means?)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It is obvious from the above discussion, and particularly IZAK's comments, that Conservative Halaka is a different code than Orthodox Halaka, and that most people outside the Conservative branch of Judaism probably do intend Orthodox Halaka when they use the word Halaka. This proves the need for 2 separate articles. (There is also Reform H, let others say what they will). The two traditions have diverged, and one of them denies the legitimacy of the other--IZAK is not eccentric in saying this. But while he is entitled to his POV that only OH is legitimate, it is clearly a POV, and he has no right to try to impose it on a neutral encyclopedia. The name here can be shown to be what the movement itself uses, and that makes it the standard name.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I would use the name "Halaka" for the orthodox, traditional code. Not because it is necessarily the authentic code or tradition, for it is no business of WP to deny or affirm that. Rather, because when Halaka is used by itself outside Judaism, the traditional Halaka is what is intended and it is thus the standard name.</dd>
<dd>But two articles. It would otherwise be like discussing Australian and New Zealand Law in the same article. Considering the natureof this discussion, and the very intense religious meaning it has for many, I think i need to say that I haven't the least connection with any Jewish denomination. <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 01:50, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I will reinstate my position as somewhat more neutral then before but still for a stead fast <b>delete</b> as apposed to a <b>merge</b> or <b>rename</b>. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> has made me aware of a conservative rabbinical body I was previously unaware the role of in the Halachic field, but I have examined the article and its sources and am not swayed. I obviously can't nom this "halachic body" for deletion, since they seriously think themselves to be a halachic authority and made plenty of press releases which the press payed attention to which makes them notable in a crazy world. I still dont think, how ever crazy the world is, this body have established a Halachic doctrine that can call itself "Conservative Halacha". They have only made some rulings, allowances and decisions to keep their own boat afloat. It would take allot more off their behalf to establish a "Conservative halacha" then with their current activity.</li>

<li><b>comment</b>In response to Frummer's revised posting, I comment:</li>
</ul>
<p>It is a basic tenant of orthodox Judaism that there is only one Judaisim, and only one Halakah, and it is the one that they profess. Thus for them there can be no Conservative Halakah, or Conservative Judaism--the followers of these paths are heretics, though perhaps nearer to the true religion than Reform Halakah and Reform Judaism. The only people who believe this are Orthodox Jews. Whether or not they are in truth the only authentic tradition is a matter of faith. Conservative Judaism is quite clear that its traditions are equally old, are equally based on the same Revelation, and continue the tradition of earlier Jewish law--which, as Frummer knows very well and in more detail than I, has never been uniform.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>His argument is a statement of purely religious point of view--and in what I fear is the most inappropriate form, within and without WP--not letting others have their say in their own words.</dd>

<ul>
<li>Perhaps this is just an issue of semantics, but the reasoning that DGG is giving (i.e. "its traditions are equally old") is precisely why there is no such thing as "Conservative Halakha". Both the Orthodox and Conservative movements believe that they are following the same body of laws. The difference lies in each movement's respective interpretation of those laws. There is no such thing as Orthodox Halakha or Conservative Halakha -- only <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halakha.html" title="Halakha">Halakha</a>. This is a fundamental tenet of the Conservative movement. I stand by my original vote to rename. --<a href="../../../d/l/a/User%7EDLand_35ee.html" title="User:DLand">DLand</a><a href="../../../d/l/a/User_talk%7EDLand_38e8.html" title="User talk:DLand"><font color="green"><sup><small>TALK</small></sup></font></a> 23:49, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I second you DLand, also DGG claim that Conservative Judaism's traditions are "equally old" to Orthodox Judaism and "equally based on the same Revelation", and "continue the tradition of earlier Jewish law" are unfounded. The term "Conservative" in relation to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Judaism_e32a.html" title="Conservative Judaism">Conservative Judaism</a> has actualy nothing to do with "conserving", traditional Jewish beleif and Halakha.

<dd><b>Comment</b> My prior vote for <b>Keep</b> still stands, but given the general desire to merge or rename, if a merge is to be the outcome of this AfD, I believe the best place to merge would be <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_responsa.html" title="Conservative responsa">Conservative responsa</a>. The article title "Conservative responsa" acknowledges that the Conservative decision-making process is based on a different philosophy which in an important minority of cases results in different outcomes from the Orthodox approach, while sidestepping questions of the meaning of those differences. Whether Conservative Halakha is "the same" as Orthodox Halakha in some philoophical sense, Conservative responsa, the records and products of the decision-making process, are acknowledged as being different in a way that appears to be less controversial.

<dd><b>Keep</b>, the reason behind this request to delete is factually incorrect since Nintendo themselves revealed the existence of Metroid Dread, furthered by Nintendo reps who said it did not show up at E3, and further proven to be in existence by IGN and Nintendo magazines that claim it to still be in development.

<dd>Now, as an <b>artist</b>, I have a really hard time seeing how she qualifies for her own page. I could very well dig up a couple of articles on my little sister (she plays basketball on the local team) in the local newspaper, without it making her notable. Here's a question: what kind of notable personality is Sue Richards? Is she a publisher? A photographer? An event manager? She hardly seems notable in any of these fields. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperdix_7f51.html" title="User:Superdix">Superdix</a> 16:25, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

If multiple local papers have decided that your sister is notable enough to write an article with her as the main focus (i.e. non-trival mention), you probably have a strong case that she deserves her own article. Notability due to acheivement in a profession is only one criteria for a person to merit an article. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcscott_e3f9.html" title="User:Ccscott">Ccscott</a> 17:34, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I am aware that that is only one of the criteria. However, let's try to look at this reasonably. If we set standards that high for people within scientific professions, and even government officials, then how come a person who has been the publisher of a breast calendar deserves their own page? I was just trying to put things in perspective here. Basically, her article is a CV, the only "notable" part being the breast calendar. If we're looking for multiple independent articles on the subject of Sue Richards, so far only one has turned up. The other one had the breast calendar itself as a subject. Which means that currently, the subject of Sue Richards is not notable by WP:N. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperdix_7f51.html" title="User:Superdix">Superdix</a> 19:41, 14 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Topics can be notable that don't meet the primary criterion, but articles that reference multiple and independent, non-trivial published works are notable almost by definition. In this case, she is notable becuase both local and national newspapers have published articles that focus on her and her projects. Of course, you as an editor are entitled to your opinion as to whether the cited references are non-trivial, independent and are published in an acceptable forum. However, none of this is to say she is notable as an artist; most of the articles I read focus on her and the calendar and not her art., or does this say that the article is "good"; it clearly needs work. If you feel that the article overemphasizes her artisit abilities or accomplishments, please change it. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcscott_e3f9.html" title="User:Ccscott">Ccscott</a> 20:22, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>A primary contributor (repeatedly so) is User:Missfebruary, hardly a coincidence. On the other hand, if there is more on the accolades she has won for work <i><b>besides</b></i> the calendar, the problem with <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> could be minimized. Until sourced information about her other work enters the article, I'd recommend a <b>very weak delete</b> as work with one calendar (albeit issued over six years) is in itself insufficient for <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> - otherwise all those "anonymous" compilers of calendars for <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hallmark_Cards_eace.html" title="Hallmark Cards">Hallmark Cards</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlton_Cards_85b8.html" title="Carlton Cards">Carlton Cards</a> would also merit Wikipedia articles. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 22:30, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>All those "anonymous" compilers of calendars have not been discussed multiple times in various newspapers. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="WP:N">Notability is not subjective.</a> <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcscott_e3f9.html" title="User:Ccscott">Ccscott</a> 09:56, 15 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think you missed the point: <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> does put forth one important criteria: <b>The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person</b>. Read that once more. <i>Sue Richards</i> should have been the primary subject, not the <i>breast calendar</i>. See where I'm going with this? Consider a book on Monet or Rembrandt. These publications are written on the subject of the artist, not on a particular piece of art they created. The articles listed on Sue Richards have the breast calendar as their subject (but one, from the Guelph local paper). This does not warrant a biography for Sue Richards, it warrants an article on the breast calendar. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperdix_7f51.html" title="User:Superdix">Superdix</a> 15:11, 16 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I realize the content of some of the other newspaper articles listed in the references are not accessible online, but it is clear from reading them that Sue Richards the person is discussed as a primary focus of each of the articles (i.e. in a non-trivial way). In fact they talk more about her life than the calendar. If you do not have access to a library to read them I can post them for you to judge for yourself, but I have been hesitant to do so for fear of copyright issues. I have searched wikipedia but have been unable to find any indication on policy regarding posting newspaper articles in talk pages. In any case, from my reading of all the references I still believe this person easily meets the primary notability criterion (multiple, non-trivial media publications on the subject) and therefore I maintain the article should remain. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcscott_e3f9.html" title="User:Ccscott">Ccscott</a> 16:22, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>no consensus</b>, note - this underlines how tricky a multiple listing can be. Unless subjects are identical (which does not describe a group of footballers from different clubs and countries) the results tend to be hard to read. This should not prejudice subsequent debates where single players from this nomination are relisted individually. For that reason I'll decline to place this result on the talk pages of all but the main nominee. <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> <small><a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk</a></small> 17:42, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Wikiproject on football states, write articles on all notable players in each country. These players are deemed notable. Living in Ireland and fervently following the football season I know personally that these players are actual players and certainly meet the notability requirments. Again, people who nominate such articles are, for me the scourge of this site, possibly more so than Trolls. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyannus_bbc6.html" title="User:Ryannus">Ryannus</a> 19:27, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Overlooking the personal attack, I should probably expand on my reasons for nomination. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> regards as notable "Sportspeople who have played in a fully professional league". As far as I am aware, the top division of the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_League_of_Ireland_2fb5.html" title="Football League of Ireland">Football League of Ireland</a> is not fully professional. Some of the bigger teams are professional, but the league as a whole is not fully professional. The notability of the <i>clubs</i> is not in question; this AfD is concerned solely with players. Media coverage regarding some of these players is mentioned above. If <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> sources were <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cited</a> within these articles to establish notability beyond doubt, then I would be happy to withdraw some or all of these nominations.</dd>
<dd>With regards to some points made by others above:
<ul>
<li>Finn Harps have played in the UEFA Cup, but in the 1970s. None of these players have played in European competition as far as I have been able to ascertain.</li>
<li><a href="../../../f/e/r/Fergal_Harkin_5629.html" title="Fergal Harkin">Fergal Harkin</a> did not play make any appearances for the Leicester first team.</li>
<li>Comparisons to <a href="../../../g/a/e/Gaelic_football.html" title="Gaelic football">Gaelic football</a> are irrelevant, the best Irish <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">football (soccer)</a> players play professionally.

<li><b>Strong keep:</b> Wikipedia's test for notability states:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Sportspeople/athletes/competitors who have played ... at the highest level in mainly amateur sports or other competitive activities that are themselves considered notable..."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Although the team of most of these players currently rests in the First Division, all of these players have been, or are, members of a team at the highest level of football in the Republic of Ireland - that is, the Premier Division of the <a href="../../../l/e/a/League_of_Ireland_c3e4.html" title="League of Ireland">League of Ireland</a> (bar <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Gorman_d6bb.html" title="Anthony Gorman">Anthony Gorman</a>, who played for <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linfield_FC_9737.html" title="Linfield FC">Linfield FC</a> (Northern Irish football's biggest club) and <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_Crossan_ee7e.html" title="Matthew Crossan">Matthew Crossan</a> as far as I'm aware). The activities are notable without a doubt. The players feature both on national Irish television and local radio regularly.</p>
<p>Furthermore:<br />
<a href="../../../m/a/r/Marc_Mukendi_634b.html" title="Marc Mukendi">Marc Mukendi</a>, who is on loan at <a href="../../../f/i/n/Finn_Harps_e342.html" title="Finn Harps">Finn Harps</a>, is the member of <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derry_City_F.C._783c.html" title="Derry City F.C.">Derry City F.C.</a>, a professional side in the Premier Division, and has representented Ireland at under-age level.

<p>It is hard to fathom how <a href="../../../e/l/o/Eloka_Asokuh_942a.html" title="Eloka Asokuh">Eloka Asokuh</a>'s winning of the under-17 World Cup with Nigeria may be deemed non-notable.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that <a href="../../../f/e/r/Fergal_Harkin_5629.html" title="Fergal Harkin">Fergal Harkin</a> may have represented <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohemian_FC_b5ce.html" title="Bohemian FC">Bohemian FC</a> in European competition, and possibly <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Mohan_ab06.html" title="Tom Mohan">Tom Mohan</a> a few seasons ago when he was with Derry City.

<li><b>Keep all</b> Finn Harps is a semi-professional club which only recently played in the top level of Irish football. Removing references like this will help give the impression that all Irish football is played in England. Fergal Harkin is an active member of the first team squad of Bohemian FC, and one of the foremost wingers in Ireland. Proposing his article for deletion in particular reveals an alarming level of ignorance of the game, and in my view this should inform any decision.

<li>Actually, the one AfD for Something Awful that's listed was an overwhelming Keep, so I don't really see your grounds for making that statement. And to Jacj: browbeating Keep votes is bad form.

<li>If Something Awful indeed has non-trivial media mentions, they should be cited as sources in that article. It is woefully lacking of external citations, and should be cleaned up. --<a href="../../../a/f/e/User%7EAfed_b194.html" title="User:Afed">Afed</a> 20:43, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If you believe it's "browbeating" and "bad form" to explain why wrong and misleading reasons for a decision are wrong and misleading, it would be prudent to avoid any discussions where people might have to explain why they disagree with each other.<br />
<br />
Since the AfD process is not, in fact, a democratic vote but more like a weighing-up of the reasons for and against deletion, it makes sense that only genuine reasons for keeping or deleting should be considered. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacj_756e.html" title="User:Jacj">Jacj</a> 19:12, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>How can I put this... it gives the impression that you're jumping on people, pigpiling. It seems to only happen in cases where someone is really dead set on there being a specific outcome to the AfD debate. I really only can say that it doesn't look good for your side that you're not willing to let your original arguments stand on their own merits. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 07:32, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Entirely growing sick of seeing people nominating things as "non-notable" simply because they haven't heard of them. Notable webcomic artist sporting multiple well-known comics, some of which were on Keenspot, which alone should be enough even disregarding everything else he's been involved in. --<a href="../../../k/e/o/User%7EKeolah_f37e.html" title="User:Keolah">Keolah</a> 03:50, 14 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What makes you so certain that my judgement of Kelly as non-notable is based solely on not having heard of him? In fact I <i>have</i> heard of him from being a member of the <a href="../../../s/o/m/Something_Awful_forums_4c70.html" title="Something Awful forums">Something Awful forums</a>. Your claim to his notability rests on his comics being (1) well-known, and (2) an important feature of Keenspot.<br />
<br />
(1) doesn't really hold up. If Kelly's comics were sufficiently well known as to be notable, then there would be references to the comics from sources other than websites Kelly has a hand in running. As it is, the three citations given in the article are all links to sites Kelly runs. So his comics are apparently not well-known enough to be considered notable.<br />
<br />
Regarding (2): Kelly certainly does have a webcomic affiliated with <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keenspot.html" title="Keenspot">Keenspot</a> (or at least he <i>did</i> — the latest strip was uploaded six months ago), but that only justifies listing it on the Wikipedia entry for <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keenspot.html" title="Keenspot">Keenspot</a>; it does not, in itself, establish notability for the comic, nor for the creator, who is two degrees separate.<br />

<dd>Does something not being recent make it not having been notable, or even notable in its time? Shakespeare hasn't been updated in hundreds of years, by that estimate.&#160;:P And you seem to claim that the only websites which ever mention him or his comics are his own. That's extremely not-true as well, as a quick google search would have indicated if you had bothered actually looking, as I was able to find numerous sites unrelated to him discussing such in under a minute. --<a href="../../../k/e/o/User%7EKeolah_f37e.html" title="User:Keolah">Keolah</a> 08:10, 14 December 2006 (UTC)
