<p>I'm not a notable person. Period.

This could be deleted under speedy since no claim to fame is made in the article. I actually intended to nominate this article myself. "Ben Burch" as an article has no verifiable secondary claims and, in-fact, none where "Ben Burch" is the subject likely exist. His website might be slightly notable, but not Ben. In addition this article has been flame-bait since the moment of it's conception. <i>Before you voice your opinion here, please take a look at the above policies and make your judgement with it in mind.</i> ---<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.smith_e018.html" title="User:J.smith">J.S</a> (<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User_talk%7EJ.smith_6ef6.html" title="User talk:J.smith">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_J.smith_698b.html" title="Special:Contributions/J.smith">c</a>) 06:33, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Merge</b> (or delete)The article on Mike Malloy might be expanded to include information about some of that program's regulars and guests. Malloy credits a number of persons at the conclusion of each show, certainly all do not warrent a page in wikipedia. I don't see that an article is needed, or appropriate, but there is some useful information here that would fit in the Malloy article. Obviously, more editing and fact-checking is needed as well, etc. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalicocat_8d97.html" title="User:Calicocat">Calicocat</a> 06:57, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, but close quickly. The person is non-notable and the article was created as an attack page (see earlier versions).

<li><b>Comment</b>: Also, the page should be <b>protected</b> so that it cannot be recreated. Normally I would not support preemptive protection, but the vandals and sock puppets involved in the article and this nomination makes me think that it is necessary. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 05:59, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. It is a funny case; I tend to believe that the BenBurch who nominated it really is the same person as the article subject. And I also think that it's been used for trite attacks on the person. However, I read Mr. Burch's writing activities as minimally meeting notability criteria, especially under the "author test". Obviously, per below comments, Mr. Burch's opinion has no special weight in regard to his own notability. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 07:18, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete and protect from recreation</b> - I was in two minds whether to close this myself and just speedy the article, but as someone has expressed the opinion that the article should be kept, I think that would not be the right thing to do. The facts that an attack page was refactored into an article, and that it's a troll-magnet, and Mr. Burch's own request (it's not policy, but it is polite to take heed), and that he doesn't actually meet notability criteria to any great extent, all make me think we'd be better off without this page. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i><b>/</b>/<b>/</b></i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 09:42, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> A7. The article does not "assert the importance or significance of its subject". If his only notability comes from The White Rose Society (website), mention him there. (Quite honestly, I don't see how the website justifies an article either - looking at its AFD, it survived on the strength of meat puppetry and because the nomination was in bad faith. But that's a discussion for another time.) At any rate, <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> is correct. Posting on a message board and running a questionably notable website is not a meaningful assertion of importance. The fact that it's a self-request changes nothing.

As to the substance, I disagree with Ben about his notability (and I agree with the comments that the views of the article's subject are entitled to the same weight as anyone else's, no more and no less). My starting point is service to the readers. A significant number of people may encounter Ben's name through <i>Adult Video News</i> or through AAR. They may want to know more about this person; some may encounter both sources and wonder whether it's the same "Ben Burch". <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 05:36, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm not sure I understand your argument? He's notable because his article would be useful? Outside of a very small community he is completely unknown. Most of his work for AVN us uncredited and unverifiable. Besides, there hasn't been a single article anywhere -about- Ben, so the article has no way to be independently verified from a -secondary- source. That's like a big deal from the standpoint of WP:V. ---<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.smith_e018.html" title="User:J.smith">J.S</a> (<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User_talk%7EJ.smith_6ef6.html" title="User talk:J.smith">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_J.smith_698b.html" title="Special:Contributions/J.smith">c</a>) 15:38, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As far as I can determine, the only newspaper articles about me, other than Letters to The Editor I have written and had published, are from the 1970s and involve me winning an engineering competition. I've been interviewed on talk radio a few times, but there are no written transcripts. My contributions to AVN are all editorial and advisory, and do not entail a byline, just a mention in the colophon. If I am notable at all, it is the most minor sort of notability, much like the "Key Grip" from a movie; He gets a credit, but nobody knows who the heck he is. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 16:46, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I don't understand your reference to "a pornography industry magazine". Do you mean that notability based on a publication would depend in part on whether Wikipedians approve of the publication? I assume that, with pornography as with many other subjects, some magazines are important and widely known, while others are obscure. Setting aside for a moment the specific question of Ben Burch's notability, are you arguing that public attention received because of <i>some</i> activities should be discounted because the activities are disliked by some people? <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 15:41, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. This is, it seems to me, a very strange case. This article has been around for a while, and has been the subject of an extraordinary number of edits---mostly, by the looks of it, vandalism, and the reverting of same. Now, here we have the ostensible subject of the article, asking that the article be deleted because he does not feel that he is notable enough to deserve said article. How, one wonders, are we to even know that this <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> is, in fact, the real Ben Burch? Reading the article, which is rather short, the individual in question seems somewhat notable in the field of political blogging and talk radio. This is all very puzzling to me. Can the subject of an article ask that said article be deleted on the grounds that he or she does not feel he or she is notable enough? I feel that I cannot vote on this AfD until some facts are sorted out. ---<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoldanarchist_24ab.html" title="User:Theoldanarchist">Charles</a> 05:20, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>Hi, Charles! The article was created in the first instance as a vehicle for personal attack by the trolls who reside at Conservative Underground. These people are well know to vandalize liberal and progressive message boards, and they decided to expand. I listed the article for deletion because it became clear to me that they would never grow up and stop vandalizing it, and people here on Wiki have enough to do trying to get actual work done without having to revert this page endlessly. And I am no more notable than a lot of people who don't have Wikipedia articles. Lets save those for folks you can at least find a newspaper article about, OK? <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 05:27, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Ben, your slander of CU notwithstanding, in your nomination you say that we children have not had enough fun. Might I remind you of your comments yesterday on the DU Talk page regarding the External Links discussion: "My dear, I've had a lot of serious fun lately. This is quick becoming my new hobby and my model railroad and the live steam locomotive building up in my workshop are gathering dust. I have to monitor the computers here in the studio at all hours from 11 AM through midnight, and so this fills in the time when things are working properly quite nicely." It would seem that you enjoy this activity immensely. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 12:01, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Well, sweetiepie, I am not certain which of MY comments you refer to, since I have attempted to conduct myself with the civility that is expected of Wiki editors, which is a bit more than you can say for yourself. Have a nice day, Honeycheeks. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 14:45, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Again with the innuendo, my little box of Nuts n' Honey. I challenge you to point to a single Wiki comment of mine that is out of line. If you are referring to my posts on CU, they are irrelevant to the discussion at hand, which is your notability. Adolf Hitler was a disgusting human being, but I would never argue that he was not notable. While I find you personally abhorrant, I am able to separate my personal feelings from my objectivity about your notability. This is something you should learn. I could refer to volumes of your posts on DU which are disgusting examples of hate speech, but they would be irrelevant to this discussion. While blog mentions are not considered here, if you were to count all the mentions of BenBurch, Fister, and Fat Che on CU, FR, and the Dummy Funnies, one could draw the conclusion that you were more notable than the President. You really aren't very good at this Ben. You should spend more time fundraising for your website, and less time causing trouble on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 16:24, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Charles, of course, is correct. Absent <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">legal</a> concerns, the opinion of the subject of an article merits no more consideration than that of any other editor (in the case that the subject should be a Wikipedian), and the desire of a subject that an article apropos of him/her be deleted in no way militates for (or against, I suppose) deletion (toward which proposition see, e.g., <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Daniel_Brandt_%283rd_nomination%29_1c82.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Daniel Brandt (3rd nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Daniel Brandt (3rd nomination)</a> and its sundry affirmances); neither does his/her opinion with respect to his/her notability carry any special weight (even where he/she adjudges himself to be non-notable, which determination would tend to be against one's interest, although surely not in situations such as these). Of course, I'm likely to support deletion, believing the subject to be non-notable, but his desire that the article be deleted will not affect my reasoning (and neither will the fact of the frequent vandalism of the article, even as I'm no fan of the CU). In any case, <a href="../../../s/p/e/WP%7ESPEEDY_9918.html" title="WP:SPEEDY">speedy deletion</a>, for which Ben advocates, is surely not an appropriate disposition here. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 05:47, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Joe, of course I don't want to twist anybody's arms, and if people decide I'm really notable, fine, but I think some articles are just not worth the time they waste in terms of people having to keep fixing them. I'm happy for it to stay or go, but I warrant that it will continue to be a lightning rod if it does stay. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenBurch_6e87.html" title="User:BenBurch">BenBurch</a> 06:04, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Reply to first post</b> Techicly speeking the subject of an article has no more say of what goes in it then any other edior on wikipedia (<a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> is the policy here). However, Ben as an editor can make the argument that he's not notable under guidelines like WP:BIO with as much weight as anyone else can. ---<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.smith_e018.html" title="User:J.smith">J.S</a> (<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User_talk%7EJ.smith_6ef6.html" title="User talk:J.smith">t</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_J.smith_698b.html" title="Special:Contributions/J.smith">c</a>) 06:39, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>, if this AfD will reduce the amount of pointless chatter and edits that happen on Wikipedia surrounding Burch/DU/CU related topics, that would be the cherry on the sundae.
