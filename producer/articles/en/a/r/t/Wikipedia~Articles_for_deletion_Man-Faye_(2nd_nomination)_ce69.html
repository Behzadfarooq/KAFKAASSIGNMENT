<p>Man-Faye has the same relevancy than other otakus from whom there are not articles about because they are not relevant. Crossplaying, being mocked up on tv, and being taken out from a convention are NOT reasons at all to be there (same accomplishments than the Narutard and many others). Goggle has tons of examples of men dressed as a female anime character, and none of them deserve a sole article. This article doesn't have anything to add that is not covered in the Crossplay article. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlosHoyos_f846.html" title="User:CarlosHoyos">DrJones</a> 19:03, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Man Faye is notable, more so by far than any other cosplayer, and despite repeated claims that he is not, he has continued to pop up over and over in various media. Complaints of POV during the last nomination have been addressed, and the article is fairly solid as it is. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElijya_4eeb.html" title="User:Elijya">Elijya</a> 21:29, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Man-Faye is the more noteable of the cosplayers.crossplayers out there. The fact that he's been seen in national media (as opposed to fan sites a/or imageboards) is more than crediable enough to warrant inclusion.--<a href="../../../2/9/3/User%7E293.xx.xxx.xx.html" title="User:293.xx.xxx.xx">293.xx.xxx.xx</a> 12:39, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Strong Deletion</b></s> - The reason for the deletion is the subject of the article, not the content. Man-Faye utterly fails at accomplishing <i>anything</i> that makes him unique. The only point at his favor&#160;? appearing on TV as a laughable random guy. Compare him with [<a href="http://www.manoloeldelbombo.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.manoloeldelbombo.com/" rel="nofollow">Manolo el del bombo</a>], who appears <b>on the spanish News</b> everytime he shows on any stadium, has twice the google hits of Man-Faye, is well beloved, and yet doesn't have its own an article (nor deserves it). Infamous local figures should also do something remarkably and <b>positive</b> inside its small group to deserve an article by itself. Having <i>poor taste</i> is not enough. An example of a remarkable local figure is <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Long_2790.html" title="Mike Long">Mike Long</a>. Compare him with Man-Faye. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlosHoyos_f846.html" title="User:CarlosHoyos">DrJones</a> 11:31, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That is non-sense. Why would anyone care about them outside their "niche hobbies"? When someone looks for <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gorbachov.html" title="Gorbachov">Gorbachov</a>, he/she wants info about his job as a politician, not about the pizza spot in which he appeared. Second, <b>having contributed</b> is not the key point, but <b>how much have they contributed</b>. <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Long_2790.html" title="Mike Long">Mike Long</a> piloted the first <i>combo deck</i> in <a href="../../../t/h/e/Magic%7E_The_Gathering_240a.html" title="Magic: The Gathering">Magic: The Gathering</a>, developing an entire new strategy for the game, and thus creating a more stable environment denoted many times as <i>rock-paper-scissors</i>. He also has won multiple important tournaments and played a major role in the success of the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Pro_Tour_%28Magic%7E_The_Gathering%29_d659.html" title="Pro Tour (Magic: The Gathering)">Pro Tour</a>. His contributions to the game <b>redefined</b> it. By contrast, the <i>contribution</i> of Man-Faye to Cosplay is so slim that makes me sad, unless he had done a major contribution that is found nowhere on the article. He isn't even the first crossplayer. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlosHoyos_f846.html" title="User:CarlosHoyos">DrJones</a> 11:37, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You brought it up. I merely pointed out that your trying to validate one "insignificant" person who's fame is limited to one aspect of society, yet you want to delete an article where another guy's fame is limited to an aspect of society. I mean, by your logic, should we continue on deleting people who's fame is limited to one aspect of society? Should we delete all the noteable Magic Players, because only a handful of society knows them? Request a <b>Speedy Close</b> to this nomination page. --<a href="../../../2/9/3/User%7E293.xx.xxx.xx.html" title="User:293.xx.xxx.xx">293.xx.xxx.xx</a> 07:09, 20 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You still don't understand my words. My point is that people whose fame is limited to an aspect of society should have made something worthwhile inside that aspect of society. Man-Faye has done nothing thousands of people haven't done on carvanal every year. Also, you have refused all this time to give/write on the article just one major contribution of Man-Faye to his "area of interest". I hope the administrators read this and <b>Speedy delete</b> this article alongside this nomination page.&#160;:) <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlosHoyos_f846.html" title="User:CarlosHoyos">DrJones</a> 10:22, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You keep missing the point (or I write horribly).

<dd>Without entering into debates about if Manolo el del bombo deserves the article or not (you have read my opinion about him already), that doesn't mean that Man-Faye also deserves it, because Man-Faye is far less popular both in media coverage and google results than him, which for an internet meme is disastrous. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlosHoyos_f846.html" title="User:CarlosHoyos">DrJones</a> 12:13, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think he meets the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28web%29_6df7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (web)">Wikipedia:Notability (web)</a>, plus the article written as-is covered most of his "history" and doesn't seem to be a vanity article in the slightest sense.

<li><b>Delete</b> - At the end of the day, the Mr. Faye isn't a historical figure nor is he a beloved or despised person: Merely a mediocre footnote in passing trends. Half the memes on Wikipedia are passing trends. It might be interesting to note which memes can stand the test of time, but it would simply bloat wikipedia trying to list them all. What Man Faye does is nothing new or noteworthy or particularly shocking. Let's try to trim wikipedia whenever we can; the rest of the Internet can carry on Man Faye. Emil_lang</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - There are some articles on Wikipedia that simply boggle my mind as to why they exist, yet I don't think they should be deleted simply because someone may come along trying to find information about it that may not be found elsewhere. For example, I bet there are very few people today who would remember a mediocre 80's cartoon like Turbo Teen, yet there is an article here about it. Knowledge is knowledge, even if it's trivial.Djseifer 12:50, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - There are a lot of articles about video game characters, like for example characters from Suikoden, you can get a synopsis on. I wouldn't say that this info is particularly important, but it is nice to have! So why not have an article about Man-Faye. The article is not about adulating man-Faye but to inform for example european cosplay fans about this "event" in american cosplay culture. Wikipedia is a source of information, so why delete information, someone might be interested in? The article on man-Faye is well written and neutral in tone, so I say we keep it. 217.235.178.60 14:07, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Some of the arguments for deleting the article is that Man-Faye hasn't contributed anything useful to his niche. That's not a reason for deletion. If being an attention-whore were to be grounds for deletion, there wouldn't be a <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Hilton_9740.html" title="Paris Hilton">Paris Hilton</a> article. The fact is, Man-Faye has managed to be a <b>successful</b> attention-whore, and has been covered in media. One's opinion on whether the individual has made a significant contribution is irrelevant. -- <a href="../../../w/h/p/User%7EWhpq_e938.html" title="User:Whpq">Whpq</a> 20:27, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Hilton_9740.html" title="Paris Hilton">Paris Hilton</a> has entered the Guiness Book of Records as the most pointless celeb, though. That's quite an accomplishment no other attention-whore has achieved. I think a more proper analogy for Man-Faye would be this: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_Gets_Famous#Synopsis" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_Gets_Famous#Synopsis" rel="nofollow">"I didn't do it!"</a>] . I think that the world has millions of weirdos that haven't done anything noteworthy and allowing Man-Faye to have his own Wikipedia page lowers the bar a bit <i>too much</i>. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlosHoyos_f846.html" title="User:CarlosHoyos">DrJones</a> 10:45, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> What your argument boils down to is not whether Man-Faye is actually notable, but that you believe Man-Faye <b>should never be notable</b> regardless of how much publicity he may have acquired. --<b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">TheFarix</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheFarix_f893.html" title="User talk:TheFarix">Talk</a>) 12:30, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I haven't said so. I have claimed, however, that he shouldn't have a wikipedia entry if he hasn't done anything remarkable (and that just going to conventions or appearing on tv on an irregular basis is not). The only remarkable things I can read on the article (and in forums) is: a) His cosplay is awful. b) He is somewhat popular. I can put here a link right now to a page with more than 300 people with awful cosplays (including sumo wrestlers dressed as Sailor Moons, with tested media coverage). Your only alternative, thus, is defending his popularity, which is a rather vague and POW term. My empyrical experiments with Google shown very low results for him (lower than obscure local figures), and many pages calling him a fad and an old meme (just like <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bart_Simpson_19e2.html" title="Bart Simpson">Bart Simpson</a> on the above analogy), so I suppose I have the right to question his <a href="../../../i/c/o/Icon.html" title="Icon">icon</a> status. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlosHoyos_f846.html" title="User:CarlosHoyos">DrJones</a> 22:13, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Wikipedia's notability guidelines are to determine if he is notable, not if he has done something remarkable. If he is verifiably notable, then that is enough bases for most editors. You, however, are trying to create an entirely different standard, notable <b>and</b> done something remarkable, which isn't supported by the majority of editor. --<b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">TheFarix</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheFarix_f893.html" title="User talk:TheFarix">Talk</a>) 22:55, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Can we bring this to an end?</b> I realize that an AfD vote is not strictly decided by popular vote, but the results here are overwhelming: only two votes for deletion, one by the nominator (who doesn't do much to disguise his bias), and one by a user with less than 50 edits. Most of the supporters have all provided reasons for their suggestions to keep, and countered the reasons for deletion. Forgive me as I usually restrict my activities on wikipedia strictly to article content, but would any kind individuals more familiar with procedure hasten this debate to it's inevitable conclusion to keep the article?

<li><b>Comment</b> It probably won't be closed anytime soon. The nomination wasn't completed until yesterday. The admins are probably waiting 5 days from the completed nomination before closing, just to be on the safe side. --<b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">TheFarix</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheFarix_f893.html" title="User talk:TheFarix">Talk</a>) 21:39, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>, yeah, that's unfortunate since the AfD's really been up for 10 days now and there was just some sort of error that kept most people from knowing about it. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElijya_4eeb.html" title="User:Elijya">Elijya</a> 22:11, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>, Just because someone deleted the original AfD (whether it be intentional or unintentional), and the requestor didn't keep tabs about it, it shouldn't be grounds for the debate to be extended further. It's been up past the 7 days, follow the rules. <b>Speedy Close</b> with extreme prejudice.--<a href="../../../2/9/3/User%7E293.xx.xxx.xx.html" title="User:293.xx.xxx.xx">293.xx.xxx.xx</a> 00:18, 23 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Most of the claims of notability are unreferenced or referenced only by a single source, which is an interview with the guy himself on a rumour site. That's not reliable, folks. Therefore, this article fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, and must be deleted unless <i>proper, reliable</i> sources can be found. Just because he's infamous on some websites, and just because a lot of people seem to think the article should be kept, doesn't mean we can ignore fundamental Wikipedia policies. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 10:25, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Objection</b> I wouldn't dismiss <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime_News_Network_d66a.html" title="Anime News Network">Anime News Network</a> as a <i>rumor</i> website, given it's one of the bigger anime news sites out there. And while <a href="../../../t/e/c/Tech_TV_bfcb.html" title="Tech TV">Tech TV</a> has it's detractors, it does qualify as a legitimate verifiable source.--72.234.211.221 22:21, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Seeing there are numerous "pointless" articles on Wikipedia (Ranging from insignificant car models like <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keicar.html" title="Keicar">Keicars</a> to <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supercars.html" title="Supercars">Supercars</a> that may never hit US shores ever to even TV shows that may never get seen on US shores as well), there is no harm in having this article on Wikipedia. It's not a vanity article like some would lead to believe, and i'm not seroiusly convinced that those that oppose it have provided a valid reason. One contributor nominated the article <b>twice</b> for deletion (This AfD and one that ended up as a no consensus) and even Man-Fayes <a href="../../../m/a/n/Talk%7EMan-Faye_bc3f.html" title="Talk:Man-Faye">talk page</a> has shown his apparent bias.--72.234.211.221 22:21, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
