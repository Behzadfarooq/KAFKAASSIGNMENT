<p><b>Nomination for deletion</b> Full of original research with poor sourcing (seems to be using slashdot posts and spinoff slashdot troll sites only). <u>The article does not show how the "Slashdot trolling phenomena" (such as "crapflooding" (I'm sure far more of this happens on wikipedia than slashdot), anti-semitism, homophobia, racism, plagiarism, flamewars, "karma whores" (many web forums/communities have a comment scoring system)) described here are substantively unique and distinct from <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_troll.html" title="Internet troll">trolling</a> phenomena elsewhere</u>. Claim that Slashdot has particularly "bizarre and complex" subculture is ungrounded (and incidentally compared to what? <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a>? <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birder.html" title="Birder">Birdwatching</a>?) Memes described are ephemeral in content and unsourced ("Hot grits", "Stephen King is dead"). There is no claim for encyclopedic notability here.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Slashdot_trolling_phenomena_ce5f.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Slashdot trolling phenomena">This article was already listed on AFD</a>. It received nearly unanimous <b>Keep</b> votes, roughly in the range of 95% with extremely high voter turnout. Please consider this precedent and the fact that the Wikipedia community considered it poor form to <a href="../../../g/a/y/Talk%7EGay_Nigger_Association_of_America_f69d.html" title="Talk:Gay Nigger Association of America">list articles on AFD multiple times</a>. Furthermore, if a person <i>does</i> insist on skirting this guideline by re-AFDing an article that had a strong <b>Keep</b> consensus, it's expected that he will at least link to the previous AFD so it doesn't appear he's trying to sneakily cover up the previous AFD. 4.253.43.8 17:27, 8 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>1) I did check through the talk page (too hastily) and did not see the previous VfD (the general practice now is to highlight these in a colour shaded box - I was looking for one of those; also the link to the afd nomination screen from the afd tag led to a blank screen rather than the first AfD, so this also led me to assume there were no previous ones.). My bad. 2) Please see <a href="../../../c/c/c/WP%7ECCC_b716.html" title="WP:CCC">WP:CCC</a> - which is an actual official policy as opposed to the made-up "guideline that I'm skirting" which you suggest is implied by the GNAA talk page (I disagree than such notion is implied, and certainly not as a guideline). Please also see <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. Also, I don't consider a second nomination "multiple times" (I also think GNAA (which has been nominated 18 times or something) should continue to be open to afds). It's also been more than 2 years since the vfd, so its not like we haven't given the article time to improve or people haven't been adding to the article (there's actually been a few hundred edits since then). And I'd like to think that in those 2+ years, Wikipedia's standards and expectations have gone up a bit. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 19:00, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I have to come clean why I feel we should keep this article: plain and simple, its just a fun and fascinating read. Honestly, this kind of article is a great example of why I love wikipedia - we don't mind a page of subculture munitiae. As more and more of our lives and interactions move online, the history and culture of our experiences become depressingly ephemeral and temporary. I ran into this recently with an obscure opensource game I've played for a few years (MAngband) - I decided it was time for an article about it (its been around for coming up on a decade) and was saddened to find that old archives of the early-days-development mailing lists had eventually been deleted and the site they were on closed. Is it obscure? Yes. Does the Greater Populace really care? Nope. But it was and is a small but persisting phenomena that has had an impact on a small, quite group. How sad it would be to think that so many of these things, on a larger scale, suddenly vanish from all lasting knowledge with the click of a mouse button at a webhost. Is the article clunky and messy? Then let's commit to cleaning it up! The quirky, funny, and oddly interesting subculture that arose in a community of hundreds of thousands of people is certainly worth keeping with us. <a href="../../../d/x/c/User%7EDxco_460c.html" title="User:Dxco">Dxco</a> 03:09, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This is kind of depressing to me. It's like the signal of the end of real life in place of Internet culture; however, as that hasn't happened, this article remains not part of our history, but rather the history of a small minority, and as such needn't be covered in an encyclopaedia. GassyGuy 07:39, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>1) Wikipedia's primary purpose is to become an authoritative encyclopedia, not a free archive space for your favourite internet forum.

<dd>Yes, you can go to Slashdot and see that people are trolling this way. But here's the thing: Slashdot postings are basically unrelated instances of random happenstances. They don't necessarily interrelate with the bigger picture. Anyone could post a couple of postings there over a time, come here, and claim it's a "minor trolling phenomenon". Thus, we can't really use Slashdot itself because <i>correlation doesn't mean causality:</i> To determine whether the trolling phenomenon is <i>notable</i> and <i>specific to Slashdot</i>, we'd need to draw <i>educated, weighted conclusions</i> based on a lot of Slashdot comments, which is <i><a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a></i>. In Wikipedia we don't draw educated, assertive conclusions, just simple deductive conclusions based on <i>already</i> published research. You could probably do this if the body of work was entirely available in simple form (as in "a moderate amount of postings that aren't edited, purged, and made disappear automatically by most peoples' browsing settings"), and drew only simple conclusions ("there's 2000 articles that have the GNAA spam, as anyone can plainly see"), but in current form, this demands too much from the reader who wants valid, easily verifiable information. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 13:46, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, Keeping information on trolling is very difficult. Websites go down, links get lost, troll posts get deleted. Regardless if you read any of the trolltalk archives it is pretty apparent that trolling slashdot is definately a phenomenon and definately occurs. With trolling you can't really hope for external sources from the community being trolled because people documenting the trolling usually are heavily involved in the communities. In this case much of the trolling is immediately verifiable via trolltalk. There is evidence, you might not like it. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrollHistorian_f3a9.html" title="User:TrollHistorian">TrollHistorian</a> 17:14, 15 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> This not acceptable evidence for wikipedia - you're asking that all the evidence comes from the trollers themselves . Even leaving aside the questionable acceptance of information from self-proclaimed trollers, this counts as unreliable original research which is not verifiable because of its unreliablity. You also need to prove reliably that slashdot trolling is substantively different from other trolling on other websites in an encyclopedically meaningful way (i.e. not "they make jokes about X on Slashdot while in comparison, they make jokes about Y on Fark - we know this because of the original posts on the websites".) <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 00:33, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, yes, if a group of people get together, think up an imbecile name for their group and then insist on behaving like idiots as much as possible and as long as possible and go out of their way to irritate as many other people as possible, at some point they may be "successful" enough to get some media coverage for being a minor irritating pop culture phenomenon thats marginally and debatably notable enough for a wikipedia article.
