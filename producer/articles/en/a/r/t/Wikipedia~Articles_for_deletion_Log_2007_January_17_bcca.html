<dd>You miss understand me i think. Its not even a stub. Its the same 1-2 sentence that is on the list of episodes. It provides no more info than the list does.

<dd>Then expand it! I'd certainly do it if I watched this series, or was interested in Disney - frankly I'm sick of moaning, if people are unwilling to meat out the articles that aren't up to spec then just don't look at them, simple as that - but deletion is not the answer - temporary redirection might be however. <small><font face="Tahoma"><b>thanks</b>/Fenton, Matthew Lexic Dark <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MatthewFenton_0db4.html" title="Special:Contributions/MatthewFenton">52278 Alpha 771</a></font></small> 23:12, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - Books shouldn't be judged according to their sales and availability. Look at Harry Potter books, does that mean all the facts in Harry Potter books are correct because it's on bestseller list for I-don't-know-how-long-already. Also, many books are not the centre of attention after many years of its publishing date. Similar "fate" of books include <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Darwin_74f3.html" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin's</a> <a href="../../../o/n/_/On_the_Origin_of_Species_757b.html" title="On the Origin of Species">On the Origin of Species</a> (1859) which suggests the theory of <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a>. It was 10 years after the first publishing date (1869) that scientists really start focusing on his information. Another great example is <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Watson_4863.html" title="James Watson">James Watson</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Crick_68e2.html" title="Francis Crick">Francis Crick</a> published their article The Molecular structure of Nucleic Acids in 1953.

<li><b>Keep</b> Please take a fresh look at the article. I added 2 reviews from reliable independent publications which I found with Proquest. In particular, there was a favorable review by Choice, the publication of the American Library Association, as well as a bried review by Scitech Book News. These two reviews along with the unfavorable coverage by the other side establish notability and verification. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 18:22, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Edison, please review criterion 2 at <a href="../../../b/k/_/WP%7EBK_5e06.html" title="WP:BK">WP:BK</a>. It specifically says that a review in a publication like <i>Choice</i> that reviews thousands of books a year with little regard for notability does not indicate that the book is notable. (If you look at the table of contents for the July/Aug issue of Choice you'll see that there are 622 items, looks like mostly all book reviews - I am assuming that Scitech book news is similar). <i>Every</i> book will be reviewed somewhere, just like every book will have a page on amazon.com - neither signifies notability. I have a self-published history of a New England liberal arts college that cites two reviews on the cover. The point is not that any book that's been reviewed is notable, its that any book that is reviewed by publications that don't review just about <i>everything</i> is notable. If a significant reviewer (NYTimes, NY Review of Books, London Review of Books, etc.) thought that the book was notable enough to warrant a real review (not a paragraph) than that's evidence of notability. A couple of brief reviews are really meaningless. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 18:45, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> (edit conflict) Wikipedia guidelines for notability explicitly exclude "reviews in periodicals that review thousands of books a year with little regard for notability"; both <i>Choice</i> (whose web page claims over 7,000 reviews per year) and <i>SciTech Book News</i> (over 20,000 reviews per year) are in this class. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaymond_arritt_89f0.html" title="User:Raymond arritt">Raymond Arritt</a> 18:56, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> As it happens, you are wrong about Choice, which reviews 7000 bks a year from the estimated 50,000 or so academic titles published. The selection criteria are that the title must be impt to an UG curriculum. The reviews are typically favorable because they do not include lower quality books unless they're so bad that a warning is in order. Every time I've wanted to give a book a neg review there, I've needed to justify why a neg review should be published. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 06:22, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article is not about the recent report in the <i>Sunday Times</i> that Israel is planning a nuclear strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, rather it is an analysis of Israel's capability to launch such a strike. As it stands, this article needs to be deleted because of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball.</a> This article treats the alleged plan as something that Israel admits (i.e. frequent statements like "Israeli claims that..."), when in fact Israel claims that the Times piece is not accurate. The very title of the article asserts that Israel in fact <i>did</i> propose such a strike, which is completely POV. I removed the most obvious OR from the article, an assessment of the potential radioactive fallout, but the second section is also OR. If we have an article on this topic, it needs to be about the <i>Sunday Times</i> article, NOT about the allegedly proposed strike. It would need to be called something like Reports of an Israeli plan for a nuclear first-strike on the Natanz facility. The question then becomes, Is the Sunday Times piece notable? Policy is foggy here, there doesn't seem to be a specific notability guideline for current events and the general notability criteria really don't work (ANY current event is by definition going to have multiple published works about it. Personally, I don't think that a newspaper report that generated a few days worth of controversy but seems to have been otherwise ignored is at all notable. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 00:32, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would agree that the content has been much improved. There are still some problems. The article needs to be renamed, for one thing and the opening sentence needs to be changed from "Media reports..." to "A (date) report in the <i>Sunday Times</i>..." or something similar. I'm not sure voting to delete purely on the basis of OR is appropriate at this point. However, the question of notability still stands. This is more of a problem with the wiki not having clear standards of which current events are notable than any problem with the article itself.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> As the originator of the article, the intention was to use these unfolding events as an illustrative case study of the more general concept of nuclear preemption. I note that nuclear preemption does not seem to have been dealt with yet on wikipedia which is a pity since it is an important aspect of nuclear deterance which is clearly becoming more relevant due to the inevitable march of technology. I have proposed that the original article be merged into <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plans_for_strikes_against_the_Iranian_nuclear_program_c6aa.html" title="Plans for strikes against the Iranian nuclear program">Plans_for_strikes_against_the_Iranian_nuclear_program</a> which should in term be linked to from nuclear preemption as an illustrative case study. This move would deal with the article name being POV which, I agree, is inappropriate. In its current form the article does not violate <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> or <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. I strongly disagree with your opinion that "Personally, I don't think that a newspaper report that generated a few days worth of controversy but seems to have been otherwise ignored is at all notable." in that a potential aggresive nuclear first strike is clearly a major event in human history .... potentially only the third to be precise. I also find it interesting that you hold this opinion and yet have contributed such articles as <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2006_Seattle_Jewish_Federation_shooting_e26a.html" title="July 2006 Seattle Jewish Federation shooting">July_2006_Seattle_Jewish_Federation_shooting</a>, which would seemingly also be inappropriate by your standards. LochVoil 00:36, 20 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The difference between this and <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2006_Seattle_Jewish_Federation_shooting_e26a.html" title="July 2006 Seattle Jewish Federation shooting">July 2006 Seattle Jewish Federation shooting</a> is that one actually happened while the other is a newspaper article. A nuclear strike is a major event in human history. A <i>plan</i> for a nuclear strike is not. A report of a plan of a nuclear strike id <i>definitely</i> not. Further, Wikipedia is not the place to "use... unfolding events as an illustrative case study" of anything. That's original research. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 02:54, 20 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are claming that wikipedia should not contain articles on potential events that have not yet happened? I suggest you read more of wikipedia which will soon disabuse you of this notion. Wikipedia has many articles that relate to circumstances that have not yet come about. One pertinent example being Iranian acquisition of nuclear weapons, which all parties currently agree has not yet happened but which many experts assert is likely to happen. Speculation on Iranian nuclear weapons has been wide spread in "newspaper articles" which, despite your implication that this renders the subject matter unworthy for inclusion into wikipedia, has resulted in a substantial article on (as yet non existent) Iranian nuclear weapons (including numerous media quotes): <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction.html" title="Iran and weapons of mass destruction">Iran_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction</a>. Leaving aside the high relevance of the article in question here to the theory of nuclear preemption, risks of nuclear bunker busters and israeli-iranian-american political relations for the moment: Even when using the criterion of relative probability of a potential event as the basis for deciding whether to include it in wikipedia, the event in question here scores highly:
<ul>
<li>Israel has stated categorically that it will not allow Iran to acquire nuclear weapons.</li>
<li>Experts assert that the Natanz facility is invulnerable to conventional attack, a view I share given my own particular professional expertise.</li>
<li>Experts assert that there is a high probability that Iran will attempt to develop nuclear weapons in the short term.</li>
<li>The history of diplomatic relations between Israel, the USA and Iran are, in my opinion, not encouraging to the prospects of a peaceful settlement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Finally, I find your preemptive blanket claim that the use of examples within (as-yet-uncreated) wikipedia articles unequivocally constitutes original research spurious and nonsensical. LochVoil 16:16, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think it is clear that the SUNDAY TIMES ARTICLE itself, the furor it has caused, and the implications of its allegations are certainly highly notable, but the article as written is only speculation based upon the Sunday Times' allegation. If the article is renamed to something along the lines of "2007 Sunday Times article on Plans for Israeli Nuclear First Strike on Natanz Facility", much of the current information on its military and technical implications and human cost could stay but it would be in addition to the context of the article itself, theories as whether the leak was sincere or saber-rattling, the international response, etc. If we are given more reason in the coming months to think that Israel is infact planning on a nuclear first strike on Iran, than I think the article could and should return to its present form. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexeiSeptimus_d337.html" title="User:AlexeiSeptimus">AlexeiSeptimus</a> 19:42, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as per the concerns I raised in the original afd and in the original. We should care about the quality of references and if they verify the claims of the article. Simply adding reference footnotes with links does not prove that an article is well-referenced.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Here are the issues with the unproven claims and implications of the article:</li>
<li>1) The original research implication that the operation was named after a children's colouring book. The CIO magazine article mentions the title of a series used for drug smuggling but does not specify what kind of book. Making an unreliable original source claim that a children's book series is connected with drug smuggling is irresponsible - it may cause legal problems with the children's book series authors and publisher, especially as the book series implicated is still active<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Show-Me-How-Activity-Step-Step/dp/0765194198" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Show-Me-How-Activity-Step-Step/dp/0765194198" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.
<ul>
<li>So fix it. That <i>may</i> have been presumptous by the author of the article to <i>perhaps</i> assume that it was the children's book of the same name, but that can be easily edited. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 22:21, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So you're saying that there's a solid argument to be made that this book series <i>was</i> used for drug smuggling? Not an serious issue to suggest such a thing? I'll fix it by taking the statement out. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 22:29, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Was there a book called "show Me How" that was used for drug smuggling? Appears so. What was presumptuous? <i>Perhaps'</i> assuming that it was the children's book of the same name and not something else. To take it out entirely would be improper, to take out the children's book part, possibly not. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 12:41, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2) This misleading suggestion: "Through Operation Show Me How, an important international gang of drug smugglers were disrupted as a result of twenty four hours of coordinated database effort".Actually, the CIO magazine article specifically uses the operation as an example of "the international multicountry operations that may last for eons". The operation lasted at least two years. Not 24 hours. What the article says is that within 24 hours of an inquiry being sent out internationally, they received responses from 50 countries - how long does it take for a professional department to respond to an email, fax or phone call which asks the department to look up something in their own computer database? This is not particularly noteworthy. Note that none of the official reports mentioning this operation mention the "24 hour" aspect at all. Magazine interview sources should also be taken with a grain of salt, especially if the interviewee appears to be talking off the top of his head (I doubt that arrests were literally made on "all continents" for instance plus he can't remember the month this eventful supposedly-smashing-drug-gangs-in-a-supposedly-landmark-24-hours operation started but we are to take his "50 countries" number quote as gospel?)
<ul>
<li>Okay...and? With the interview thing specifically, we're sourcing to him, right? So that's all that matters - what he said. The article can merely reflect "Interviewed party claimed 50 countries on all continents." --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 22:21, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My main point is that the article's claim that the operation was special for achieving something in 24 hours is misleading. The database inquiry is not unusual. As for the second part of the statement, I was pointing out that the magazine interview is not a solid source. As I said above, we should care about the quality of our sources and what they actually say. In addition, as I also note higher up in this discussion, <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interpol.html" title="Interpol">Interpol</a> is an international police organization with 180+ member countries and one of its main routine purposes is to coordinate information sharing and inquiries between all its members. Making an inquiry to 50 countries is not special for Interpol, its their normal business. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 22:39, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I disagree with you regarding the interview, and I don't think anyone's claiming that the inquiry to 50 countries is anything special. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 12:41, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>3) The misleading suggestion that the operation was decisive in showing the possibility of drugs sent through mail was an issue for all countries. This claim is based on the 1999 Interpol report which mentions Show Me How and at least one other operation ("Hostel/Portrait") in connection with Express Mail smuggling as well as vague additional "Interpol Information". Unless we apply an original research expansive interpretation of the brief one-line mention of Show Me How, there is no statement which suggests that Show Me How was decisive in showing that this was a problem. It is also not clear even if it did, why this would be encyclopedically notable.
<ul>
<li>So is the problem with the word "decisive," or something else? The operation was apparently worth noting, so it was <i>something</i>. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 22:21, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>By your standard then, any operation or project mentioned in a paragraph or even a single line by a government or police or international agency report is worth an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a>
<ul>
<li>You're probably correct. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 12:41, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>4) No other indication of why this operation was especially important compared to other Interpol drug operations. In the 36 page 1998 Interpol annual report, this operation gets a ~30 word mention. (9 countries, not 50, are mentioned as significant operation areas) in the middle of a list of 10 drugs operations. There is no indication why this is a stand out operation. In the 40 page 1999 Interpol annual report, the operation is given a single line mention, which is shared with another operation. In the 196 page Transnational Crime report, the operation is given a 25 to 30 word mention in a list with 2 other operations. Furthermore, a <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factiva.html" title="Factiva">Factiva</a> news database search showed no news coverage hits for "Operation Show Me How"
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../p/o/k/WP%7EPOKEMON_abf7.html" title="WP:POKEMON">WP:POKEMON</a> in reverse. Perhaps we should make articles on the others, too? --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 22:21, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I said above, by this standard, any operation mentioned in a paragraph or even a single line by a government or police or international agency report is worth an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>5) The Czech and the "World News Connection" articles (which are actually the same - the World News Connection is merely an international news collection database translation or summary of the Czech article) refer to a French NGO report which does not mention Operation Show Me How at all. See my comments at deletion review about this<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2007_January_11" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2007_January_11" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. --<a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 21:54, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So, again, fix it. If the reference is tagged incorrectly (and just because the source doesn't mention the operation doesn't mean it's not a valid source in the article for any number of statements), then fix it. These are issues that should be taken up at the article, not as reasons to delete - you have yet to indicate what the problems <i>with inclusion</i> are. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 22:21, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, I have in detail. Regarding this specific source, even if accepted, does not show why this Operation is encyclopedically notable <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a>'~

<li><s>Hi, Nekura. Plan 9's wiki article has to do with its validity as a publisher in the same way that all questionable claims on wikipedia must be backed up with third-party reliable sources and as yet we have none on this publisher (unless for some strange reason they are in some other article). You're right that "<a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> #3 has no qualification that the books have to be 'significant' or 'notable.'" In fact, WP:WEB #3 has absolutely nothing to with books, it has to do with online distributors, which I pointed out earlier. I have no idea what exactly a non-trivial print run is; you might want to ask User:Kizor which reliable source he's using for that claim since he's the one who is claiming these books exhibit such a thing. Myself, I'd expect four notable books from a notable publisher containing notable comics to attract some decent book reviews we could use as sources.

<li><s>At risk of invading the process here, it seems to me that you are arguing, essentially, the formal existence of Plan 9 as a publisher. It can be asserted that they do exist and that they are publishing Suburban Jungle books; I myself have all four books sitting beside me at this moment and use them regularly as an archival reference when discussing the strip. The problem is the establishment of "notability" for the comic, not the publisher. As an historian, I would like to reccomend that you look at this a different way. The SJ article was painstakingly written and reviewed by several fans of the work, using the books as published to represent a primary source on the comic strip. If you're going to declare notability as being published, then perhaps you need to accept that any work published in book form-- by any publisher-- is an acceptable primary source for itself and therefore establishes its own notability. If the standard of notability you are using to eliminate Plan 9 were to be used by historians, our history would be a mere shadow of what it is now. Instead, we value first primary source material from reliable sources. I reccomend that Wikipedia include a notability category, it could be called WP:PriSrc, that non-printed media may self-cite once it is published by any house, major or minor, so long as that published work is cited as a primary source material for the topic of the article. 67.185.101.54 16:34, 18 January 2007 (UTC)Guest comment from Tora Kiyoshi 16:32, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</s>

<li><s>While your comments are thought out, they do not match with Wikipedia policies. Wikipedia is a tertiary source, not a secondary one: we report what other secondary sources (see <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> for the correct and complete policies and guidelines) have said about a subject. Furthermore, it is consensus on Wikipedia that not all published sources are notable: self-published sources are no indication of notability (although in exceptional cases like <i><a href="../../../b/o/n/Bone_%28comic%29.html" title="Bone (comic)">Bone</a></i>, they can nevertheless be notable), and publication by a minor publisher is not a strong indication of notability either. But as I have argued above, even a publication by a major publisher can be still non notable for Wikipedia, if we have little or no <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> sources about the subject, which is the case here. It doesn't matter if Keenspot and Plan 9 are notable and important: those are points in favour of the comic, and should encourage us to look harder and think twice, but ultimately, when we don't find the necessary sources, we have to follow policy and delete it. Now, since no such sources have been shown by anyone in this AfD or in the article, it should be deleted.

<li><b>Comment</b> Google result reads as <i>Turko-<b>Persia</b></i> which is different to <i>Turko-<b>Persian</b></i>. However, the objection is the term is not academically being accepted. The correct name for that culture is the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persianate.html" title="Persianate">Persianate</a> culture not the "Turko-Persian". Turkophones (mostly of mixed race and Persianized in culture) only spoke in Turkic dialects and were in the military. That is not enough participation in creating and forming the culture to deserve the name "Turko-Persian Tradition" – This is misinformation. All the elements in that area, which have to do with tradition and culture, were drawn from the Iranian culture (Persian, Kurdish, Azari, Baluchi, Tajik, Luri, Gilaki, Talishi, Mazandarani, etc.), and the Islamic faith, not much Turkic elements (like shamanism, yurts etc.) were incorporated in. That is what makes the name "Turko-Persian" an imaginary one. Surena 02:20, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Well, I see your point (sort of), but you must be careful with your wording. Using words like "imaginary" and "factitious" imply that the article in question is being nominated as an intentional hoax, which I don't think it is, nor do I think you meant it that way.

<dd><b>Delete</b> Well, from the reading I have done, and I can post several quotes, the invading Turkic armies adopted Iranian customs and culture. Infact, they even left administration purposes to the Iranians. I dont know where the term "Turko-Persian" Tradition comes from, because even the Ottomans adopted the Persian language for their own cultural language, which suggests that Turkic culture was <b>not</b> mixed with Iranian culture, but rather seperate, and that Iranian culture was preferred. Again, I do not know where the term "Turko-Persian Tradition" comes from and it seems very misleading. I have heard of the term "Turko-Persian Empires" before, but never of this term. Also, it should be said that not even the term Islamic culture is valid, because most, if not all, of Islamic culture is basically practices adopted from Iran after the Arabs conquered it. With this said, I'm not saying that Turkic peoples did not leave their traces, because of course they did, this is evident by the Turkic dialects spoke in the Middle East today, however, if we are speaking of culture and tradition, there was only one that was adopted by most peoples, and those were Iranian, from Abbasid Arabs, to the Turkic tribes, to the Mongols.<a href="../../../a/z/e/User%7EAzerbaijani_f7b7.html" title="User:Azerbaijani">Azerbaijani</a> 03:10, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>This term is a Wikipedian Hoax, and is a campaign by Pan-Turkists here to falsify and replace the internationally, and scholarly known term of <b>Persianate</b> with this nonsensical and fictitious term.

<p>This biographical stub has too little detail to properly stress the subject's importance and, consequently, has been tagged for non-notability and lack of sources. Eight months before its creation, however, another editor initiated a more extensive and well-sourced (three book references) bio of the same individual, with her name spelled correctly (<a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethel_MacDonald_f123.html" title="Ethel MacDonald">Ethel MacDonald</a>). There is no need to merge the two—All the details from the "McDonald" stub already exist in the "MacDonald" biography. <a href="../../../r/o/m/User%7ERomanspinner_a058.html" title="User:Romanspinner">Romanspinner</a>|<a href="../../../r/o/m/User_talk%7ERomanspinner_3dc6.html" title="User talk:Romanspinner">talk</a></p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am the original author. I've been busting my hump trying to edit and contribute other business related articles. This is not easy as much of the business info here is pretty bad. That said, it takes time. What I'm working for here is the notion that a small business idea is not just spaghetti thrown against the wall, The idea itself is a process that requires thought and refinement (much like this article). Give me another week or two and I'll pull it all together. What I don't want to do is just cut and past from my original work, which is not the first link but the second one. If you must dump it now because you don't think a "small business idea" needs any explanation I'll disagree, but it's not the end of the world. Writing takes time and revision, I should say "decent writing". Please let me know one way or the other. I've made most of the changes off line and didn't want to add them until I was finished (to avoid this). Without listing my entire bio, I'm 41 and I have founded 4 businesses, 1 fairly successful, 1 very successful, and 2 that failed. Fifty fifty ain't bad in the business building world!Egurr 00:24, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Ah, so this is your work entirely? Sorry, but Wikipedia has strict rules against <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. Plus, we already have an article about <a href="../../../s/m/a/Small_business.html" title="Small business">Small businesses</a>. While I appreciate your effort, I'm afraid this article doesn't sound like it fits on Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../k/e/s/User%7EKesh_2f01.html" title="User:Kesh">Kesh</a> 00:58, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Which is why, if you look above, I said I didn't want to cut and past from the original. And again, this has nothing to do with small business per se, but the process of creating a business idea.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think I'll just go ahead and fold this up and move the content as apparently I'm not able to get the idea across. I wanted to create an encyclopedic entry that explained in an unbiased approach what people like Hewlett and packard, Jobs, Gates, and Ford did with a business idea. In the end for wikipedia to remain vibrant, editors must have the final say, I just hope the editors of a category are truly expert in that category.Egurr 04:55, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

The Olympians they have produced are possibly worth their own articles, but the gym they trained in is not. Pure advertisement, nothing more.

<dd>Almost of the "references" provided for the article are from the local newspaper in the city in which the gym is located, and the information contained therein comes from the gym itself. They're promoting a local business. The two references from other places are a) an article about another business started by the coach; b) a business journal. There's absolutely nothing that would suggest that this gym is any more notable than any other gym producting elites in America, or that it has a history of sustained Olympic excellence (for instance, like Round Lake in Russia, the Karolyi gym or Deva in Romania) that would warrant an article. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielEng_df2b.html" title="User:DanielEng">DanielEng</a> 03:32, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>As an interested party in this (I created the page), I will try to add something to this stub to demonstrate sufficient notability. However, in the interim, please note that the amateur ornithology angle I am coming from is only one facet of this person. As far as judging notability by Google hits is concerned, one could try Googling 'Durno Murray' rather than 'Mitchell Durno Murray'. 'Mitchell' is seldom, if ever, used. <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMaias_ac15.html" title="User:Maias">Maias</a> 11:40, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Good point. It does put the spotlight on the notability (or not) of the Hobbs Medal. My feeling is that being awarded the Medal in itself makes the recipient notable. This is because a) it is a national award (rather than a regional or local one), b) it is made no more than once a year at most (i.e. they are not handed out like jellybeans), c) it is made by Australia's peak ornithologal body (the equivalent of the AOU plus the National Audubon Society in the USA, or the RSPB plus the BOU in the UK), and d) it is not made for 'amateur ornithology' but for 'ornithology as an amateur' (i.e. contributions to the science of ornithology, not recreational birding, by someone who is not being paid to do it, even though they may, as in the case of Durno Murray, be a professional in the biological sciences anyway). The equivalent, or sister award, for professionals in Australia is the <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serventy_Medal_bf4c.html" title="Serventy Medal">Serventy Medal</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/i/User%7EMaias_ac15.html" title="User:Maias">Maias</a> 01:28, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>Delete</b></p>
<hr />
<dl>
<dd><b>Considerations</b>:
<ul>
<li>Per the MONGO/ED arbitration, we probably cannot link to the site any longer as it now hosts attacks on Wikipedia editors. This does not affect the outcome.</li>
<li>Nmaster64 is blocked for gross incivility and attacks, both on and off Wikipedia, continuing long after the time when he had been told it was unacceptable to behave in this way. This does not affect the outcome.</li>
<li>Offsite solicitation took place, and several <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">brand new users</a> came along to venture an opinion. This does not, in and of itself, affect the outcome, but most of this input was (unsurprisingly) not founded on Wikipedia policies and guidelines. Welcome, please do spend some time reading the <a href="../../../5/p/_/WP%7E5P_c2b8.html" title="WP:5P">five pillars of Wikipedia</a> and turn your thinking round from "This is great, it must get an article", to "These are the standards, what subjects meet those standards". That works in a way that vote-staking a process-which-is-not-a-vote does not.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd><b>Arguments for deletion</b>:
<ul>
<li>Several editors argued that the comic fails the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">primary notability criterion</a>, being multiple non-trivial coverage in reliable, independent secondary sources. This is discussed in a subject-specific context at <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. This was not credibly rebutted.</li>
<li>It was argued that the comic achieves a low rating on the "Google test" (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=F%40NB0Y%24+comic&amp;start=60" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=F%40NB0Y%24+comic&amp;start=60" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>), under 80 unique hits. This is supporting information only, in that this list of hits does not appear to contain reliable sources and the small number of unique references indicates that such sources will probably be hard to find. Low unique Google hits is not a good sign for a web-based medium, but this is not in and of itself an argument for deletion.</li>
<li>Low Alexa rank (~ 250,000). Alexa ranks are open to manipulation, although a very low rank may, like a poor Google result, be an indicator that sources will be hard to come by.</li>
<li>Lack of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">independent non-trivial sources</a>: Noted by several editors, a compelling point not rebutted by any Keep advocates. Although there is legitimate debate about what precisely would constitute a reliable sources for a webcomic, there were really no sources to weigh up, either in the article or in the debate.</li>
<li><a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Original research</a>: Noted by some editors. The entire contents is indeed sourced solely from the comic and its associated forums. This speaks to the content more than the subject.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd><b>Arguments for retention</b>
<ul>
<li>Google searches are not in themselves reliable. Valid argument, but does not replace the Google test with anything that <i>does</i> indicate notability or importance.</li>
<li>Growing in popularity, receives thousands of hits. Interesting but not relevant, even if reliable independent sources existed. Thousands is a small number anyway, and "growing" is subjective and meaningless without a base figure.</li>
<li>Featured on (e.g.) Destructoid, Joystiq, Dueling Analogs. These are potential sources of neutral critical commentary, but no such commentary was in evidence. Simply <i>being</i> there is probably not enough; definition of <i>featured</i> is also open to interpretation.</li>
<li><a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">List of "less notable" comics</a>: Irrelevant, ignored.</li>
<li><a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">Eloquent testimony of impassioned fans</a>: Irrelevant, sorry, also ignored.</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/u/s/WP%7EJUSTAVOTE_222e.html" title="WP:JUSTAVOTE">No reasoning given</a>: Ignored, obviously.</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/b/f/WP%7EABF_c955.html" title="WP:ABF">Accusations of malice</a>: Ignored.</li>
<li>Joystiq Weekly webcomic award. Not actually an award, a weekly online poll. Slightly under 2,000 votes cast, and having seen the way the fanbase can be mobilised this may be due to astroturfing. The award itself does not appear to be particularly important, even if the site is, so this does not override lack of sources.</li>
<li>"<a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> does not allow webcomics" - an interesting argument, one which probably needs to be addressed somehow, but doesn't help us with sourcing.</li>
<li>"Per Nmaster64" might have been persuasive if Nmaster64's reasoning was stronger. Sadly it wasn't.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>Summary: On the weight of argument from policy and guidelines (which represent community consensus in a way a poll of a few editors does not), I must call this as Delete. It is not unlikely that at some time in the future we may have sufficient independent reliable sources for an article on this subject to be written. It is unlikely to be in the near future, though. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 17:33, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Strong Keep</b> Google searches to determine notability, in this case specifically, are not viable. The use of non-alphanumeric characters and the general reference to the comic as "fanboys", a term not easily searchable given it's common usage, especially within circles where it's popular, makes it completely unfair to judge in this manner. There is simply no good manner to search for this and return an accurate count which is usable to judge anything.</p>
<p>The comic has recently been featured on extremely popular gaming sites such as Destructoid, Joystiq, Dueling Analogs, and more. The comic is continuously growing in popularity, and receives thousands of hits a day. Certainly it has achieved a popularity higher than many of the comics on the wiki's list of webcomics.</p>
<p>The article itself is well-made and appears to meet all Wikipedia standards. Given it's growing popularity, it's winnings and features in Joystiq's weekly webcomic poll (Joystiq sits w/ an Alexa rating around 2000), and it's mention on numerous other gaming and comic sites around the net, I think F@NB0Y$ has certainly earned itself a small wikipedia article. I'd also like a viable explanation as to who the hell it's hurting by existing. This seems counter-intuitive to the concept of the Wikipedia, when good information is censored based on a few people who don't feel the work "popular enough". --Nmaster64 11:08, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Note: the list above marks every webcomic existing on the Wikipedia's <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_webcomics.html" title="List of webcomics">List of webcomics</a> that has a lower Alexa traffic rankings for it's domain than Fanboys-Online.com. This does not include any comics who's sites do not have data available, nor comics who's rankings are increased due to co-existing on a domain with other content or comics. Thus, it is likely the list is in reality longer.</p>
<p>Based on the above information, the basis that the webcomic F@NB0Y$ is non-notable is at best ridiculous, at worst an example of horrible bias. It's clear F@NB0Y$ is even at current a relatively popular webcomic, and with it's continued growth, especially as it begins to see more and more exposure, merits the existence of a Wiki article. --Nmaster64 15:02, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The above list looks like a ready-made batch AfD nomination. We don't have to keep non-notable things just because there are even less notable things which haven't been deleted yet. But that does not mean that the less notable things automatically get a pass when it comes to WP:N WP:V and WP:RS, such as the hundreds of Pokemon characters with their own articles and zero independent cites for notability. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 20:36, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If the Wikipedia guidelines cannot understand the concept of userbase, then they have failed. The point I'm trying to push forward is that F@NB0Y$ enjoys a much larger number of readers and traffic than a LARGE number of the "notable" webcomics, and therefore it is a given there are going to be more people interested in the Wiki entry than for some relatively unread webcomic who happens to have the "subject of multiple non-trivial published works" criteria met. Also, it is my opinion the comic HAS in addition met with <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, as Autodmc explained so well. I understand the need for notability guidelines, but if they've sunk to this point, then the Wikipedia is being limited and censored on a level that completely goes against the original principles of the project. --Nmaster64 16:23, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Common sense alone should garner the growing popularity given it's increase feature in the Joystiq polls, and it's recent features on numerous other webcomic sites and Destructoid. Alexa also shows a solid growth in traffic over time, especially recently. This is all coupled with direct speak from the author of the comic. I will see if I can't get any more specific information out of him regarding this. --Nmaster64 16:23, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It got a whole 911 votes at Joystiq. An informal, low turnout net poll is scrapping the barrel for notability.

<dd>The vote turnout is not as relevant as the site traffic. Joystiq marks probably the biggest gaming blog on the internet. That is hardly scrapping the barrel. Besides, I don't see why it's necessary a webcomic need some award or plaque to say their notable.</dd>
<dd>Website stats are conflict of interest? Wow, now I know the Wikipedia has failed. Opinion has overruled fact in an attempt to remain "neutral". That's both the funniest and most pitiful thing I've heard all week. --Nmaster64 18:58, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, regardless of all that, I'm going to post some anyway. I checked the tracker myself, independent of the creator, and found the comic averages almost 3,000 uniques a day, and over 17,000 a week. The comic nabbed over 74,000 in December, and almost 70,000 in the first half of January. This shows it's growing, and from what I've heard (even though I know it's "conflict of interest" due to source), this has been consistent with previous months. Also, I've found links to F@NB0Y$ featured everywhere from RPG-TV and Hockey Zombie to the Bungie blog. It's also somewhat notable also in my own opinion that this is all with practically no advertising or marketing, almost all word of mouth. I believe it was just yesterday Scott commented he was getting into advertising, so that should further grow the comic. --Nmaster64 19:44, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>If you contributed on a more even basis to Wikipedia, rather than just pushing one article, you would understand why we have to have strict rules on notability.

<dd>You can take your Wiki-Elitist attitude elsewhere, I fully comprehend the need for notability rules regardless of my contributions. I'm simply stating that if they contend with a webcomic with this level of traffic that has a well-made stub, then they have gotten TOO strict, and quite so. There is no harm in this article's existence, period. And the Comixpedia Wiki is simply a failure, although a F@NB0Y$ article is up there. Ironic to note, F@NB0Y$ has about twice the traffic ranking of that entire wiki. --Nmaster64 20:53, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Invalidated to your specifications, no doubt, but I remain unconvinced. It's obvious you're a fan - you're quite vocal about this on that forum. However, you're letting that blind you to the stark realities - outside your circle of fans, there doesn't seem to be much to back up the notability of the comic. Also, by trying to bring all those other webcomics into the argument, you're going for what's been called "<a href="../../../p/o/k/Wikipedia%7EPok%C3%A9mon_test_7449.html" title="Wikipedia:Pokémon test">The Pokemon Test</a>" - they aren't under discussion here, though. If you feel they're not worthy, take it to those pages and initiate AfDs there, if you have valid reasons to do so and solid evidence as to why they're not notable. But the simple fact that they exist isn't reason enough to keep this one.
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I'm an avid fan of F@NB0Y$. Regardless, I've always been an avid fan of the Wikipedia and it's founding principles, however this insanity completely shatters that in my own opinion. The need for some notability standards is obvious, but when you approach this level, there's no viable argument as to what it's hurting by having this article exist. If I hadn't spent a good 6 to 8 hours of my life writing it, it might not bother me so much...</dd>
<dd>I'm using a variation of the Pokemon Test, I admit. Well, I'm a supporter of the Pokemon test. If X is more notable than Y, but X is "not notable enough", than Y should not exist. Thus, go get Y deleted then come back and you have an argument to delete X. That's my thoughts on the Pokemon test. --Nmaster64 18:58, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, since I was a bit bored at the moment, I did a little searching on my own. According to <a href="http://www.thewebcomiclist.com/p/5645/fanboys-beyond-geekdom" class="external text" title="http://www.thewebcomiclist.com/p/5645/fanboys-beyond-geekdom" rel="nofollow">this page</a>, <i>Fanboys</i> is currently ranked 2475 out of 8163 webcomics. Let's look at some of the first few on your list - <i>Achewood</i> is #202, <i>Alecto: Songbook</i> is #3545, <i>Alice!</i> is #2133, <i>Angels2200</i> is #89, <i>AntiHero for Hire</i> is #61... I'm not going to go through the entire list, though. However, a quick glance at those comics Wikipedia pages shows that <i>Achewood</i> has apparently seen some actual print publication, <i>Alecto: Songbook</i> has been physically published, as has <i>Alice!</i> - all solid bases for notability. Also, check the discussion page for <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> - Alexa rankings (none of which your provided, just the claim that <i>Fanboys</i> is higher) is no longer considered a valid source due to some reporting problems it has with some platforms. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRealFennShysa_6315.html" title="User:TheRealFennShysa">TheRealFennShysa</a> 17:22, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Uh, that entry is for a different comic. Check the web address, it's missing a dash...If you don't believe my Alexa rankings, check 'em yourself, I gave the URLs. Many of them sit in the millions, nowhere remotely close to F@NB0Y$. Any way you look at it, F@NB0Y$ seems to certainly have enough readers it should merit a frikkin' Wikipedia article. When it comes to something like a webcomic, magazine, newspaper, websites in general, anything that's got a "subscription" type release schedule like that, should be judged more on it's reach and reader base than links from other sites. I'm a game journalist, and used to run my own news site. I could probably link to a hundred sites that sourced me for stuff, hell even the Wikipedia entry for Wii once linked back to me. Does that give my site notability to where I could create an article for my site? I never thought so, because despite my success in marketing, I had a very low consistent reader base. By the standards your pushing forth however, my site deserved a Wiki article more than a site with a thousand times my traffic but without the links from Slashdot and everyone else. That just doesn't make sense, that's not how things should be judged. Then your playing into marketing, which is supposed to be what the Wiki tries to avoid... --Nmaster64 18:58, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Maybe you don't grasp this...there is this big ol' banner at the top of the article's page that says "This is up for deletion!". I didn't have to point out the deletion debate, other people just kinda noticed ('cause, ya know, they can read it without my help?). The fact a discussion arose on said topic is not solicitation, it's just that, discussion. The topic at hand was the wiki article, so whenever people go and see that huge banner at the top, you can't claim that as solicitation/meatpuppeting/canvasing/etc. You can't hang a sign above your head saying "COME HERE!" and then blame someone else when other people come over.

<dd>I reiterate the idea of simply setting up redirects to each comic's respective Comixpedia article, assuming a viable one exists or the Wiki entry is good enough to move over. It seems like an awesome solution for a large number of webcomics that don't supposedly quite meet Wiki standards. The Wiki can just toss users over there and wash their hands of the matter. Seems like that would make most everyone happy... --Nmaster64 07:19, 18 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I suppose they could be moved over, but we can't have a bunch of redirects to external wikis. Pages on Wikipedia that warrant their own content can link off to their specialized wiki site (like <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memory_Alpha_f337.html" title="Memory Alpha">Memory Alpha</a>).

<dd>It's as I assumed then. What about an extremely small stub that essentially says, "this is a webcomic. You can find out more about from the comixpedia," or something simple like that? I can even go a step further to try to make some people happy. What if instead of each getting it's own page redirecting to the comixpedia, there was a single page internally where they all redirected to that either maintains a list of links for these comics and their comixpedia articles, or simply even just links to the Comixpedia's list of comics. Anything, just <b>as long as someone who comes to the Wikipedia searching for information on a given webcomic are able to easily and quickly find the information they were looking for</b> (assuming of course it exists). That is my goal, and seems like it should be the goal of the Wikipedia... --Nmaster64 18:36, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>We have something similar already set up on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_webcomics.html" title="List of webcomics">list of webcomics</a>, as well as a link to Comixpedia at the end. It isn't necessary to specifically link off every webcomic listing to its respective Comixpedia article (otherwise it may bring up issues of Wikipedia endorsing Comixpedia, stuff like that), but a blurb could be added to the intro of the list saying that most/all of the listed webcomics have a page on Comixpedia (if a bunch of them ended up being deleted off Wikipedia). <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarson_Lam_29de.html" title="User:Carson Lam">Carson</a> 19:57, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I'd say keep if it was a little older. The problem with webcomics is that they tend to die out quite fast. Some of the 'accepted' Wiki-articles have the same thing also.</li>
<li>I would propose to give a certain age-limit for webcomics to be included. And if they are regularly updated still, and show a real sign of life, don't nag too much about notability. If they're too young, only include them if they've won a notable award or have gotten notable attention. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackSparrow_Ninja_f7b7.html" title="User:JackSparrow Ninja">JackSparrow Ninja</a> 12:46, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>That seems like a reasonable idea to me. A hard age limit that requires younger webcomics to provide a touch more evidence of notability. That works against my case for Fanboys, but it makes sense. Webcomics that are no longer updated should be assessed to see if they hold any historical value or can be considered to have had been big enough they merit staying archived, which probably eliminates most webcomics once they've stopped updating. If it's current and popular, it should be here. If it dies off without leaving notable impact, just delete it at that point... --Nmaster64 15:36, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>---<b>Propositions seperate from "keep" and "delete"</b>---</p>
<p>A couple ideas hit me for more reasonable answers to this debate, and I thought I'd throw them out for consideration.</p>
<ul>
<li>Delete and merge with <a href="http://www.bombsheltercomics.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.bombsheltercomics.com/" rel="nofollow">Bomb Shelter Comics</a>. Since F@NB0Y$ exists under the umbrella of Bomb Shelter Comics, it seems feasible if a quality article could be written for the webcomic group, the F@NB0Y$ article could be shrunk and merged into it. The Bomb Shelter Comics would serve as a good single article listing that particular group of smaller webcomics, and thus could stem this occurance from happening again with any of the other comics in that group. If none of the comics in that group are considered notable, it seems to make sense all of them combined likely do. This is of course assuming the fact some independent sources can be found to help define the included comic's and/or the group's notability.</li>
<li>Article redirect to the comic's <a href="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/F%40NB0Y%24" class="external text" title="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/F%40NB0Y%24" rel="nofollow">Comixpedia</a> page. If it doesn't merit it's own big Wikipedia entry, why not hand it off to the Wiki for comics? This seems harmless and win-win, and seems to me a good solution to 99% of webcomic article debates.</li>

<li>Web traffic is an effective negative argument for notability, but not a positive one except at extreme levels. In other words, getting 200,000 google hits doesn't make you automatically notable, but only getting 12 does make you automatically non-notable (unless you're like an 8th century philosopher only mentioned in Persian texts and academic papers, or something else pre-internet). --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 08:54, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>You obviously have no clue what makes a web page notable by Wikipedia standards, as there are many other reasons a web page can receive little or no traffic (without being of historic value) and still be notable.

<li>I'm <a href="../../../b/e/t/Betting_%28poker%29.html#Call" title="Betting (poker)">calling</a> you on that one. The three criteria for notability are independant mentions, republication by a notable independant source, and awards from notable independant sources. No notable website exists which is not either historically important or high traffic for its field. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 00:32, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'll call you both. Tjstrf is indeed technical correct about what Wikipedia standards state in terms of requirements for notability. However, Tjstrf, I'd request you point out to me how each of the comics on the Wiki meet those criteria. In terms of historical importance or republication, VERY, VERY, few qualify. Even some insanely popular ones like Dr. McNinja or VGCats don't seem to fit the criteria. The third criteria, "independent mentions", needs to be much more defined, as it's obvious there is argument over how many mentions are needed, and of who qualifies as a source reputable enough to make a mention. I would say that by these policies only a handful of comics should exist, certainly 90% of the list above should disappear, which personally seems unacceptable. We are knee-deep in a horrific case of double standards... --Nmaster64 01:17, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>, Your opinions of my reasoning are both severely flawed and meaningless. My feelings are in no way limited to this specific article, and I am not asking for a change in policy JUST for this webcomic. It's obvious the policies are poorly written and need to be better established first off, and second off it disturbs me so many people can be so blindly faithful to them, condemning any varying opinion or disagreement thereof. It's this close-mindedness that I cannot tolerate and bear no apologies when referencing anyone who thinks as such as "stupid". You can accuse me of meatpuppetry 'til your blue in the face, but the majority of people here are of the Wiki community, not from any of my own. I honestly could give a crap less about the vote at this point, I have a more vested interest in seeing a reasonable middle ground be found so as to not deprive those seeking information. I don't care if it's F@NB0Y$, ExtraLife, or any comic on that entire list above, 90% of which I've never heard of, regardless, if I'm looking for information on them the Wikipedia should either be able to provide it or point me to the correct Wiki that holds it. I argue I am not misusing the term censoring because it seems to me that Wikipedia holds a strong biased against webcomics, among other things, and in a certain sense does look upon it as objectionable.</dd>
<dd>Say what you will about me, accuse me of whatever, but when it comes down to it I am the one trying to help the USERS of Wikipedia. The opinions of this community, which the majority of portray themselves as nothing less than elitists, are of no concern to me. It's the people, like myself, who find the Wikipedia a valuable resource and feel it should strive to be the best source of information available I look to. Does that mean maintain a directory and entry on every little webcomic ever made? No, certainly not. But it does mean possibly toning down the notability requirements, looking to reader base as a viable means of judging notability, and most importantly, at the least, pointing users to where they might find the information they are looking for. A comic on the notability and with a user base on the level of F@NB0Y$ <i>at least</i> deserves so much as a "This is a webcomic, you can find more information on it at it's entry on the Comixpedia, the Wiki for comics, found <a href="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/F@NB0Y$" class="external text" title="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/F@NB0Y$" rel="nofollow">here</a>." (and there are even less obtrusive ways I can suggest too) If you find that as unacceptable, then please evaluate on the damage such a thing causes by existing, as I can certainly describe the negatives of giving users pages that say "Sorry, we've got info on this, or at least know where to find it, but refuse to give it to you because WE don't think it's important enough. Your own opinion is of no impact, as your just a filthy user." That is what is being portrayed to me by this event. --Nmaster64 00:19, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>, it's amusing the endless accusations of meatpuppetry, when there are only maybe 2 or 3 votes here I can see as being from a link of my own that could be considered as such. A couple people is a far cry from an army, and it seems to me it's being used simply to dodge any legitimate discussion on the matter. The people on the forum already agreed they'd keep away, and I've stressed to non-Wiki members not to get involved. Honestly though, I fail to see why a couple outside users completely demolishes the establishment of a resolution, and in all reality it seems the Wiki community could use a little bit of outside opinion, as it seems to close-minded in it's own. The "outsiders aren't welcome" policy is kind of ridiculous in a certain light, ya know? Believe it or not, the <i>users</i> of the Wikipedia may feel different from the <i>editors</i>, and it may be a <i>good</i> idea to interact with them. In the case of a <i>yay</i> or <i>nay</i> vote of course it's a problem and nothing comes of it but arguing. However, it's amazing if you think outside the box for a second then there may be actually be an option OTHER than <i>keep</i> or <i>delete</i> that can satisfy people on both sides, although that can only be achieved through <i>discussion</i> and putting new ideas forth. I personally would much more enjoy hearing different ideas being tossed around than this "eff you webcomic people"/"well eff you wiki people" that this is degrading into, <i>partly</i> of my own fault I admit. --Nmaster64 00:19, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Many of the webcomics articles seem well researched, and fairly easy to verify (you just go to the webcomic pages and see for yourself). Note that some of the webcomics in the lower alexa rank list are likely going to be quite easy to verify because they have a lot written about them, or are very old, or both. For instance a webcomic that ran last century is not going to have a high alexa rank today, for instance. It can be very notable if it has since influenced much newer comics. On the flip side, a comic with a higher alexa rank could be rather non-encyclopedic.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So, if you use the measures some people are proposing, we'll end up deleting a number of historical and notable webcomics, that have contributed to web culture greatly, and simultaniously we'd end up keeping a bunch of one-day flies.</dd>

<li>Thanks for that. People don't understand I'm more interested in discussion and resolution than votes. And furthermore they don't realize I am pretty much alone here, I have no army or helpers in this matter, at most just a few people on the sidelines cheering me on. As for outside sources, an honest question, where do you expect me to go? What IS considered a notable mention for a webcomic? Nobody talks about webcomics except blogs, there are no really good sources for these cases. It's just one of those things, a webomic could have a million readers but that doesn't mean the New York Times is gonna comment on them. That's my problem with the notability standards, there needs to be some way to acknowledge webcomics that most certainly have a really big following, even if their only claim to fame is a few of the more popular blogs (and I'm speaking in general here, not necessarily just in the case of F@NB0Y$). There HAS to be a way to do that, although I admit I haven't come up with a good solution yet myself... --Nmaster64 15:36, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b>: After seeing Joe Loves Crappy Movies get deleted from Wikipedia I've become convinced that Wikipedians simply don't want Wikipedia to fulfil the idea that you can find any information about anything on it. I understand that many people try to use Wikipedia as a way to advertise and get hits to their webpage (anyone remember Jesus Camp?). However, F@NB0Y$ is not using Wikipedia any more than any other person that has an article about them on Wiki. Just because the comic is not notable to one person, doesn't mean it isn't notable to the people that view it. I bring to light evidence A, the fact that <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torchic.html" title="Torchic">Torchic</a> was a featured main page article recently. ALL information is notable. Pop culture classification does not mean that it has no merit as knowledge. Webcomics have become extremely popular and the more we know about them the more we can study the trends. You all have to realize that Penny Arcade was once just a no nothing comic like this one and has since then become one, if not THE, most dominent name in the gamer subculture. Deleting yet another webcomic on the grounds of notability doesn't make sense because the notability of anything comes down to personal bias. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeirToPendragon_b665.html" title="User:HeirToPendragon">H2P</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../h/e/i/User_talk%7EHeirToPendragon_c05a.html" title="User talk:HeirToPendragon">Yell at me</a> for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HeirToPendragon_68aa.html" title="Special:Contributions/HeirToPendragon">what I've done</a>)</sup> 17:43, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>While I agree with you to a point H2P with the idea that notability is in a sense "in the eyes of the beholder", <i>and non-notability just the same</i>, we do have to recognize the need for some standards and requirements in terms of independent sources. I just feel people don't recognize that in the case of webcomics, there are almost no sources to pull from. Nobody talks about webcomics besides blogs. F@NB0Y$ getting the props from Joystiq, Destructoid, as well as numerous other "notable" webcomics seems to me about as good as it gets. Looking at traffic, we know it gets thousands of hits a day, so that seems like a decent reader base to me. At that point, what's the harm in the article existing, or maybe a stub pointing to it's Comixpedia? --Nmaster64 19:20, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The harm is in information which is not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliably sourced</a> existing on Wikipedia. If blog mentions are "as good as it gets", the subject <i>is not notable</i>, and <i>does not belong here</i>. There are certainly webcomics such as Penny Arcade which <i>do</i> meet the standards, but if most webcomics don't, that doesn't mean they need a "special exception"-it means, until those webcomics start attracting wider and reliable attention, they're not suitable for articles yet. As to a "link to Comixpedia", <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a directory of links. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 14:20, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Except it's not a matter of it not being notable. Millions of people read webcomics, there's plenty of proof to show they have a substantial following.

<dd>Have you read the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> guideline? It doesn't leave much up to chance, and any "up in the air" certainly doesn't apply to articles that have little or no third-party sourcing at all (as found in most Webcomics articles). Face it, the articles are (for the most part) completely <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, primarily because third party reliable sources don't write about each webcomic, because (in the big scheme of things) the comics really are not notable (despite how notable a wikicommunity fanbase thinks). So, even if you get over the hurdle of our (wikipedia) measure of notability (which is still contested by some), there is probably little (if any) chance that there will ever be <i>reliable</i> third party sources (as defined in the guideline). QED they will, most likely, never truely be in compliance with our most basic principles on Wikipedia. <b>That</b> is why they keep showing up in AfD -- no matter how many different ways you slice it, the fundamental problem (which most seem to conveniently overlook) remains. /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaxthos_9d7e.html" title="User:Blaxthos">Blaxthos</a> 18:56, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Then there should be talks and ideas thrown forth upon how that fundamental problem may be resolved. Nothing with Wikipedia is set in stone, and even if it seems impossible to you, that hardly means there aren't possible solutions. Could there be a reliable way of measuring traffic? Should a comics <a href="http://www.thewebcomiclist.com/p/7548/FNB0Y" class="external text" title="http://www.thewebcomiclist.com/p/7548/FNB0Y" rel="nofollow">ranking</a> be taken into account? Is there a good way to use the Comixpedia for handling these? There are a number of things that seem open to discussion and possible middle-grounds to find other than "screw all webcomics" and "every webcomic deserves a page". Good solutions never lie in extremes.</dd>
<dd>Remember, the goal is simply to give users the information they're looking, or at least point them in the right direction.

<dd>Yeah, we can read. Still, for instance some people are calling Joystiq a non-reliable source PURELY because it's defined as a "blog". Last I checked though, they're an official member of the press and get into every event the industry offers pretty much. They've got more clout in the industry press-wise than much of the media it seems. Destructoid is not far behind in those terms either. They're just as reliable as the NYT as far as I'm concerned, being labeled a blog just gives them some leeway in joking around and being a little less "professional" in their writing. It doesn't change the validity of their articles however... --Nmaster64 10:20, 21 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>From official policy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html#SELF" title="WP:V">WP:V#SELF</a>: <i>self-published books, personal websites, and blogs are largely not acceptable as sources. Self-published material may be acceptable when produced by a well-known, professional researcher in a relevant field or a well-known professional journalist. These may be acceptable so long as their work has been previously published by reliable third-party publications. However, exercise caution: if the information in question is really worth reporting, someone else is likely to have done so.</i> I think that pretty much hits the nail on the head -- unless a reliable third party has published the blog's finding (WP:RS back in the mix), it doesn't really meet the exception requirement. Also, I believe the NYT and Washington Post are held to a little bit higher scrutiny and credibility standards than a blog (hence the policy). /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaxthos_9d7e.html" title="User:Blaxthos">Blaxthos</a> 10:39, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I've read that before, and I'm saying that if Joystiq is not considered a reputable source, than reputable sources do not exist on the internet. On this I stand 100% firm, <i>if a site like Joystiq is not to be considered a reliable source, then the policy is <b>wrong</b>, in every possible way, and needs to be changed immediately</i>. Personally, I don't think it was the intention necessarily to block a site like Joystiq, because it's far from your "typical" blog. I just think it's sort of a casualty of generalization, and some clarification is needed. They are an official member of the gaming media, and generally have full press access to most everything. Barring a couple non-printed sources like IGN, they are about as reliable as come. Their articles might not go through the rigorous editing processes the others do, and they have a bit more freedom on what they can write about, but it hardly makes them any less notable. Them, and a handful of other extremely popular multi-editor blogs are reliable sources, and if the policy has been adapted to the strict level where none of these can be referenced as sources for notability, then it needs to be changed ASAP, because that conception is ridiculous. --Nmaster64 18:29, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

For example...Joystiq is not a single guy in his basement ranting about his life, it's a rather large team of people who are industry insiders and for the most part do this for a living. If that doesn't fit the exception, then it's NOT a general rule, and yeah, it should be changed. The only eye I'm spitting in is editors refuse to allow the concept that <i>maybe the guidelines are wrong</i>, that <i>maybe we could make things better with a little change</i>, into their mind. You say I'm explaining away every delete, but aren't you and the other editors doing the same with every keep? All you can seem to respond with is "the rules say that doesn't count" and "ZOMG Meatpuppets!" You refute everything with a simple WP link, and nobody even seems open to thinking about non-keep/non-delete solutions...</dd>
<dd>This isn't an isolated case, it's one among many. At some point, people should be willing to stand up and say "hey, maybe we should try something else. This ain't working too well..." Simply put: having thousands of thousands of readers makes you notable, in a most true sense, so the question that should be asked is how can that be established in certainty, since no one magical trustworthy source just gives us this information.</dd>
<dd>And honestly, I'd still like a <i>good</i> explanation as to why there is such voracity in getting things like this removed, the articles seem 100% harmless too me, and don't understand the concept of limiting information on this level... --Nmaster64 20:20, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think you're missing the point of NMaster's use of the other articles as examples. He simply meant to point out that Fanboys' Alexa ranking isn't such a low rank, as there are many notable comics on Wikipedia with lower rankings. It was not a defense of the article itself, just pointing out the significance of Fanboys' Alexa rank, as it is a relative measurement. I could be wrong, but that is how I took his list of references, or else I think he would have linked the articles themselves, not the websites of the comics. <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZaron_4a89.html" title="User:Zaron">Zaron</a> 04:42, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

But the idea of comparing to ALL of them is the idea of proof in numbers.

<p>Ok this is getting out of hand. Nmaster has brought it up and I'm going to bring it up again, and I don't want to see another "delete: per nom" or WEB reference until this is answered. WHERE do you guys want us to get sources? This is the main problem WEB presents to Webcomics. They aren't notable in the academic world so we can't pull the information from CNN or anything similar. I know on the TV show I edit we can site episodes for the information, is there a way to do this here? Is there a way to directly site the author through an e-mail or something? If you can answer this then we will go to work and find the sources. But you can't just sit there at your desk claiming we don't have sources and not verifying what constitutes as a source.

<dd>I'm just really confused as to what the sources are supposed to prove. Are they supposed to prove that the comic exists, cause a quick link to its site will prove that. Sources are supposed to back up claims. I'm not saying this page is perfect, it does lack... content of any kind (nMaster go actually write something about it on the page!) and I may just be jumping here because of the WP as a whole (in which case someone point me to where I can open a discussion).

<dd>Well removing PA, pages about authors not the comic, and comics that were in print before the web, I get three. Megatokyo may as well be a comic book in terms of comparison to other smaller comics with many readers. So really the only links you give me lead to one comic currently with an AfD and one comic that is one paragraph wrong with two sources to random lists in a couple of magazines. All these webcomics out there with thousands of readers don't fit into any catagories that is approved. So where do we put them? I can't agree with you that they just don't belong. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeirToPendragon_b665.html" title="User:HeirToPendragon">H2P</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../h/e/i/User_talk%7EHeirToPendragon_c05a.html" title="User talk:HeirToPendragon">Yell at me</a> for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HeirToPendragon_68aa.html" title="Special:Contributions/HeirToPendragon">what I've done</a>)</sup> 17:05, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, so I don't even know where to jump into that...but this is some good discussion. First off...I did something wrong with the article? Damn, I thought I did pretty good...well, what's it missing content-wise? Second, I've definitely got a problem with policies if they <i>require</i> historical significance. It seems to me the Wiki should be worried about <i>current</i> significance, not historical (in regards to things that are in fact current and updating of course). So, for example in the case of webcomics, a very popular comic should get it's own article, IMO. If that comic stops updating or disappears or whatever, then the article needs to have it's historical significance put into question, and most in most cases the article should be deleted.</dd>
<dd>As for sources, H2P is hitting around what's been bugging me. Now let's compare to TV shows for example. TV shows are big business (funny how Wikipedia is pro-BigBiz, anti-LittleGuy, eh?), so no surprise there are all sorts of sources looking at them. Some are probably even paid by the people making or airing the shows. So tell me, does it make a TV show immediately notable when some published source reviews them, even though it's that sources job to review <i>every</i> show? See, there are sources for many mediums that will look through EVERYTHING that comes their way. <i>Any</i> show that comes on a major network is gonna be noted and reviewed by someone. That doesn't mean anybody watches it though, or that it has any historical significance. It could get canceled the next week, but because there's a paid published source that mentions it, that makes it notable? Seems money is defining notability here...and I don't see why being printed on a piece of paper makes you any more verifiable than being stuck on a screen. There is no evidence some of the rags that do entertainment reviews have higher editing standards than say Joystiq, that's purely a conception.</dd>
<dd>I'm also wondering about why site statistics like it's <a href="http://www.thewebcomiclist.com/p/7548/FNB0Y" class="external text" title="http://www.thewebcomiclist.com/p/7548/FNB0Y" rel="nofollow">rank</a> and stats from independent sources, like <a href="http://extremetracking.com/" class="external text" title="http://extremetracking.com/" rel="nofollow">eXTReMe Tracking</a> can't be used. It seems to me if you've got hard number data on visitors, then it should be easy to define in those cases whether something has enough readership to garner an article... --Nmaster64 18:20, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

The fact is, most people in the population at large would get the "Giant Enemy Crab" jokes, but those who do, would find them absolutely hilarious.

<li><b>KEEP</b> Though this discussion seems to be going down hill there are a few clear issues that need to be adressed. First of all policy states that for a web related article to be notable it must meet one of three criteria. The second criteria is that the subject in question must have one a notable award. Fanboys Online has won the Joystiq Weekly webcomic award. One can debate the worth of an award who's winner is determined by a web poll but two things are a bundantly clear. The award was awarded by a notable body as Joystiq itself passes the notability tests which makes it valid and the means of conducting polling and determining the winner of said award, is an accepted method. Hundreds of notable, undisputed awards are determined by web polls including the 2005 and 2006 People's Choice Awards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inaccoredence with the policy these awards are noted on the article page.</p>
<p>People are also using meatpuppetry as a reason for deleteing the article are just absurd as it completely throws all acedemic merit out the window in favour of spite. Since the subject of the article is not doing this themselves it hard seems right to use it as a reason to remove the article.</p>
<p>I suggest a quick read over of <a href="../../../a/r/g/Wikipedia%7EArguments_to_avoid_in_deletion_discussions_1a86.html" title="Wikipedia:Arguments to avoid in deletion discussions">Wikipedia:Arguments to avoid in deletion discussions</a> by anyone trying to use the Google test as evidence either for or against the deletion. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Njiska (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Njiska_47dd.html" title="Special:Contributions/Njiska">contribs</a>) 04:54, 23 January 2007 (UTC).</small><small>— Njiska (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Njiska_47dd.html" title="Special:Contributions/Njiska">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> What <i>EXACTLY</i> in this article is unverifiable and needs sources? If this comic is as notable as people say it is, then it should be easy to back this up with evidence. This could simple be a case of the article being worded poorly and in a way that makes it seem less notable than it really is. Rather than run around in circles with keep vs delete, we should consider cleaning it up and adding more 3rd party sources to it. I'm seeing people throw <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> around, but I would like to know what exactly in the article is original research. --skyman8081 04:45, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Neutral</b> - This AfD has clearly provoked greater strength of feeling, on both sides, than any other in which I've participated. It might be a good idea for the various users above - both pro- and anti-deletion - to stop arguing for a while and give everyone else a chance to state their opinion. Personally I lean towards deletion, as it would be a bad precedent to state that all webcomics with a large fan base are inherently notable (not to mention a fairly broad interpretation of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>). Yet at the same time I can see the argument for keeping this article, so don't treat the above as a "vote" for deletion (not that we technically "vote" on these anyway). To any admin planning on closing this AfD, I certainly wouldn't advocate deletion now that it's provoked so much ill-feeling. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 17:11, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I'm not really for the keeping of this article as it is. It needs serious clean up and actually something worth reading as it really has no decription other than character bios. My main problems with this AfD right now is the constant deletings of every webcomic with a page on Wiki. WEB doesn't allow for webcomics (other than like 5) to have pages and I think the policy itself needs to be looked into and that the delete happy manuevers be toned down to allow all the webcomics out there to catch up. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeirToPendragon_b665.html" title="User:HeirToPendragon">H2P</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../h/e/i/User_talk%7EHeirToPendragon_c05a.html" title="User talk:HeirToPendragon">Yell at me</a> for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HeirToPendragon_68aa.html" title="Special:Contributions/HeirToPendragon">what I've done</a>)</sup> 17:20, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Do be careful though-by submitting to Wikipedia, you don't just need the artist's permission for use <i>on Wikipedia</i>. Unless it's used under fair use (which is not allowed on userpages, but is in some cases in articles, for example a single comic panel could be used under fair use in an article about that comic), the artist would have to agree to release under <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>, which would mean, among other things, anyone in the world could make use of the webcomic so long as they follow the GFDL's terms, on a personal or commercial or any other type of site.

<li><b>Keep and Stop Being Trolls</b> I know I don't have many edits under my belt and they are all about web comics. I can also tell by the timbre of this discussion that somebody is going to make a snarky comment about that. This has gone beyond childish into the realm of the absurd. If you want to accuse someone of being a talking head or "puppetmaster" it's very easy to do because you can hide behind your monitor and flame away. It's much harder to actually try and see both sides of an issue. We're seeing trolling from both sides of the fence and the delete trolls are being down right rude. If you are stepping in just to call someone a "meatpuppet" then don't post because you honestly have NOTHING PRODUCTIVE to add to this conversation. SPA's are just as valid as chronic posters so back off of them. More posts does not make you more important. People tend to forget that. It is a neutral article that is strictly informational. All the information is verifiable by outside sources. The nasty comments about notability are 100% SUBJECTIVE. You can say whatever you want about how notable something is and change your criteria the next day. It's the same as having a discussion over what supermodel is the skinniest choosing weight one day and the number of ribs you can count the next. It's pointless unless you agree ahead of time what your metric will be. Let's get back to being grown-ups and present some more cogent, FACT-based arguments. If you want to use metrics such as Alexa, get together and set up official rules about what parameters make that metric valid. The government assigns committees that evaluate what metrics to use and how to use them. It generally takes them 6 to 12 months to institute a single metric. I figure the wiki community can do it in 3 - 6 weeks. So let's get started. -- <a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBrutilus_762d.html" title="User:Brutilus">Brutilus</a> 10:56, 23 January 2007</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a>. Lists are appropriate to to wikipedia, including stand-alone lists. Rather than having a 50 long bullet list at the end of every article on this list for similar sites, its spun off in one link to a list. Spinning off long sections to new articles is long practice on wikipedia. This article is well watched to remove any spam. These links do not link (at least they shouldn't maybe they need checked) directly to the websites and instead link to their wikipedia articles. As for it being a directory, its not. its not different than a see also section of any other article on any other subject. The subject has simply become so large and encompassing so many articles that it is better served as a single article.

This is a neutral message, identical to the one which was posted last summer when this was up for deletion. Many people watch those articles, but don't watch this article, even though its deletion would effect the article. They would have to work some kind of lengthy see also list into their article were it to be deleted, or then work on a policy for which sites should be listed as see also, because if they try to artificially limit it, you're going to have people constantly trying to add to it. It would be very different if I were to say go about targeting individuals who I know always make keep statements or who I know shared my opinion. The message is neutral, bipartisan and open.

<dd>Thats right and my intent was rather clear from the accompanying edit you left out which is above, where I was honest and forthcoming about the neutral and non-partisan messages I left on the talk pages of articles which would be effected by the outcome of this discussion. You cannot selectively pick edits out of a group and claim you know my intent while ignoring the one edit which did explain my intent. You can continue to assume bad faith if you like, but I was quite clear on my intent and you still haven't show even the slightest hint of anything I did that could be seen as attempting to sway the AfD in a particular direction, because there isn't anything.

<dd>Hence your assumption of bad faith. Perhaps you cannot remain neutral in asking for input after taking a stance on an issue, but I have no such trouble and you made a bad assumption. And again you continue to make insults. You assume I wasn't being neutral, but I've challenged you several times to indicate where in the messages I left there was any degree of partisanship. As you've failed yet again, and only continue to hurl baseless insults and accusations I believe we're done here. My edits and behaviour stands on their merit. There wasn't a remote hint of partisanship in the messages I left, there was unchallenged precedent for those messages being left on related talk pages, they were completely neutral in tone, and honestly, this AfD isn't remotely contentious as not a single person has shown up to agree with you that it should be removed. In fact I'm surprised an administrator hasn't closed it on the basis of speedy keep or WP:SNOW at this point. I was also forth-right and honest in the fact that those messages asking for input per those reasons would be left, as soon as they were challenged, I ceased leaving them. You've been asked to stop assuming bad faith and to stop making personal attacks, as you've failed to do so the discussion on my part is done here.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 07:20, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Withdrawal of deletion nomination</b> consensus on Keep was established quickly, appears to have a fairly Good layout, better than most lists. I still believe this would be better served as a (self-maintaining) category, however, by watching edits to the article during this Afd, it apears to be maintaied well from the recent spam attempts. I believe that to be the most important aspect, and main reason for withdraw. keep it up!--<a href="../../../h/u/1/User%7EHu12_d0ca.html" title="User:Hu12">Hu12</a> 17:11, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Terms restricted to internet use (including LOL and ASL) are within Wikipedia's collection. That these may or may not appear in a dictionary has no bearing on the usefulness of the entry.

<p>It should be deleted because translation projects are not translating images. And even if translation projects allow the translation of images, nobody (probably not even university professors) could really interpret the meaning of those words because it was written at 222 AD (almost 2000 years ago). To put it in western perspective, you're analyzing something much older than Shakespeare's language and we all know that some words can't be translated nowadays in Shakespeare's plays. <a href="../../../o/h/a/User%7EOhanaUnited_21f4.html" title="User:OhanaUnited"><span style="background-color:#DDDDFF; font-weight:bold"><font color="#0000FF">OhanaUnited</font></span></a> 05:37, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The band does not meet the touring criterion, as it has not actually happened yet, and the record label is not established as a major or an important minor label, so that criterion is not met either.

<p>I have followed the progress of The Enigma Project for a considerable length of time now. It is true that at the time of creation, this article did not meet the required criterion. However, as it currently stands the BBC Has articles on their website regarding the band <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/content/articles/2005/06/01/localband_enigmaproject_feature.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/content/articles/2005/06/01/localband_enigmaproject_feature.shtml" rel="nofollow">Enigma Project BBC Article exhibit A</a> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/content/articles/2006/11/29/enigma_project_christmas_party_feature.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/content/articles/2006/11/29/enigma_project_christmas_party_feature.shtml" rel="nofollow">Enigma Project BBC Article Exhibit B</a>. This thus means the band has at least met the criterion for a verifyable article by a notable company, and hence, the band's notability is confirmed as it has met one of the criterion, which is all that is required according to <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>. Furthermore, Itunes (on which The Enigma Project's work can be found) is significantly notable- could this be counted as a label of production? Finally The broadcast 1 hour long on the BBC Berkshire mainstream radio confirms this band's notability. Therefore, I feel that this article no longer qualifies for deletion under Wikipedia's policy, as any artist must only meet ONE of the criterion listed on the link given earlier- as such I would move that this discussion is closed? <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowpaladin_f12d.html" title="User:Shadowpaladin">Phil</a> 10:52, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Thirdly, isolated quotes do not constitute non-trivial coverage, full articles do. And fourthly, still no one has explained whether the band was the subject of the entire hour broadcast, or merely appeared on a brief portion of it, which I believe would definately <i>not</i> meet the criterion. — <a href="../../../s/w/p/User%7ESwpb_9c6b.html" title="User:Swpb">Swpb</a> <sup><i><a href="../../../s/w/p/User_talk%7ESwpb_ffe5.html" title="User talk:Swpb">talk</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swpb_aa66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swpb">contribs</a></i></sup> 17:26, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you would research into the show in question on BBC radio Berkshire you will find that bands are the feature of the show. They are subject to an hour long show being interviewed and even playing live on the shows. They played two songs on the show and interviewed for at least 45 mins. This means an hour long broadcast purley on this band. More information about the show can be found on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/the_session/index.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/the_session/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/the_session/index.shtml</a>.

Those are two articles from different sources, on top of the other quotes, on top of the hour long radio programme. There surely cannot be any reason to delete the article, as more than one criteria stated in the <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> (which is the orginal reason this page was submitted for deletion) has been met.

(the previous statement is not meant to be read in a sarcastic or patronising way, if that is how it came across, then I apoligise.)--Scuzzmonkey 20:03, 21 January 2007 (UTC) Also even though BBC Berkshire is a "local" radio station, as it is part of the BBC it can be listened to internationally via the internet by clicking <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/aod/berkshire.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/aod/berkshire.shtml" rel="nofollow">here</a>. As such, it reaches a far greater amount of people than standard local radio, and as such is notable. The cited articles on the BBC are notable due to the fact the BBC actually had to approach the band and ask if they could feature them on the website, thus proving the BBC must know about the band, and thus they are notable. --Scuzzmonkey 14:33, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Fails every part of WP:MUSIC except the radio broad cast. However their '1hour show' wasn't on BBC radio nationaly it was BBC berkshire local radio only, thus it fails as it wasn't a national broadcast.

<li>It is really quite simple. And it has always been policy. <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>. Amazon IS a reliable source for the book's <i>existence</i>. (They don't sell non-existent books.) So the existence of the subject of the article is verifiABLE and indeed VerifiED. However, Amazon inclusion is not evidence of notability, so <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is not satisfied by that - although a very high Amazon ranking might be. Further, as the details in an Amazon listing may be supplied by the author - Amazon listings are not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> for details. So there may well be reason to delete. But, the existence of the book is verified, so Verifiability is not a reason to delete. The debate is over notability and whether we can say anything reliable about it, not about verifiability. (OH, on that basis <b>delete</b> by the way) --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 22:19, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment/Question</b> I'm not contesting the existence of this book, but I'm pretty sure being listed on Amazon doesn't actually verify that a book exists. Wasn't there a hoax book that somebody made an Amazon listing for in an attempt to keep it on Wikipedia? I wish I could remember the title... GassyGuy 22:50, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just to reply, even if you assume that Amazon included a hoax on one occasion, that doesn't alter its overall reliability as a source for verifying the existence of a book, its author, its publisher and other basic data. Major news organizations sometimes report misinformation or are fooled by hoaxes, but those imperfections don't make them any less reliable in the aggregate and so we continue to use those as references as well. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:50, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Oh, I wasn't arguing that it is a hoax, I agree that Amazon is a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> source for its existence (and verifiable does not necessarily mean true, so hoaxes on Amazon are covered&#160;:-) ). It may be due to a poorer grasp of English on my part, but when I said in the nomination that there are no <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> sources about the book, I intended (by using "about") sources giving any verifiable information beyond the basic existance (beyond the directory listing Amazon essentially is). Sources giving background information, showing the notability. So, yes, like most AfD discussions, it is about notability, but that has to be shown by using <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> sources or the lack thereof, no? Anyway, this is more a semantic discussion, I think we basically all agree, but the use of the WP abbreviations differs a bit. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 06:15, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I haven't read the book nor do I know anything about it, but I'm inclined to think that if this were a bigger, more established article, then we would be trying to save it. The fact that nobody has expanded it yet doesn't necessarily make it a candidate for deletion, however conversely it is of no use in its present form. If nobody comes forward to establish notability or attempt to expand the article in, say, 3 months, then at that point I think we could reasonably assume that it's not notable enough for anybody to be interested in. I realise this is a rather weak argument, which is why I'm so tentative, and the more I type the more I'm considering changing my opinion to delete....! --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn24601_55f4.html" title="User:John24601">John24601</a> 23:19, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Batch nomination of all the above transport stubs I stumbled across. These were mostly created in January 2005. These are light rail stops, and are only a little more noticeable than bus stops. These are a pretty <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">indiscriminate</a> articles, most of them contain not much more info than "<i>[Station] is a station on Hong Kong's KCR Light Rail. It belongs to Zone [zone] for single-ride ticket. This station consists of [number of] platforms, and is situated on [road 1] near to its junction with [road 2], and serves [placename]. Routes&#160;: [route number] [start point] to [destination]</i>".

<li><b>Keep all</b> Sjakkalle is correct in noting that light rail stops are far more notable then bus stops, because the route of the later can easily be changed while light rail lines require permanent infrastructure and (usually) platforms. However, these stops are far less significant(and often more frequent) then regular railway stations, and thus could be more efficiently combined article absent the development of further information in individual articles. Thus, as an alternative, I would support a "Merge all." <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanntm_9b62.html" title="User:Danntm">Danntm</a> (<a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDanntm_6305.html" title="User talk:Danntm">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Danntm_aafb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Danntm">contribs</a>) 18:12, 17 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>
<li><b>Delete all</b> This set of articles offers the same info in a less useful form than could be obtained from the source transit authority at <a href="http://www.kcrc.com/html/eng/services/services/light_rail/index.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kcrc.com/html/eng/services/services/light_rail/index.asp" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>, and such a spew of articles becomes instantly stale and out of date. Transit systems are subject to change, and there is no mechanism to detect when a platform is taken out of service or added. A transportation network is better represented by the transit system's own map, timetable, and fare guide than by a Wikipedia copy in the form of a linked set of articles. The individual stops of a light rail system are not much more notable than an equivalent set of bus stops. There is no automatic gimme just because someone chooses to make articles about them. None of them appear to have been the subject of multiple independent, verifiable and reliable sources, because they just are not that notable. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 18:51, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I have linked up some of the chinese articles to the english ones, but am finding that these contain very similar bits of info to each other. You may have to look elsewhere for more information to add. Many of the stops are named after housing estates which, are not notable by default per previous discussions. I would venture this was a best case merge per <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a>, meaning we would have articles for said non-notable housing estates by extension of that logic. However, I am meeting <a href="../../../t/u/e/Talk%7ETuen_Mun_Ferry_Pier_a44d.html" title="Talk:Tuen Mun Ferry Pier">some resistance</a> with that course of action. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 09:59, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. They are bit of a hybrid, and precedence seems to indicate default non-notability of bus stops. Light rail stations are only slightly more than bus stops, with an elevated platform, shelter, and no formal access controls. Unlike the <a href="../../../d/o/c/Docklands_Light_Rail_a7b2.html" title="Docklands Light Rail">Docklands Light Rail</a>, this system serves what could be considered "semi-urban areas", linking 3 of the more densely populated centres in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Territories_e5a9.html" title="New Territories">New Territories</a>. As already mentioned, some of the "stations" take their names from housing estates which they serve, and so many of the place names (Affluence, Butterfly Goodview Garden, etc) which are not recognised as districts. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 03:58, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Well I think that this should be quite obvious. There is no academic source or scholar who attests to the existence of this mythical "Brown people", a term with racist connotations. Many Middle-Easterners, Pakistanis and Indians are varied in skin-tone, and can range from Caucasoid to Mongoloid in ethnicity. Looks like a <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> violation, at best, Neo-Nazi/far-right propaganda at worst. It would not be so bad if the article were sourced reliably and had some kind of academic context instead of just a couple of sentences. However, I do not think that such a thing is possible. <a href="../../../r/u/m/User%7ERumpelstiltskin223_6de5.html" title="User:Rumpelstiltskin223">Rumpelstiltskin223</a> 07:44, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><i>Response</i>: I'm not speaking for anyone else. I'm pointing out that the article has been completely rewritten since the timepoint of AfD submission through just prior to Edison's remarks. That needed to be explicitly stated for the reviewing administrator because the arguments given for deletion prior to Edison's addition to the discussion are based on different content entirely (and should therefore be re-timestamped to show that they acknowledge and maintain their opinion of the article <i>as it stands now</i>, otherwise their comments are irrelevant to the AfD discussion of the <i>current</i> version of the article). The submission is also based on different content entirely and therefore the submitting editor should reconsider their submission. Whether they reconsider and feel it still does not meet the inclusion criteria is up to them, but it is something they should have to deal with as opposed to ignore entirely. There is nothing in what I said before or how I clarify it now that is said out of arrogance or speaking for anyone else. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 00:16, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>There's no obviously offensive remark there, no "Interpret all deletes as keeps". It merely reflects fact- admins should (and probably would) not change those opinions but discount most of them altogether, or at least treat them as being of minimal weight. AfD is not a vote, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a democracy</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Et tu, Brute?</a></small> 01:27, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Its offensive to ask an admin to ignore the comments of those one doesnt agree with. The admin should ignore Ju's comments on other users intentions and focus on the votes. Both Carwil and I still think it is a rascist article that needs deleting and for anyone to claim that other voters who voted delete dont think that is clearly trying to affect the vote in a negative and entirely spurious way. Its not for Ju to decide that delete means keep, nor anyone else. To ignore the delete votes would be little more than trolling and I trust that no admin will do so, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 17:14, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Any discussion about the text of the article (regardless of whether the discussion signifies keep or delete) prior to Uncle G's rewrite of the article in its entirety are not applicable to Uncle G's contribution to the article. Is that not clear to you? The only part of the article that remained the same between the edit just prior to Uncle G's involvement and the current text is the title. The nomination even states that "academic context" would mitigate the need for deletion. You are continuing to falsely characterize my statements because in no way have I said "delete means keep", nor have I said "ignore the delete votes". Finally, I'd like to say that it is possible to discuss race without inherently being rascist or violating <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. There are numerous academic fields based upon race and the approaches taken to studying race are encyclopedic. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 19:03, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well I hope you will respect the delete of all users who wrote delete. Of course we can discuss race without being rascist. IMO Uncle G's contributions are to be lamented, he turned a troll bait article into something wikipedia might be stuck with (7-5 in favour of delete right now) even though the article is so full of holes (eg it says brown people dont exist, so why if that is the case is this article being used to justify anything other than its own deletion). In terms of watching comments (your edit summary) that is exactly what I am asking you to do and not to dismiss the delete of any users as you have asked for, so taking some of your own advice would perhaps be a good idea, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 19:09, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If they based their discussion on sound guidelines and the current text, then I give their comments due credit. If they are based on a different text entirely, then the responses need to be updated. If an article meets the guidelines then Wikipedia is better for having it. The article discusses a term of historical significance. At one point the term was used to classify people in an anthropological system based on skin color. Furthermore, there are still references in more modern situations (as also written in the article). Articles are frequently started for many wrong reasons but concern notable topics (e.g., if a "Paula Abdul" article is created saying <i>Paula Abdul eats goats.</i>, then it should be rewritten to discuss a notable entertainer and abide by WP:BIO and WP:BLP). There are articles about concepts that have little or no place in today's society (like <a href="../../../p/h/r/Phrenology.html" title="Phrenology">Phrenology</a>) but are notable and historical concepts which makes them encyclopedic. Unless the article violates a guideline, then I'm not sure why it would require deletion. Can you point to the guideline(s) that the current text violates? <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 19:27, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well people are still voting delete. The text itself says it is at best a shoddy concept and at worst there is no such thing. The fact that one new person has called for delete and I continue to do so is the clearest possible indication that the other editors won have changed their minds either. IMO this article was writen as troll bait and I am sure the person who wrote it is having a laugh at our expense. I also think in rewriting it Uncle G has damaged the reputation of wikipedia and has done more harm than good, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 19:33, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> -- There's no central underlying concept here that has an encyclopedic meaning. As the article now says, "Historically, the appellation "brown people" has been applied by various people to a wide range of disparate, and disconnected, groups of people." Throw all the referenced material to <a href="../../../c/o/l/Color_metaphors_for_race.html" title="Color metaphors for race">Color metaphors for race</a>. I think we should be really hesitant to reify prejudicial and racist concepts, starting with Blumenbach's categories, but extending from there. If racists call people brown, ignore it. If notable racist systems call them brown, put them in the relevant articles (<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blumenbach.html" title="Blumenbach">Blumenbach</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-Nazism_9005.html" title="Neo-Nazism">Neo-Nazism</a>, etc.).

Note that quick google search suggests that <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brown_people.html" title="Brown people">Brown people</a> is used as a racist term most frequently.--<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarwil_fe69.html" title="User:Carwil">Carwil</a> 16:44, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Brown is used by Mexican people</i> It is? There is no exact equivalent in the Spanish language for the English word <i>brown</i>, only words describing various <i>shades</i> of brown. The Native American people of the US, some of which are of the same lineage (<a href="../../../u/t/o/Uto-Aztecan_6b0f.html" title="Uto-Aztecan">Uto-Aztecan</a>, for example) as many native Mexicans, are often described in English as.. <b>red</b>skins. Should we have an article on "red people"? Of course not, that's covered by articles about Native Americans, a "red people" article would be equally silly and redundant as this article is. Minus things that ought to be moved to other articles, what's left are dicdefs of several definitions of "brown people". This will be kept by "no consensus" and by "administrative courtesy", no matter what arguments go on here, since Unca G is an admin, but that's my pinche cinco centavos worth of opinion. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 09:29, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> At the very least, there is a strong historical (and encyclopedic) note to be kept on the term as used by Enlightment thinkers and early refrences like <i>On the Natural Variety of Mankind</i>. The rewrite seems close to this context, or at the very least more well-founded and better written. You may take the term to be antequated or ultimately flawed, but the term certainly existed and was used as a point in time. Even <i>if</i> I personally wouldn't recommend the usage of a term currently, that doesn't retcon the historical usage. (In fact, if verifiable, a section on the decline in usage of the term or possible modern offensiveness would be entirely appropriate.) <a href="../../../b/i/t/User%7EBitnine_cb95.html" title="User:Bitnine">Bitnine</a> 21:42, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

But in such cases, I try to research any historical usage of such terms such that I may well later say, "<i>Ooooh</i>, that was a legitimate term for such things back then.

<li>Problem is, Blumenbach et al. were in fact racist douchebags, building a "scientific" system in large part to reinforce their underlying prejudices. (See the chapter on Blumenbach in S.J.

<li>If that's the case (I must admit to not being familiar with Blumenbach in particular), I would tend to think that citations and referencing in the proper context with a NPOV is a screen enough. In any event, I'd much rather judge Blumenbach to be a douchebag because of a knowledge of his beliefs and reasoning, not a lack thereof or impromper connotation of terms. Various articles discuss distasteful things in a (hopefully) neutral fashion, so long as they meet the standards for notability. I'd would certainly trust that editors such as yourself would be watchful about such articles spreading a POV even through their subtext; that is definitely something to be mindful of and remove. <a href="../../../b/i/t/User%7EBitnine_cb95.html" title="User:Bitnine">Bitnine</a> 02:35, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The outdated, racist and pseudoscientific nature of the anthropological writings involved are best addressed on single pages about their theories (<a href="../../../b/l/u/Blumenbach.html" title="Blumenbach">Blumenbach</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_%28historical_definitions%29.html" title="Race (historical definitions)">Race (historical definitions)</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Color_metaphors_for_race.html" title="Color metaphors for race">Color metaphors for race</a>).

<li>The "race scientists" don't use <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brown_people.html" title="Brown people">brown people</a> as a central concept, but rather <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australoid.html" title="Australoid">Australoid</a> or <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malayan_race.html" title="Malayan race">Malayan race</a>. Brown is an add-on descriptor, not the central concept. Using it to link to anyone who's called their collective group of people brown (and contra the article, lots of people have brown skin) to these terms stretches the page into two unrelated concepts, and (this may be what's most important to those of us writing about the racism involved) gives legitimacy to very problematic concepts.</li>

<li>Hm, are you sure about that application of the naming conventions? That would certainly apply to the term as used in an article about people from that particular region, however, not to an article about the term itself. In the latter case, the term is not being used to describe people, rather the term itself and past usages are described. I suppose you <i>could</i> try and fold the term into the pages of all of the Enlightenment era authors that used it, but that seems a little off as a reason behind an AfD to me. <a href="../../../b/i/t/User%7EBitnine_cb95.html" title="User:Bitnine">Bitnine</a> 23:29, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Even the title of the title of the chapter alone reveals that this is one topic. To see it you don't even need to open the book, as it is given right there in the citation in front of you.

<li>A read of three academic articles by Jack Forbes on the issue, and using the word brown reveals that he uses brown only as a color descriptor, and makes no attempt to conceptualize or reify "brown people." The articles were: The Hispanic Spin: Party Politics and Governmental Manipulation of Ethnic Identity, Jack D. Forbes, Latin American Perspectives &gt; Vol. 19, No. 4, The Politics of Ethnic Construction: Hispanic, Chicano, Latino...? (Autumn, 1992), pp. 59-78. Mustees, Half-Breeds and Zambos in Anglo North America: Aspects of Black-Indian Relations, Jack D. Forbes, American Indian Quarterly &gt; Vol. 7, No. 1 (1983), pp. 57-83. Undercounting Native Americans: The 1980 Census and the Manipulation of Racial Identity in the United States, Jack D. Forbes, Wicazo Sa Review &gt; Vol. 6, No. 1 (Spring, 1990), pp. 2-26. In any case, the book does nothing to bridge the totally different concepts of Australoid/Malayan with Black-Indian mixed descendants (Forbes only writes about the latter).--<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarwil_fe69.html" title="User:Carwil">Carwil</a> 15:35, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

The term is a misnomer, in that the artists don't all have blue eyes.

No. And have you ever looked closely at eyes called "blue"? Lots of eyes called blue are simply a lighter shade of eyes not called blue. Someone who wants to find out about either "brown people" or "blue-eyed soul" should be able to find such an article in wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b>; article claims a charted hit single and album, and he may have had a hit in 2003.

<li>Hmm.... I kept clicking and it got to page 30 and said, "291 - 296 of about 387". I don't understand the relevance of this. If you put wikipedia in google and go for unique hits, it gets "Results 21 - 30 of about 33", which is very little unique.

<li><b>Merge content and Delete</b> - This is a definite <b>fork</b> article. It has been and still is an edit war magnet. In its present form it is singularly antiukrainian and prejudiced. If one wants legitimately treat the subject of Ukrainian German collaboration, than there should not be an exclusive focus on Holocaust, there should be at least an attempt to look at other forms of collaboration including non-military. In its present form it is "How Ukrainians murdered Jews". If this is an objective of the author, than there should be an article about how "Jews murdered Ukrainians". This is not a legitimate or in any way serious treatment of the subject. These events are already covered in a number of articles.

<li>Comment. Because of the extent of Nazi activity in Ukraine during WWII, and the notoriety of some Ukrainian collaborators, there is enough material for an article. There <i>are</i> similar articles for state-level collaboration in <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vichy_France_a8eb.html" title="Vichy France">Vichy France</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/d/Nedic%E2%80%99s_Serbia_0746.html" title="Nedic’s Serbia">Nedic’s Serbia</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_State_of_Croatia_a8ec.html" title="Independent State of Croatia">Independent State of Croatia</a>, etc, (linked from <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-German_cooperation_with_Nazis_during_World_War_II_647c.html" title="Non-German cooperation with Nazis during World War II">Non-German cooperation with Nazis during World War II</a>) and the article ahould be named consistently with these. I'd suggest <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reichskommissariat_Ukraine_0b51.html" title="Reichskommissariat Ukraine">Reichskommissariat Ukraine</a>, but (a) that is a large and badly organised article already, and (b) it's about the Nazi civil admin rather than Ukraininan collaboration.

<li><b>Merge content and delete</b> There are valid issues and facts contained in this entry which have a place in Wikipedia, but not as a separate article which so specifically singles out Ukrainians, and certainly not under this inflammatory title. It should be noted that until <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam Carr</a> moved it, the title was the even more incendiary <a href="../../../u/k/r/Ukrainian_Nazi_Collaboration_during_WW2_2011.html" title="Ukrainian Nazi Collaboration during WW2">Ukrainian Nazi Collaboration during WW2</a>. By its very nature and uniqueness, it posits as a given fact that large numbers of non-Jewish Ukrainians behaved in such a heinous fashion towards Jewish Ukrainians that they deserve an article which would serve to direct more condemnation against them than against any other German-occupied national group. This is the very point raised by <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> in his opening comment and reiterated even more strongly by <a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillock65_13a1.html" title="User:Hillock65">User:Hillock65</a>. Reasoned examples of articles about other countries under German occupation are provided by <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquiddy_078f.html" title="User:Squiddy">Squiddy</a>. All of those countries had collaborators and militias which rounded up Jews and transferred them into German hands, to be sent off to death camps, but the titles of those articles are neutral—<a href="../../../v/i/c/Vichy_France_a8eb.html" title="Vichy France">Vichy France</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/d/Nedic%27s_Serbia_9af5.html" title="Nedic's Serbia">Nedic's Serbia</a>, etc. Squiddy notes that the <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reichskommissariat_Ukraine_0b51.html" title="Reichskommissariat Ukraine">Reichskommissariat Ukraine</a> entry is primarily about German administration of occupied territory, not the Holocaust, but the same can be said about the <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vichy_France_a8eb.html" title="Vichy France">Vichy France</a> entry, and yet no one has spun off a separate article about French-German collaboration in the Holocaust. French police chief of <a href="../../../l/y/o/Lyon.html" title="Lyon">Lyon</a>, Rene Bousquet, who personally ordered and supervised the delivery of thousands of Jews to the Germans, doesn't even have an entry. The proposal by <a href="../../../j/d/2/User%7EJd2718_bc8a.html" title="User:Jd2718">Jd2718</a> of combining this Ukrainian entry into a broad article on the entire region's culpability makes the most sense. <a href="../../../r/o/m/User%7ERomanspinner_a058.html" title="User:Romanspinner">Romanspinner</a> |<a href="../../../r/o/m/User_talk%7ERomanspinner_3dc6.html" title="User talk:Romanspinner">talk</a> 16:44, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Like Piotrus has already stated, the fact that the article is badly written in so many ways is not a reason for deletion, but rather one for improvement. The fact that there are no corresponding articles does not "serve to direct more condemnation against them [the Ukrainians] than against any other German-occupied national group" like you claim Romanspinner. Wikipedia is not for about directing condemnation against anyone - it is for describing historical truths, for example. And the fact that a lot of Ukrainians collaborated with Nazi Germany is such a historical truth. Croatians, Lithuanians, Albanians also did that and that should be mentioned too - in the correct articles. A higher level of detail on the Ukrainian collaboration only goes to show that there are more Wikipedians interested in writing about it than about the Croatian collaboration, for example. We should encourage more people to write about those topics rather than deleting information about topics with better coverage.</li>

<li>If Wikipedia was to follow your logic, Romanspinner, the majority of all US-related articles would have to be deleted, because the country definately gets undue weight on Wikipedia currently compared with other countries with comparable sizes.

<li><b>Merge</b>, although I think most of the reasons for deletion given in this discussion are wrong. It should not be deleted because the quality is poor, or because there are no corresponding articles for other nations. Deleting the article for that reason would be completely absurd, since that would justify deleting large parts of Wikipedia. And Wikipedia articles are not designed to place blame as has been mentioned by several editors, but rather to inform. I do, however, believe that starting a History of Ukraine in World War II article first and then splitting information related to collaboration into its own sub-article once there is a lot of it would be more helpful. For one, those Ukrainian nationalists, who start to cry and add irrelevant information about resistance just because they can't bear the thought of having crimes committed by Ukrainians mentioned by themselves, would be satisfied (I hope). Further, I just believe it would be more easy to write good, informative articles about this topic if a general article about Ukraine in World War II is written first and then other articles are split off once there is enough information.--<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarabinieri_1a8f.html" title="User:Carabinieri">Carabinieri</a> 20:04, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Prodded for deletion, prod tag removed. I feel that this is listcruft. The title seems to indicate that this article contains <b>all</b> of the Golden Globe winners -- not the case. This article would be better to be replaced with either a list of the lists of winners, or a list of the lists of nominations/winners by year.

<li><b>Comment</b>, my original reasoning for contesting the G11 speedy deletion was:
<ul>
<li>"G11 is for <i>pages which exclusively promote a company, product, group, service or person <b>and which would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become encyclopedic</b></i> (emphasis mine). The article is written in a reasonable style and does not read like advertising to me. If deletion is wanted, this should go to AfD instead, because the question here might be notability (although I cannot say anything about that), which definately is not a speedy deletion criterium." --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt.

<p>Fails WP:V. Googling turns up nothing. It's been prodded since November. An inquiry on the talk page in late December was not responded to. Seems fictional. There is of course a Prince Street in Manhattan, but that doesn't seem to be what is being referred to. Maybe created by a bored NYU student? <a href="../../../w/e/h/User%7EWehwalt_4659.html" title="User:Wehwalt">Wehwalt</a> 12:07, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Keep</b>.</s> I'm not a bored NYU student; I created the article because "Prince, NY" is apparently a real geographic location with ZIP code 10012. It is one of the links from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ZIP_Codes_in_New_York_fb7b.html" title="List of ZIP Codes in New York">List of ZIP Codes in New York</a>. If you search Google Maps for "Prince, NY", it will indeed show up. There must be <i>something</i> notable enough to have a ZIP code named after it there, presumably some sort of neighborhood or defunct city. If it's not notable enough to have its own article, for completeness, this title should be redirected to Greenwich Village, or whatever other article explains why this ZIP code has this name. Getting this information might involve using&#160;::gasp:: offline sources. -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 18:51, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Oh. A light begins to dawn. A little research indicates that the NYC post office for zip 10012 is "Prince Station" located on Prince Street.<a href="http://www.nyctourist.com/nyc_post_offices.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nyctourist.com/nyc_post_offices.htm" rel="nofollow">[45]</a>. It must be a quirk of Yahoo! Maps, because when I google "Canal NY" or "Cherokee NY" (two other post office stations for other areas of Manhattan), I don't get presented with a map. Interesting. But a quirk of Yahoo! Maps does not a notable article make. Sorry about the NYU Student crack.--<a href="../../../w/e/h/User%7EWehwalt_4659.html" title="User:Wehwalt">Wehwalt</a> 19:04, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Delete or redirect</b> Looks like more likely than not this is just a post office, then. Sometimes you have things like Fort Point Station, which is named after the Fort Point area in Boston, but <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Manhattan_neighborhoods_7ae2.html" title="List of Manhattan neighborhoods">List of Manhattan neighborhoods</a> seems to have thoroughly mapped out this area, and Price is not on the list of neighborhoods. I have updated the ZIP code list to indicate this for future reference. To help people solve this mystery when they (like me) type "Prince, NY" into the Wikipedia search bar, should this title redirect to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ZIP_Codes_in_New_York_fb7b.html" title="List of ZIP Codes in New York">List of ZIP Codes in New York</a>? -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 21:09, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I think we´re running into USPS policy on acceptable addresses. I know in Virginia, the USPS will accept either Älexandria or Kingstowne for zip (I think) 22315. I played with the ZIP finder, it accepted CHURCH STREET NY but warned it was not an acceptable address. In other words, it is still a post office district thing.--<a href="../../../w/e/h/User%7EWehwalt_4659.html" title="User:Wehwalt">Wehwalt</a> 16:52, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I agree with the above that presidential first names is trivial at best, as are middle names and last names. There might be an argument for nicknames having some minor value, since nicknames aren't obvious or well known to most readers and are names given to the person by other people in recognition of some trait or achievement (eg Knowing why Reagan was called "The Teflon President" gives some insight into his personality and presidency).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>That being said, I could be pursuaded to change my mind if someone somehow expanded the first-name or middle-name articles to explain why the president's name was <i>significant</i>.

<li>I reviewed the content that you merged and still regard it as unencyclopedic and sub-trivial.

<ul>
<li>I see your point. I wasn't as conserned with that being as unnecessary as the other stuff I cut out. I took out the alphabetical lists and left the basic facts. It's interresting than what letter or how many letters a name starts with. I thought it might be a way to expand the nickname article a little more. It isn't alot, but it's better than three separate articles of blah. <a href="../../../j/j/m/User%7EJjmillerhistorian_b2eb.html" title="User:Jjmillerhistorian">Jjmillerhistorian</a> 12:01, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, mainly on the basis of strong circumstantial evidence about his notability. My knowledge of <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carnatic_music.html" title="Carnatic music">Carnatic music</a> is minimal and I am not familiar with him.

"No-ones touched this article in months" does not bother me in this case because this is not exactly an orphaned article and there are many active editors in Carnatic music. <a href="../../../t/i/n/User_talk%7ETintin1107_ddb3.html" title="User talk:Tintin1107">Tintin</a> 14:26, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The low quality of the article should not reflect badly on the musician. This article has existed for three months and is still very weak. It has five tags on it to describe its many problems. Evidently there is no one who has the time or the expertise to improve it at the moment.

<p>Prod expired. Prod rationale was "Not notable, his publications are in norwegian only, and are local history books for 4 Norwegian muncipalities". Prod contested on article talk page. Contested, even if not removed, is enough reason to bump to AFD. My opinion is that the language of publication is totally irrelevant. Some local historians are notable, some aren't. I lean to a weak keep myself. I'd like to see more sources to demonstrate meeting <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> or <a href="../../../b/o/o/WP%7EBOOK_b369.html" title="WP:BOOK">WP:BOOK</a>; so count this as a technical nomination, and I reserve the right to opine later. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 15:31, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep—This article was added during my Wiki-youth, and now that I’ve spent some time amongst the AfD pages and reviewing new articles, I probably would not add it again until a couple more years have gone by and standards have evolved; I’d have realized it was open to discussion as GRBerry notes. None-the-less, “all my children are good-looking” so here is the case for keeping:</li>
</ul>
<dl>

<ul>
<li>I (the original author) believe that Arnfinn Kjelland, although a relatively minor figure, as a regional historian does meet the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> guideline: <i>“the individual is more well known and more published than an average college professor (based on the U.S. practice of calling all full-time academics professors), they can and should be included.”</i></li>
<li>I first encountered Kjelland’s work while trying to develop material for the article on <a href="../../../o/d/e/Odelsrett.html" title="Odelsrett">Odelsrett</a>, an article in which he is quoted. Since I’d quoted him and liked his insight, a link seemed appropriate.</li>
<li>I live halfway around the world from Mr. Kjelland and do not know Mr. Kjelland. I’ve have only exchanged one email with him asking if he would mind if I added this article; he cautiously agreed based on reservations that he had whether local historians were sufficiently noteworthy. I did not write it or intend it as a “puff piece” and try to avoid writing promotional material. Whatever it is, I do not believe it is a vanity article.</li>
<li>This Arnfinn Kjelland article was one of my early contributions and I concede that the article will never have the merit that the article on <a href="../../../v/i/d/Vidkun_Quisling_c366.html" title="Vidkun Quisling">Vidkun Quisling</a> or <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_Churchill_74d2.html" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> will. And it is hardly an exceptional bit of prose.</li>
<li>I have included the "regional history phenomena" in Scandinavia on my To Do List for later research since it turns out there are quite a number of publications along those lines. But that addition to Wikipedia is for later.</li>
<li>I do believe that the {{prod}}er/nominator is acting in good faith in proposing deletion of this article on his countryman. Even though I abused him mightily, he responded civilly and intelligently. I rather liked his insights and regret having not been gentler.</li>
<li>And if you’ll allow me to indulge in an argument which borders on casuistry, I do believe that Wikipedia has rather variable standards of notability. Arnfinn Kjelland has certainly made a more notable contribution to the world than much of the pop culture that Wikipedia has captured (if you don’t want to pick on musical groups then consider porn stars, who are rather well represented).</li>
<li>I did not remove the {{prod}} tags and probably could have without contest (but I don’t from articles I originate), so I leave it in your able collective hands and intellect to adjudicate this AfD.</li>

<li><b>delete</b> The standards for college professors are not entirely arbitrary, but do take account of what the is work. A set of descriptive books of local history--or any similar region in any country in any language--is not a major academic contribution. If he should come to work on a broader scale, or make insights recognized as significant even on a small region, add it again. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 07:33, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> - the sources confirm that he an associate professor. I don't in any way dispute that he holds the rank of major in the reserve army. What I don't really understand is why this suggests notability. His books have been published, but aren't very widely known. Accordingly, I would suggest this doesn't pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> or <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>... <a href="../../../a/d/d/User%7EAddhoc_21d7.html" title="User:Addhoc">Addhoc</a> 16:38, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, No claim to notability. worldcat shows his list of books is only the six listed on the article, and google scholar lists 0. I dont doubt for a moment that there are scholarly articles in journals not listed by google scholar, but I cant see evidence of notability. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 06:30, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Prod expired, bumping because article is on a person who probably is notable. Prod rationale was "Notability concerns, but CV/resume-toe does not help, nor does it being unsourced." It does look like the only source was a resume or CV; however I think a rewrite could salvage it. Does anyone want to source and rewrite? If not, delete at the end of the AFD, as <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> notability is not definitively established in this unsourced article. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 15:48, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is a summary of what seems to be a pretty minor piece of US legislation. To my mind, it is bordering on falling foul of Wikipedia is not a directory / indiscriminate collection of information. But...</p>
<p>Let me say that this is a very tentative AfD! I have no idea if there is any form of precedent on this sort of article, or indeed whether the article is acceptable or not. I've tried to work it out, but can't really find a definitive answer. The closest I've come is the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_United_States_federal_legislation_fb27.html" title="List of United States federal legislation">partial list of <b>notable</b> United States federal legislation</a>, and I don't believe that this act is notable. Anyhow, I will gladly withdraw this nomination if I'm in the wrong.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> It is referenced to the AP story about Bush signing it. As a newly enacted law (signed Jan 13, 2007) to criminalize pretexting, passed 409 to 0 in the US House of Representatives, it addresses a common practice of fraudulently obtaining the phone records of others. Technically, wouldn't publication in the Congressional Record and the Federal Register furnish the additional "independent, verifiable, reliable" sources? Sorry for the crystal ball, but let's give prosecutors a chance to prosecute pretexters rather than deleting the article as soon as the law is passed. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:03, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. Not to mention, I don't know of too many people who self-identify as "heathens." Whose definition are we using?

This article is a clear essay in violation of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. The uses of it sources amount to synthesis and (like most essays) is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>.

Think of the sub page POV essays that could be written for the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> or <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">Marriage</a> articles? An ideal situation would be to userfy the text, since it is an essay. But the user who created this page, didn't create the essay. Editors on the <a href="../../../b/o/r/Bordeaux_Wine_8edc.html" title="Bordeaux Wine">Bordeaux Wine</a> page had concerns over the POV and Original Research issues and so it was removed as a splinter article. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bordeaux_wine&amp;diff=43500342&amp;oldid=43148165" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bordeaux_wine&amp;diff=43500342&amp;oldid=43148165" rel="nofollow">original author</a> seems to be <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshleyHouston_38bf.html" title="User:AshleyHouston">User:AshleyHouston</a> who has not edited since April 2006. I agree that there is some interesting tidbits but after looking at the sources and the POV overtones, I personally don't feel comfortable with using any of it in an encyclopedia article. I think the editors on the Wine Project can do a better job introduce the subject matter into the respective articles starting from scratch rather then starting from a POV essay. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 20:12, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If there is "no precedent for attaching essays to articles" (<i>There is no precedent for anything until it is done for the first time.</i> — <a href="../../../a/2E/_/A._P._Herbert_bb3a.html" title="A. P. Herbert">A. P. Herbert</a>), then I would have to change my opinion to <b>keep</b> and <b>merge</b>, then. The mere presence of POV claims or original research in otherwise useful text is something to handle by editing, not by deleting. If I understand you correctly, this was broken out of an article on <a href="../../../b/o/r/Bordeaux_Wine_8edc.html" title="Bordeaux Wine">Bordeaux Wine</a>, then perhaps it ought to re-merge back into the article, where any original research or essayish wording could be edited out. Or, if the only concern is attaching a POV essay in <i>article</i> space, and the Wine Project has a page of its own, perhaps it could be moved out of article space and to a subpage of the <i>project</i> page. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 21:45, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I've thought long and hard about this article, trying to see if there was anything worth salvaging.

<dd>Agne, there is precedent for attaching essays to the <i>talk pages</i> of articles. I've seen it done. It would become a talk page archive. As a talk page archive, it's out of the main space, and anyone can still use the good bits. I doubt anyone would vote to keep the article where it is.</dd>
<dd>If you agree, then you as the nominator can withdraw this nomination, then go to the article and click on the "Move" tab to move it to a sub-page of a talk page; I suggest moving it under <a href="../../../f/r/e/Talk%7EFrench_wine_c08e.html" title="Talk:French wine">Talk:French wine</a> per the comment of <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> above (the new article name would be Talk:French wine/Problems in the French wine industry). To withdraw the nom, just strike out the nomination (Using &lt;s&gt; and &lt;/s&gt;) and write "withdrawn" below it. I understand you can technically also close it yourself but I'm not sure how that's done. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmatulic_b5b8.html" title="User:Amatulic">Amatulic</a> 00:40, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't plan on withdrawing. Looking at the history of this patch of information, it has remained virtually unchanged since AshleyHouston left it. It is a personal essay-one person's opinion and synthesis. Its presence is simply "Wiki-publishing" of original research. If it has a place in Wikipedia, it is on a user's subpage. <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 09:28, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>My point was that there is no appropriate user subpage - unless someone volunteers.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I created this page by moving the text out of 'Bordeaux wine'. Perhaps I should have just deleted it then. The text came from the 'French wine bashing' school of editors (French wine is rubbish, in terminal decline, we all want to drink Gallo...) whose influence has now mostly been removed from Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> Currently the total number of podcast listeners is very small. The number of people who have even downloaded a single podcast is <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2005/04/05/pew-backtracks-on-podcasting-survey-numbers/" class="external text" title="http://www.engadget.com/2005/04/05/pew-backtracks-on-podcasting-survey-numbers/" rel="nofollow">less than 6,000,000</a>. The number of <i>regular</i> podcast listeners is probably a fourth of that. This means that with 15,000 listeners ExtraLife Radio captures approximately 1% of the total number of people listening to podcasts, a significant portion of the market. Considering the amount of growth the podcast has seen since this article was last deleted, I think it should be kept for the time being, assuming the show will maintain it's current rate of growth. I also feel that it satisfies the notability requirement based on Nmaster64 above links. The article needs a lot of cleanup, but it should not be deleted. 67.88.66.41 00:00, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>It should also be noted that the basis for most of the delete suggestions here is solely on the fact that this is recreated content. As this podcast and web comic have increased in popularity by a factor of ten since the original article was deleted, I think this is not a valid reason to delete the article. If it is decided that ExtraLife is still not notable enough to have an article about it, then so be it, but to suggest this article needs to be deleted simply because it is recreated content is not a valid reason. 67.88.66.41 16:34, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It is, because popularity is not a criterion for inclusion.

<dd>I am not saying that because the audience has expanded it should stay. I am saying that because the audience has expanded, deleting this article simply because it is recreated content would be a mistake. What might not have been notable could very well be considered notable now. If everything else were equal, and this article was recreated, I would say delete it strait away, but the podcast has grown dramatically since the article was originally deleted. To simply suggest this article should be deleted because it is recreated content is irresponsible. I am not sure what you mean by lack of substantial sources though, Nmaster64 listed multiple external references above.

The ExtraLife comic is redistributed via <a href="http://www.mmorpg.com/humor.cfm" class="external text" title="http://www.mmorpg.com/humor.cfm" rel="nofollow"><b>mmorpg.com</b></a>, a well known and independent news source for massively multiplayer online games.

<p>Came across this page while reading somebody's talk page, although apparently he is related (in that they are both wrestling promoters) to Mosh Pit Mike who I have also nominated. Much of the information in this bio is similar to the info in that bio. This person doesn't seem to be inherently notability althuogh if notability can be established then cheers, but right now the only "sources" are Hobo Hank's own web site. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrstroeebski_7f9b.html" title="User:Orstroeebski">Orstroeebski</a> 07:24, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>: no sources. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 17:42, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>No Comment</b>: Again, I don't feel it would be right for me to chime in with an opinion here, as I created both of the articles in question. The source given is AmarilloPWF.com, which is a webpage that is only editable by the webmaster, who is employed by the WTWL. I feel the nominator was misleading in identifying the only source as "Hobo Hank's own web site". Also, as I stated with Mosh Pit Mike, Hobo Hank is listed on the West Texas Wrestling Legends (WTWL) page. This is the only reason I created an article for him, I figured if he was mentioned in a wikipedia article, he deserved to have an article of his own. Burquelo 20:05, 11 January 2007 (UTC)Oh man! Here I go again, continuing with the long windedness. I also feel that user Orstrobeeski has a personal grudge against me. If he were to be putting deletion notices in all wrestler pages, I would accept it as a substantial challenge. But look at CJ Summers. This page cites no sources whatsoever, except for the wrestler's personal website. There are no federation websites which suggest he even exists, yet Orstrobeeski simply removed links instead of nominating the article for deletion. Personal attacks are fine, I'm a big boy, but I think it's unfair when it impacts a wiki.
<ul>
<li><i>I figured if he was mentioned in a wikipedia article, he deserved to have an article of his own.</i> — That is not the case. The criteria that we employ for who warrants articles of their own are our <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies</a>.

<li><b>Do NOT Delete</b>: The nomination for deletion on this wiki page is an outrage. "Hobo" Hank is a professional wrestler that I have seen with my own eyes perform for West Texas Wrestling Legends in Amarillo, TX. The AmarilloPWF.com website is not ran by anyone other than WTWL Management and The WTWL Webmaster. While "Hobo" Hank is on The WTWL roster, he is not the promoter and has no access to editing AmarilloPWF.com in anyway. Being apart of The WTWL, I know that the information on Hanks' wikipedia page is 100% accurate and I can say that "Hobo" Hank has performed at every WTWL show since I've been associated with it in June of 2006. This page belongs on wiki just as much as any other wrestlers page. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Brett420x (<a href="../../../b/r/e/User_talk%7EBrett420x_8c1e.html" title="User talk:Brett420x">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Brett420x_bafe.html" title="Special:Contributions/Brett420x">contribs</a>) 22:10, 11 January 2007 (UTC).</small>

<li><s><b>Delete</b> unless reliable sources showing notability are produced.</s><b>Keep</b> - Willing to give the benefit of the doubt; looks like it's been print-published in notable publications (though I can't really research Finnish-language stuff), also don't want to contribute to systematic bias.

Still, getting the comics on such major publications, even to their online editions, is quite an achievement. However, right at the moment, some more sourcing to get claims of fame established would be mighty great. I'm not coffeed enough to do that myself. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 17:36, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I contacted a writer and received the times and newspapers when and where the comic has been featured in print. These constitute distribution in a well-known medium independent of the creators. I received an article about the strip itself as well. I've added these to the references as well as I could. Sosiaalisesti rajoittuneet was also featured in a notable online publication, but a subscription-only one, and a good while ago, so how would we prove that? --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizor_34ff.html" title="User:Kizor">Kizor</a> 11:23, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This attempt is unfounded, and there are references to prove its worthiness. Clearly from the exhaustive attempts by User:MosMof, this is a contentious topic, but I'd ask what for, and why? There are enough people who do call it LoHo ever since the real estate brokers renewed the name in 1996, that LoHo Studios had been using all along. The references do not even mention a realtor and in fact, refer to it as a location in NY. <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudae1_994a.html" title="User:Judae1">Juda S.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Quoting from the article itself: <i><b>LoHo</b> is one proposed name of a neighborhood in the New York City...</i> It does not matter what this article is called. The key question is if <i>LoHo</i> is different from the <a href="../../../l/o/w/Lower_East_Side_c760.html" title="Lower East Side">Lower East Side</a>. Does it have a different area or does it include all of LES? Does it have a different ethnic mix as its population?</li>

<ul>
<li><b>keep</b> These designations keep coming, and they almost always stay. I suppose it indicates something about NYC that the inhabitants are always trying to re-create it as a series of more and more little villages each characterized a little differently.

<li><b>Delete</b> Loho is a neologism coined by a real estate company of the same name. They have a single propietary interest in the formerly limited equity co-ops south of Delancey, east of Essex. I live in one of them. I've never heard the neighborhood called "Loho" by anyone, not a soul, not even the agents who work for the company.

<li><b>Delete</b> (<b>merge/redirect</b>) The "LoHo" term is not in widespread use outside of mentions by LoHo Realty and its PR and publishing associates involved in discussion here.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> The term "LoHo" is in the culture, and as such should be noted here. The very discussion on this page suggests there is much political opposition to the use of the term and that, in itself, already justifies not censoring it. The novelty or longevity in this instance is immaterial, but it has been shown that "LoHo" is used in the name of more than one area business for more than a decade. -- [[[User:Yyanover|Yyanover]] 11:07, 23 January 2007 (UTC)YYanover]]</li>

<p>While the term might become more accepted in the future, it seems that reputable, local media outlets have not accepted it as such. The way the article reads almost like a real estate brochure, and the way the article starter has included a link to "LoHo" in every possible article, sometimes hiding the link under "Lower East Side", it seems at best, premature neologism, and at worst, spam. <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMosmof_7aef.html" title="User:Mosmof">Mosmof</a> 21:06, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>KEEP</i> The point is not whether it has a different ethic mix (but it does, as it is a younger, more affluent population than that of the whole Lower East Side which spans Alphabet City all the way down and includes parts of China Town and Loisaida. LoHo is within LES, don't lose site of that) or that you can point to the person who began using it; Loho studios did years ago, than Loho Realty. It is the the demographic and affluence shift that has occurred as a result of the high-yield home prices, especially when compared to that of the Lower East Side as a whole, which consists mostly of City projects and low income housing facilities, has taken the name LoHo to mean the newer, trendier neighborhood, and not the old-style pushcart/peddler Lower East Side. Please understand the difference. Lower East Side is a much bigger picture, LoHo is smaller and more defined by its people, trends, lifestyle, nightlife, expensive homes, condos and hotels, and expensive boutiques. <a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudae1_994a.html" title="User:Judae1">Juda S.

<p><i>Comment</i> - I can quote for you 1000 articles that refer to the neighborhood as LoHo; what you are doing is trying to back Wiki into a corner by saying that if one or more are not full features on the name LoHo, you won't buy it. The fact is that people, people from all over, near and far alike, are using the name LoHo. The fact that media refer to it, trendy nightspots and shops refer to it, etc,. says that it is beyond a whim or a novelty - and 1000 articles like this will be unable to satisfy anyone bent against the new moniker. The fact that you care so much about Wikipedia's integrity that you want this article to reflect a comfortable tone is commendable; that you chose Loho as your first and only target as the reason Wikipedia is not there yet, is, perhaps, a bit of a tell (as we say in poker).

<dd>Wiki asks for reliable non-self originated sources. It also tends to not like blogs. Yet, many of the pieces are bona-fide news reports from established media, and the blogs are either popular media-like spots, as is the New York Observer Real Estate blog, written by real reporters, and others using the name LoHo in various references to the area in question have been written years prior to this debate, prior to the Wiki LoHo entry being created. These are all pickups from what has become a popularized name over the past 10 years, not recent plants to support my or anyone else's theory.<a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudae1_994a.html" title="User:Judae1">Juda S.

I'm willing to consider it a "sub-neighborhood" if that's clear. My take on sources is that it's just barely there. There was a whole NYT article about the neighborhood and its designation.

<dd><i>Comment</i> It's worth noting that while neighborhood designations may stay and might even get a few mass media mentions, they don't always reach the level of "true" (for the lack of a better word) neighborhood names a la Alphabet City. Many often stay the way of SoHell ("South of Hell's Kitchen" for the lower Midtown West area below Port Authority), which has been around for a while and even got a NY magazine profile, but has mostly stayed at the word of mouth level, like so many microhoods that pop up on sites like Curbed.com ever so often. So I'm not sure "it'll stick around" is enough to make a case, which is why I think <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> is a good test - widely used isn't necessarily notable. <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMosmof_7aef.html" title="User:Mosmof">Mosmof</a> 08:18, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Comment</i> Names are a personal and sensitive thing, which is why anyone with half a brain would stay away from the topic. So let me say this...</p>
<p>The Lower East Side stretched 100 years ago from 14th Street all the way to the water and included Chinatown, too. But within that area there were always neighborhoods (Chinatown &amp; Corlear’s Hook come to mind). Those neighborhoods were named by their residents to determine a more precise location than a 2 by 3 mile area, and, believe it or not, for commercial reasons. Like the Orchard Street area.</p>
<p>SoHo, East Village (a total fabrication) and NoHo (likewise) have been there before. I believe LoHo is catching flack mostly for being latest to get rich off of real estate values in the city. It smacks of old money scorning the new, even if the person attacking it is a pauper.</p>
<p>Also, the East Village tag has been the flag of uninhibited gentrification, which utilized frontal violence to protect property values – is that a valued name for you? Think the Koch troops doing the Gestapo thing in Tompkins Park – that's what East Village brings to my mind. In comparison, what's the crime of LoHo? A pun on real estate history? An attempt to imbue an immigrants' neighborhood with some of the shine of the arts and hipness of SoHo? <a href="../../../y/y/a/User%7EYyanover_c221.html" title="User:Yyanover">User:Yyanover</a> 03:34, 18 January 2007</p>
<p>As a young person who spends a lot of time in the Lower East Side, I have not once heard anyone use the name LoHo in reference to the neighborhood. Call it an urban myth, I call it a real estate plan to attach a neighborhood name to its company. It's no secret that the man arguing to keep the name is a PR person.--Josef</p>

<dd>Funny how Josef's only other entry is the inclusion of a reference to an organization that has been vocal critics of a name change; and yes, my living comes from PR, but A) I don't hide that, it's in my bio, and more importantly, b)I am a Lower East Sider with a tad more experience in the neighborhood that some of of the other writers here. My family business, by the way, is known for being a "<b>Lower East Side</b>" tourist spot and part of its rich history, and not LoHo, so this argument can even be construed as counter productive - as far a self interest is concerned.<a href="../../../j/u/d/User%7EJudae1_994a.html" title="User:Judae1">Juda S.

<p>I just saw this on the Observer. Its seems that while Mr. Engelmayer is open about his working in PR, he isn't being open about LoHo Realty being a client at hi PR company ( <a href="http://www.5wpr.com/Our_Clients/Index.cfm" class="external free" title="http://www.5wpr.com/Our_Clients/Index.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.5wpr.com/Our_Clients/Index.cfm</a> ).

Engelmayer</a> 23:54, 18 January 2007 (UTC))With that in mind, it seems a bit disengenous to represent the entry as fact when the fact is it's part of a marketing campaign. I don't fault people for wanting to build up areas. But the Lower East Side- which is finally seeing its day again - is one of NYC's last remaining true-neighborhoods. NYC is at enough risk of erasing its past due to real estate development; Creating (or trying to brand ) a neighborhood from one that already possesses a rich identity is simply self-serving (to say the least) and pays no mind to the people who have spend years building it.

<p>Comment: So, what happens if I stumble upon the term "LoHo" as a synonym for LES and wonder how the moniker came to be? My first instinct is to turn to Wikipedia.

<p>Comment: The <b>East Village</b> was a 1970's invention by real estate brokers who were thugs to boot. Everything you know about cruel gentrification, complete with sending riot police after squatters, happened on the sacred East Village. But no one challenges this made up name because it's been there almost 40 years. To sanctify the evil EV while calling LoHo "parasites" is to be entirely devoid of a notion of history. A name is out there as part of the culture. You want to censor the culture? Who gave you the right? [User Yyanover]</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think both sides of the debate are missing the issue - whether LoHo is "real" or not is inconsequential. The real question is whether it passes Wikipedia's tests for notability (I've already mentioned <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> here and in the talk page). You're right, no one challenges "East Village" because it's been around for 40 years (since the mid-60s, actually). And because it's been around for 40 years, there are reliable sources that verify its existence and its boundaries, and define it as a proper neighborhood. More to the point, East Village managed to gain notability without the benefit of a Wikipedia article - we can only see if LoHo can do the same. <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMosmof_7aef.html" title="User:Mosmof">Mosmof</a> 12:03, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The ad hominem aside, you're missing my point - I'm not saying wait 40 years. In fact, if Wikipedia were around 40 years ago, East Village would have had its own article then because the neighborhood had already received substantial mass media coverage. NoLIta, which we are led to believe isn't that much older than the LoHo name, has managed to gain traction that LoHo hasn't come close to.

<dd>Pointing out an apparent conflict of interest is not a conspiracy theory - it's more than relevant to the argument if you or Yori have, or at one point had, a professional relationship with Goldman and LoHo Realty, since one of the questions here is whether the real estate company is engaging in astroturfing.

<p>Article was created as result of a confusion, contains no factual information. There is no "Großes Höllental" near the <a href="../../../z/u/g/Zugspitze.html" title="Zugspitze">Zugspitze</a> or anywhere in Bavaria. It is in reality a small side valley on the <a href="../../../r/a/x/Rax.html" title="Rax">Rax</a>, which has no entry in de.wikipedia.org. Unless someone finds enough material to create a new page and wants to do it, this stub should be deleted. The creator of that page did not reply to my comments on the talk pages and his user page, although he was active inbetween. This lemma has also three redirects to it. <a href="../../../h/u/r/User%7EHurax_14a4.html" title="User:Hurax">Hurax</a> 21:21, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Please can you translate these for me please? I GREATLY appreciate your help on this.

<li><b>Delete</b> The present article seems to be just wrong. As others have commented above, the Grosses Höllental is near the <a href="../../../r/a/x/Rax.html" title="Rax">Rax</a>, which is southwest of Vienna, part of the water-supply area for the capital, and nowhere near the Zugspitze, which is on the border of Austria and Germany. It is hard to see why a small valley in Austria with a non-unique name that is not mentioned in the German Wikipedia is notable enough for us to include. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 20:54, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Delete</b>. I cannot find <i>any</i> information on him on the internet. The name of the article isn't even the name mentioned in the text. As to Mawassi, I guess it would be more notable to put up pages on Al Mawassi in tha Gaza strip or on a certain successfull <a href="http://www.agri.gov.il/People/MunirMawassi.html" class="external text" title="http://www.agri.gov.il/People/MunirMawassi.html" rel="nofollow">scientist</a> from Isreal. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarol_Langner_26da.html" title="User:Karol Langner">Karol</a> 06:23, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is legitimate information. Ziad Mawassi is a real person and a local hero who lends his valuable time to many people in the community. He has helped many troubled teenagers by giving them a knowledge and experience in the automotive industry. Ziad Mawassi improved the quality of my life when he transformed my classic Ford into a show winner, as he has to many others.</p>
<ul>
<li>Has he appeared in any newspaper articles or anything of that sort which would prove what you've told us? --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 11:19, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>I can also attest to Ziads quality of work. Previously having bad experiences with another restorator, i had a meeting with Ziad to discuss my options with my vehicle. Noting his professional behaviour and vast knowledge of the industry, i decided to trust him with my pride and joy. The final results were unimaginable. Even i couldnt envision such a quality job!</p>
<p>I would also like to state how much Ziad has contributed to our community. Realising that his success has been hugely a result of our community, he now strives to give back what he can. Quite often he has been a part of charity fundraising. From simple ordeals, to larger-scale projects, such as restoring cars to be sold off to raise funds.</p>
<p>I can not stress enough the faith i have in Ziad Mawassi, and his level of character.</p>
<p>I can and will definately hold my flag up high and show support that Ziad Mawassi as a genuine person. I can surely solemly swear that he singlehandedly "tricked up" my show winning Datsun Fairlady roadster. 2 Cheers for ziad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hooray!!</p>

<p>This article is about a morning radio show in San Diego. As far as I can tell, it is utterly non-notable. I originally prod'd it, and the prod was removed with an edit summary of, "The Mikey Show is a very popular show in a large market. How is this not notable?" by someone who has been around long enough that they should know what is and isn't notable. I was hesitant to take this to AFD, especially since I tend to err on the side of wanting to keep marginally notable articles; but really, what makes The Mikey Show different from any other popular large-market morning show? A google search for <i>The Mikey Show KIOZ</i> garners 362 Google hits. By comparison, a google search for <i>Wank &amp; O'Brien Hank</i> (an Indianapolis market morning show) garners 9,820; but I wouldn't think they should have a Wikipedia article either. Looking at The Mikey Show's google results indicate that Mikey replaced Howard Stern on that station. While Howard Stern is certianly notable, I don't see how that would make The Mikey Show notable, and that assertion isn't in the article anyhow. The article cites no sources, and has been tagged as such since July. No one has cited sources to demonstrate notability in that time. Basically, I really hate to do this; but I have to ask... how is <i>this</i> show notable? How is it any more notable than its competiors on the other San Diego radio stations? How is it more notable than similar shows in other major markets? And why are there no sources in the article? ~ <i><a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn"><span style="color:#0cc">ONUnicorn</span></a></i><sup>(<a href="../../../o/n/u/User_talk%7EONUnicorn_f780.html" title="User talk:ONUnicorn">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ONUnicorn_939c.html" title="Special:Contributions/ONUnicorn">Contribs</a>)</sup><small><a href="../../../p/%26/s/WP%7EP%26S_1d27.html" title="WP:P&amp;S">problem solving</a></small> 21:51, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Why is this a valid reason to consider deleting the article? It's not notible by WHOSE definition? First of all, the show is the top rated show in the San Diego area, and if you don't believe that, get your hands on a copy of the Arbitron book. Second, most of the notes in this article are from audio sources, and where the audio is not archived, how is it possible to post a link to the source? Why don't I just make up a webpage to put as a source? Third of all, this article is hardly non-notable. This very page has actually been referenced numerous times on the air on the Mikey Show. And fourth, I have saved a copy of the article, and I'm going to circulate it among every listener of the Mikey Show I know, meaning that if it gets deleted, it will be posted back up just as quickly, because neither I, nor the rest of the P1 listeners, believe that "it's not notable" is a valid reason to "mark it for deletion". You're missing the entire point of what Wikipedia is about. It's not only supposed to have "major events, people, places and things" like the Encyclopaedia Britannica - it's supposed to be a source for almost anything.

<li>Relevant policies and guidelines that should have been cited in the nomination include <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENote_4dcf.html" title="WP:Note">the guideline on notability (which you should read if you say "it's not notable" is a valid reason to "mark it for deletion")</a>, the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">policy on verifiability</a>, the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">guideline on what counts as a reliable source</a>, and the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research policy, which a quick read through the article shows the article is violating</a>. The main, and most important aspect of notability is "<i>that a topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself.</i>" Once it can be proven that those multiple non-trivial reliable published works exist and they are <i>cited in the article as being the source of all information contained in the article</i> you need have no fear of the article being deleted. The nominator is not the one "missing the entire point of what Wikipedia is about", you are. Wikipedia is about assembling information from other places in one convenient location. You must be able to say where the information came from, and off the top of your head is not a reliable source. As for it being "posted back up just as quickly," it will then fall under <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">the criteria to be deleted as quickly as it can be posted back up.

<li><b>Withdrawing nomination</b> The article has been significantly cleaned up and notability is now clearly established by the citing of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and each other. There are some facts that still need citations, and some missing info that I'd like to see added to the article in order to make it complete (such as when did he return to the air after his 2004 firing, when did he "get religion", etc.), but that's all clean-up issues; not deletion issues.
