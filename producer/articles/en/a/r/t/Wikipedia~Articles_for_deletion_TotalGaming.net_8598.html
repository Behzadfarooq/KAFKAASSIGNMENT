<dl>
<dd>Firstly, I think people are mistaking this for an article about a website, possibly because of the article's name. It is not - it is about a subscription service/system, which <i>happens to have</i> a website. That is why the majority of the content is about the details of the subscription service and a description of the games on it. It should be considered in relation to articles like <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steam_%28content_delivery%29.html" title="Steam (content delivery)">Steam (content delivery)</a>. As the website's actual address is <i>totalgaming.stardock.com</i>, the site's traffic is absorbed by alexa's <i>stardock.com</i> entry, which had a rank of <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Ftotalgaming.stardock.com%2F" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Ftotalgaming.stardock.com%2F" rel="nofollow">6,321</a> as of today (this doesn't count <a href="../../../w/i/n/WinCustomize_74ad.html" title="WinCustomize">WinCustomize</a>, which <i>is</i> primarily a website, ranked <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=wincustomize.com%2F&amp;url=wincustomize.com%2F" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=wincustomize.com%2F&amp;url=wincustomize.com%2F" rel="nofollow">3,545</a>).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>TotalGaming.net's notability rides on the fact that it is a commercially-successful <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital_distribution.html" title="Digital distribution">digital distribution</a> systems for computer video games (not something founded with <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venture_capital.html" title="Venture capital">venture capital</a> that didn't actually provide a viable product). It was in production before Valve had even announced their offering, and it has been running for over five years now. I know it's hard to prove commercial success for a privately-owned company, but put it this way - I don't think we would have kept doing it for that long if we didn't make any money out of it.&#160;:-)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The game articles that are linked in the text (within the Games section) are there because they were there already. I did not start any of them, although I am the majority contributor to <a href="../../../d/r/e/Galactic_Civilizations_II%7E_Dread_Lords_90a5.html" title="Galactic Civilizations II: Dread Lords">Galactic Civilizations II: Dread Lords</a>. I used external links for the rest of the games precisely because I felt that was better than creating redlinks on the page for things which had not yet been judged notable by others. On reflection, I've commented these out from <a href="../../../s/t/a/Template%7EStardock_3b85.html" title="Template:Stardock">Template:Stardock</a> as well - I was trying to be comprehensive, but they just clutter it up. Perhaps it would be a better article without the external links, either? It seems hard to judge a service's relevance without knowing what games are on it, though - that's why I've kept the list updated.</dd>

<dd>I will try to improve this article's referencing. I know I can get some more specific and additional sources for some of it - for example, I'm pretty sure <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penny_Arcade_%28webcomic%29_73fc.html" title="Penny Arcade (webcomic)">Penny Arcade</a> has commented on the service.

<dd>I actually split it out from Stardock because it was getting too large, and because it seemed odd to be talking about a company and a digital content system in the same article. I can try putting some of the content and references back in there if suggested for merging/deleting. Some more information about what particular segments of the article people do and do not like (rather than just "original research" or "non-notable") would be helpful for knowing what to keep in that case. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 22:07, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Which particular material?

I guess the reasoning for the changes in the service over time should be attributed specifically to them, though there might be better references for that (would probably be more forum posts by Brad, I'm sure he's talked about it at some point . . .). <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 21:57, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Given that you work for Stardock, I think using Stardock sources to write up an article on a Stardock product is too much like <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> for my tastes. Sorry, I agree with <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>&#160;: if you do something important enough to merit an encyclopedia article, you should trust others to notice that.

<dd>I would indeed prefer to use non-Stardock sources, but frankly the only ones I could find that had sufficient detail on the mechanisms of subscription were just repeating our press releases, as so many sites do. It seemed better to have an authoritative source for that. There aren't many references on the Steam article that are about the system itself, either - it seems not many people like to write seriously about content delivery systems, just the games that are on them. I've just been told <i><a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Herring_%28magazine%29_0274.html" title="Red Herring (magazine)">Red Herring</a></i> will be bringing a significant review out soon, but it's hardly a source before it's released.

<li><b>What?</b> - I don't think your argument makes a lot of sense. Steam is <s>infinitely</s> more popular. Just because we have articles about one music player (iTunes) doesn't mean "Joe Shmo's Mp3 Playa" is acceptable.

<dd>Infinitely so? No? Vastly? I don't know, where's the figures to compare? It'd be interesting to know that for TotalGaming.net as well - I have no doubt that Steam has <b>more</b> users, but the proportion that are there just for Half Life is perhaps a more relevant question (the same should be asked for Stardock's <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galactic_Civilizations_II_7904.html" title="Galactic Civilizations II">Galactic Civilizations II</a>, of course).</dd>
<dd>In any consideration of the content delivery system as a whole (not just the games part, which was separated out in this article) you need to include all the <i>applications</i> which are provided to <a href="../../../o/b/j/Object_Desktop_2cf5.html" title="Object Desktop">Object Desktop</a> subscribers through Stardock Central (which has used a more rudimentary system since at least 1998; as with one of the first instances of "software as a service"). The games have historically been the "fun" for Stardock, while the apps have been the money. This may not apply so much this year, given GC2's success (beyond our most optimistic targets), but it has up to now.</dd>
<dd>I think that if this article is deleted it would make more sense to merge/redirect the material about the content (what games are on the service, etc.) to Stardock and perhaps add some of the material about the mechanics of the service itself to Stardock Central, as the same system is used for both the games and the applications (Drengin.net was essentially the "beta test" of the system before Stardock switched over the more important applications side of things from Component Manager, the previous delivery system). <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 17:14, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
