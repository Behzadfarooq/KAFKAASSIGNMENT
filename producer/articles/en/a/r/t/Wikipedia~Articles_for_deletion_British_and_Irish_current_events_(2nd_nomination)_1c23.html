<li><b>Keep</b>. Yes, it does need to be kept up-to-date, and I would volunteer to do it if Wikipedia were not my primary source of current events. This is not a reason to delete though imho. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 19:00, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. The arguments have not changed since the previous AfD, therefore I restate my vote and comments from last time. Inactivity for a period is not grounds for deletion, and some of the other regional current events pages have had few edits since last summer/early autumn either. I also fail to understand what you mean by <i>If the article is to be brought up to date it will have to be rewritten anyway</i> - current events articles are not continuously rewritten, they are periodically archived. -- <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/w/User_talk%7EArwel_Parry_e253.html" title="User talk:Arwel Parry">talk</a>) 01:33, 4 February 2006 (UTC)&#160;:
<ul>
<li><i><b>Strong keep</b>. Wikipedia has reported Current Events from the early days of its existence (that's why there's a link in the main navigation bar). The fact that nobody has considered anything that's happened in the UK or Ireland particularly noteworthy in the last 6 weeks or so which has not alternatively been listed in <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events.html" title="Current events">Current events</a> is neither here nor there. If you press this deletion request, why have you not also listed <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events.html" title="Current events">Current events</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_sports_events.html" title="Current sports events">Current sports events</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_science_and_technology_events.html" title="Current science and technology events">Current science and technology events</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events_in_Africa_9eb3.html" title="Current events in Africa">Current events in Africa</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events_in_Iraq_fe46.html" title="Current events in Iraq">Current events in Iraq</a>, Current events in Hong Kong and Macao, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_current_events.html" title="Chinese current events">Chinese current events</a>, <strike>Current events in Cisjordan,</strike> <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_current_events.html" title="Canadian current events">Canadian current events</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_current_events_a62b.html" title="United States current events">United States current events</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events_in_Australia_and_New_Zealand_c7f3.html" title="Current events in Australia and New Zealand">Current events in Australia and New Zealand</a>, Current events in the European Union, and Current events in Poland, several of which have also not been updated since May?

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I hadn't really researched other regional current events articles, but my firm opinion is that these <b>should</b> also be deleted if they have not got anyone updating them. Wikipedia is <b>not</b> a newspaper. The purpose of such articles is to put Wikipedia articles in the context of current events; but this is pointless if nobody maintains them. The uniform nature of current events pages means that it's extremely easy to recreate one if there's at least one person prepared to maintain it at intervals smaller than a month. I cannot believe that with its current world focus that <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_current_events.html" title="Chinese current events">Chinese current events</a> has not been updated since September. Even British and Irish current events have seen a story that made the first headline in <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events.html" title="Current events">Current events</a> on February 2nd. The deletion of Current events in Cisjordan also establishes that you cannot justify this article just because others haven't been deleted yet. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigbluefish_a3b9.html" title="User:Bigbluefish">BigBlueFish</a> 12:03, 4 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - your comment that <i>Even British and Irish current events have seen a story that made the first headline in <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events.html" title="Current events">Current events</a> on February 2nd</i> would appear to indicate that you have a fundamental misunderstanding of the purpose and usage of the current events articles: there's no such thing as a 'headline' event - items are added chronologically, the more recent at the top. Regional current events pages are used for interesting news items which <b>exclusively</b> affect those areas - if they are of wider interest or ramifications they go in the global article. The items should be used to link to associated encyclopaedia articles. As I said, the arguments have not changed since the last AfD nomination, and I would commend a re-reading of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_British_and_Irish_current_events_c5de.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/British and Irish current events">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/British and Irish current events</a>. -- <a href="../../../a/r/w/User%7EArwel_Parry_70fd.html" title="User:Arwel Parry">Arwel</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/w/User_talk%7EArwel_Parry_e253.html" title="User talk:Arwel Parry">talk</a>) 13:22, 4 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - forgive me for misunderstanding the ordering of the Current events article. It remains that one of the seven world headlines of that day was predominantly associated with the UK and no doubt has specific local consequences. It's beside the point though... the current article almost implies that Charles Kennedy is still standing for leader of the Lib Dems because of its outdatedness, and is confusing because it refers to days of the week as if it was documenting last week. I have read and re-read the previous AfD and there seem to be only two arguments justifying a keep. The first is that it will be updated; if this is the case then why has this not happened? Don't tell me that the Thames whale or the dissolution of Fathers4Justice don't fall into relevant topics for the article. The second is that the information documents past events in an encyclopedic fashion. Yes they do, but in this case they should not be labelled as current events. We should instead make <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_in_the_UK_b2b8.html" title="2006 in the UK">2006 in the UK</a> or a similar title, just as the Irish, for example, have done with <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_in_Ireland_6efb.html" title="2006 in Ireland">2006 in Ireland</a>. Take an outsider's view of the encyclopedia. This article makes it look bad. Why is it that we are so resistive to change? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigbluefish_a3b9.html" title="User:Bigbluefish">BigBlueFish</a> 20:22, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I should also point out that the last discussion involved the statement, <i>"It will (we promise) continue to be maintained."</i>. That lasted five months. It's more important to focus on the core of the encylopedia and leave things like this to Wikinews if there isn't enough interest to keep it going. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigbluefish_a3b9.html" title="User:Bigbluefish">BigBlueFish</a> 12:07, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Fair play, please; that quote is taken <b>out of context</b>, and was made by someone arguing for the page's deletion. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">talk</a> 08:59, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - apologies. The comment was made by someone arguing for the page's deletion who was assessing the reasons for inclusion. As such it reflects promises made by <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">You</a>, <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunc_268d.html" title="User:Func">func</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a>, and conditional keep votes by <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJoolz_b423.html" title="User:Joolz">Joolz</a> and <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamsan_7def.html" title="User:Adamsan">adamsan</a>. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigbluefish_a3b9.html" title="User:Bigbluefish">BigBlueFish</a> 13:36, 6 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Point of order</b>: I made no such promise. I offered help in keeping the page up to date. Nobody used the word promise except for Aaron. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">talk</a> 13:48, 6 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - your words were "I will help to keep it up to date". That's a positive future assertion, whether or not it is to be interpreted as a commitment. I'm not criticising the fact that you haven't been able to sustain that assertion, which I understand, but that at least some people chose to support keeping the article on the grounds that they thought that you and others would. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigbluefish_a3b9.html" title="User:Bigbluefish">BigBlueFish</a> 15:44, 6 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am merely seeking to redress the fact that the comments in question do not support the statement you were seeking to base on the strength of them. Your latest statement, that people have voted keep in that debate on the grounds that they thought it would be maintained is somewhat misleading too. One user voted keep as long as it is maintained, but that vote made no mention of who maintains it or how often it should be maintained. The original discussion is there for all to read and draw their own conclusions from; there is no need to keep referring to facets of it. I would also hope it isn't too much to ask for some sort of apology for your interpretation of my words as implying a commitment when you agree no such commitment is inherent within them. I apologise if you feel I am taking this too personally; I merely happen to believe my words should not be presented as meaning more than they did. As I stated, <i>I offered help in keeping the page up to date</i>; your quotation of my exact words, "I will help to keep it up to date", supports that, and so I find myself unclear as to why you felt it necessary to quote my own words at me when I have already elucidated what I said, and when they are already on the record for all to see. Rather than get sidetracked into debating the merits and arguments of the previous discussion, would it not be better to allow this one to develop? My offer still stands: I am willing to help maintain the page. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">talk</a> 16:18, 6 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But <i>will</i> you? Nobody makes any commitments on Wikipedia for which they can be blamed or incriminated for should they not honour them. That is the free nature of the wiki. The use of the word "promise" may in that sense be interpreted as such a commitment, and I apologise for such an ambiguity, which was made for the sake of quoting a past summary of the last consensus. It remains that "I will" instigates much more optimism than "I am willing". We are now in the position to look back at our decision, see that in spite of good intentions it has not proved practicable, stop trying to maintain that the content of the article is current and refocus our efforts on content that does not expire. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigbluefish_a3b9.html" title="User:Bigbluefish">BigBlueFish</a> 16:36, 6 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I appreciate your apology; as to anyone maintaining the article is current, I'm not sure anyone is. The page however, cannot be archived since we can't move it whilst it is up for afd. I'm also unclear as to how to split the page history into four pages, so that those users who contributed can be credited at <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_2005_in_Britain_and_Ireland_4a55.html" title="October 2005 in Britain and Ireland">October 2005 in Britain and Ireland</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_2005_in_Britain_and_Ireland_d754.html" title="November 2005 in Britain and Ireland">November 2005 in Britain and Ireland</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_2005_in_Britain_and_Ireland_2c81.html" title="December 2005 in Britain and Ireland">December 2005 in Britain and Ireland</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_2006_in_Britain_and_Ireland_f909.html" title="January 2006 in Britain and Ireland">January 2006 in Britain and Ireland</a>. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">talk</a> 17:07, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The Channel Islands are legally <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Islands_949e.html" title="British Islands">British Islands</a>.
