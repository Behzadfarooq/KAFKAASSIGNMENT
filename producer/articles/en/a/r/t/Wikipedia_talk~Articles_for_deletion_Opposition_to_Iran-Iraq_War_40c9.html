<li><b>Comment</b> None of the sources on the movie mention anything about opposition to the war. To the contrary, the cited interview with the director states: <i>"Rather, he escaped the country in 1986 at age 17 <b>out of an instinct for survival</b>: to avoid fighting in the bloody Iran-Iraq war."</i> (emphasis added) Not a word about opposing the war; he wanted to stay alive.

<p><b>Issue:</b> The issue here, according to my understanding, is mainly between <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> (<a href="../../../f/a/n/User_talk%7EFan-1967_07f3.html" title="User talk:Fan-1967">talk</a>), and <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatchouli_1f56.html" title="User:Patchouli">Patchouli</a> (<a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatchouli_e06e.html" title="User talk:Patchouli">talk</a>). Fan is claiming that Patch has not supplied any sources that prove that there is opposition to the Iran-Iraq war. Patch, however, believes that by having <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> sources that discuss derserters, fleeing, and hiding, the article should be kept.<br />
In my understanding, the main issue of this dispute is the disagreement as to whether or not the desertion and evasion that the soldiers are currently doing is opposition to the war or not. Patch believes it is. Fan believes that without a source, it cannot be included in Wikipedia.</p>
<p><b>Dispute according to Fan:</b> Fan believes that this article does not have enough verifiable sources to back up the claim that there is opposition to the war. He believes that soldiers who desert and flee from battle are attempting to survive. To quote him, "Let's face it, both Iran and Iraq used their draftees as disposable cannon fodder. Deserting or evading was not "opposition"; it was survival."<br />
However, Fan has said that if a source can be found that proves that the acts of desertion and evasion are motivated by opposition to the war, then it would be acceptable as proof of opposition to the war. However, presently he believes there is no source that does this.</p>
<p><b>Dispute according to Patch:</b> Patch believes that the desertion and evasion is proof of opposition to the war. He believes that the article should be kept because of this. He has found sources that he believes proves this point.<br />
Patch has also admitted that while desertion may not be considered as large an object of opposition as other opposition/criticism pages, he does not agree with the deletion of a true event.</p>
<p><b>Dispute according to other editors:</b> Currently, all are in favour of deletion, for the reasons Fan has made. Some have also claimed that the article is presently unencyclopedaic.<br />

<p>I find it puzzling that I was asked to come and comment on this, but here goes. Partly, I agree with Patchouli: I do think that opposition to the Iran-Iraq war is an interesting, encyclopedic topic, and that evidence of people fleeing the country to escape the draft and of a draft of children would be relevant for an article on this topic. Hopefully, Wikipedia will eventually have a well-cited, neutral article on this topic that incorporates these facts. While unsourced statements are generally bad, they are not a criterion for deletion, and are found all over Wikipedia. However, the article is currently does not fit some basic criteria which all articles need, especially NPOV. The article is not very balanced, listing only alleged negative things about the war. Additionally, Patchouli should cite his sources for the first two paragraphs of the Iran section. The most important problem of all is the relative lack of information that is actually about opposition to the Iraq war. There may be some information in the currently cited sources about internal opposition (such as evidence of protests, guerilla groups, etc.), and Patchouli and other editors should try to use this and other sources in the article to make it more complete. The currently present information, such as that a draft existed, and some vague group of people held undefined negative opinions about it, is not very unique in war, and if more information is not added, the content is non-notable under its current title. Maybe the information about the draft would be better put at the article <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran-Iraq_War_b457.html" title="Iran-Iraq War">Iran-Iraq War</a>. Sorry if that was a bit long-winded&#160;:) <small><a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELittleDan_7151.html" title="User:LittleDan">LittleDan</a></small><sup><a href="../../../l/i/t/User_talk%7ELittleDan_c646.html" title="User talk:LittleDan">talk</a></sup> 19:39, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If I could add a few points: We have <u>anecdotal</u> reports of desertion and evasion. All wars have some degree of this. We have no cited sources to indicate numbers. If, in fact, such numbers could be found, there <i>might</i> be a potential here for an article on desertion and evasion. However, if the article is titled <i>"Opposition to Iran-Iraq War"</i>, somebody, somewhere in the article has to be cited as saying "I oppose this war." Not one such citation exists. Patchouli <i>feels</i> that desertion equals opposition. I don't agree, and don't see that anyone else does either. Every single source that specifies a reason for the evasion/desertion lists fear or desire for survival as the reason. That's not opposition. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 19:48, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You don't have to be. That's what I'm here for. I'm also here because I felt you raised issues that were slightly different to the other two editors, along with the other people who voted for <i>Delete</i>. They are, admittedly, very similar to Fan's points - but you have made very specific examples. I am sure that you would be very vital in reaching a compromise, since you seem to come from somewhere in the middle. Also, as you are the person who nominated this article for deletion, and thus inadvertantly beginning this RfC, I feel you should take a part in it - even if it is small. <font style="background-color:#cedff2;font-size:100%;font-weight:bold;border:1px solid#a3b0bf;text-align:center;color:#000;">Scalene</font><small><sup>•<a href="../../../s/c/a/User%7EScalene_b93a.html" title="User:Scalene">UserPage</a>•<a href="../../../s/c/a/User_talk%7EScalene_f0b6.html" title="User talk:Scalene">Talk</a>•<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Scalene_9562.html" title="Special:Contributions/Scalene">Contributions</a>•<a href="../../../s/c/a/User%7EScalene_Userboxes_0695.html" title="User:Scalene/Userboxes">Biography</a>•<a href="../../../s/c/a/User%7EScalene_Esperanza_8a10.html" title="User:Scalene/Esperanza"><font style="color:#00F;">?</font></a>•</sup></small> 22:55, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comments after First Compromise:</b> At this time, I must make some critical comments. The primary issue here is that Patch is unable to come up with a verifiable source that says fleeing is a mark of opposition. I agree with fan on this. However, Patch's opinion that desertion is, in fact, a sign of resistance, could be what makes the difference.<br />
At this time, I have formed two possible compromises that may satisfy both sides.</p>
<p>1. If a verifiable source were to be found that proves that most desertion is a sign of resistance, would both parties be willing to come to an agreement?<br />
This would also mean that if no source similar to this is found, the article should be deleted.</p>
<p>2. Patch, Fan makes two good points. All other opposition/resistance articles have proof of resistance that this article does not have. Also, it is normal to assume that desertion is out of instinct for survival, rather than anything else. For that reason, I currently lean towards recomending the article for deletion, unless all parties agree with the first compromise. For that, I ask if you would be willing to accept the deletion of this article until you find a verifiable source.<br />
This is what LittleDan and Fan want, I understand. The deletion of the article would not be permanent. When you find a verifiable source, it would be perfectly acceptable to reconstruct the article again.</p>

<p>I don't think a "Request for Comment", or any form of dispute resolution, is appropriate procedure on an ongoing AfD page. This is neither the place nor the time for this. This page is not about a dispute between two or three users, it's about the article and whether or not the article or the subject matter is of encyclopedic nature. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMardavich_3f4a.html" title="User:Mardavich">Mardavich</a> 23:02, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have to say I've never seen an RFC on an AFD before. Not sure it's appropriate. If there is a consensus to delete, does an RFC become a method to forestall that consensus? If invoking RFC becomes common, does the AFD process end up becoming hopelessly clogged? It's bad enough already. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 02:23, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>AFD is supposed to be about reaching consensus. So is RFC. AFD is not a vote. Perhaps this is a better way to run an AFD? At least in cases like this where leaving the page as is would be wrong, but deleting it outright would also be wrong?

<dd>I agree, it's ridiculous that we're spending so much time in commenting and bureaucracy when Patchouli is the only one who opposes deletion, and he wrote the article in the first place. I know you have good intentions, Scalene, but I'm not sure that all of this is helping. I'm not trying to "fan the flames" or anything, but we all have more important things to do. <small><a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELittleDan_7151.html" title="User:LittleDan">LittleDan</a></small><sup><a href="../../../l/i/t/User_talk%7ELittleDan_c646.html" title="User talk:LittleDan">talk</a></sup> 17:45, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm with you, here. I just want to get the thing closed. I've been notified that the article has been moved to Conscription in the Iran-Iraq War. I think that Patch is trying to avoid deletion. Plus, he has not responded to either compromise.</dd>
<dd>I'm thinking that this needs to be dealt with further up. Patch has a history of POV pushing, and this <b>is</b> slowing things down.

<li><b>Comment</b> Again, I'm sorry if you don't like the way I voted. Accusing me of not reading the article before I voted when I've quoted from the article itself in my vote is, to me, inappropriate. I voted for the options that I thought best, in this case <b>delete</b> or <b>merge</b>, I owe you no explaination for my vote or anything else I do for that matter. The links to other articles I included to disprove the claim that Iran was doing anything anything new or unprecedented by killing or torturing deserters, that has been a feature of warfare for as long as humans have been warring with eachother, even in the U.S. Army, desertion can get you sentenced to death. As it stands, I see nothing in this article that could not be easily covered as a section on conscription in the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran-Iraq_War_b457.html" title="Iran-Iraq War">Iran-Iraq War</a> article.L0b0t 15:15, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I forthrightly concede that I did not like the way you voted. I furthermore appreciate your time and examination of the matter at hand on top of recognizing your right to vote.

<dd><b>Comment</b> The size problem can and should be dealt with by removing all the Iranian POV about America controling the Iraqi invasion but, that is another discussion. You are right on point about consensus though, and I apologise for misinterpreting your comments. I still feel that an article about "opposition" to the war should include more on opposition from civilians and less on deserters and cowards. With that said, I think an article on conscription, both Iranian and Iraqi, might be a good idea. L0b0t 16:17, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> There is a problem, however, with turning this content into an article on conscription, draft evasion and desertion. Pretty much most of the content is anecdotal. All of these activities appear in just about every war, especially when casualty rates climb. Was desertion or evasion more common in this conflict than in others? We don't seem to have sources that say so, just some vague commentary that there was a lot. No reliable numbers seem to be there. They're needed. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 02:49, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
