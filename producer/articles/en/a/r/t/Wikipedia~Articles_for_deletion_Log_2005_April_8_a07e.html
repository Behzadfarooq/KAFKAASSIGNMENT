<p>This article (which hasn't been expanded at all since its creation almost a year ago) is inherently problematic and can never become encyclopedic, the way I see it. Though the term "Accession states" is common enough, its true explanation is nothing more than a definition -- namely the countries that last acceded into the European Union. When Bulgaria and Romania join, it's them that are gonna be commonly referred to as accession states, when more countries join, it'll be them, and so forth. I suggest a <b>deletion</b>, since all it contains and all it can possibly contain are described elsewhere, either in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_European_Union_6398.html" title="History of the European Union">History of the European Union</a> or <a href="../../../e/n/l/Enlargement_of_the_European_Union_c95b.html" title="Enlargement of the European Union">Enlargement of the European Union</a> or <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Accession_2003_e69e.html" title="Treaty of Accession 2003">Treaty of Accession 2003</a>, while the definition it currently provides is at the same time limited and misleading. <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAris_Katsaris_46a9.html" title="User:Aris Katsaris">Aris Katsaris</a> 01:05, Apr 8, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> -- Roughly 15,000 Google hits for exact phrase, and, imho, the persistent vandalism to this entry shows that author's work is getting noticed. Vanity is not sufficient grounds for deletion if entry is relevant/subject notable. Also, subsequent, critically analytical [if POV, and in need of neutralization] changes have been made to this article, showing interest from the non-vandal side of the fence too. This is an entry that apparently provokes strong feelings in some, and is in need of expansion / input from editors other than the author, not deletion. -- <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrian_Lamo_094a.html" title="User:Adrian Lamo">Adrian</a> 19:17, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>My only comments to this would be: (a) persistent vandalism of this particular entry is probably less reflective of its relevance and more reflective of the author's reference to it to garner attention. For example, the vandalism appears to be concentrated around the times of mention by the author on his weblog or in the column that prompted this relisting. (b) While Wikipedia is great at the multiple author expansion/edit model, self-written bio pages like this are the best examples of the single-editor problem -- precious few others are in the position to contribute about a subject as narrow and unknown, and when they do (as in the current Metafilter adds/deletes), it's mass-deleted as vandalism rather than edited and tuned to remain neutral. <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelfuego_7a53.html" title="User:Delfuego">Jason</a> 19:37, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> --Vanity is not sufficient grounds for deletion. As discussed in the past vote, subject's writing credits seem to make him a legitimate figure, and this new debate about him seems to only increase the relevance of his entry. (and in reply to Cjr2q below, he created this page eight months before his article appeared -- that's hardly correlative. And when did glib encouragement of anything merit deletion of an article? Attack the page, not the person.) -- <a href="../../../j/s/n/User%7EJsnell_4a6e.html" title="User:Jsnell">Jsnell</a> 19:21, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> -- This is clearly a vanity page. Chronicling every single person who's ever written for some two-bit website is a project unto itself.

"Cyrus Farivar" is a bit less common of a name than Bob Jones -- most of the 15,000 hits are Farivar's bylines and stories written for publication, and other information related to him.

<li>-- I've repeatedly and strongly supported my position in favor of this entry being kept, but I think Snowspinner needs to more clearly articulate his reasons. Out of respect for the community he serves, it would be appropriate to explain specific reasons for disregarding specific votes, or rationales. To his credit, he's done so somewhat, but I'd be uneasy about this article being kept, despite a majority opinion, without explanation -- ie, specific suspect accounts involved in the voting, votes not grounded in solid policy, etc. That said, I still support the whole not-deleting-this-entry thing. -- <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrian_Lamo_094a.html" title="User:Adrian Lamo">Adrian</a> 03:58, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Fair enough. Here's my position. A journalist with notable publications writes an article on himself. Is this bad? Yes. Should we assume that he knows about our policies on vanity pages? No. Assume good faith. Don't bite the newbies. This is someone who is giving Wikipedia good press, and who probably made an honest mistake. Regardless of the original status of the article, it's been edited by many people who are not him now - that makes it not vanity anymore. It's just wrong to delete an article because of a genuine mistake of a user who is being a real ambassador of good faith and for whom a strong case for notability can be made. If I had started this article, saying he was a journalist with publications in Macworld, the New York Times, Wired, and Slate, there would be no objection. The issue is that people are pissy that he made a mistake. And even more pissy that he made his mistake publicly on Slate. That's not a reason to delete. Reasons to delete have to do with the content of an article. Too much of this discussion has to do with the article's creator. And those aren't valid votes. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 04:18, August 2, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Personally, I have supported a person editing autobiographical pages in the past. But that guy was notable, and it was appropriate for him to have a Wikipedia page. Not so for this guy. But whether you have compelling reasons for ignoring each vote is irrelevant, because you have already made it clear that you will ignore the results of the community process, even before it is completed, and no matter how compelling the popular consensus is. This is the very definition of prejudice. --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrouse_1daf.html" title="User:Grouse">Grouse</a> 08:39, 2 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>This is a quote from a previous VfD which also began as an autobiography: <i>The biography proposed policy, which says in part "Biographies on the following people may be included in Wikipedia...Published authors, editors, and photographers who have written books with an audience of 5,000 or more or in periodicals with a circulation of 5,000 or more."</i> Mr. Farivar meets this criteria I believe.

<li><b>Delete</b> and <b>Userfy</b> - Vanity, non-notable, non-encyclopedic. Popularity or notoriety must not be mistaken for notability. This sets an awful precedent. If every person with comparable achievements should see fit to make Wikipedia entries about themselves, then it serves to elevate the signal-to-noise ratio to uncomfortable levels. That he links to his own Wikipedia entry on <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2123673/fr/rss/" class="external text" title="http://slate.msn.com/id/2123673/fr/rss/" rel="nofollow">the Slate article</a> and incites others to do the same encourages this. This entry would best be relegated to a userpage. Journalism is about the articles, not the journalists, and at this point, Mr. Farivar's case for being notable or well-established is highly debatable.

<li><b>Keep</b>, This is my first VfD. In fact, this discussion has been highly illuminating for me, teaching me much about Wikipedia and the process of creating, editing, and deleting entries. The entry should be kept as a sort of "meta-entry" about what Wikipedia is, can be, and shouldn't be. Because you have to keep the discussion about the VfD, you also have to keep the article to which it refers. Although, in fairness, if you can both keep the article, and keep the links to it alive, and at the same time perform a redirect, then the article should be slid to the User Pages section. Like it or not, the Slate article that tweaks Wikipedia is now a permanent part of the ether - people will be reading it and linking to it for years to come. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalangali_5158.html" title="User:Malangali">Malangali</a> 11:46, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wikipedia is not a tool for reward or punishment. For a biography, the question isn't how annoying the subject is; it's whether the subject meets the generally agreed-upon <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_Inclusion_of_Biographies_a5ce.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for Inclusion of Biographies">Wikipedia:Criteria_for_Inclusion_of_Biographies</a>. It is independently verifiable that Farivar has written for "periodicals with a circulation of 5,000 or more". Therefore, a biography of him merits inclusion, according to Wikipedia guidelines. (And, yes, I think it would actually be a good thing to have articles on every writer for the New York Times. Wikipedia is not paper; there is no shortage of space here. More information is better than less information.) That's why I vote <b>keep</b>--but for those who are unpersuaded, I point out another possible solution that was used in a previous situation.</li>

<ul>
<li>When I joined Wikipedia, I am embarrassed to admit that I created an article about myself, because I met the criteria for inclusion. After becoming more familiar with Wikipedia standards, I came to understand that it was inappropriate for a user to judge his own notability. I therefore <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Jacob_Sager_Weinstein_a150.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Jacob Sager Weinstein">put the article I had created up for VFD</a>. The consensus that emerged was that it would be deleted--but that a user who felt the information was worth preserving would recreate it from independently verifiable sources. This might seem like a rather roundabout approach, but I'd argue that it is reasonable compromise that is true to the spirit of Wikipedia. So... My vote (and first choice) is that this article be kept. My second choice would be that, if it is deleted, a user recreate it from independently verifiable sources. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacobw_974e.html" title="User:Jacobw">Jacobw</a> 15:34, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>On what planet? Until this Wikipedia page popped up, I'm sure a lot of us here (Mr. Snell excluded) had never heard of Mr. Farivar. Putting up a Wikipedia entry on yourself to make yourself "notable" isn't exactly the way to go about doing it. I'm going to agree with the recommendation to <b>userfy</b>, as that seems to be the most graceful way to solve this problem - Mr. Farivar stays on Wikipedia in some fashion, and all the arguments used against it thus far would become irrelevent, as he's a user, not a "very notable Internet personality."

<ul>
<li>-- This article meets Wikipedia policy criteria for inclusion of biographical entries, which include several standards under which a subject may qualify as 'notable' -- Farivar meets enough of these standards for his entry to be valid. Votes to delete based solely on "this is vanity!" are not reflective of valid cause for deletion under WP policy, and may be disregarded unless amended to show objective reasoning recognized by existing WP policy. I note again that there's enough interest in this topic that it's highly probable that the community will polish and update it as time goes on, the lack of faith in the WP process shown by some notwithstanding. -- <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrian_Lamo_094a.html" title="User:Adrian Lamo">Adrian</a> 13:30, 3 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well, <b>I</b> first heard about Cyrus Farivar before even knowing he had made a Wikipedia article about himself. It was from a mailing list my former work colleague manages.

I recognize, respect, and disagree with the original reasons for this Vfd, but some of the votes here smack of a desire to tear others down, not make Wikipedia better. To me, one of the fantastic things about Wikipedia has always been the potential for controversial entries to grow and evolve. This one won't be given a chance if deleted, and that's a shame.

<li><b>Delete</b> -- I see my name on Google all the time. I have occasionally been the subject of "internet controversy." I am a published journalist. I have the common decency not to create a Wikipedia page about myself. This opens the door to countless other "vanity pages" by would-be actors, writers, etc., and I see no benefit in having Cyrus Farivar on a list with H.L. Mencken. When Mr. Farivar writes something on the same level as Mr. Mencken, I will be the first to argue for his reinstatement. Hell, I'll even write his entry. Until then, he doesn't belong here. -- The New Zorker (note, no Wikipedia page) 209.113.141.74 20:56, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>note: user's IP is new, but the user himself wrote the original entries for <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Along_The_Watchtower_f85d.html" title="All Along The Watchtower">All Along The Watchtower</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blind_Willie_McTell_%28song%29_a167.html" title="Blind Willie McTell (song)">Blind Willie McTell</a> ages and ages ago.

<li>I have to ask: at what point is someone "Wikipedia-worthy?" And who decides that? Surely Mencken doesn't define the bottom limit. Does David Pogue? Does Steven Levy? Does Maureen Dowd? And what if that decision is influenced by the behavior of the author or the subject of the page, rather than his/her own merits? In addition, what if this wasn't a self-created page? Then the "vanity page" arguments have to turn into something else. Ego page? Nepotism page? <a href="../../../j/s/n/User%7EJsnell_4a6e.html" title="User:Jsnell">Jsnell</a> 21:17, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>You're right, you're right. It's unfair to put a "bar" down in terms of these sorts of arguments. If he didn't create the page himself, there would be less of a "delete this page" upswell. But the fact remains, David Pogue, Steven Levy and Maureen Dowd are all fairly well-known, or at least have a following of some sort. I see no Farivar Fan Club. If I create a page on <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murray_Chass_3c2a.html" title="Murray Chass">Murray Chass</a>, an author whose name I currently see on the front page of the New York Times website, does that grant him legitimacy? While I acknowledge Mencken is a poor bar to set, a bar does exist, and Mr. Farivar does not clear it. The New Zorker 21:25, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks for the vote, invisible user. I don't really appreciate your mention of "whoring" in conjunction with "Macworld," but since your sentence is completely nonsensical I can't really question it directly. The Slate reference was a joke -- we professional writers, we makey with the jokey sometimes, see? I see what's going on here. Cyrus stepped on a landmine that was armed with the sanctimony of Wikipedians. And he is being punished (in various ways) for that. I'd like to believe that this article is being voted for/against deletion on its merits (or lack of same), but it's clear that some participants in this process are slagging on the spirit of Wikipedia while claiming to endorse its tenents. It's too bad, but very enlightening about the weaknesses in a system as strong as Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/s/n/User%7EJsnell_4a6e.html" title="User:Jsnell">Jsnell</a> 23:37, 1 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>;Subject announcement of a Wikipedia page about himself will do more good for Wikipedia than harm. Might bring a large number of new readers to Wikipedia. (This is the first time I've ever edited anything here.) Furthermore, his role in outing the 'greenlighting' hoax will have done a lot in bringing to light the existence of 'hoax communities' like WookieFetish. Finally, what's so bad about vanity pages? Is disk space not getting so cheap as to be free? Won't vanity pages make people care more about Wikipedia? If a person gets used to writing a page about themselves, that should introduce them to the process of Wikipedia and might get them to start editing other pages about subjects they care about. All of this is a good thing, right? 63.197.5.4</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - I am in a position to know that Cyrus Farivar was one of the ringleaders in developing the "Greenlighting" hoax - the purpose was to see how far the traditional media could be hoaxed before Cyrus would "uncover" the hoax and be the hero. The whole "Greenlighting" hoax was designed in large part by him in order to get recognition for himself (his blog had been receiving very little traffic or attention). Unfortuately Cyrus jumped the gun and pulled the plug on the hoax before it really got going. Therefore since Cyrus was a conspirator in creating the hoax in the first place, this entry is only serving to perputate his self-grandeur. 209.225.104.124 02:58, 2 August 2005 (UTC)

I have not RTFA on policies, but it seems to me that is what is germane here, not personality, popularity, relevance etc. Clearly, there are other ways to utilze the wiki-resources to announce oneself to the world, and while I do slightly tip my hat to C.F. for the brazen marketing, I also offer a slap upside the head for not following the posted TOS.

<p>Ok, so it gets a few thousand Google hits, but this is an internet radio station. I doubt it is notable. The article itself is quite poor, and needs cleanup, and the fact it includes a list of (presumably) forum user names isn't very promising. Internet radio stations generally aren't notable and I think this one isn't notable enough for it's own article. As it is part of a MMORPG, I think it should be <b>merged</b> in to <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Loathing_5bed.html" title="Kingdom of Loathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a> or <b>deleted</b>. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 02:41, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> This radiostation is extremely notable. We have a lot of poor stubs on webstations and I don't know why you decided to choose this particular article. I'll quote myself one more time. "I could explain in many ways, why the station is notable, I'd just say it's THE ONLY radiostation based around a MMORPG, not even Everquest has something similar. It works 24 hours a day, all djs are people who play the game and they waste up to 4 hours a day on the radio. A truly notable radiostation.". <i>radio "kingdom of loathing"</i> gets 5000 hits. The station is fully independent from the KoL, it is not part of the game and it's real, working and popular radiostation. It shouldn't be merged, but rather stay on it's own. Please research before proposing such ridiculous deletion requests. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue">Grue</a> 04:33, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'd hardly say it was ridiculous. Web stations generally aren't notable, I did some research, and nothing came my way to show why this is notable. If this stays, the show articles should definetly go, or be merged. As you are the writer, i'd say strong keep is a bit POV, because its a 'Keep' at best. I'm perfectly justified in listing this VfD. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 16:48, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Your Google search is unfair, and brings up too many Kingdom of Loathing results. The search "Radio" "Kingdom of Loathing" brings up the same amount, although less than 5,000 hits is hardly notability.</li>

<ul>
<li>Exactly. Furthermore, this station isn't one of the most popular ones - None of Shoutcast's front page stations have an article, bar Virgin Radio, as it is an FM feed. The fact Radio KoL only has 200 slots on a 24kbps mono stream means it could never be as notable as any of those stations - Why should this be an exception? The fact it is the only known MMORPG station is irrelevant, it can be explained in <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Loathing_5bed.html" title="Kingdom of Loathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a>. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 01:30, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>So how many radiostations can you name that have 24/7 of live shows, without replays or hour-long music sequences. I bet only a few.

<li>See <a href="http://www.shoutcast.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.shoutcast.com" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, theres a lot there with five times or more the listeners of Radio KoL. To my knowledge, only stations like <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digitally_Imported_eccf.html" title="Digitally Imported">Digitally Imported</a> deserve an article. Thats on Wikipedia and it is one of few that deserve inclusion. If this survives theres no way you can VfD any station with more than 120 listeners, which is just above what KoL had when I checked last night. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 17:18, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>You know, these with thousands of listeners are commercial radiostations. As far as indie radios go, they couldn't be much more popular than rkol. However I was not talking about popularity here. You could have a bland dj-less top 40 radiostation, and it could be very popular. Or you could have an adfree radiostation with ~20 djs, each having his/her own unique personality, working for free, playing music that you won't hear anywhere else. Which of these deserves an article more? <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue">Grue</a> 18:15, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> but <b>needs revision</b>. RKoL is unique. I don't really feel that comparisons to other streaming radio stations is fair, since it's not remarkable for being a radio station, but rather for being the only MMO-related, player run station.

The only reason Koeberg has an article while they don't is because Koeberg is <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>'s only commercial Nuke power plant.

<ul>
<li><i>(Above user has 10 edits, of which 5 are to the KoL page.)</i> Being the only commercial nuclear power station in South Africa is a convergence of three general qualities - there are loads of commercial power stations, loads of nuclear power stations, and loads of power stations in South Africa, but only one which is all three. "MMORPG-connected", however, is verging on the trivial. OK, there are lots of radio stations, and lots of Internet sites. Most netradio operations are run by amateurs with no experience of broadcasting for real, so "player-run" doesn't really say anything. But while there are lots of MMORPGs, there are few things which you can say are MMORPG-related. It's like saying I'm notable for being the only DJ on my small station to recycle TV presentation elements from the 1980s on a music quiz show (which I do, to great effect). <a href="../../../1/3/1/User%7E131.251.0.8.html" title="User:131.251.0.8">131.251.0.8</a> 15:28, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC) (This is me forgetting to sign in first. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> 15:36, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC))</li>

If so, I am curious why Kingdom of Loathing itself ranks worthy of an article but its radio station doesn't rank worthy of a sub-article (since this user voted for deletion and not merge). <a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHaplo3k_142a.html" title="User:Haplo3k">Haplo3k</a> 02:20, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This would be based on <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue">Grue</a>'s claims that the station doesn't belong in <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Loathing_5bed.html" title="Kingdom of Loathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a>, which I think it does. As for games, they are published material, but again games get deleted often if they aren't notable. In this case the MMORPG is just about above the line of notability, but 'just another internet radio station' isn't notable. The fact it is the only one attached to a MMORPG doesn't change that fact. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 15:36, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Right, I know your stance and I agree with it - add the article to <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Loathing_5bed.html" title="Kingdom of Loathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a>. As I said, I was commenting on the fact that the above user voted for deletion, not merge, indicating the game is worthy of note but the station is not (in fact, I'm sure you'd find many people to argue that one of the reasons the game is notable is because of the station). <a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHaplo3k_142a.html" title="User:Haplo3k">Haplo3k</a> 17:06, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> On Shoutcast.com, Radio KoL is currently ranked 323 by number of listeners. Even with their capacity filled the station could not enter the top 200. This removes any suggestion of 'popular radio station', because by wide standards, it isn't 'up there' with the notable stations. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 15:43, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I was under the impression that sometimes things are notable because they are unique, no matter how popular they are. Radio KoL caters to a specific group of people, and is the first internet radio station to be created with that purpose. There's no way we could increase our listener numbers without losing our individuality (not to mention the fact that we couldn't afford it). The reason I, and others, think that Radio KoL is worthy of note (whether as article or subarticle) is <i>because</i> of this uniqueness. I completely understand that this is a slippery slope, that you don't want to be forced to include every internet radio station with 5 listeners that pops up claiming to be unique - but please note that I am arguing here <i>against votes for deletion</i> and completely support a merge. <a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHaplo3k_142a.html" title="User:Haplo3k">Haplo3k</a> 17:06, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The above was a note to counter 'keep' comments suggesting it is a popular radio station. Increasing the capacity would be irrelevant, the station listener number fluctuates inbetween 100 and 130 daily. As for uniqueness, everything that is unique does not warrant an article. Stations for online gaming (MMORPG goes under that on a wider scale) are common - a lot of clans have small stations, like Radio KoL. None are notable. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 18:33, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wow, 323. It is actually much higher than I expected. Certainly very high for a non-commercial station. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue">Grue</a> 18:49, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Most of those in front of you aren't commercial. Theres about 75 commercial stations in the top 300, i'd estimate. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 15:29, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> for several reasons. 1) It's pretty notable 2) So that the individual show/DJ articles can have someplace to be merged to and 3) if merged into the main KoL article it would eventually be merged right back out when that gets too big. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 20:58, Apr 13, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'd like you to explain the notability more. How is it any more notable than any other random 150 listener internet station? The argument presented is that it is the only MMORPG station, which contradicts the argument for not merging that it isn't an MMORPG station directly. It doesn't seem to be any more notable than your typical clan station or IRC radio. As for the article getting too big, that doesn't seem to be the case. The individual DJ articles can easily go into <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Loathing_5bed.html" title="Kingdom of Loathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a> under a Radio KoL section. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 21:33, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I voted to merge the DJs and content writers to this article, but after reading a few more days of postings and asking some friends with interest in MMORPGs or independent broadcasting, I still think RKoL is sufficiently pioneering to be worth keeping an article. In a year or two, there will be dozens of these, and most won't have notability worth WP inclusion, but RKoL seems to have begun something more significant (technologically and socially) than "your typical clan station" or radio-game-chat. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 14:30, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge or Keep</b> -- If kept, it needs some work. For starters the specific DJ names should be removed, and some note of the station's interactive nature with respect to the game should be included. The inclusion of DJ names makes this sound less like a presentation of interesting information so much as self-congratulatory back patting. If that's the point, then <a href="http://www.everything2.com" class="external text" title="http://www.everything2.com" rel="nofollow">e2</a> might be a better place for this. As a DJ on said radio station, I feel it's unique enough to warrant its own article, but only if it's written in a way that explains why it's unique (24/7 live staffing, its interactive nature, the back-and-forth with the game, etc.), but I don't really have an issue with merging it either. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChungkuo_4112.html" title="User:Chungkuo">Chungkuo</a> 15:38, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As mentioned, user is biased for station as is a member. I'm looking forward to adding the two hundred or so stations more notable than KoL.<a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 15:53, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"More notable" in which sense: innovation, listener count, Google hits, or what? I agree with Chungkuo that the most noteworthy bits need to be added or expanded so the article establishes the notability that some voters don't see, but how many of those "two hundred or so" stations have done some substantially new thing like RKoL seems to have done? I write this as someone not associated with KoL or RKoL, and as someone who doesn't do any similar form of online gaming.</li>

<li>James Maitland Balfour was the father of Arthur Balfour, a prominent prime minister at the beginning of the 20th century during the "Decline and Fall of the British Aristocracy" - as discussed in the book of the same name by David Cannadine. I followed his link because I wanted to know the kind of family that Arthur Balfour came from, since he staunchly backed the preservation of the House of Lord's traditional powers. Thanks to it, I found out other aristocratic links within the Balfour family, through James' mother and through his own marriages and those of his children. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshyoua_2cc4.html" title="User:Joshyoua">Joshyoua</a> 03:46, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I followed the link for the same reason as Joshyoua. But maybe the solution would be to say more about <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Balfour_ff11.html" title="Arthur Balfour">Arthur Balfour</a>'s background in his own article. The most important point, that <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Balfour_ff11.html" title="Arthur Balfour">Arthur Balfour</a> was the nephew of Prime Minister <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Gascoyne-Cecil%2C_3rd_Marquess_of_Salisbury_8761.html" title="Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury">Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury</a> is already there.

<li>Apparently the most notable thing about this school is that 'The library offers a "Homework Center", every Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday from 3:15 to 4:30pm,' as you keep trying to insert. —<a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorath_83d6.html" title="User:Korath">Korath</a> (<a href="../../../k/o/r/User_talk%7EKorath_cda5.html" title="User talk:Korath">Talk</a>) 00:51, Apr 12, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No less notable than if 'The library offeres a "Homework Center", every Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday from 3:15 to 4:30<b>am</b>.' It's a regularly scheduled library program, no different from poetry readings, or ESL tutoring. The school is notable, the school library is notable, the school library's programs are notable. <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 03:05, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>These facts you are adding do not bolster any case for notability. Take the word of somebody who had to study the Dewey Decimal System in graduate school, I assure you that it is entirely non-notable that this school's library employs it. It's like saying they have books and walls and ceilings. It's no hyperbole to say that 95% of public schools use Dewey. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 00:58, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My opinion is that all schools are notable, therefore their school libraries are also notable. The librarians, special collection's, physical plant, and classification scheme are also notable. Any regular programs the library runs are also notable. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki_is_not_paper.html" title="Wiki is not paper">Wiki_is_not_paper</a>. What bothers me is that people are reducing the amount of information in the article. <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 03:05, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Pointing out the obvious is not information, it is clutter. Whatever your opinion on the notabilty of schools, the fact that a library has "homework time" or uses Dewey is not informative. It would be a surprise if these things were not there. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 05:38, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The key question is if the information is relavent, not if it's obvious. It's good to know that fish are aquatic creatures; an article that did not mention that fish live in water would be deficient. <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 18:39, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That information—that a North American middle school library makes use of the Dewey system—would be quite appropriate for an article on middle schools. It's redundant in the article on each and every school, and just bloats these articles unnecessarily. A middle school that <i>didn't</i> use the Dewey system for a substantial library collection might be worth mentioning. To use your example, the <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fish.html" title="Fish">fish</a> article does indeed describe them as "water-dwelling vertebrate"s. The article on <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trout.html" title="Trout">trout</a>, on the other hand, says that "trout are usually found in cool, clear streams and lakes". The article <i>doesn't</i> explicitly state that trout are <i>always</i> found in water since expect the reader to know this based on his general knowledge of fish. Our <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lungfish.html" title="Lungfish">lungfish</a> article makes explicit note that these creatures can breathe air, because it is <i>unusual</i> and contrary to expectation. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> | <a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">Talk</a> 02:35, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>But, given that many VfD voters are inclusionist about all schools (rather than all universities or all secondary schools), someone will always object, with a good chance someone will be upset that you tried to speedy it. Until non-consensus changes among the WP community, it's safest to <s>waste</s> spend the time getting the usual mix of "all schools are notable" and "all middle schools are non-notable unless (they make the national news / somebody kills a record number of people / haven't seen a notable one yet)" reasons.

<li>Although I believe that not all schools are automatically encyclopedic, and although I believe that "notability" plays a legitimate role in deletion discussions, it is simply <i>not</i> a criterion for <i>speedy</i> deletion under current policy.

The criteria for speedy deletion are quite clear and quite restrictive—and a recent proposal to allow speedy deletions on the basis of non-notability appears to have overwhelming opposition. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 02:08, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't have an opinion as to the ruling, nor a complaint that it shouldn't apply to anything else. I <b>despise</b> that a non-disruptive vote was removed for <i>any</i> reason, and the voter recieved a one week block for it. It gives me a twinge in my stomach.

<ul>
<li>The ruling is in place as punishment for past abuses of the deletion process. The Arbitrators made it explicitly clear what the punishment was and made him explicitly aware of it, and he deliberately violated it knowing full well what the consequences would be. Any edits he makes to any deletion-related page, regardless of what the edit is, can be reverted on sight (this is confirmed by the Request for Clarification at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_1b83.html#Requests_for_clarification" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration#Requests for clarification</a> by anyone and any administrator can (and imho should) block him for up-to a week. As you have had dealings with both GRider and the ArbCom, I presume you were aware of the case. Everyone has the right to comment on the talk: /proposed decision page if you feel it too harsh/too lenient/whatever.

<li>I actually never have been involved. I think it was probably a mistake on the part of the ArbCom to not consider voting as part of the ruling. GRider seems to have made trouble in posting frivolous nominations, but not for disruptive voting. I think it is practically barbaric to remove a vote and then block for the maximum. --<a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 15:59, 2005 Apr 12 (UTC)</li>
<li>Everyone had the right to argue about the case: it's closed now. IMHO it's stupid to block somone to genuinely and with good faith contributes to wikipedia, and is filled with wiki-spirit. As I see it, his sanction ought to be reduced. Censorship from VfD is all that is needed, and even that is excessive. The blocking is purely punitive, and IMHO serves no correctional purpose in a voluntary project. <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 18:39, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>GRider is welcome to ask the ArbCom for relief from a particular aspect of their decision. I note that just last week ArbCom lifted some of the sanctions they had previously imposed on another user, based on a polite request and the markedly improved behaviour of the user in question. (See <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_RK_2_7df4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/RK 2">Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/RK_2</a>). I would also note that GRider's decision to violate the ArbCom's ruling while the "ink was still wet"—the day after the ruling, and less than two hours after he blanked the ArbCom notice on his talk page—doesn't seem to show good judgement. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> | <a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">Talk</a> 16:15, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I personally wish that GRider would not try to demonstrate the unjust nature of the decision by having it fall upon his head. His choice though. But, that leaves other people like myself to defend GRider against an angry and organized bunch of deletionists for the sake of a greater good. A great encyclopedia is not built by obscurantism and deletionism. <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 18:39, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're right,a great encyclopedia is not built on obscuratism and deletionism; it is built on high quality articles on distinctive topics. If wikipedia is inundated with thousands of school stubs that are barely distinguishable from each other, then that poor level of quality hurts the reputation of the project and causes observers to think us sloppy and frivolous. I have no problem with schools being identified on the pages for cities even if they are not notable enough for there own articles. I also have pretty low standards of notability (though not as low as some). If you could show that the school has an innovative curriculum or a long and distinguished history or was part of an important local news event or just about anything that makes it stand out, then I will vote keep (the Dewey Decimal system does not help), but on nearly every school article up for deletion, not one person tries to find this information (including myself, but I do not care passionately about keeping every school article). If anyone actually went to that effort, I bet a lot of interesting facts would be found and a lot more schools would be kept with overwhelming support without all the divisive argument. Wikipedia is not paper, but those people who use that as an excuse to eliminate all quality control are not helping the project. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 19:49, Apr 12, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Where do you get that from? GH was the first place to host pictures and a hands-on preview of the system. Just because the site is getting lambasted as advertisement, it doesn't mean it cant even be referenced. Once the Phantom: Rewound features go back up (they got dropped in a server move), I will link to them in the external links section, since they detail the entire running history of the system. Unless, that is, I'm not supposed to provide valid information if I'm the person who compiled it. I also think that article containing the first pictures of the system is a notable piece of information for Phantom history. I'm fine with excluding that link as it is included in the Phantom: Rewound piece I mentioned before. For cripes sake, you dont have to discount every edit I've ever made because you don't like the ones pertainant to myself -- I built that Phantom page from the ground up; I'm more than a vane advertiser.

<li>Well, my reasoning was that no one is going to type in "Fag (cigarette)". No one ever types in those little disambig paretheticals. If anything, they'll search for <a href="../../../f/a/g/Fag.html" title="Fag">fag</a> and get a disambig page directing them where to go. Most likely, if they want cigarette, they'll just type that anyway, not the slang. --<a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a> 22:42, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>According to "what links here", 7 pages link here, not including those related to VfD. It wouldn't be too hard to go through each one and change the link to being ciggarette, but than again it also wouldn't be to hard to make this a redirect.-<a href="../../../l/t/n/User%7ELtNOWIS_fcfd.html" title="User:LtNOWIS">LtNOWIS</a> 23:54, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, there's only 6, as I wouldn't count the transwiki log. Four of these are disambiguative in nature: fag, faggot (slang), fag (disambig), fag (pejorative). That only two obscure pages link here as compared to the hundreds to <a href="../../../c/i/g/Cigarette.html" title="Cigarette">cigarette</a>, I think, supports the idea that a redirect is unnecessary. --<a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a> 00:36, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> IANAPsychologist, but Googling on "mortido Freud" provides a fair amount of support for it as a legitimate term in Freudian psychology. It's the drive towards death, in opposition to <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libido.html" title="Libido">libido</a>. I'm not sure how it relates to <a href="../../../d/e/s/Destrudo.html" title="Destrudo">destrudo</a>. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreplySpang_52d7.html" title="User:FreplySpang">FreplySpang</a> <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreplySpang_a627.html" title="User talk:FreplySpang">(talk)</a> 22:24, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Appears to be a Freudian term but the article as it stands is a waste of space. Would vote to keep if turned into a reasonable stub. No vote as yet. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 09:48, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Notable Freudian term. The fact that the stub is poorly written should not be a reason to vote delete. I did some basic wikifying and tagged it as stub. Please note IANAP either: if this survives VfD, it should get some attention from a specialist. For instance, my researches could not clarify whether this is a synonym of <a href="../../../d/e/s/Destrudo.html" title="Destrudo">destrudo</a> (in which case a merge &amp; redirect would seemed more appropriate): apparently, it is still controversial within the psychoanalytic theory how to name and describe the basic drive that is the opposite of <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libido.html" title="Libido">libido</a>. <a href="../../../v/m/v/User%7EVmv_bc84.html" title="User:Vmv"><font color="#0000C0">Vlad</font><font color="#989ACC">M</font><font color="#0000C0">V</font></a> <font color="#6F078D">٭</font> <sup><a href="../../../v/m/v/User_talk%7EVmv_5a55.html" title="User talk:Vmv"><font color="#0000C0">talk</font></a></sup> 14:31, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

I wouldn't discredit them for that reason, or just because the article was added by someone on their first-day wikispree.

<p>Why are other MMOG sites such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/There.html" title="There">There</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Life_f75c.html" title="Second Life">Second_Life</a> allowed to have a page whereas this one is claimed to be an advertisement? SLWK 11:56, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, it depends on a variety of factors, including whether the company itself or someone associated with it made the page, how many people play the game (e.g. how notable it is) and so on. For what it's worth, 159 google hits on "perfectcompetition". <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 15:43, Apr 8, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. It appears to be a very, very minor online game: Google shows 159 hits, most for something else, and no links. The forums only have about 100 posts, and are password-protected, so I can't check how long a time period that covers. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 23:43, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>It is fairly new. Launched a few weeks ago. The thing about the game is that it is unique. It is a new genre of MMOG. Whereas There, Second Life etc are all roughly carbon copies of each other. SLWK 06:42, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If it's only a few weeks old, then maybe in a year or so, it'll be big enough for an article. And as for MMOGs all being like each other, as a former player of Astronest, <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html" title="RuneScape">RuneScape</a>, <a href="../../../e/v/e/Everquest.html" title="Everquest">Everquest</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/There.html" title="There">There</a>, and a current player of <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Life_f75c.html" title="Second Life">Second Life</a> and StarStrike, I can assure you they are not "carbon copies" of each other. StarStrike, for example, is similar to AstroNest, but the turn-based combat of AstroNest and the turn/time hybrid of StarStrike are nothing like the real-time action of Everquest and RuneScape. Further, There is basically a glorified chatroom, and the only thing I've found approaching Second Life's ability to modify the game world is the Open Source Metaverse Project. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> 07:20, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Actually, i shan't reread the less memorable portions of those pages, until i need the info: While i have an active interest in policy, and value the Wiki-lawyers who keep it codified, becoming a Wiki-lawyer is not part of my calling. And i don't need that info bcz none of it could change the clear fact that either the nomination for deletion names a page that was a redirect when nominated (obviously (to anyone who knows of <a href="../../../r/f/d/RfD_39ed.html" title="RfD">RfD</a>) improperly), or the instruction (placed on the page via template in the process of nomination) not to move a nominated page has been contravened. A VfD that does not make sense on its face has unacceptably high cost in distraction of participants -- as would an RTFM msg like the one above, if it went unanswered.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>My disambiguation of the situation at a point immediately visible to the VfD participants is a mediocre solution, but superior to what i found. I welcome a yet better solution; one might be
<ol>
<li>moving ("my") <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Talk%7EWarsaw_Vote_948f.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Talk:Warsaw/Vote">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Talk:Warsaw/Vote</a> to Wikipedia talk:Votes for deletion/Talk:Warsaw/Vote,</li>
<li>deleting the resulting historyless redirect,</li>
<li>moving <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Warsaw_Vote_6521.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Warsaw/Vote">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Warsaw/Vote</a> to <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Talk%7EWarsaw_Vote_948f.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Talk:Warsaw/Vote">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Talk:Warsaw/Vote</a>,</li>
<li>adding to it a brief note with link to Wikipedia talk:Votes for deletion/Talk:Warsaw/Vote, and</li>

<dd>but IMO only a Wiki-lawyer is in a position to judge the acceptability of <i>that</i> means of making the VfD sensible on its face.</dd>

<li>Weak <b>delete</b> all three of these song lists as trivia, topic(s) not encyclopedic and inclusion of some songs not verifiable. Apparently any song that mentions masturbation or contains allusions that someone thinks refer to masturbation can get listed, without verification of the songwriter's intent.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Actually, I agree with Radiant and Mozzerati that we should keep articles on MS-funded tech writers <i>if the subject is particularly significant and the article content is verifiable</i>. A better way of expressing my point is that people in this position <i>need critical attention</i> when considering their notability, given that (1) tech bloggers are a dime a dozen -- self-weblishing does not equate to encyclopedic notability, and (2) some of those known to be on the payroll of Microsoft or its partners have proven (see, for example, www.groklaw.net) to disregard journalistic ethics in favor of <a href="../../../f/u/d/FUD_f18b.html" title="FUD">FUD</a> supporting corporate interests that don't correspond to the public interest. My guideline isn't really "delete them all", but "view them with suspicion and strong attention to notability and verifiability guidelines." For the comment between those two, has Scoble actually "made history", or just been one of the first to sell out in an old way in a new medium? I haven't read enough of his material to judge, and the article doesn't help me resolve this. <b>No vote</b>, just a cautionary comment. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 15:07, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)
