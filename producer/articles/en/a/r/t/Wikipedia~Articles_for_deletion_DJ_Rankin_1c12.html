<li><b>Keep</b> I have swapped the 'Scottish Musicians' label with 'Scottish People', seeing as the article outlines the fact that DJ Rankin is in fact <i>not</i> a musician. This reduces (or rather removes) the need for the article to conform to <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. 61.106.77.157 10:40, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> Are you the same Alkivar that contributed to the comments section on youtube regarding 'rankin - the truth'? Then you're an american who hasnt heard of a UK 'artist'. Well im in the UK and while Im sure your quite popular and talented I cant say ive heard of you either&#160;:P . If you check the links on this article you will see for yourself that Rankin is popular and well-known - maybe not amongst your social peer group - but popular nonetheless. Yes he does fail on WP:MUSIC so the removal of his status as a musician is a sensible one the whole section of 'controversy' covers the fact that he isn't a musician which precisely the reason why he is infamous. Besides, a lot of notable DJs do not conform to WP:Music as they play record not make them. He is more of an internet phenomenon really. Considering his considerable influence on so many kids of a given age both in ROI and the UK I think his article should stay. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 80.177.65.182 (<a href="../../../8/0/2E/User_talk%7E80.177.65.182.html" title="User talk:80.177.65.182">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_80.177.65.182_0479.html" title="Special:Contributions/80.177.65.182">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>Put your willy away and stop waving it about. I wasnt questioning your musical credentials, just the fact that they arent relevant here. I repeat that you seem to be basing your decision on the fact that YOU havent heard of him rather than actual research. Maybe you should ask the likes of Brisk, Hixxy and Scott Brown (especially Scott Brown) about the songs of his that Rankin ripped off...sure he's a nobody to the hardcore scene, in fact Rankin doesnt even play hardcore as such anymore, but he's still a big draw to the kids and getting more famous and indeed infamous by the day. All you got to do is look on google or any fileshare prog and see how many reference to Rankin there are. He might be a nobody to you and your contemporaries, but he's a somebody to hundreds, if not thousands of kids in the UK AND the US 80.177.65.182 12:21, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The fact is that in a sense he is a nobody. But because of his antics, all these kids think he isn't and have badgered promoters and event organisers to book him on the basis they thought he was ALREADY a big name DJ. One club/bar booked him on the basis he was the single most requested DJ. Look at the pics on his website playing to 1000's of kids...he don't look like nobody to them. Its a curious situation but one I feel should be documented considering loads of kids are emulating Rankin and think what he does is 'what DJs do' - I have heard so many kids say this in defence of Rankin it's depressing... Also if folks will give me a bit of time, I will add a few more sources over the coming days, as the likes of 'cant sleep clown will eat me' seem intend on wiping anything unsourced 80.177.65.182 12:49, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article appears to have been edited suitably. Also, the statement 'anonymous contributions do not count on AFD' is untrue. The rules state 'Unregistered or new users are welcome to contribute to the discussion, but their recommendations may be discounted, especially if they seem to be made in bad faith'. At least two of the above discounted contributions are valid and made good points. You say 'Rankin is a nobody to anyone who matters in the UK Hardcore scene', but that fact appears to be the whole point in the article! (especially before the recent edits). As a final note, I personally <b>have</b> heard of DJ Rankin, and am well aware of the scale of his fanbase - it is huge. And he tends to play euro trance, not happy hardcore. To summarise, users have made changes to the article that correct the issues raised initially, and thus the article should stay. <a href="../../../e/l/t/User%7EEltyrub_3cee.html" title="User:Eltyrub">Eltyrub</a> 10:20, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>The artists own profile on a site doesnt conform to policy? How the hell does that work? The article reads like an attack page because if YOU ACTUALLY READ IT PROPERLY (which I suspect none of you people are actually doing AND its properly on a subject you know nothing of) it's very difficult to put a positive spin on his activities - how do you say positive things about a thief?. He is notable due to his thousands of fans (more fans than a lot of other artists) and the article (while covering some negative activities) is all verifable fact. You think this guy is a figment of somenoe's imagination or something? What kind of sources would *you* like then? Ill find them for you. 82.42.98.242 10:44, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. In response to 82.42.98.242, Google is a search engine which can be utilized to find reliable sources, but is not a reliable source itself. MP3.com returned 1 hit for an unrelated "Ricky Rankin", but nothing for "DJ Rankin" or "Gordon Rankin". What I see here is an article about someone who has a small following of fans and foes as a result of his plagiarizing notable trance musicians. In search of reliable sources, DJ Rankin scored zero hits in the LexisNexis database, nor was I able to find any kind of mainstream or alternative media coverage of this person using Google or Yahoo. What we're left with at the end of the day is a few low quality Youtube videos and a vanity page from a blogging site.

<li><b>Keep</b> If you don't think it is a proper 'biography', remove the tags like 'Scottish People' from the bottom! There is absolutely no reason to remove the article; it is an accurate description of the activities of Gordon Rankin, (not of his life story) and simply looking at the sites brought up by Google will tell you of the extent of his fanbase. <a href="../../../e/l/t/User%7EEltyrub_3cee.html" title="User:Eltyrub">Eltyrub</a> 08:18, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Also, watch the youtube video that is linked to - it may be a video, but it cites many examples of songs DJ Rankin has reused and passed off as his own, and gives the viewer the full names of both the DJ Rankin title and the original artist and title.

<p>Hello? Is anyone going to give a sensible reason for deleting this article? Why is it only the people saying to keep it can come up with reasons. Look at all the references to him on other people's site (myspace etc), look at the gallery on his website, look at the fact that he has a independent fansite (not many artists can boast that), look at the fact that he played to 1000s of people and then sit there and say the guy isnt notable. So he's not had mainstream coverage in the media, thats because hes gained popularity outisde of the mainstream media. Theres plenty of source material linked on the page itself and to dismiss the sheer quantity of results on google and more important their actual content as irrelevant is frankly laughable. 80.177.65.182 12:12, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I think the intention in the article is to correct the myth amongst teens that DJ Rankin <i>is</i> a notable musician - so if he doesn't meet notability criterior set in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> it makes sense. This doesn't mean the article should be deleted, just that it should be considered less of an entry about a musician and more an article about popular culture and youth culture on the internet. <a href="../../../e/l/t/User%7EEltyrub_3cee.html" title="User:Eltyrub">Eltyrub</a> 17:49, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I strongly recommend some of you androids look at www.mixstreet.net. THIS is the effect DJ Rankin has had. 100s and 100s, if not 1000s of kids doing the same thing as what made rankin famous - messing with other peoples music (mainly pop-trance and happy hardcore) and calling it their own 'mixes'. 82.42.98.242 20:10, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
