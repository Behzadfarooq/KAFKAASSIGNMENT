<p>This page is redundant and lists things that already have their own articles. It creates more hassle and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Avatar" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Avatar" rel="nofollow">the template</a> is already a navigational tool. This was discussed a little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender#Splitting_Character_Section" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender#Splitting_Character_Section" rel="nofollow">here</a> too. <a href="../../../d/y/l/User%7EDylan0513_8f4d.html" title="User:Dylan0513">Dylan0513</a> 01:08, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Redundancy is not a good reason for deletion, nor is more hassle. A template only serves to navigate by name, but does not provide the potential informative content of this list. For example, there are many television shows and other fictional works with lists of characters, such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_characters_7f92.html" title="List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer characters">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_of_Lost_234d.html" title="Characters of Lost">Lost</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_on_The_West_Wing_177c.html" title="List of characters on The West Wing">The West Wing</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Wire_9268.html" title="List of characters from The Wire">The Wire</a>. Now this page is fairly new, so it's not as good as any of those pages, it needs some real clean-up to bring it up to snuff. But deleted? I can't understand why, though I am concerned that this is a bad faith nomination, and should be looked at very carefully. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 01:49, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> This is definitely not a bad faith nomination. The article serves no purpose at all and just restates what other articles say.

<li><b>Comment</b> This is not meant to be a direct criticism of Bigtop, but it seems to me that people are <i>awfully</i> quick to make accusations of bad faith when people nominate articles of this type for deletion - lists of fictional star trek weapons, articles about each and every character ever mentioned in a particular comic book, etc. Is it really difficult to understand that some editors honestly don't believe this stuff to be encyclopedic?--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 03:21, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, I think you misunderstood the problem, which is that there is a dispute over the existence of this page, versus the existence of other pages, and how to handle the subject.

<dd>I've not looked at those other articles, but if the content would be better handled on the main series article (or maybe not at all in the case of a list of minor secondary characters!), I would&#160;!vote Delete at an AfD for those as well.

<dd>Yes, I think it should be one article. I don't see what these lists offer extra. You disagree, fair enough. I don't have any grudge to grind here, I feel the same about most of the "List of character" type articles for TV shows/films/video games etc. As an aside, how do you know "Avatar is one of the most viewed pages on all of wikipedia", and which Avatar page? - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Rundle_db17.html" title="User:Richard Rundle">fchd</a> 20:52, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Semi-Delete</b> - This information is presented not only on the Avatar: The Last Airbender main page but it's also presented at the bottom of every Avatar page that carries Template:Avatar. All information not listed on the main page each has it's own main page, also listed on Template:Avatar. All these names are linked to multiple times within the episode articles as well. It's just a list with links to no more than 10 different pages. The bottom half links ALL links to Minor Secondary Characters but then goes to that same character. That page itself has a key that is identicle to the bottom half of this page. The only reason I put semi-delete is because if a person wants to look up, say, Aunt Wu, this page tells them that she is in the Minor article. But then again, had they clicked the Major characters page first, not found her, the next logical thing is to go to minor. In this situation though, it still required exactly two pages before she is found. It either needs to be deleted or worked into a way where there is actually a use for it's existance. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeirToPendragon_b665.html" title="User:HeirToPendragon">H2P</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../h/e/i/User_talk%7EHeirToPendragon_c05a.html" title="User talk:HeirToPendragon">Yell at me</a> for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HeirToPendragon_68aa.html" title="Special:Contributions/HeirToPendragon">what I've done</a>)</sup> 10:02, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Your opinion of the page holds no more weight than anyone else's. That people agree with you is also moot, since people also disagree with you. Finally, you know that argument is flawed. you should know better than to even suggest such a thing. – <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy0830_d67f.html" title="User:Someguy0830">Someguy0830</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESomeguy0830_3c31.html" title="User talk:Someguy0830">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Someguy0830_4a47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Someguy0830">C</a>) 23:21, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>If you made a article saying you rock, well, yes, it would be of minimal relevant content. Assuming you added more than that though, you'd run into the <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">personal vanity</a> problem. If you can get enough other people who think you rock though, you might well qualify for a page, but I'd still advise not creating it yourself. Even editing it should be taken very carefully. However, that is an entirely different problem, completely unrelated to the subject of this page. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 00:21, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Omg, you seriously just tried to disprove a stupid example I gave just so you'd actually think in terms other than that of Wikipedia's. Obviously didn't work. And of course people are disagreeing with me! I'm saying people are also agreeing with me. And I nominated this article for deletion because it serves no purpose and one of the ways it serves no purpose is though redundancy. I don't see what more of an explanation you guys want. And Manticore, please don't responde quoting any Wiki rules because I will just ignore you.

<dd>I assumed good faith, and responded to you in a civil and polite manner to explain why what you suggested would be a problem.

<dd>They aren't referred to every time, but they are helpful to refer to, as they are useful ways to express arguments without going into excessive details, and to help show people what other people feel. I'm not sure why you're offended by referring to them, especially not in an AfD discussion which relies heavily on policy, but you should note that not every comment I've made has referred to any policy. You should perhaps avoid such gross exaggerations. They are not indicative of proper reasoning, but are instead merely hyperbole. The same with your claims that you'll go off in a huff if people cite policies to you. It's one thing to be concerned about insults and uncivil behavior, but when people choose to cite policy when you've engaged in behavior that violates it is something that should lead you to reflect upon your conduct. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 19:00, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> General pages are perfectly acceptable and are what most people will look to if trying to locate a specific character. I know for a fact people often don't notice the template, as I have had to point them out at least twice to users asking on talk pages. – <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy0830_d67f.html" title="User:Someguy0830">Someguy0830</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESomeguy0830_3c31.html" title="User talk:Someguy0830">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Someguy0830_4a47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Someguy0830">C</a>) 21:10, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep it</b> - I vote this page stay as it is just as beneficial here as it is on the main avatar page, it contributes by having a separate article for characters on its own. Featuring a brief introduction, is another good feature it has as well. Keep the character profiles the way they are, relationships is interesting and adds more interesting content which is the opposite of redundant. Minor characters and secondary characters should remain as they are a good edition. For avatar fans, they are just as necessary as main characters and were displayed as they should have been. The character page deserved to have its own separate section and it was well made and nicely done. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Lastairbender (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lastairbender_62dc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lastairbender">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - After looking over the main page and the article in question, I agree that having them both is redundant. However, I can't decide which course of action, out of deleting the article, or keeping the article and deleting the section in the main page, would be better. If the Avatar article is getting too big, I say we keep the page and delete the section. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESAMAS_7b35.html" title="User:SAMAS">SAMAS</a> 13:27, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, it wasn't a discussion about deleting that section, so much as modifying it, and shortening the main article's section was actually the agreed-upon consensus. And of course, there is a clear intent to modify this page, as soon as some of this controversy has settled down, and a good consensus can be reached. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 15:25, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The topic in that discussion wasn't shortening it, it was deleting it and at the very least there wasn't a consensus to delete it so that <b>isn't going to happen.</b> The Avatar project members came to a consensus on not deleting the descriptions and I think that's what matters there. This is a separate matter. -<a href="../../../d/y/l/User%7EDylan0513_8f4d.html" title="User:Dylan0513">Dylan0513</a> 19:00, 13 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, it wasn't, as nobody ever proposed deleting the section. So you can say there was no consensus to delete if you want, but that's still missing the point, as nobody was actually advocating it. I still don't don't know why you believe it was the case, but really, if that's what you were worried about, that wasn't the idea at all. And that discussion did end up with a consensus that shortening that section would be appropriate. Ignoring that is not exactly good reasoning on your part. It's certainly inaccurate. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 21:36, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Conditional Keep</b> I thought we alrady went over that in the main article, the section will be shortened while this list is a longer, more elaborate version of it.

<li>Add all of them to Category:Avatar: The Last Airbender characters. It looks like they may already be in the category though, which means I'm conflicted.
