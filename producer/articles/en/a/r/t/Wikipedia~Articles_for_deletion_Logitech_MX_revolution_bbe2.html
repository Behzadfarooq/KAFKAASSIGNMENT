<li><b>Keep and cleanup</b> - this is a relatively significant product release by a major electronics company; how is it not notable? Yes, it needs to sound less like an ad.

<li><b>Comment</b> I think you already know the answer to your own question, but I'll indulge you anyway. The Pentium III is notable because it's a far more complicated product with far more innovations. The development history is documented in books, its architecture is studied in textbooks, and there are a variety of interesting aspects of its history, performance, implementation, and application. (That's not true of all processors, by the way.) And it's true of very, very few mouses. On the contrary, should we have an article about every single product ever reviewed at a couple of websites or in a printed magazine or two? I hope not; that is, I hope the people using reviews and "references == notability" arguments understand that opens the door to hundreds of thousands of articles on all sorts of run-of-the-mill products, from stereo gear to knitting needles. That's pretty obviously not what Wikipedia needs, and I guess I mistakenly believed that everyone could see that. -- <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">Mikeblas</a> 00:39, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Arrrrrrgh! Have you ever even touched this mouse? It sounds like you don't know anything about it, except that it is a mouse. As far as I can tell, there aren't even over ten mice that would even be notable enough for anyone to think of puting them in Wikipedia, so this doesn't "open the door" to all kinds of junk. Its just making an article of a product that I own that I like. <a href="../../../k/j/t/User%7EKjtheDj_897a.html" title="User:KjtheDj">KjtheDj</a> 21:17, 29 March 2007 (UTC) <a href="../../../k/j/t/User%7EKjtheDj_897a.html" title="User:KjtheDj">KjtheDj</a> 20:22, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply to above</b> If it is true of very few mouses, this is one of them. The only other mouse I can find in recent history to receive this depth of coverage is Apple's first multi-button USB mouse, the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Mighty_Mouse_c253.html" title="Apple Mighty Mouse">Apple Mighty Mouse</a>, notable as representing a shift in thinking for the historically single-button Mac community. <a href="../../../i/r/e/User%7EIrene_Ringworm_a72d.html" title="User:Irene Ringworm">Irene Ringworm</a> 02:59, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Another reply</b> Maybe if this was some low rate 15 dollar mouse you would have an argument. However, this mouse has plenty of good sources, as already stated, has many cool features, and other stuff. I mean, there are plenty of other articles on mice, such as the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logitech_G5_8a74.html" title="Logitech G5">Logitech G5</a> and the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Mighty_Mouse_c253.html" title="Apple Mighty Mouse">Apple Mighty Mouse</a>.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Its price doesn't make it notable. The "delete those too" argument is completely inappropriate; it should be obvious that I can read, evaluate, and edit only one article at a time. A such, there will always be some other article that should also be deleted. We're not talking about the Mighty Mouse or the G5 here; we're discussing the MX. -- <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">Mikeblas</a> 02:37, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><small><b>Comment</b>Personally, when I came to Wikipedia, I thought, "Cool, this has the potential to be an encyclopedia about every thing. People could be able to find everything from pencils to continents." But I guess I was wrong after I had found WP:N. Plus, like I have already said, if this was an article about a 15 dollar mouse, things would be different, but it is not about some 15 dollar mouse. Plus, I started this article because it stood out, to me, as a mouse that wasn't just "some other mouse." I guess that kind of sounds like I'm trying to get you to buy it, but that, honestly, is the truth. <a href="../../../k/j/t/User%7EKjtheDj_897a.html" title="User:KjtheDj">KjtheDj</a> 20:09, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</small></li>
<li><small>So a few of the sources are viable... but that's still not enough for you. That's my point... you have decided the kinds of articles that get written about computer mice are never going to be enough here. WP:N was actually written so Wikipedia could include a vast number of articles on topics like this... so long as they could be appropriately referenced. The point of WP:N was never to dramatically restrict what we could write articles on to topics with dozens of journal-quality articles as sources. So if that means we can have hundreds of articles on computer mice, that's what it means... maybe you want something more restrictive than WP:N. Such things have been proposed, but never went anywhere really. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 03:14, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</small>
<ul>
<li><small>I'm really amused at how you're happy to tell me what it is or isn't that I'm doing. Your oh-fer at it, so far--but keep trying! I think I'm not asking for something more restrictive than WP:N; I think I'm just interpreting it at face value. I haven't decided anything about the kinds of articles that get written. WP:N tells us that, and it says that the references need to be substantial and meaningful. There are plenty of mice products which are notable: the first mouse itself, the first optical mouse, the first wheel mouse, and so on. I think there's a history of doing deep stories on products that are truly revolutionary or notable--<i>stories</i>, not reviews. Look at all the stories on the Macintosh, or the Corvettes, or the Pentium, and so on. This mouse is not in that class of product; I'll be happy to consider it so if there are books like <i>Corvette: Fifty Years</i> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0760311803</a>), <i>The Pentium Chronicles: The People, Passion, and Politics Behind Intel's Landmark Chips</i> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0471736171</a>), or <i>Insanely Great: The Life and Times of Macintosh, the Computer That Changed Everything</i> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0140291776</a>) about it; but right now there aren't. -- <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">Mikeblas</a> 02:34, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><small><b>Keep, cleanup, and merge with <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logitech_VX_revolution_4f54.html" title="Logitech VX revolution">Logitech VX revolution</a></b>, an identical product for laptops. External coverage is pretty much limited to product reviews but the depth of coverage (Anandtech writes over ten thousand words), suggests that this is more than "just another mouse". That being said, the current article reads like marketing material. Agree with Mithent that the new article should focus on the unique features. <a href="../../../i/r/e/User%7EIrene_Ringworm_a72d.html" title="User:Irene Ringworm">Irene Ringworm</a> 19:04, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</small>

<li><small><b>Comment</b>. Indeed; since the references for this subject are mostly reviews, how can they be used as references in writing anything other than a review? -- <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">Mikeblas</a> 00:51, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</small>
<ul>
<li><small><b>Reply</b>. Most new product introductions do not receive the <i>depth of coverage</i> that this one has received. Anandtech, Cnet, and their print cousins typically give little more than a passing mention to new peripherals in a buyer's guide. Anandtech gives this particular peripheral a nearly ten thousand word article describing major competitors, the history of logitech mice, and closing with "We found the overall design, ergonomics, and quality of materials to be the best of any mouse we have used to date. While the Revolution has several new features from both a hardware and software viewpoint, we found the new scroll wheel to be the most important technology introduced on this mouse." Certainly not every mouse on the market needs a wikipedia article but the MX and its VX sibling represent a significant offering from a major company that has achieved a level of attention and depth of coverage far beyond the norm. <a href="../../../i/r/e/User%7EIrene_Ringworm_a72d.html" title="User:Irene Ringworm">Irene Ringworm</a> 02:43, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</small>
<ul>
<li><small><b>Question</b>. How would you go about substantiating your "depth of coverage" claim? If you can find a way to do so, maybe it would be a good addition to WP:N. Until then, these reviews are just that -- reviews. I've explained here (or in the VX AfD, maybe) about how essentially <i>all</i> products get reviewed--even crappy ones. We can't possibly consider reviews a sign of notability, as review subjects are chosen indiscriminately. Truly notable products have hundreds of thousands or millions of words written about them: textbooks about computer architecture cover the Pentium's internal design, while the manuals for the product alone are more than 5000 pages, plus the books about the team and the way they worked. -- <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">Mikeblas</a> 02:53, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</small>
<ul>
<li><small><b>Reply</b> By direct comparison with other comparable products. Most new mouse releases and other peripherals (game pads) don't garner ten thousand words from Anandtech - they usually don't even get their own article. A simple product refresh to the G7 series, for example, might get a passing mention in a weekly buyer's guide or - maybe - a three or four hundred word article. The same goes for coverage in other print magazines - not extensive in the way that a processor or new car release might be covered, but extensive compared to other comparable products.</small></li>

<dd><small><b>Reply</b>. I think I've made my position pretty clear, so I'm surprised to see you misinterpret and/or overstate it. I don't think <i>this</i> mouse is notable enough for an article. The article doesn't make the case for it, either. The mouse hasn't won any interesting awards; its development story wasn't notable; its feature set isn't notable. There are notable mouses--they do win awards, they do get coverage beyond just product reviews, and so on. Few mouses are notable -- and that only makes sense. If all or many was notable, how would they be notable? -- <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">Mikeblas</a> 18:51, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</small></dd>
