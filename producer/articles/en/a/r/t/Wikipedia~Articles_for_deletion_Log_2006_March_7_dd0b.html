<li><b>Keep</b> with the reservation that it needs to be expanded to be of any importance. His parts in those movies weren't huge, and alone are probably not enough to merit inclusion.

<p>Qksearch is a search engine. So I searched for it using another well-known search engine and found about 900 hits. But that is a bit of an over-estimate, since some of these are individual "qksearch.htm" pages etc. Nothign on Google News, no evidence of innovation, widespread use, user base, Alexa ranking &gt;200,000 (higher than expected, but compare with the majority of well-known search engines, which are in the top five thousand (or in some cases the top ten). Not everybody can be Google, of course. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 22:33, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As a regular user of this metasearch engine, I am a little disappointed. In my opinion, when people make a suggestion they should be well informed about the topic they are commenting about. In this case obviously the difference between a so called major search engine and a metasearch engine and how to compare them. And to pass a judgement just by searching Google should not be a benchmark for assessing the quality. Definitely not being too much influenced by medis buzz only. May be the best judgement would be to do some research searching and compare the quality of results; and obviously to do so one needs to understand how search engines work and how to evaluate the quality of results.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. At first glance these past two comments appear to be downgrading my opinion as that of a newbie. I've edited/improved other pages on Wikipedia over the past 2 years albeit anonymously (I could provide some of the IP addresses I used to edit from for proof). I created a user account yesterday because I read voting under a user account carries more weight. I am in agreement with the reasons listed on <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Notability</a> regarding "Valid content is deleted" and that "Obscure content isn't harmful". It appears that others (strongly) disagree with me on this and the HexIt article. I think Wikipedia is better off being more inclusive on content than exclusive. --Kaze0010 07:06, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b><s>Delete, don't merge</s> Move improved article to <u>Lobster Newberg</u></b>. While it would be possible to write an encyclopedic article about <i>Lobster Newberg</i> (as it is more commonly spelled), this ain't it.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I still don't know why we need this article since everything in it is already in the <a href="../../../l/o/b/Lobster.html" title="Lobster">lobster</a> article. Also, this isn't even a subcategory of <a href="../../../l/o/b/Lobster.html" title="Lobster">lobster</a>, it's more like a sub-subcategory, as it's in the subcategory of "lobster as food". Therefore, wouldn't "Lobster (food)" be a more suitable article than this? Some clarity/explanation would be nice. -<a href="../../../e/d/g/User%7EEdGl_582c.html" title="User:EdGl">EdGl</a> 20:39, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Ansatsuken is simply a Japanese word for "Assassin Fist"; it is not a style. This whole article is based off someone's mistranslation.</p>
<p>Perhaps renaming this "Martial Arts of Street Fighter" or something could salvage this page. <a href="../../../e/v/a/User%7EEvan1975_6e49.html" title="User:Evan1975">Evan1975</a> 03:22, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I apologize if responses like these are breaking the format, but I'd like to point out that Shotokan Karate is not Ryu/Ken's style. It's a mistranslation. - Nickoten
<ul>
<li>Actually, in SF1, they originally listed Ryu as practicing a real world martial art called "Kyokushinkai". It's a mix of Goju-Ryu, Shotokan, and Judo(History of Kyokushinkai in the uk). In SF2, they changed it to the generic Ansatsuken. (Tiamat's Street Fighter Plot Guide)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>DELETE</b>, Ryu and Ken practiced SHOTOKAN...</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> , but you'll probably want to cite the Secret Files, All About Capcom books, etc as sources. Since this is the name given to their style I think it's legitimate. If someone wants to start an article for what ansatsuken really is, there could be a disamiguation page with this one being referenced as a fictional form of martial arts from Street Fighter. As also stated in Tiamat's plot guide, Hadou, Tatsumaki, and Shoryu are the key elements of the style, which would suggest that it was meant to be an original style rather than a generic name for what the characters practice. Their in-game normal/command attacks seem to incorporate different styles, but the specials always bank around the same set of techniques. So yes, I feel it is unique enough to keep this name. Again, though, we need the books cited. Also, perhaps we could name the page "Street Fighter Ansatsuken"? Or even maybe "Ansatsuken (Street Fighter schools)"? It should still turn up easily in a search for "Ansatsuken," right? I don't know what we'd do about links from other articles though. EDIT: I looked at the page for <a href="../../../r/y/u/Ryu.html" title="Ryu">Ryu</a>, and I noticed that both the Street Fighter videogames and Tiamat's plot guide (As well as the books he cites, indirectly) are listed as sources. I can only assume the creator of this article may do the same.- Nickoten 15:51, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I wrote the article. I am aware of the problem. The information comes strictly from Tiamat's Street Fighter Plot guide. However, very few Japanese fluent speakers bother to add information or verify. Unfortunately, I need a reference name for this martial art, which Capcom doesn't provide, so I just called it the generic "Ansatsuken". I know it is the equivalent of calling this "hand to hand combat" and saying it's a martial arts. The only option I had was Ansatsuken, which I admit wasn't a proper martial arts name, but I noted that at the beginning of the article. I did this mainly to archive the info from Tiamat's plot guide, which is the most info I've ever received about this game. -BB Mofo 10:16, 9 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I can rewrite with the sources if necessary. If it requires a merge, fine, but merge with what? Tiamat suggested Ryu, but there are several other martial artists who study from Goutetsu's school. And I tried that before with cites, and someone took it out without reason (hence this article being created). They did the same with my Goutetsu and Gouken articles. Perhaps put this information into Goutetsu's article? Maybe change the article name to "Hado No Chikara", since Goutetsu definitely invented, or atleast found that? Really, "Ansatsuken" is what Capcom Japan call it in the instruction manuals and on their website. For lack of a better name, since Capcom of Japan doesn't want to give it a name, it's the only one I can think of. Also, I agree on taking out the technique lists (except for the original 6 techniques, and 3 elements) -BB Mofo 16:12, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - This is valid material. Ryu and Ken clearly praticed the style outlined in this article and the game's clearly support this. When I learned of the reasoning for the porposed deletion of this article, I was horrfied. An discussion on the talkpage should have been made proceeding this action, and the user in favor of deletion should have done his homework. This is not an canidate for deletion.</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of this, the user is extremely new to the way Wikipedia works. looking at this edit count, he has only ammased 272 edits, of which an mere 9 have been directed at talk. User has also not demonstrated an knowledgeable background in the series or wikipedia policy, as he has not contributed to any character pages or any discussion pertaining to them. Poor reasoning for deletion does not dictate what gets kept and what gets deleted. Wikipedia does. To attempt to pass off this article as an threat to the encyclopedia is a travesty. As for sources, please read <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/coinop/arcade/game/583625.html" class="external text" title="http://www.gamefaqs.com/coinop/arcade/game/583625.html" rel="nofollow">Tiamat's Street Fighter Plot Guide</a> for information.</p>
<p>Additionally, I'm pleased to confirm that Evan is incorrect. Mistranslations absolutely does not determine what is kept and what is not kept on Wikipedia. It's merely an fictional fighting style created by an company for an video game. Where there is disagreement (and there is clearly disagreement here) then it isn't much of a guide. Which is why we need discussion on talkpages before making hasty actions usch as this.

<li><b>MOVE</b> <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. The <i>first line</i> claims that "Ansatsuken" is a "fictional martial art... in the Street Fighter series". Which it isn't. Why don't I make an article that says "Boxing" is a fictional martial art practiced by Mike Bison, then? Furthermore, you have Gen listed in here when he practices a different style. (Two, actually.) Some fan on the net (Tiamat) is not a credible source. Please, show me where it says anything about "Ansatsuken" in the Japanese-language entry <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%9A%86_%28%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%82%A4%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC%29" class="external autonumber" title="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%9A%86_%28%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%82%A4%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC%29" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. It doesn't. If mistranslations are OK, as you say, then the people claiming their style is <b>"Shotokan"</b> are more valid than Ansatsuken; "Shotokan" has been used in many more English publications. (Yes, it's wrong, too.) No, it is you who are incorrect, Megaman Zero. No specific style name has <i>ever</i> been given to Ryu, Ken, Gouki, etc. For the best <i>official</i> English-language source, try reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0972503706/hokutorenkito-20" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0972503706/hokutorenkito-20" rel="nofollow">Street Fighter: Eternal Challenge</a>. Nope, no "Ansatsuken" there either. If you rename it to something like "Gōtetsu-Ryū Ansatsuken" and take out the stuff about Gen I'll heartily endorse it. <a href="../../../e/v/a/User%7EEvan1975_6e49.html" title="User:Evan1975">Evan1975</a> 20:14, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks for the book suggestion Evan. I've gone ahead and ordered the book for myself. I'll hold off on rewriting the article until I can thumb through it. If it's really that indepth, we can use it to check the accuracy of the other SF articles. Now that we've agreed to correct the mistakes you were concerned about, can we please remove the DELETE tag for now?

I agree with what Aquillion stated, I don't think "owner/dev wanting it removed" is a valid criteria under the Deletion policy. If it was, then the Scientology page wouldn't be up right now, lol. Also, the program has somewhat of a cult following in the online SNES emulation scene, so that should qualify it for "notability".

<li>A7 was not made to eliminate all the articles on people who don't meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. It was mostly intended for people writing articles about themselves, particularily schoolchildren. (The "John is a smart guy who attends the high school in downtown. He enjoys playing soccer and is also good at volleyball. His best subjects are history and geography" type of thing). The deletion of such articles was so non-controversial that a speedy criterion could be implemented. But when a person gets an IMDB entry, it is conceivable that some people might want to look up the person, and conceivable that some people might vote to keep it, and therefore the full AFD process is preferable. That said, I have no opinion if <i>this</i> article should be kept. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 07:48, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Most of her 10 'film' credits relate to pornography 'clipshows'. Basically she's been filmed having sex a on ten occasions over a seven year period. <i>That's It</i>. I will concede that it is a 'claim to fame', and tagging as A7 may have been the incorrect proceedure to follow. However, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> suggests that Wikipedia articles for actors should occur for "Notable actors and television personalities", where "notable" is defined as major association with well known films or television productions, gauged through national-level publications, large fan-bases, independant biographies, or commerical endoresements.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Reread the nom, that's not what was said - the TV show was "barely-notable", the character article could "barely be more than a stub," and the nominator thought a merge was appropriate. I'm guessing AfD was undertaken because doing a merge without one might have been controversial among the show's fans, but I don't know. Not every TV show on a major network is notable, and those that are will differ in how notable they are. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Шизомби</a> 01:23, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. The nom still insinuated that since the TV show was barely notable, a character on it wasn't. I disagree that the article can only be barely more than a stub, look at <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandy_Cheeks_3a2c.html" title="Sandy Cheeks">Sandy Cheeks</a> for example, as Royboycrashfan pointed out.

<p><b>Delete</b> Traditional metal isn't a genre especially since the bands play drastically different music and certainly do not make up a scene. It is only useful as a way to distinguish the early Metal bands from later ones, but we already have Heavy Metal for that.

<li><b>Comment</b>. There is no logic or order to this article. Look at the others: Supercentenarian: a person verified to be 110 or older. Longevity claims: unverified claims to 110+ that aren't preposterous. Longevity myths: preposterous claims to extreme longevity stretched beyond normal reasons. Oldest People: Lists of the world's oldest person, oldest woman, oldest man, and oldest by nationality. First supercentenarians, instead, arbitrarily lists what it wants to under no order or format. For example, the article appears to be started as "first person to reach 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, etc." But then what do "oldest person by race" and "oldest by French nationality" have to do with the "first" to reach 110? Again, we don't see a systematic listing of oldest by every nationality with a large dataset. Instead, we find that the article starter is French, so he made a French list. That's arbitrary and un-encyclopaedic reasoning. 69.180.8.87 07:33, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>what does 'nobality' mean? As for proving the fonts are used where they are, the way you do that is by looking at the fonts used in a film and then comparing them with samples of the fonts from the publisher. Films don't generally list font credits. The only thing the publisher could do - and it might violate customer privacy - is provide proof that the company producing a film or someone working for them had bought the font. The point of all this being that where a given font is used is something which anyone can verify for themselves, but which cannot be provided in a Wikipedia article unless there were another article somewhere on which films use which fonts or something like that which could be linked to, and there just aren't articles like that. The point is that these claims are absolutely verifiable if you just compare samples of fonts in the film with samples of the fonts in question. To demonstrate this I direct you to these two image links: <a href="http://www.fontcraft.com/scriptorium/previews/beynkales.jpg" class="external free" title="http://www.fontcraft.com/scriptorium/previews/beynkales.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.fontcraft.com/scriptorium/previews/beynkales.jpg</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/images/B000AMPZGC/ref=dp_image_0/102-9504945-7754566?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;n=5174&amp;s=music" class="external free" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/images/B000AMPZGC/ref=dp_image_0/102-9504945-7754566?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;n=5174&amp;s=music" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/images/B000AMPZGC/ref=dp_image_0/102-9504945-7754566?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;n=5174&amp;s=music</a> - the first is a sample of the Beynkales font and the second is a sample from Amazon of the film title using it. Here's a link to an article referencing the use of another font in another film with samples which demonstrate the relationship - <a href="http://www.fontcraft.com/csa/fontcraftcomments.php?id=150_0_4_0_C" class="external free" title="http://www.fontcraft.com/csa/fontcraftcomments.php?id=150_0_4_0_C" rel="nofollow">http://www.fontcraft.com/csa/fontcraftcomments.php?id=150_0_4_0_C</a> - your google searching also isn't terribly good. Try a search for 'scriptorium' and 'tim burton' to find many references to the use of Scriptorium fonts in Burton's films and others as well. I can link to many other movie titles which use Scriptorium fonts. Should links to the images referencing the fonts be included in a Wikipedia article? That's really the only form of proof there can be.</dd>

<p>The main article Laxius Power seems to have been up for a vote for deletion, which ended in it being supposedly deleted. Has somebody revived it? Regardless, this article (obviously even less than the original "Laxius Power") deals with a highly unnotable hobby project with few google hits, in fact, the first google page is the wikipedia article.

Even then, I do not think a lot of the Pokèmon articles should exist either (and there certainly aren't 500,000 of them as they would be roughly half of Wikipedia). I'm not even sure a million people have heard of this game, much less care about it. What evidence do you have that it is widely known? kotepho 00:39, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>. There does seem to be a case here of soapboxing fairly stridently and I think the <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walled_garden.html" title="Walled garden">walled garden</a> suggestions are close to the mark, having also read <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Boyd_Haley_93d2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Boyd Haley">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Boyd Haley</a> and its associated article. It is possible that a former chief scientific officer to the Dept. of Health would survive an AfD (though not certain, perhaps, since it's non-ministerial, non-elected, and non-political) but this article as is is absolutely without a doubt being used for advocacy, no matter the attempts made at advocacy-by-quote. It is full of irrelevant attacks on other scientists (it almost gets to speedy territory: <i>"The UK medical establishment including the Department of Health regard Wakefield’s claims as junk science lacking substance"</i>, without any citation). Those editing this debate who do not seem to have some serious vested interests (including both Ombudsman and the nominator) seem to lean clearly towards deletion (including, notably, Capitalistroadster). I don't give the "two more will pop up" argument any weight in determining what to do with this article, and it's readily apparent that Leifern has turned up mainly to be unpleasant (he doesn't make even a tangential reference to the article). So it's a delete-without-prejudice to a proper, non-soapboxed, genuine article that makes the case for the notability of its subject without leaping into the very shady territory this article inhabits. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 23:31, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, well, perhaps you two might to be willing to begin discussing the actual science after all. Doubts about that aside, the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Analogy.html" title="Analogy">analogy</a> above was offered as an attempt to get you two to see that paving over the Wiki with the preservative-laden spam of medical establishment <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dogma.html" title="Dogma">dogma</a> necessitates all the more, in a <a href="../../../c/o/-/Co-evolution.html" title="Co-evolution">co-evolutionary</a> sense, the need to protect the wilderness of medical dissent, lest the Wiki might end up needing to <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outsource.html" title="Outsource">outsource</a> remedies for the lack of content oriented to mere carbon based life forms. Beyond the Wiki, the predominance of such spam can be traced, in part, to the economic inequities and intellectual iniquities caused by the conspiculous <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conflict_of_interest.html" title="Conflict of interest">conflict of interest</a> consequences deriving from the fact that big pharma now has a cash flow of over a trillion dollars a year, and profit margins that even illicit drug cartels would envy. Asimov, like the 'humble' Imperial garden caretaker and Fletcher, never seemed to be hamstrung by such conflicts. Asimov wrote hundreds of academic texts, many dealing with biochemistry, and his depiction of Trantor evidences his intuitive understanding of <a href="../../../s/y/s/Systems_biology.html" title="Systems biology">systems biology</a>. At the macro systems level, Asimov recognized Trantor's unlikely capacity for supporting an inordinately large population, and that the concrete and steel straightjacketed seat of a galactic empire would necessitate the outsourcing of agricultural support from twenty worlds. At the micro level, there is a verisimilitude with the compound cumulative effects of vaccines, which a number of scientists have shown to be inextricably associated with <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoteny.html" title="Neoteny">neotenized</a> neurological development -- short on carbon based compounds and long on alkaline metallic compounds, resulting in the overbuild of relatively simple neurological infrastructures at the expense of the complex enzyme mediated superstructure necessary for a more normal sequencing of neurodevelopmental events. Asimov would understand that, just as he would understand that what you two have been doing, by substituting the gracile spam of orthodox dogma in the place of robust content on the scientific insights of dissenters, is tantamount to injecting the Wiki with the equivalent of <a href="../../../a/d/j/Adjuvant.html" title="Adjuvant">adjuvants</a> that, if unchecked, would cause the equivalent of arrested, neotenous neurodevelopment which is characteristic of <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autistic_spectrum.html" title="Autistic spectrum">autistic spectrum</a> disorders. Say what you will, but Asimov would look askance at this AfD, just as he would look the same way at the deletionism that you two relentlessly push, and he might even compare your efforts to the lead-poisoned elite of the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>, upon whom he modeled the rulers of the <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decadence.html" title="Decadence">decadent</a> Trantor.

<li>Added comment: searching PubMed for "Fletcher P vaccine" gives no results. Googling for the same combination only results in hits from blogs describing his testimony. Do we need a page on every person who ever testified for an English court? Some may characterise him as "eminent scientist and high ranking authority on vaccines", but this is not quite borne out by generally used indicators. Oh, and since when has the autism epidemic spanned the globe, and what is the source of the statistic that "untold thousands of UK children [who] have become autistic and developed <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autistic_enterocolitis.html" title="Autistic enterocolitis">autistic enterocolitis</a>"? <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 19:19, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b>: An eminent scientist and high ranking authority on <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccine.html" title="Vaccine">vaccines</a>, Fletcher has shattered the illusion that the medical establishment is united in its refusal to acknowledge culpability for triggering an <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_epidemic.html" title="Autism epidemic">autism epidemic</a> that spans the globe. For political and economic reasons, other medical authorities have been entirely unable to regognize and acknowledge the global catastrophe caused by <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccine_injury.html" title="Vaccine injury">vaccine injuries</a>. Simply because the bulk of Fletcher's career predates the advent of the internet, there is no reason to assume his contributions to medical science are anything less than extremely noteworthy. Fletcher is noteworthy not only for the prestigious position he once held overseeing vaccine policy in the UK, but also for breaking ranks with medical authorities loudly and clearly as an expert on vaccine issues, and his statements have been reported around the world. Beyond that, he was chosen as an expert witness and played a primary role in the high profile UK lawsuit on behalf of the untold thousands of UK children who have become autistic and developed <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autistic_enterocolitis.html" title="Autistic enterocolitis">autistic enterocolitis</a> following vaccination. He presented reports, inexplicably ignored by the court in its decision to derail the litigation, that supported the clinical evidence and observations by thousands of parents "that a triple vaccine (MMR) was causally related to the damage suffered by the children." Fletcher has been quoted widely by journalists around the world who have covered the <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccine_controversy.html" title="Vaccine controversy">vaccine controversy</a>. Ironically, Midgley himself has said the only thing that he dismisses about the case presented on behalf of the children and their parents had to do with <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conflict_of_interest.html" title="Conflict of interest">conflict of interest</a> concerns.<a href="http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/eletters/329/7472/939#80648" class="external autonumber" title="http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/eletters/329/7472/939#80648" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> However, the only expert testimony in the case where such concerns could easily be dismissed would be that of a retired vaccine expert and recognized authority, such as Fletcher. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 18:02, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> One of the things about courts, at least English courts, is that very little of what they do is <i>inexplicable</i>. Hardly any of it is even unexplained. It isn't always trivial to obtain the actual text of the explanation, but it is perfectly clear here that the Legal Aid Board had the opportunity to consider Dr Fletcher's comments, and decided, in the light of that and the other avaialable elements of the case the bringing of which was proposed, that the case was hopeless - hence their explicable decision to not fund it further. That case has been funded IIRC to around £10M from public funds already, and I think that it was reasonable to pay to bring such concerns to law, but it is not reasonable to go on and on and on. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgley_e5a1.html" title="User:Midgley">Midgley</a> 18:21, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

In fact, there is more biographical information in that newspaper article than on Peter Fletcher (for example, he was Chief Scientific Officer in the 1970s). Further, the original text of the page is extremely emotive (e.g., "In early 2006, Fletcher reignited the smoldering MMR vaccine debate", "political firestorm"), and seems incongruous with the evidence.

<li>His career certainly did pre-date the internet.

Perhaps the best defence you could make for this article would be to find some actual biographical information and evidence of notability.

<li>Depicting Mohamed in the weave of a basket is an example of what Islam forbids (according to some scholars, not all). Depicting Mohamed in a basket is idolatry, i.e. an "ansab" (what, no article on that?! Probably under some other name I can't find at the moment.) <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_athletics.html" title="Islamic athletics">Islamic athletics</a> discusses other similar Islamic principles such as <a href="../../../h/i/j/Hijab.html" title="Hijab">hijab</a> and <a href="../../../a/w/r/Awrah.html" title="Awrah">awrah</a>.

You are rather quick to cite others of incivility when it is somewhat possible you don't understand the point they are making (which, again, is entirely possibly in a large part due to me not being a native speaker of English! Also comments in an AfD are written in an unusually curt form due to the need to get the point across quickly; this requires even further positive attitude (assume good faith) from the reader.

<p>Article is primarily an advertisement for the book <i>Super Chef.</i> Also, the term "super chef" as defined here is something of a neologism and hasn't caught on beyond Rossant's book; the phrase is generic and is usually used as a synonym for <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celebrity_chef.html" title="Celebrity chef">celebrity chef</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> this page serves no purpose. Maybe we do need a neologism to label this exact sub-sub-species of people but I doubt it and certainly not in this book-pushing form.

<li><b>Leave as a separate page.</b> I am the author of this page (and I am not Juliette Rossant!).</li>
</ul>
<p>Were any of you to read this entire "super chef" before continuing your deletion process, you will see that a "super chef" is clearly a new (though growing) phenomenon among chefs -- and clearly does not include many celebrity and other chefs. In fact, the article spends its last quarter separating out celebrity and other chefs who might be confused with super chefs: Julia Child, James Beard, Jacques Pepin, Sara Moulton, Anthony Bourdain, Alton Brown, and Rocco DiSpirito; Paul Prudhomme, Alice Waters, Martin Yan, Michael Chiarello, and Masaharu Morimoto; Rachael Ray, Paula Deen, and Jeffrey Smith (AKA The Frugal Gourmet).</p>
<p>If you wish to make changes, e.g., you don't like the book reference (strange for people who are trying to creating a reference encyclopedia), then please suggest or simply make changes, but at least have the courtesy of reading more carefully.</p>
<p>Also, the "sub-sub-category" and little used "neo-logism" arguments are not very strong, either: isn't Wikipedia as an online encyclopedia trying to get ahead of the institutional speed of something like Brittanica?</p>
<p>Lastly, if you want an article about Juliette Rossant in order to validate your point, I am writing one today.</p>
<p>That said, I confess that Wikipedia still confuses me with its own institutional, lengthy instructions. I am trying to categorized this page (preferably under Food, Hospitality, Business, News, Media, Celebrity and/or possibly other categories, if I can just find them and figure out how to incorporate them...)</p>
<p>Also, I am unclear about hyperlinks: does Wikipedia prefer hyperlinks referring to its own pages or outside pages? Frankly, I am for both and don't mind adding both. Thus, " <a href="../../../j/u/l/Juliette_Rossant_2214.html" title="Juliette Rossant">Juliette Rossant</a> <a href="http://www.julietterosant.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.julietterosant.com/" rel="nofollow">q.v.</a> "</p>
<p>Please email me directly with replies before taking any further action, as this will also help me understand Wikipedia's direction and how worthwhile it is for me to contributing with further new additions and edits: aboudaqn [ at ] gmail [dot] com.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<dd>Speaking for myself, I did indeed read the article. I'm well aware of the distinction Rossant is making. However, we can't have an article on every new word someone comes up with. We need some evidence of its currency and usage beyond the confines of this one book. We're not in a competition with <i>Britannica</i> (or any other encyclopedia) to see who can incorporate neologisms first. Right now, if this term belongs anywhere, it's in a section of the <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celebrity_chef.html" title="Celebrity chef">celebrity chef</a> (or possibly <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chef.html" title="Chef">chef</a>) article, because it's not well-known or widely-used enough to have its own article. Someday it might be, but today, based on available evidence, it isn't. Also, please understand that this isn't anything personal; it's about making the best encyclopedia we can. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 01:34, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Response</b>: I did not attack the post, or the poster. I did not even attack Shmulevich himself. I called his followers "hoodlums", and their posters "moronic", not because I agree or disagree with their political position, but because I viewed the contents of the website and the pictures of their "actions". The degree of stupidity contained therein is <i>directly relevant</i> to B.A.'s notability as a political movement: the lamer, the less legitimate, the more deletable.

<p><b>Keep</b>. The fact that somebody is considered a "hoodlum" is not a reason for not having an entry. Nor is there a rule on the number of followers required for someone to be "notable," so far as I know (and quite how many followers he has is open to dispute). Shmulevich is intresting for two reasons (which is why I postd the entry in the first place, hoping that someone would expand it). Firstly, he is an associate of <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Dugin_9b59.html" title="Alexander Dugin">Alexander Dugin</a> and a founding member of Dugin's Eurasia Movement. He is therefore relevant to the understanding of Dugin and his movement, which is why I put a page on him in my book *Against the Modern World* (Oxford UP, 2004). Secondly, he is an example of "Hyperzionism," a movement that does exist, even if it is pretty small. His public advocacy of a "Nile to Euphrates" State is in itself notable. The Israeli newspaper *Ediot Ahronot* thought him notable enoug to merit an articl (Natasha Mozgovaya, “The Red Army of the Hebron Rabbi,” July 18 2003). Frankly, I suspect that the main argument for deletion is simply that many people don't like the guy--which I understand, but I just don't think that should be a criterion.<a href="../../../m/j/s/User%7EMjsedgwick_8a06.html" title="User:Mjsedgwick">mjsedgwick</a> 18:40, 8 March 2006 (GMT+2)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I think the author himself unintentionally makes the point for deletion. This is not about ideology (I am unfamiliar with A.S.'s ideology other than the ludicrous borders thing). This is about being marginal. A marginal crackpot with ludicrous views and few or no followers may be very entertaining, but is not a proper material for inclusion in wikipedia. (Incidentally, the author and I are having an interesting conversation about all these characters off wikipedia. There's no personal animus here). <a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">Crzrussian</a> 17:05, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Response</b>: True about the side discussion. Problem is that I'm going to have to abandon debate soon as it's late in my time zone and there are children to be put to bed! I'm probaly violating some policy by going off topic like this, but I'm rather struck by the fact that the result of my adding a stub for someone I thought interesting is that I end up wiriting more on this page than on the original entry. Lesson for future: don't post a stub, post a full article. Anyhow, back on topic: at least <a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">Crzrussian</a> admits to "interesting" and "marginal"! How "marginal" is "marginal"? OK, no-one's about to put the guy on banknote, or elect him to the Knesset, but surely you don't have to be THAT notable for a Wikipedia entry. I'll repeat here my original logic. <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Dugin_9b59.html" title="Alexander Dugin">Alexander Dugin</a> is certainly notable. Subject of dispute contributes to understanding of larger subject. Also relevant to second larger subject of HyperZionism/Neo-Zionism.<a href="../../../m/j/s/User%7EMjsedgwick_8a06.html" title="User:Mjsedgwick">mjsedgwick</a> 19:20, 8 March 2006 (GMT+2)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Until now this has been civil and divorced from ideology. A few minutes ago I removed the following passage from the article: <i>Th[e] control [from the Nile to the Euphrates] need not be military: the techniques of economic and social control suggested in the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protocols_of_the_Learned_Elders_of_Zion_6d00.html" title="Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion">Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion</a> would do equally well.</i> OMG! The reference to the Protocols, a pathetic antisemitic hoax, which makes my blood boil, instantly casts doubt on the entire article and the intention of the writer! Is this article meant to castigate its subject? I am profoundly unhappy. <a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">Crzrussian</a> 19:37, 9 March 2006 (UTC) I am having trouble being cool as a cucumber. <a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">Crzrussian</a> 19:38, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Response</b> Well, that's what comes of saying we're having an amicable and interesting discussion! A sentence "<i>instantly casts doubt on</i> the entire article and <i>the intention of the writer!</i>" Since I'm the writer, I think that means doubt is being cast on <i>my</i> intentions? Does that mean that it's OK for me to consider the intentions of <a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">Crzrussian</a>? "I am profoundly unhappy" describes a state of mind, which might be relevant to intention. "A pathetic antisemitic hoax, which makes my blood boil"--well, let's see. Hoax, yes. Antisemitic, yes. <i>Pathetic</i>? Well, I wish! One of the most successful hoaxes in history, I'd say. Just look at the number of editions and translations... But anyhow, whether or not that particular hoax makes one's blood boil is not the point. The question is whether or not the subject of the article did make that rather extraordinary assertion [and he did]. One might then speculate as to <i>why</i>. Well, put it together with the "Nile to Euphrates" definition, and a possibility starts to become clear. That definition too is a hoax, and a very successful one. The majority of Arabs are convinced that the State of Israel has designs on Egypt and Iraq, even though this is not the case. What Shmulevich is doing, I think, is being as provocative as possible by taking the two greatest antisemitic/anti-Israeli hoax ideas around, and endorsing them. And it seems to work, no? Anyhow, the reason I'm replying at such length is partly to defend myself against the charge that seems to have been brought against me, and partly because I think this exchange illustrates my earlier thesis that the real objection to an entry on Shmulevich is not that <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT" class="extiw" title="m:WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information</a> but that people don't like the guy. To which I would reply: <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT" class="extiw" title="m:WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not censored</a>. Despite which, I am accepting censorship on this occasion, and have not reversed the deletion. <a href="../../../m/j/s/User%7EMjsedgwick_8a06.html" title="User:Mjsedgwick">mjsedgwick</a> 13:49, 11 March 2006 (GMT+2)

<dd><b>I give up</b> Keep the article if you want to. I am removing myself from this debate, but remain convinced that Professor Sedgwick invidiously compared Shmulevich's actions with the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, which was quite anti-semitic and unprofessorly of him. See ya. <a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">Crzrussian</a> 02:24, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Oh, I see!</b> <a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">Crzrussian</a> thought that it was <i>me</i> who had made the comparison with the Protocols. I can see now why he got upset. If the original (now deleted) sentence is read more carefully and in context (and in cold blood), I trust it will be clear that I did not make this comparison at all (it would never occurr to me to make such a comparison, which is why I didn't realize what <a href="../../../c/r/z/User%7ECrzrussian_3f2d.html" title="User:Crzrussian">Crzrussian</a> was getting at). I was reporting what <i>Shmulevich</i> said (or wrote, actually). It is Shmulevich who provocatively refers to the Protocols, partly as a way of gaining people' attention and making them react--which certainly seems to have happened on this occasion! <a href="../../../m/j/s/User%7EMjsedgwick_8a06.html" title="User:Mjsedgwick">mjsedgwick</a> 19:45, 12 March 2006 (GMT+2)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> an indiscriminate collection of information. This article reads like a FAQ or a product review, not an encyclopedia. Most of the text of the page is in the form of large tables rather than an encyclopedic article; what little accurate text there is often wanders into configuration advice. Moreover, the information is outdated and inaccurate — some of it never was true, and none of it is referenced, meaning that the page also violates either <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> or <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. The article itself warns that its content isn't accurate; the information it provides would be better suited to <a href="../../../w/e/b/Category%7EWeb_browsers_283d.html" title="Category:Web browsers">Category:Web browsers</a> and associated articles anyway.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Reorganise layout and provide links to named browser articles. The comparison is the most useful aspect of the information.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is not remotely indiscriminant, but a well-presented features list. My only criticism is that it will be very difficult to keep up to date, but if the editors are willing to do so, it's a useful reference. Removing detail to individual browser articles would defeat the purpose. In fact, I referenced <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_wiki_software.html" title="Comparison of wiki software">Comparison_of_wiki_software</a> last week and found it useful. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User_talk%7EBikeable_218a.html" title="User talk:Bikeable">(talk)</a> 16:15, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>"Utility is irrelevant"? I disagree; ease of use is critical in an encyclopedia, and encyclopedias have plenty of lists when comparison between items is appropriate. I agree that categories would be better for many things on wikipedia, but not for comparisons like the ones you have nominated. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User_talk%7EBikeable_218a.html" title="User talk:Bikeable">(talk)</a> 17:22, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>He didn't say "irrelevant, he said "not at issue." Meaning "not disputed"--it's clearly a useful list. I'm torn--I worry about maintainability. That doesn't matter for fancruft, but it does for an article people might use to make decisions about things. On balance, though, it's a good article, well-presented, hard to see how else it could be done.

<li>Yes, most of the companies have not been written up yet. My main purpose for wikifying the list was to see which firms have articles and which don't.

<p><b>DELETE</b> Usually I am all for band articles, however the user User:Bearbrian seems to be gaurding the page and reverts any edits, despite attempts to compromise.

<ul>
<li>I must protest that if <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speedcore.html" title="Speedcore">Speedcore</a> is a relevant entry; as is Mister joker; to the music community - then Darkera has also has relevance as a free-distribution artistic archive for this EXACT subject. Notability is subjective to the readers own bias. Followers of the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardcore_Techno_503e.html" title="Hardcore Techno">Hardcore Techno</a> movement would argue this "non-notability" Discrimination based on popularity would be ACTUAL vanity, especially if it led to the removal of this article. A curious Wikipedian might venture a search for "hardcore music labels" or something similar &gt; only to find countless entries referring to artists, bands and labels. So why punish just this ONE of many "offenders"? 64.180.249.186 16:49, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>See <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_02d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity">Wikipedia:Vanity</a> for a definition of what we mean when we say "it's vanity". Speedcore actually gets 333,000 which would demonstrate notability to me; even Mister Joker gets 325 (that article itself is borderline and most certainly fits what we would define as vanity here). -- <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancs2000_6420.html" title="User:Francs2000">Francs</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Francs2000&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Francs2000&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">2000</a> <a href="../../../g/a/y/Image%7EGay_flag.svg_c968.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/68/Gay_flag.svg/25px-Gay_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="15" longdesc="../../../g/a/y/Image%7EGay_flag.svg_c968.html" /></a> 16:56, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I think you are missing the point. The company is either worthy of recognition or it isn't. How many CDs has it released and how many copies have they sold? How many culturally significant artists have they produced? If Darkera's goal is to establish the significance of currently unknown artists that is a terriffic goal but it means that Darkera does not <i>currently</i> deserve a Wikipedia entry. Wikipedia recognizes notability, it is not a tool to develop notability. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 18:30, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Darkera is an Emeriging music label representing a vast varity of musical content. you expect something that its only been up for one day to get a million hits or so? thats ridiculas. artists as much as labels need recogination. censoring something after a total of 24 hours without prior seeing what the full results maybe are not only ludacriss but also obscenly stupid and hindering.</p>
<p>Someone mentioned you cant find DE content well here is the brief history of the label so far try going to Discogs. YOU can not even get content on that site unless its proved to have beeen released and offical <a href="http://www.discogs.com/label/Darkera" class="external free" title="http://www.discogs.com/label/Darkera" rel="nofollow">http://www.discogs.com/label/Darkera</a> try looking on sites that sell Dj releated vinyls, things RR and hardcorestore, Sector-1 etc things that generate for the community, rather then some lame search on probley what HMV Uk or some place that deals with Mainstream releases</p>

OK - so I have retuned the Darkera article and begun development of a useful discussion. Hopefully this will help to answer some of the questions arising here.</p>
<p>vanity was certainly not the intent of this information, however I understand that the original entry was not useful. Quite to the opposite, the main drive of the DE movement has always been the free and unbiased release of music. Even so, this has not prevented the release of purchasable hardcopy albums as well.</p>

Rewrote main page, fixed miscatagorization &amp; started to add links to valid externel media.</p>
<p>I would suggest to anyone who still considers Darkera an unnotable contributor to the speedcore scene: please review <a href="http://www.coreboard.de/viewtopic.php?t=5487" class="external text" title="http://www.coreboard.de/viewtopic.php?t=5487" rel="nofollow">Project: Enigma</a>.

<p>This will bring Darkera's hardcopy count to 4 ~ 1 cd, 2 vinyls and a DVD. Subsiduary <a href="http://www.phlow.de/netlabels/index.php/Gateway" class="external text" title="http://www.phlow.de/netlabels/index.php/Gateway" rel="nofollow">Gateway</a> clocks in with 9 releases.</p>

<dd>Update it? You mean add about thousand of albums that it doesn't include? Yes, it's worse than most of the lists, because most of the lists contain things that have some interesting properties, not something that's true for 50% of these things. Hell, it even does have "similar but not quite there" section as if the main section doesn't have potential to be the largest list in Wikipedia. We don't need an article titled list of FOO when it in fact doesn't contain even 10% of FOO.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Firstly I'd argue with your figures in the first comment, as by checking my own CD collection I'd estimate about only 30% of albums have a matching or near-matching track.

<li><b>Delete</b> I was among the out-voted last time, but I am unrepentant. I love lists; and rarely vote to kill them but here it needs to go. My reasons before -- and now -- are basically that it was nearly every album and impossible to be even reasonably complete.

<li><b>KEEP</b> Anyone see that program about the NME on the 10th march, BBC 2? in states that anyone can make up a genre, as they did - 'Camden horror' &amp; 'Figgle' where made by non-musicians, but critics, one writer in the NME grouped together as little as 3 bands and stated they are a new genre, and this was accepted. This is the beauty of musical creativity and creation in general, anyone can do it. so from now on, with or without the 'law' of wikipedia, there is a new genre in the musical world known as 'Hyper rock' - bands in this catagory are mostly unsigned, apart from Muse.

<li>The article needs improved, not deleted. Fact is, BZP is a very relevent site, it would be silly to delete an article on it. As far as it being an advertisement, BZP hardly needs advertisement. But I beleive that every site of note in the Bionicle community deserves reference; we're talking about the fan community of LEGO's most successful line, that helped save the company, and it is also the company that is more in-tune with its online fan community than virtually any other. There is just plain no justification for any arguement that sites like BZP or MoD do not deserve their own encyclopedic reference, unless you want to argue that the LEGO company is not noteworthy.

<p>This version of the original article about the Australian soap opera <i><a href="../../../n/e/i/Neighbours.html" title="Neighbours">Neighbours</a></i> was created recently because the programme is broadcast a few weeks later in the UK than it is in Australia and some UK viewers don't want to see "spoilers". It is therefore a fork and over time the two versions could become more and more divergent and perhaps inconsistent. Overall quality is likely to suffer if the editorial effort is divided. This is a very bad precedent as it could be applied to hundreds of programmes which are broadcast in more than one country. Spoiler warnings on the relevant sections are sufficient and if people want to be sure of avoiding all spoilers they can read an old version from the history. <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHonbicot_fd59.html" title="User:Honbicot">Honbicot</a> 18:58, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berabow_Man_81e3.html" title="Berabow Man">Berabow Man</a> article appears to be a shallow copy of the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bravoman.html" title="Bravoman">Bravoman</a> article with just changes in the names, no images, and no apparent reason for creation e.g. like "Berabow Man" being an actual alternate name for the actual Namco's game <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bravoman.html" title="Bravoman">Bravoman</a>. Also, its author vandalized the original Bravoman page and redirected to his/her version. This article offers little or nothing extra information compared to the original, and has little reason to exist.</p>
<p><b>Berabow Man</b> is NOT a shallow copy of the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bravoman.html" title="Bravoman">Bravoman</a> article. The game name is BERABOW MAN based upon Namco's own listings: - BERABOW is in the default high score listing - BERABOW MAN is listed in the history of Namco games in Namco Museum Volume 1 (PS1) - BERABOW MAN is listed in the history of Namco games in the end credits of Dragon Saber (1990). Bravoman is just an NEC PC-Engine conversion of the game, translated into English.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I cross checked, and seen that there is indeed an arcade (Japanese only) "Beraboh Man" (the sources are uncertain between Berabow and Beraboh, however it's even emulated under MAME). But still, IMHO the best thing would still be merging the "Berabow man" info with the Bravoman article, as this is the most common name under which the game is known and under which its ENGLISH versions are known. And, gingerfield rocks, your article IS just a copy of the original, and claiming that it focuses on the original japanese arcade version while keeping the NEC's version english texts unaltered iand deleting the whole article is a bit hypocritical... <a href="../../../e/p/i/User%7EEpiVictor_855c.html" title="User:EpiVictor">EpiVictor</a> 12:14, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Non-notable sandwich served (and discontinued years ago) by a single university cafeteria. Normally I would prod this, but the speedy was already contested (meaning, I feel prod would be a waste of time). <strike><b>Delete</b></strike> I am now changing my vote -- to <b>Extremely strong delete</b>, due to users that are now stalking me on IM due to my stance on this issue. <a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">Andy Saunders</a> 19:27, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>As there is no other place on the internet where the recipe or process for this sandwich is available, I feel that wikipedia is fufilling its mission of keeping information not otherwise available accessible to anyone who needs it.

<li>"Wikipedia is a neutral and unbiased compilation of notable, verifiable facts." "A view is generally considered notable if it is potentially information of value or interest in some way to a significant number of people, or to some perspective, or its omission would leave a significant gap in historical human knowledge of a subject." (from <a href="../../../8/w/_/WP%7E8W_03c1.html" title="WP:8W">WP:8W</a>). I am of the opinion that the Spanjo is not of interest to a significant number of people; therefore, I refer to it as "non-notable". -- <a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">Andy Saunders</a> 19:37, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Indibass, thank you very much for your contribution. I made myself a spango for lunch today and it was amazing! I believe that it would be a slap in the face to vegitarians everywhere if this sandwhich was deleted from record and forever lost to civilization. Andy Saunders seems to be a typical Canadian anti-vegitarianite. Just because it does not have gravy does not mean it is not good. Besides Andy, who made you the sandwich police?!!

<li>"the Spanjo is not of interest to a significant number of people" -OntarioQuizzer. Again: not true.

There are several comments in support of this article, and I wouldn't have created it just so it could be deleted. I would like someone to tell me 1) what is the best thing that could happen by deleting this article and 2) what is the worst thing that could happen by keeping this article. I think you'll find that more information is preferable to deleting something because you don't know what it is. Maybe it makes you afraid. I don't know. What I do know is deleting this article is a blow against the guiding principles that wikipedia was founded on.</p>

<p><b>KEEP!!!</b>The Spanjo is how I met my husband. You see, I was at the Halfass, trying to decide which sandwich to order, when the guy in front of me ordered a Spanjo. I was thinking about trying the Spanjo myself, but as a poor college student, I was reluctant to spend my money on a sandwich I might not like. I asked the guy in front of me how the Spanjo was, and with his encouragement, I took the plunge. We ended up eating our Spanjos together that afternoon, and 5 years later we got married (and for the record, we had mini Spanjos during the cocktail hour). Every year, we return to Michigan for a football game, and on these trips we are sure to visit the Halfass for a Spanjo at least one time (they still make the sandwich, even though it is not on the official menu).

<li><b>Keep!</b> I'm new to this site (and thus I'm sure that big red box above refers to me) I can't say I'm an expert in all things wiki-related, but I can vouch for the fact that the sandwich in questions does exist. Not only is it surprisingly tasty, it does hold a bit of cultural significance in south central michigan. Point is, while this "information" may only be interesting to a very small sliver of the population, isn't that enough? It's not made up. It's true. And the information itself takes up a whole lot less space that the protests against it. As I said, from someone who is new to wikipedia, I thought this was precisely the place to put information like this, information you couldn't find anywhere else. sixofrock 10:48, 9 March 2006 (UTC) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 65.189.252.158 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.189.252.158_7233.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.189.252.158">contribs</a>) 09:48, 9 March 2006.</small></li>

<dd>"information that you can't find anywhere else" easily violates WP's "verifiability" tenet. If you can't find it anywhere else, how can you verify it to ensure that it's actually true? Nobody's done any sort of scholarly work on the Spanjo; Letterman hasn't eaten a Spanjo on his show; it's simply not notable, and if we were to include everything along the same notability level as the Spanjo, Wikipedia would be much too unwieldy and would lose a lot of its credibility. -- <a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">Andy Saunders</a> 16:20, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep</b> Since the Whopper is listed in Wikipedia I think the Spanjo should be included. A delicious sandwich should not be discriminated against simply because it is not served by a national chain. Andy's reply is going to be: "But the Whopper can be verified by published sources and many more people care about the Whopper." Good points Andy, but having eaten a Spanjo myself I must say keep. --Velcroshoe 18:13, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Keep</b> Andy - it's not inconceivable that more than 600,000 people have enjoyed a Spanjo (Michigan is a huge school), meaning that more than .01% of the population has intimate knowledge of it. Furthermore, let's say that each of those people told one other person about the sandwich in their lifetime. That's 1.2 million people. Are you so stuck up as to deny that 1.2 million people constitutes enough valid sources? --TsarSteve 18:32, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>This whole discussion amuses me. The reason I say to Keep it are because I love this sandwich and I know that I am not alone in my enjoyment. The "eataspanjo" is an Ann Arbor equivalent to the restaurant chain Steak and Shake's "Takhomasak". It's a local legend of a sandwich. --Velcroshoe 18:51, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b> (no consensus). It is a bit difficult to count the votes here, because the creator first wanted it kept, then said "might as well delete it". One person has called for a redirect, but I don't know where such a list might be. One called for moving this to Wiktionary, something which I think is entirely unworkable. Regarding whether or not this phrase is a neologism, I note that the term has very many <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=%22Trout+Bum%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=%22Trout+Bum%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Google hits</a> from a variety of websites. My count sets this at something around 6d-3k, and with a debate like this I am not comfortable calling anything else than a no consensus result. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 10:09, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I created it. Angr has been pretty persistent in trying to get it deleted but it really is a notable entry and it does not qualify as a neologism (new concept). I am a professional flyfishing writer and I put this up here because it really is a definitive term in flyfishing. To be a "trout bum" is to be one totally dedicated to the sport. Since Gierach's book debuted the term has entered the entire flyfishing lexicon. The Trout Bum Tournament is even sponsored by Fly Rod and Reel magazine (not the outfit I write for). Googling "trout bum" returns 68,000 hits. The fact that Angr is not aware of the term doesn't mean it isn't viable - this merely speaks to his personal ignorance of it; a problem which would be remedied were it to be included.

<dd>Is there ever a point at which I can know that the entry has been kept or has been deleted? This is such an arbitrary place - almost everything I've done today has been deleted by someone, which tells me either I don't understand the politics of this thing or there is a group out here more willing than me to be vocal.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Regarding the question of notability - I read the wiki definition (thanks Thatcher). It seems to me that the line of notability is crossed when a term eclipses the "narrow" understanding of a target group and begins to be known by a mass audience. Flyfishermen are definitionally a rather large target group, with industry numbers projecting around 2,000,000 flyfishers in the US alone. However, if the test is to be whether the term has exceeded the bounds of the field, please look at local news sites: <a href="http://www.yakima-herald.com/page/dis/329491691747867" class="external free" title="http://www.yakima-herald.com/page/dis/329491691747867" rel="nofollow">http://www.yakima-herald.com/page/dis/329491691747867</a> (Google '"trout bum" news), or even large sporting outfits like ESPN: <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/outdoors/fishing/news/story?page=f_fea_CO_ski-n-fish05_L.Burkhead" class="external free" title="http://sports.espn.go.com/outdoors/fishing/news/story?page=f_fea_CO_ski-n-fish05_L.Burkhead" rel="nofollow">http://sports.espn.go.com/outdoors/fishing/news/story?page=f_fea_CO_ski-n-fish05_L.Burkhead</a>. <a href="../../../z/a/c/User%7EZachMatthews_93ca.html" title="User:ZachMatthews">ZachMatthews</a> 22:28, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It's a neologism but non-notable? From <i>The Seattle Times</i>, Febuary 7, 2006, Pg. D9, "Having a trout bum around is kind of like having a Labrador retriever around the house, if you don't get them outside regularly, they get squirrelly and start to stink. I needed to air it out.

<p>This belongs on a wold of warcraft/MMORPG wiki, it's far too gamecrufty for the general interest, having endured a short but educational world of warcraft career, myself, I know that 'custom' (i.e. not hardwired into the software) loot systems do exist, but this one is just an attempt by a clan to make their name stick to that system. It's also only got one Google hit. --<a href="../../../o/b/l/User%7EObli_4ce1.html" title="User:Obli"><font color="#FF0000">O</font></a><a href="../../../o/b/l/User%7EObli_4ce1.html" title="User:Obli">bli</a> (<a href="../../../o/b/l/User_talk%7EObli_47c1.html" title="User talk:Obli">Talk</a>)<small><sup><a href="../../../t/a/l/WP%7ETALK_766c.html" title="WP:TALK">?</a></sup></small> 22:12, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

From the Author:</p>
<p>Systems like <a href="../../../d/k/p/DKP_%28Point_System%29_2ba7.html" title="DKP (Point System)">DKP (Point System)</a> exist in this wiki already as do other MMORPG-specific terms, some of which are very specfic to various games (see <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeroy_Jenkins_c207.html" title="Leeroy Jenkins">Leeroy Jenkins</a>). I will willingly remove the guild reference from the title if that is the issue, but again, I was following the format of the DKP article which refers to the guild which created it. I could certainly add this section to the DKP system, but I feel that it is an inherently different system and it isn't a variant.</p>
<p>I've also thought about making a more general "loot systems" article which would be more general and attempt to place the variant systems such as this into a context for the reader and would make a place for other newer variants to add sections. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Iceparrot (<a href="../../../i/c/e/User_talk%7EIceparrot_3931.html" title="User talk:Iceparrot">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Iceparrot_8263.html" title="Special:Contributions/Iceparrot">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<ul>
<li>I actually tried looking for an article on loot systems, seems like you knew where to look&#160;:) I actually think a more generalized article for loot systems, maybe loot (MMORPG) would be better, Id' be for it if you moved <a href="../../../d/k/p/DKP_%28Point_System%29_2ba7.html" title="DKP (Point System)">DKP (Point System)</a> to that name and merged your existing article, seems to me that peolpe will find it easier that way. --<a href="../../../o/b/l/User%7EObli_4ce1.html" title="User:Obli"><font color="#FF0000">O</font></a><a href="../../../o/b/l/User%7EObli_4ce1.html" title="User:Obli">bli</a> (<a href="../../../o/b/l/User_talk%7EObli_47c1.html" title="User talk:Obli">Talk</a>)<small><sup><a href="../../../t/a/l/WP%7ETALK_766c.html" title="WP:TALK">?</a></sup></small> 22:35, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><br />
I will do that instead, I think it will be of greater use and be more general to any MMORPG, but still allow to give credit to the "inventors" of certain systems. Iceparrot 21:42, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply slowmower. Ten years ago these =were= neologisms. As we write, these words and notions are becoming relevant and common language in accademic arena as well as in the sofware development realm, especially online community development. I strongly believe that they should be available for reference both for a historical context POV as well as for their relevance to the discourses currently informing such creative areas. As an example: what Bergson believed was to be not representable (the motion of duration) became allegorized by the advent of film. Interactive media is opening even more access to notions such at that one as common experiences which can (and need) to be reffered to by a single term. in this case (splace and platzgeist, which mean the same but in diferent languages) do exactly that, they refer to an otherwise unrepresentable notion (the sense of place, as it relates to time and experience) in an interactive environment. To support these argument, I have made references to the thinkers who motivated the creation of such interactive (diegetic) space, and consequently the words to describe them. As online community sofwares evolve to the next phase, this will be even more relevant to describe succintly. "Wiki" was once, not too long ago, a neologism. Respectfuly yours, Splace</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Basically nobody uses this word right now. WP is not a crystal ball to predict neologisms which "are becoming relevant" or "will be even more relevant". <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 23:34, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hynca-Hooley, that is a very good point, however, I must disagree with you, I am making a qualitative contribution, not one based on a quantitative gage. When did someone determine that the word "Bling" had reached the tipping point in order to deem it a signifier to all things 'Hip-Hop'? I agree there must be critical mass, but 'splace' and 'bling' differ qualitatively in that their usage is relevant to demographies which by their very nature will produce wide disparity in their numbers. I am talking accademia and sofware developers... not pop culture. I assumed that these kinds of reviews would be done by peers based on the relevance of the actual content contributed, not purely on speculatons of partially evident external factors. No one so far is going to the meat of what I posted to deem it 'deletable'. <a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers</a> &#160;;) cheers, Splace</p>

<p>Allen, Thanks for the diligent research. Again, non of this addresses the meaning and philosophical context of the words presented in the article. Tomorrow a restaurant chain could adopt the name and still that is irrelevant to the actual meaning of the word. Amazon is a river in South America, that a retail bookseller addopted that word as a name to do business, does not make the word more or less relevant in terms of it's original meaning. Is anyone here versant in the ideas presented in the article? That would make for a fairer scrutiny than what so far appears to be knee-jerk reactionary reviews to what so far is an unfamiliar word to some, presented by a newcomer. Respectfuly and simply curious. Splace</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for your response. As far as I can tell, the website is run by the person who coined the word, so it doesn't seem quite like Amazon.com. Also, if it weren't for the website, I would say that the article was <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, which Wikipedia discourages. --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 00:40, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Krash, thank you for poiting the already-mentioned out&#160;:) I agree that 'vanity' clause seems to apply given the user name I chose for these sessions, clearly this could be solved easily if I sign in with a different username. As I explained above, the terms are no longer neo-logisms, and to quote from one of the links you posted, this is what is the case for my contributions:</p>
<p>"In the Wikipedia namespace, for example, the test should obviously be whether a word or phrase is useful for discussing Wikipedia, not whether the word is sufficiently widespread outside Wikipedia."</p>
<p>Please address the content and its relevance to the contextual references and meaning involved, not just the circumventing proto-evidence. Thank you. Splace</p>
<dl>
<dd>If I understand you correctly, you argue that these are not neologisms because they're ten years old. However, if, after ten years, practically nobody but you is using them, they would have to be described as a failed attempt at neologism.

<li>There's a little problem on the google hits, as the overwhelming majority lead to things like "JoysPlace" or "RosesPlace". Occurrences of "splace" as a standalone word are few and far between. Where the word does exist (like your items 2 and 3 above) there is nothing to tie it to Schnaas or <i>platzgeist</i>, and no indication that these sites have any definition of the word in common with each other or with you. Looks like these people also combined "space" and "place" but there's nothing there to attribute the word to any source other than the authors of those sites. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 15:06, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>In deed, Fan-1976, the bulk in the search results are typos but as I pointed above, the merit of the entry lies not on the quantitative but the qualitative value and relevance to the meaning of both 'splace' and 'platzgeist' they both are with out a doubt a needed modern terms for the ancient (<a href="../../../g/e/n/Genius_loci.html" title="Genius loci">Genius loci</a>). I just ordered the book by Mr. Salzinger and will agregate his uses in the Psychoanalitic realm to these entries. Splace</p>
<ul>
<li>Sorry, but the crux of the matter is that nobody uses these words, and therefore they have no place here. You bring up words like "bling" and "wiki" which were once neologisms but are now accepted; your words have not reached that status yet, if in fact they ever will. I fear you misunderstood the point about the "Wikipedia namespace". There are terms commonly used in WP discussions, when talking about WP, that are not normally used elsewhere. "Cruft" is such a word. "Splace" is not. I am not one of the admins who will ultimately decide whether this entry stays or goes, but I would be very surprised to see it stay. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 21:14, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Fan-1976, I certainly appreciate your investment in this particular entry attempt. From my end at least I can say I am trying. I did however expect a bit more of the thoroughness you lent to the matter from other posters, if anything to experience the 'constructive' nature of this tool for the documentation of lexicon. I was surprissed by the blanket burocratic approact in the review so far, simply quoting potential broken rules as opposed to engaging in the potentiality of the project, despite it's outcome. I still strongly believe there is merit to this entry even if it needs to be cleaned up substantially, which I will endeavor to do over time, an investment I'll seemingly have to go at alone since there seem to be few or none true passionate lexicographers in this crowd... at least so far. Cheers to you! Splace</p>

<li>I'm sorry, but the rules aren't that complicated. A word that nobody uses doesn't get an entry, no matter how much you like it, no matter how valuable you think it could be if people would use it. It's as simple as that. These terms have never caught on with anybody. I doubt they ever will. If they ever do, feel free to relist them, but I suspect you'll find them gone from here in a few days. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 01:37, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Ah, if this is a self-published book, it has a large number of Googles, doesn't it? 2200 for my search of Spiked + "C.J. Beck".

<li><b>Nominate</b> Beck may not be Balzac, who you'll remember owned his own printing press, but his readers seem to endorse if their comments at various on-line booksellers are to be believed. National Union of Journalists' award supports credentials for a book with journalist protagonists. "Different?" Check Gerald Bull entry and then see if his science has been developed much since his death or taken up in fiction. As for comment "Malundi also keeps removing tags requesting cleanup", sorry, but that was only once, and only after I supplied the request for a citation. By all means clean up, but let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater. Malundi 8 March 2006</li>
<li>Has anyone proposing deletion read the book? Rationale appears to be based on Wikipedia procedure and emerging culture rather than content. A case of the tail wagging the dog? When one member alludes to Malundi's small number of contributions it just becomes plain silly. I believe if they read the book they would see its value. This book is a sound contribution to the discussion on Apartheid-era South Africa, inner workings of journalism and a ballistics science still-born since Gerald Bull's assassination. On-line bookseller reviews are supportive. I appreciate we need to ensure conformity with Wikipedia style but let's not do it at the expense of substance. Nominated by Malundi 8 March 2006 <i>comment moved from AfD talk page</i>
<ul>
<li>When "one member" (which happens to be myself) alludes to your small number of contributions, it is because members with small numbers of contributions frequently don't fully understand what Wikipedia is, what it is for and what it <i>isn't</i> for. (Not to mention that members with small numbers of contributions, all of which revolve around one particular subject or person -- for instance, a self-published author -- often look like they're trying to promote that subject or person.) For instance, they may mistakenly think that the issue is whether the subject is <i>good</i>, and try to convince us that the subject is good -- for instance, that "if they read the book they would see its value". By the way, you removed cleanup tags <i>not</i> once, but twice, and the second time, when you "supplied the request for a citation", it was not a satisfactory citation; it was merely a link to a library newsletter's interview with the author, and nothing in the interview supports the claim that "Spiked, advances the discussion and much like the work of Tom Clancy and Michael Crichton is sufficiently technical to provide starting points for policy makers and scientists." -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 23:22, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Thanks for the compliments from Antaeus and Guy implying I'm the author. On what do you base that a self-published book is somehow inferior or that I am the author? There are many of us in our group who enjoyed reading this book. Also there are many good reviews on Amazon,B&amp;N, Borders etc., Yet none of you cite a credible rationale for deletion. Just assumptions. By the way, the "library" you offhandedly refer to is the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Library_Association_00af.html" title="American Library Association">American Library Association</a>. Every one has to start somewhere with Wikipedia and beginners will make errors. Maybe I should return to reading a good book. Malundi 8 March 2006
<ul>
<li>Amazon reviews are not objective and are vulnerable to manipulation (and five of them are anonymous). I did not say you are the author, only that the author seems hell-bent on self-promotion. The credible rationale for deletion is that it is a self-published book. Yes, everyone has to start somewhere - and that somewhere is not Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 00:10, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Neutral</b>, leaning toward delete for now because I'm not sure how to assess the notability of this, but I would like to say that I don't think self-published books are non-notable in principle. I think we should stick with the notability criterion here and not get side-tracked into discussing motives or media. If it's notable, it's notable; if Malundi wants it kept, he should supply evidence of the book's importance, which is what the cleanup tags were asking for in the first place. <b><span style="color: #f33">·<a href="../../../r/o/d/User_talk%7ERodii_6c72.html" title="User talk:Rodii"><span style="color: #669">&#160;rodii&#160;</span></a>·</span></b> 01:07, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It depends. I have five volumes of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Gunther_9e2d.html" title="Robert Gunther">Robert Gunther</a>'s self-published "Early Science in Oxford" which was self-published but is one of the leading authorities on <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Hooke_6579.html" title="Robert Hooke">Robert Hooke</a> and is cited by Margaret 'Espinasse in her biography of Hooke (it's actually 'Espinasse's copy I have). If he was not also the founder and first curator of the Museum of Science at Oxford I still strongly doubt that we would have an article on Robert Gunther on the strength of this book, and we do not have an article on the book at all even though it is cited in other books (see <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Robert+T+Gunther%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Robert+T+Gunther%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[33]</a>). I think a self-published book has a massive hill to climb; any really successful ones are likely to be taken on by a mainstream publisher long before the question of encyclopaedic notability comes about. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 18:32, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>: I think it is more effective to convince Coolcaesar of the growing consensus that the requirements for "notability" be broadened than to create a fork that has tons of red links. In my opinion, notability does not have to be national or statewide, but can also be in a regional or metropolitan sense, as well as being historically notable due to past activity on the site. I am adding some malls in the California section, asserting their notability, in hopes that I can reach a consensus that these malls are indeed notable. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalwatch_8ce9.html" title="User:Calwatch">Calwatch</a> 04:50, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> As a former resident of Malmesbury, I have the unfortunate memories of knowing my father, who was (for a very short time) a member of the Mover organisation, and whenever I mention this to some of my closest friends who reside in Bath - they have no knowledge of this so called 'gang' - even though I do not believe that the Movers were bad people. Therefore, without knowing what my father did, being in as much of the dark as apparently the rest of England, I cannot pass judgement that this is a fake article - which apparently everyone else can do despite having NO knowledge about it. I know it was a prominent gang, and am pleased that it has finally gotten the recognition somewhere, and I hope that eventually the whole truth can be uncovered.

<li><b>Comment</b> I see, so basically when four people decide to have a discussion about why an article shouldn't be deleted - everyone instantly assumes that they are all liers/the same person. That's one hell of a trusting assumption. I guess that you clearly know me personally and all these other people that are posting their disagreement with the articles in question that are up for deletion. So what, I might be a new member! Let it go, I've still got just as much of a voice on this site as anyone, and I still have an opinion. It's unfair to assume that just because we disagree with you, we're lieing. I agree with the person who posted down there, learn about social skills <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.33.68.226 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.33.68.226_c329.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.33.68.226">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>Please <a href="../../../b/e/_/Be_civil.html" title="Be civil">be civil</a>. I apologize for any offence, but you must admit that it's a suspicious coincidence when four different people come onto Wikipedia at almost the same time, only edit articles related to one particular group, and are the only ones on an AfD about that group saying that the article should be kept. I'm not attacking you because you disagree with me. It is not a life-or-death question to me whether or not these articles are kept. <a href="../../../h/b/a/User%7EHbackman_f74f.html" title="User:Hbackman">Hbackman</a> 00:38, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Whether M.O.V.E.R. is deleted or kept, it follows that pages about people who are only notable in that they are M.O.V.E.R. members (such as Don Ray) should be subject to the same decision. Putting them all up on the same AfD simplifies the matter and ensures that the same debate doesn't take place on multiple pages. <a href="../../../h/b/a/User%7EHbackman_f74f.html" title="User:Hbackman">Hbackman</a> 00:38, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
