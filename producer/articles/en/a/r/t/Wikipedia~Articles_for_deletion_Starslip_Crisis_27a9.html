<p>Non-notable, fails WP:WEB and other criteria under WikiProject: Webcomics. Alexa ranking search for "www.starslip.com" yields no traffic data whatsoever even though the site has been up for two years. Furthermore many other comics on the internet have been around for more than two years without attaining notability, let alone Wikipedia's inclusion requirements. The article also includes reference to the Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards, which has been found non-notable by Wikipedia editors. <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalby_5be8.html" title="User:Salby">Salby</a> 06:09, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. This is clearly a notable webcomic as its critical accolades indicate. I could also point out that exact phrase search turns up 101,000 hits on Google - this is a strip that has been much talked about, especially for a strip only a couple years old - and also that this webcomic has published three "real" books to date. Salby has not even searched for the correct url. www.starslip<b>crisis</b>.com has an Alexa rank of 88,460 if you care about Alexa ranks. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 08:20, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

The Starslip Crisis article is full of fancruft.

I'll also point out that a Google search for the phrase, even after excluding wikipedia, comixpedia, wikiquote, lulu, nightsidepress, and starslipcrisis, <i>still</i> gets +92000 hits, with +250 of those being distinct (reviews, blog recommendations, awards, interviews with Straub, etc).

<li><b>Comment</b> Indeed. "We're trying to delete all these other webcomics, so it's okay to delete this one too" is a circular argument. If the deletion status of "related webcomics" is at all pertinent to this discussion, then the fact that Evil Inc. was restored and Ugly Hill is likely on its way to vindication should paint this affair in the opposite manner Incredulous suggests. --<a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsWalky_9fe9.html" title="User:ItsWalky">ItsWalky!</a> 18:08, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The <a href="../../../u/g/l/Ugly_Hill_cdc8.html" title="Ugly Hill">Ugly Hill</a> discussion is loaded of meatpuppetry after the author linked to the AfD, so I wouldn't look to vindication there. As for <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil_Inc._754f.html" title="Evil Inc.">Evil Inc.</a>, there have been several AfDs put forth in good faith, which indicates an issue. In its defense, its author is a newspaper cartoonist and has been published, so there are non-author-generated secondary sources. <a href="../../../l/k/e/User%7ELKeith30_af2f.html" title="User:LKeith30">LKeith30</a> 19:18, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - The Ugly Hill discussion is doing quite well for the comic, both numbers-wise and argument-wise, even after discarding the meatpuppetry. The Evil Inc. article was brought back on DRV with overwhelming support after new, previously unknown sources surfaced. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizor_34ff.html" title="User:Kizor">Kizor</a> 11:40, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - That there have been several AfDs put for for Evil Inc. is not an indication of a problem; it's an indication of taking multiple bites at the apple until one comes up without a worm, and the article is deleted. This is in line with the general vendetta against webcomics around here. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmaynard_f6d3.html" title="User:Jmaynard">Jay Maynard</a> 12:42, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Alexa rankings, convention appearances, etc. aren't particularly useful for writing encyclopedia articles.

Best I can find is a trivial mention in passing on <a href="../../../e/d/i/Editor_and_Publisher_f4e3.html" title="Editor and Publisher">Editor and Publisher</a>'s website (not their print edition) and a three-sentence paragraph in a small local newspaper that begins "To round out my list, I have to include the sci-fi humor strip 'Starslip Crisis' by my friend Kris Straub ..."

<dd><b>Comment</b> Per <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>'s standards for such, the E&amp;P article is not a "trivial" mention of the comic. E&amp;P is also clearly an independent source with non-negligible circulation. I can also find another article, this one in a periodical about webcomics circulated regionally in Canada, in about five minutes of searching.<a href="http://www.boneflake.com/zoinks/index.php?page=2005/october/interview-kristofer_straub" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.boneflake.com/zoinks/index.php?page=2005/october/interview-kristofer_straub" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. And if I can find another article not mentioned in the wiki article under question that quickly, there are probably more non-trivial mentions out there, which is one of the reasons why we rely on secondary indications of notability, e.g., "website has won an award," which Starslip Crisis has. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 20:57, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I assume you're referring to the "Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards" as far as the website winning an award. Those awards were found NN despite even a television appearance and NY Times mention in an article about webcomics. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Web_Cartoonist%27s_Choice_Awards" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Web_Cartoonist%27s_Choice_Awards" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> This article falls way below that. <a href="../../../l/k/e/User%7ELKeith30_af2f.html" title="User:LKeith30">LKeith30</a> 21:30, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree with the claim that the WCCA are not an indication of notability. The WCCA are the most prominent webcomic awards in existence, and thus an indication that a webcomic is notable as a webcomic. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 01:01, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I might agree, but the WCCA article <i>itself</i> was deleted recently for failing to meet WP:N. That's the definition of non-notable (and another argument entirely!). If the article <i>supporting</i> a lesser article is deleted for being NN, how can the supported article use it as proof of notability? <a href="../../../l/k/e/User%7ELKeith30_af2f.html" title="User:LKeith30">LKeith30</a> 01:07, 11 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Three reasons. First, the reasons offered in the AFD for the WCCA being notable (i.e., mention in a New York Times article) are applicable to saying that winning the award is a notable. Second, WP:WEB suggests not that an award be "notable" by Wikipedia standards, but simply states that the award be "independent and well-known." Even if the Oscars were not notable in and of themselves by WP:N, i.e., if no newspapers or other print sources talked about them, the fact that a film had won an Oscar would be still an indication of a film being a notable film, since the Oscars are well-known and the judges are (I like to think, at least) not too closely tied to film producers. The WCCA seem able to qualify as well-known even if this fame does not translate into more than several secondary sources analyzing the WCCA. Third, the AFD for the WCCA appears likely to be appealed in the near future; it was carried against a 7-4 vote on the basis that non-trival mention in the New York Times was not an indication of notability. If it's not put up for deletion review within the next couple days, I'll stick my neck out and do so myself, because that's a <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Web_Cartoonist%27s_Choice_Awards_6058.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards">questionable AFD</a> if I've ever seen one, and I've watched some pretty hotly argued AFDs. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 01:42, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

If those among you are truly interested in getting rid of as many webcomics as possible, why not just go ahead and blanket delete all of them?

<dd><b>Comment</b> Note that the comic changed name from StarSHIFT Crisis and that name should also be checked when researching it. Also I thought Alexa had been discredited as a measure of popularity. Nice accusation of 'Poor Faith' that hasn't even been checked on the subject site, something that would be easy to do. Plus 'incitement against AfD' can be entirely in good faith and need not even be deliberate 'The Wikipedia entry for this comic is up for deletion, I don't understand why' is pretty much a precis of the initial reaction of most artists so far. Then they progress to annoyance when they look at how many other entries are being eliminated, together with one of the principle ways quality etc. is judged within the industry (the WCCA). Not that any artist action is needed at the moment as many Webcomic readers are on the lookout for yet another AfD related to a significant comic.--<a href="../../../b/o/a/User%7EBoatThing_308a.html" title="User:BoatThing">BoatThing</a> 10:34, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b>: <i>Alexa ranking is far below that of PvP, Megatokto, Ctrl-Alt-Del, PA, et centera.</i> So, do you propose that we should delete all articles about webcomics that gather an audience of less than 20,000 readers per day (Starslip crisis gets around 10,000)? This would leave probably some thirty or fewer comics, plus maybe another dozen that would be included because of their historical significance. I do agree with the guidelines stating that every fact should be sourced and referenced correctly. I do agree that the article about Starslip Crisis fails these guidelines. But I don't agree that we should delete articles based on unverifiable claims of non-notability, when there's reasonable argument for the notability. (In fact, if we base our perception of notability on the size of readership, I think the bar should be somewhere around 2,000 to 5,000 daily readers, and less if there are other reasons to believe the comic is culturally significant.) Of course, if sources are requested and the article does not improve in a reasonable timeframe, then it should be deleted. --<a href="../../../t/a/p/User%7ETappel_ab06.html" title="User:Tappel">Tappel</a> 11:27, 14 February 2007 (UTC)
