<p>Some of you familiar with me may think you're catching me in a contradiction here, since I've stated many times that "Criticism of X" articles are not necessarily POV forks. Well, no contradiction at all; such articles, I still say, are not <i>necessarily</i> POV forks. However, this one is one paragraph of text, three quotes, and <i>twenty-three</i> external links, and none of it actually originated in <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megachurch.html" title="Megachurch">Megachurch</a>, so it doesn't represent any sort of consensus process. (Late note: The creator of the page has just put a note on the talk page explaining that the material was moved out of <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willow_Creek_Community_Church_b6f0.html" title="Willow Creek Community Church">Willow Creek Community Church</a>. It still seems to me that it should be treated as a POV fork: the useful parts of it, but <i>only</i> the useful parts, should be merged to the main article.) -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 02:00, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megachurch.html" title="Megachurch">Megachurch</a> and <b>redirect</b>; agree that it also requires heavy editing. Also strongly consider merging and redirecting the article <a href="../../../m/c/c/McChurch_acec.html" title="McChurch">McChurch</a>, which covers similar ground, and does so somewhat better than this'n. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 05:01, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I think we have other channels for dealing with pages needing merges. That said, I would <b>merge</b> per nom.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Unfortunately, all those other channels seem to assume that the most they will have to deal with is the merging of an accidentally created duplicate article, created in good faith and about as NPOV as any other newly-created article. The kinds of people who deliberately create content forks regard this and exploit this as a loophole: Faced with the knowledge that the editors watching <a href="../../../f/o/o/Foobar.html" title="Foobar">Foobar</a> won't accept the partisan arguments they want the article to contain, they create an article with a title like Unanswered questions about Foobar or What critics say about Foobar or the like. They figure they can't lose: if it slips under everybody's radar, that's a great outcome for them (and bad for Wikipedia); if someone spots it and tags it for merging, they put a big smile on their face and say "Merge? Sure, I can do that!" and they edit their POV fork material directly into the main article. If anyone protests that none of that material was accepted by consensus, they go on the attack. "How can you defy the will of the community? The will of the community was clearly 'Merge' and I merged it! You're acting in bad faith, by resisting that!" What we really need is a definitive policy statement that when an article is determined to be a POV fork, the burden of proof must be to prove that any of the material actually <i>deserves</i> to be merged. Until then, there's endless incentive for POV-pushers to create as many POV forks as they can. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 17:14, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Move offsite:</b> Perhaps we might like to host this list of links offsite and provide a link to it in the <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megachurch.html" title="Megachurch">Megachurch</a> article. I'll put it in a blog somewhere if people would like me to, though I don't promise to maintain it particularly well. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBreathingMeat_4b6f.html" title="User:BreathingMeat">BreathingMeat</a> 08:59, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge very selectively and redirect</b> I agree, I created the article, however, none of the content is mine. I didnt know what to do with the content (sorry, I am new to this), since it was messy and mostly just links and quotes, but i knew that is was not NPOV and that it shouldnt be on the <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willow_Creek_Community_Church_b6f0.html" title="Willow Creek Community Church">Willow Creek Community Church</a> page. I did take the relevent links and put them on the <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willow_Creek_Community_Church_b6f0.html" title="Willow Creek Community Church">Willow Creek Community Church</a> page and so there is no need to merge anymore with the <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willow_Creek_Community_Church_b6f0.html" title="Willow Creek Community Church">Willow Creek Community Church</a> page, however, it might do some good to selectively merge this with <a href="../../../m/c/c/McChurch_acec.html" title="McChurch">McChurch</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megachurch.html" title="Megachurch">Megachurch</a>. thanks, --<a href="../../../m/s/h/User%7EMshuflin_e20b.html" title="User:Mshuflin">Mshuflin</a> 15:03, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>read the talk pages</b> if you read the talk pages <a href="../../../w/i/l/Talk%7EWillow_Creek_Community_Church_bccc.html" title="Talk:Willow Creek Community Church">Talk:Willow Creek Community Church</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/i/Talk%7ECriticisms_of_Mega_Churches_2c2c.html" title="Talk:Criticisms of Mega Churches">Talk:Criticisms of Mega Churches</a> you will see that this was created as a solution to some informal mediation and the user <a href="../../../f/i/d/User%7EFides_Viva_4357.html" title="User:Fides Viva">Fides Viva</a> is the person who created the content and wanted the content there. I tried deleting it but I didnt want to get into an edit war so this was our solution. I created the page not to make a POV fork or be a "POV-pusher," but rather to make a legitimate place for the criticisms. That is why it should probably be merged into <a href="../../../m/c/c/McChurch_acec.html" title="McChurch">McChurch</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megachurch.html" title="Megachurch">Megachurch</a>. --<a href="../../../m/s/h/User%7EMshuflin_e20b.html" title="User:Mshuflin">Mshuflin</a> 17:55, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> anything worthwhile here back into <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megachurch.html" title="Megachurch">Megachurch</a>, and then leave as a redirect.

<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megachurch.html" title="Megachurch">Megachurch</a> and <b>redirect</b> as discussed above. Criticism could fit in with Megachurch article.
