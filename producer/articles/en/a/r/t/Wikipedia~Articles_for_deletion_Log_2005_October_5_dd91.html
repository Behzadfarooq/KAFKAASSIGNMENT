<li><b>Delete</b> a) the definition is flat out wrong - Decennium:Ten Years::Annual:One Year - but the noun form of annual (think flowers). b) Wiki is not a dictionary --<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECastAStone_9a4a.html" title="User:CastAStone">CastAStone</a> 00:35, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Transwiki</b> to Wiktionary. Yes the word is used, but it's rare. As CastAStone said, the definition also needs work (though I would have equated annual with decennial rather than decennium). <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 00:42, 5 October 2005 (UTC) (getting fed up with edit conflicts)</i></small></font>
<ul>
<li>Annual (adjective) also works for decennial, when it is being used to describe something. Decennium or annual (noun) is when it <i>is</i> something, such as the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyterian_Youth_Connection_9de9.html" title="Presbyterian Youth Connection">Presbyterian Youth Triennium</a>. It has virtually no practical use in modern English. But then again, I'm not an English scholar... --<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECastAStone_9a4a.html" title="User:CastAStone">CastAStone</a> 01:20, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yeah - you must have added that bit about the "noun form only" during one of our two edit conflicts!&#160;:) <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a></i></small></font></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Transwiki</b>. In Merriam-Webster on-line. It and Oxford are my standards and I have heard the word. I'm having a hard time understanding Cast's comment: if your implication is it is an incidental or unused noun so it shouldn't be sent to Wikitionary I definitely disagree. People use dictionaries for the obscure not the obvious. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 01:41, 5 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It was more an explanation of why the definition of the word is so hard to flush out. I agree that the word needs to be in Wiktionary. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECastAStone_9a4a.html" title="User:CastAStone">CastAStone</a> 02:20, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was to <b>delete</b> the copyvio. In order to save the article a /temp version was created, and moved to <a href="../../../a/p/e/Apeejay_School_%28Sheikh_Sarai%2C_New_Delhi%29_1a19.html" title="Apeejay School (Sheikh Sarai, New Delhi)">Apeejay School (Sheikh Sarai, New Delhi)</a>, that article is <b>kept</b> due to no consensus. I am not sure if there are any more schools with this name in India (I'm rather inclined to think that there are), and if this is so a disambig should probably be placed at <a href="../../../a/p/e/Apeejay_Public_School_3585.html" title="Apeejay Public School">Apeejay Public School</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>: As per the request of <a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a>, I have moved the rewritten article to <a href="../../../a/p/e/Apeejay_School_%28Sheikh_Sarai%2C_New_Delhi%29_1a19.html" title="Apeejay School (Sheikh Sarai, New Delhi)">Apeejay School (Sheikh Sarai, New Delhi)</a>. What impact does this discussion hold on an article written on a temp page which has now been forwarded to somewhere else? Are we discussing the copyvio, the potential creation of a disambiguation page, or the new article at <a href="../../../a/p/e/Apeejay_School_%28Sheikh_Sarai%2C_New_Delhi%29_1a19.html" title="Apeejay School (Sheikh Sarai, New Delhi)">Apeejay School (Sheikh Sarai, New Delhi)</a>? <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_a49f.html" title="User:Silensor">Silensor</a> 22:24, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>It's an awsome podcast and those interested should be given a way to gather information on it so they can know more about it. Keep it, please think of the children!-Katong Katong</p>
<p>I say that given the amount of people affected by it, and the absence of anything else with this title, it should be kept. It's sure to be editied more in the future.--John</p>
<p>There are other podcasts on the Wikipedia, and The Widgets rating broke the top 100 on iTunes a few weeks ago. I say keep it. -Shawn</p>
<p>Thats right, they were #46. TWiT has an entry, and there are no conflicting entries for this. Let them have it. - Ken</p>
<p>I am not involved with The Widget, I am not trying to promote the show or any of the people in it, I am merely telling people that want to know about The Widget. The Widget is a podcast that brings it's material to a broad range of listeners and thrives off telling the news of Technology in a way that is somewhat different that the convential.--Scoopula 01:04, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>for the pure fact that the widget is quite well known, i think it should stay. It's meaningless, but so it the game and petals aroudn the rose. Slimy earthworm 19:00, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Why would you delete it? Its not doing anything bad to anyone, and its just a nice thing so some people can have their fun! I mean, there are over 1000 listeners, so it has a big enough fan base. Whats wrong with keeping it? BTW, I am not involved with the creation of The Widget etc, I am just a fan who has listened to every episode and thinks it is one of the best Podcasts out there! BTW, I was mentioned at the end of Episode 6, the email about why a Pirate would own a Ninja.&#160;:-) Dshban 8:29pm, 10th October 2005 (Eastern Australia Standard Time, whatever that is)</p>

<p>The Widget Show is a great addition to the ever growing podcast nation. Tim Ryan and Zane are great to listen to and have lots if usefull information mixed with good comedy. I have tried to listen to many other podcasts dealing with tech and similar topics and the widget is one of the best out today. Keep this podcast up and running and tell your friends and others to tune in. Go and check out the show instead of complaining about it's entry. LordStandley // 2005</p>
<p>This needs to be kept to help expand our knowledge of what else is out there in the world around us. You may hear a reference to the widget as you pass by two people having a conversation about the show and by using this wonderful site you can look it up to see what they are talking about. Twit has one...why not The Widget Show?--eventHorizon 12:06, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Please see www.myspace.com/eitheroregon for web results and verification as to the existence of this band. As it is now October, the time frame of 'mid to late 2005' is still applicable, referring most specifically to the months of August and September.</p>
<p>Just because an article is about something new doesn't mean it should be ignored or removed! While this band has yet to exceed your wp:music criteria, shouldn't there be some time given to allow them to carve out their own notability before outright rejecting them from Wikipedia? As the article states, they are merely a few months old at best. Is newness an automatic prejudice of worthlessness?</p>
<p>Should not Wikipedia contain articles which document the emergence of an event, pheonomena, cultural idea, or, in this case, a group of musicians attempting to cut through a slew of cheap commercializm to create -- not for itself but for its principles, aesthetic and ideals -- an element of notibility in a field which, at its heart, shares nothing with the instances of corporatized vagary which meet your wp: music standards?</p>
<p>-- posted and edited by the anonymous creator of the article, who did not know at the time that registering his email address with Wikipedia would automatically elevate him to a higher class, but is nevertheless attempting to break through that ceiling by reputably and honorably posting his thoughts regarding the deletion of said article."</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The Myspace web site reveals almost nothing about the band except that they have one concert scheduled in their hometown next month. The band has all the time it needs to carve out its own notability and then have an article about them accepted into Wikipedia, whether they need one month, one year, or ten years to meet the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criteria -- the article can be created at that time once there is evidence they are notable; they are not being rejected permanently, just for now since they are not notable yet. A musical artist can qualify under the WP:MUSIC criteria without necessarily succumbing to commercialism. Finally, comments such as "Either Oregon is a musical group that originated in Portland sometime in mid to late 2005, though <i>the exact date and location is a much debated topic in some intellectual circles. The exact lineup is unknown</i> ...." (emphasis added) may be intended to create an aura of mystery, but they mostly make it look like the group is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a> and that the writer of the article doesn't know much about the topic. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 06:34, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sorry dude, Wikipedia is a reference for things already notable, and while plenty of people agree with your arguement, more people do not. We go over this with pretty much every band on the site. <b>Delete</b> until they become notable, at which point I would hope they aren't too bitter to recreate their page. --<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECastAStone_9a4a.html" title="User:CastAStone">CastAStone</a> 06:44, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, In Wikipedia, notability means 'name recognition'. Wikipedia is not necessarily a good or accurate reflection of the real world. It just presents what history recorded and what the elites (in the sociology sense) want us to think. If you can find his name in a journal of medicine (google doesn't search academic journals) or something then he might stand a chance. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMaclean25_1193.html" title="User:Maclean25">maclean25</a> 01:25, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Images of castles. I once had a picture of a castle in my mind but no other information. I was able to use this page to find it, identify the name, and go to the page for more information. It worked out really well and without this page I would have had a hard time finding the name. Think of the pictoral listing as a <i><u>visual index</u></i> which has a great deal power in terms of locating the appropriate wikipedia page when the name is not known. Also, I do not see the lack of text in the article as a problem since the raw list of images serves the purpose very well. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarders_da66.html" title="User:Carders">Hilmar</a> 17:54, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I contributed several of the photos of castles and would have no regrets if this were moved to Commons. Provided the licenses are appropriate, Commons is the best place for collections like these, and has an article, <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Castle" class="extiw" title="commons:Castle">commons:Castle</a>, that is very similar. <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castle.html" title="Castle">Castle</a> already links to it. <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 05:07, 6 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Commons is a Wikimedia project, just as Wikipedia is, and Wikimedia has identified Commons as the place to put photos and galleries. WP can link to Commons and Commons can link to WP. Additionally, Commons can have captions in multiple languages.

<li><b>Comment</b>; One issue in moving/adding images to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_castles.html" title="List of castles">List of castles</a> is page load time. If someone has slow Internet access they will not want all those images embedded with the list of names so there is some utility in maintaining two separate pages.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, the commons cannot deal with things that are 'fair use' (not applicable here, but applicable in some cases) so it isn't an end all and be all.

<li>Since, as you said, 'fair use' is not an issue in this case, I wonder what advantage this Wikipedia article has over <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Castle" class="extiw" title="commons:Castle">commons:Castle</a>, which has more photos in one article than this one does.

<li>Eventually a caption under each image can be produced, such as the general architecture, location, age etc. Wikicommons is a dump of GFDL files, it provides <i>no</i> organized context or interpretation. Useful, but I think not a replacement for a list or gallery article such at these. As addition, I do not see the harm in having an article like this on *Wikipedia* even though one maybe on Wikicommons, Wikipedia is not paper.

<dd><b>Weak delete</b> (or make redirect to relevant album article). I'm still unsure about this; the Music WikiProject guidelines rule it out, I think, and the pop-music business is so vast that articles on singles could overwhelm Wikipedia if there were no limits); I'm still of the opinion that a number-one position on some major chart should be the normal minimum requirement (possibly overridden by other facts in special circumstances) – reaching number three doesn't strike me as making a single "a notable hit" – and I certainly think that the fact that a singer is notable doesn't make everything she does worthy of an article.

<li>Capitalistroadster asked me to have a look at the new article, and it's a pretty solid keep now. The problem here is that this album has four lengthy (perhaps overly lengthy, but then I hate WH so I'm no judge) articles on individual songs and a bare stub of an article on the album which gives no trace of the significance and popularity of this album. In principle I think that people should work on the album and break out articles from there instead of starting with the song, and had I found this stub I would have merged it into the album article myself. Song stubs are just clutter; centralized information at the album level is more useful for the reader, but I guess its easier just to toss out a stub on a song and forget all about it. With that said, I can't ignore Capitalistroadster's work on the article and no doubt the article will be kept, as it should be, but I'm still voting merge as an impotent protest against song stubs. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 06:44, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> (<i>Cross-posted from <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECapitalistroadster_c71c.html" title="User talk:Capitalistroadster">User talk:Capitalistroadster</a></i>) It is a vastly improved article now. But my merge vote wasn't due to the article's quality, it was because of the guidelines at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. Now that the article is a bit more informative, I get that this is the single that launched Houston's career. Maybe that's, um, "notable" enough to deserve its own article. If one takes a look at <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitney_Houston_%28album%29_a0bb.html" title="Whitney Houston (album)">Whitney Houston (album)</a>, though, it's just this enormously long article of tables. There's no text in it whatsoever. That suggests to me that if one pushes all of the informative text into articles on singles, what's left is album articles that look like that. I think that the guidelines at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> make sense, but I am not at all opposed to discussing them, and, especially, trying to establish some clearer consensus about what singles deserve articles. Right now we have a situation in which people are ignoring the guidelines and making articles on singles, compilation albums, and even individual album track recordings. This may suggest that consensus about what deserves an article has changed since those guidelines were written. I think that discussion needs to happen, but not at AfD, nor by individuals creating articles on singles that are good enough that it would be a shame to delete them. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 16:01, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

Also, I have seen some deletion debates which have been branded "band vanity" by the nominator, and then wound up being kept simply because the original author (usually a newbie) didn't know that it's a good idea to list all the releases, jot down their awards, etc. Yes, such pages which wind up on AFD are a bit time consuming, but if it means we save some articles which, after some investigation, definitely should not be deleted, I think it's worth it. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 06:22, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. it's not nova or aeon, it's &lt;8 non-employees. the work-for-board payment method makes it less than regular for a school. it seems to lack lots of the superlative compliments and excessive insertion of contact details that normally permeate an ad posing as an article, which makes me wonder if maybe it wasnt submitted in good on the grounds that the visa-less system makes it unique (ive actually heard of the schoo before and associate it with that). <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENateji77_10a2.html" title="User:Nateji77">Nateji77</a> 14:51, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>SOME educated systems designate these kind of schools, but most schools in the US are required to have gifted programs of one kind and the other kind comes and goes.

<p>We don't need articles to explain that a compound word "<i>A B</i>" means "A <i>B</i> that is an <i>A</i>".

<p><b>Evan Greenspoon, Round Two</b> This article has been recreated, still non-notably; a request to have it speedied was declined, so I'm reposting it here. The film "Milk" gets no Google hits when combined with Greenspoon's name, nor does the Ogden-Nash film festival. Unverifiable, non-notable. I'd still suggest <b>speedy</b> but at the very least <b>delete</b>. --<a href="../../../d/v/y/User%7EDvyost_72a4.html" title="User:Dvyost">Dvyost</a> 17:35, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I originaly rejected this as a speedy - the article states that he's the co-editor of a magazine and stared in a film. Those claims may well be bogus, or notabilty may not be established by them, but can someone explain to me how that is <i>not</i> an <i>assertion</i> of notability per <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>? --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 18:36, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I guess I'd argue that without any explanation of why this magazine or film is notable, there's still no explanation of notability; many of us have worked on small college publications or starred in a friend's film for a local film festival, and that's really not notability. Still, since I suspect you know the guidelines better than me, I've followed your advice and am perfectly happy to wait it out here.

<p>As the author of the article, I thought I should step up to the plate on this. The term <i>is</i> a neologism and in very small usage, but it still exists. It was coined in order to discuss a certain genre of fiction during classes in English at <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memorial_University_of_Newfoundland_c17b.html" title="Memorial University of Newfoundland">Memorial University of Newfoundland</a>. I'm not sure if being in very small circulation is included in the criteria for deletion. There is no substitute word to describe the particular genre. It's not just a rewording of steam/cyberpunk and is more closely related to post-apocalyptic fiction, but isn't that either.</p>
<p>What may lead the article to deletion is the fact that it is simply a definition, and for this I apologise. I was intending on adding an exploration of the history of sandpunk, as well as a list of properties and stories that fall under term, but thought I'd start with a simple definition and see how people took it, particularly in discussion on the somewhat related <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steampunk.html" title="Steampunk">steampunk</a> entry. Whether the article should be expanded upon or moved to wiktionary, I don't know. --Spectre general 23:27, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Sutton is notable for several reasons. It appears he was taken advantage of by drug traffickers due to his mental impairment. It's always remarkable when a person is arrested for trafficking drugs but has no drugs in their possession at the time of arrest. This nomination for deletion is coming from some people who are trying to bully and harass Cluse and Gibbons into using a particular foreign prisoner advocacy service, that being Foreign Prisoner Support Service. This is the same outfit which has been spamming their URL (<a href="http://foreignprisoners.com" class="external free" title="http://foreignprisoners.com" rel="nofollow">http://foreignprisoners.com</a>) all over the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Australians_in_international_prisons_ef2f.html" title="List of Australians in international prisons">List of Australians in international prisons</a> entry. It should also be noted that the person posting defamatory material about Kate Gibbons, while using the pseudonym "Robert Frost," and who claims to be from a UK based prisoner advocacy organisation, is posting from 144.131.198.139 (see <a href="http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/whois.ch?ip=144.131.198.139" class="external free" title="http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/whois.ch?ip=144.131.198.139" rel="nofollow">http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/whois.ch?ip=144.131.198.139</a>). This IP is in a block assigned to Telstra in Brisbane, Australia, which unremarkably is the location of Kay Danes &amp; Tony Fox of FPSS. FPSS are a fully unethical mob who will do anything to smear and defame prisoners and their families. The mere fact that anyone is trying to have this article pulled off of Wikipedia on any basis other than the facts related to Sutton's case should tell you that there's very good cause to keep it. --Diana Elgar 00:11, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do not delete</b> - state run internet police should not be allowed to censor free societies media. There is nothing wrong with the posting it is accurate and informative.

It is deserving of its placement not because of its demand but because of its relevancy, no different than the copy of "The Coming Plague by Laurie Garrett" has a place in the public library though it has only been signed out once. It is precisely this kind of self promotion that makes WIKI so powerful. Detailed essays criticizing the book can be posted and linked. Thus creating a much more informative reading choice than you would get by simply browsing to Amazon or even the public Library. Again large state run internet police organizations, posing as students, should not be allowed to censor or even make suggestions as to what is or is not appropriate material for WIKI. <small>(<i>preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment by</i> Gmeek (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gmeek_c5a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gmeek">contribs</a>) )</small></li>

<p>Article about a substitute teacher. Would be nn-bio, but it claims he is the CEO of a major company, JL Enterprises.

<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../o/d/y/Odyssey.html" title="Odyssey">Odyssey</a>, where this text does not currently exist.

<li>I removed it from the Odyssey because it was added by the same user, but I only noticed that later. Here's an example of the first person text: "Alcinous’ treatment of Odysseus, who is concealed as a beggar, reminded <b>me</b> of an example of a modern attitude: ‘No Angels’ by Robert Swindells." Here's another one: "The combination of the Odyssey and ‘No Angels’ gives <b>me</b> this message: Overcome fear, give as much hospitality as possible to single strangers..." I don't think this content should be merged into the Odyssey article. It's not very high quality and it is out of place in the current Odyssey article. Only short summaries of the books are given. If this is put in, there will be a large entry for book 7 that talks about customs. If this text is saved at all, it should stay as a separate article.

<li><b>Comment</b>: The content is currently innapropriate for the <a href="../../../o/d/y/Odyssey.html" title="Odyssey">Odyssey</a> article, as that article only gives short summaries of the books and this would go into book 7 because it is specifically about book 7.

The other books are discussed in short paragraphs. If you think there should be a separate section on hospitality, that's okay, but then the content would need to be rewritten to include the other books and to remove the first person writing.

<li><b>Delete</b> - Take the time to read it properly, and it's evident the text is nearly worthless as analysis, and as a result the few points that might be salvageable (eg references to usage of xenos/xenia) would need independent verification and are worth little on their own anyway, so I see no point in keeping this.<a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> 18:38, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Okay, I'd have to admit that 'Pura vida' in English is mostly only used by those who have visited Costa Rica, or want to. But if that's not sufficient for it's own page, I still think it should still be mentioned in the culture section or one of the related pages. (With or without the history).

<p>As for the article being non-notable, the parallel between the European Affairs article and this one are tenous at best. This is an article about a figure, not a region. Your extreme bias is clouding your judgment, as the two reasons you just thought up to back up your bias do not hold up to further inspection. You go to Harvey Mudd, which is a good school. Could you not think of anything better to try to push your obvious agenda?</p>
<p>I could quite easily get all of the Irish and allied nations to come on here, but it's a violation of the spirit of Wikipedia policy, and don't want to be as clearly personally involved and biased as you. Celtic1</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is silly. You're claiming Goobergunch is biased, when you created an article about how you feel your friend got screwed by some moderators in an online game? And then you spit 'biased' in his face cause he disagrees with you, and seems to understand the spirit of Wikipedia policy. I like how you made the threat, and then, later, after Goobergunch mentioned that such mass spammage of voting was against Wikipedia policy, you claimed basically that would be the 'bigger man' and not do something you had already threatened to do.

I can <i>also</i> read this AfD and see that you have twisted the truth abominably ("twisted the truth" is in fact shading the facts in your favor; I'm really more inclined to use the word "lie".) You claimed, falsely, that Goobergunch "stated he would bring in sockpuppets". The truth, of course, is that you said <i>you</i> could "get 50 or so people to come in here and explain how this article is fine for wikipedia"; Goobergunch pointed out that this was neither an ethical tactic nor a practical one, since even if sockpuppets/meatpuppets of the kind you threatened were taken seriously, he could simply do the same as you were threatening just as effectively. For you to publicly lie and claim that a) Goobergunch threatened to "bring in sockpuppets", and that b) you are entitled to declare anyone you disagree with as one of those sockpuppets based on their "tone", is shameless effrontery.

<p><s>Your "vote" was deleted as it shouldn't be here. Goober asked you to come here, and it's not fair and very anti-Wiki.</s></p>
<p>I've emailed Goober directly, and hopefully this will be sorted out. I ask those interested in helping balance the article. It plainly should not be deleted, and Wikipedia should not be a battleground like NSwiki was! This is a silly debate, and those voting for deletion have not even made valid points! Comments like "clearly vanity" don't really cut it. Anyhow, I agree it is biased, as it's cut and paste from that site ES had -- just help fix it. Definitely an interesting human interest story, like many other similiar wikipedia entries not put up for deletion by someone with a history with the person.</p>
<p>Hopefully Goobergunch will help contribute to the article, and not just attempt to delete it. It will be a sad day for Wikipedia if this is deleted. Celtic1</p>
<p>UPdate: Email to Goobergunch bounced back, here is full text.</p>
<p>Hi Goober,</p>
<p>Hope Freshman year is going well, for me it was a great time!&#160;:)</p>
<p>I am Celtic1, and have played NS for just over two years. I've been in and a few other regions, and am one of the people that sticks up for ES. Why? He was a good leader for many of us when we first came to ireland, and we're loyal to him. I don't know what history you two have, but I also see what happened on the NSwiki.</p>
<p>Wanted to discuss what is going on in Wikipedia. It seems like the same fight has broken out there, and before it escalated to the NSwiki type of argument, I wanted to write to you directly.</p>
<p>There is no doubt in my mind that that article should stand, but I agree with you that it needs to be edited. I'd like you to help me edit it so there is more balance. It is an interesting story and there are loads of articles that are human interest like this on wikipedia. I was lazy in cutting and pasting from the es/pf site, so it will have to be changed.</p>
<p>As a more experience wikipedian, I'd like you to guide me a bit with this. I don't think this deletion battle will be good for anyone, just a waste of everyones time and it will be as silly as the nswiki episode. It's a zero sum game, and I ask for your patient, expert help in this matter.</p>
<p>We definitely got off on the wrong foot there, but it's important that we not inject personal feelings into wikipedia, as it's such an amazing tool.</p>
<p>Look forward to your reply, and hopefully help with the article. Best, Renny</p>
<p>P.S. How can a page that states, "to his detractors he's a delusional lunatic that spouts nonsense" be considered a "vanity" page???&#160;:)</p>

<p>The vote is now 7 to keep, 5 to delete. Still looks like it is staying. Celtic1</p>
<ul>
<li>"The vote is now 7 to keep, 5 to delete." Right. Glad counting is one of your strong suits. Okay, as a member of the NS IRC channel, let me make clear what did occur. Goober mentioned that another article about NS was up for deletion on Wikipedia proper, at no point mentioning (to my knowledge) that he was the one who placed it there. Links were demanded from him. I know that I personally read the article in question, the debate, and the referenced Wikipedia policy articles before casting my vote. Now, assuming the support Goober <i>did not request</i> counted as sockpuppets (which as far as I can tell, it would not, based on my understanding of Wikipedia policy, since he didn't ask for it), you could eliminate, by my count, six of the 14 deletion votes. As for keep votes, I don't actually see the word "keep" in <b>bold</b> in anywhere in this discussion. Based off reading the discussion itself, I'll give you two votes. Which makes it 8 (14) to 2 for deletion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, based on an unscientific straw poll of the NS IRC channel (~45 people at any given time), only 1 (other than the moderators that had dealt with the situation and the NSWiki Moderators) had actually heard of Eire Shamrock before. Most of those people have been playing nationstates for nearly two years, I myself for over two and a half, and a good percentage of those people have played since the very beginning of the game in November/December 2002. I think that's a good reason to fail at notability, even if anyone <i>outside</i> NS cared. It means that other than the people directly involved, it affected no one. Even more, verifiablity is a joke, based off the definition Wiki uses. The only way to verify this would be through <i>original</i> research, which eliminates "encyclopedic" as well.. It is not published anywhere by a reputable publisher. And yeah, the vanity thing too. Now, I've already voted so don't count this as another vote if my IP is different. And wow, what a nice personal attack on Sirithil while I was writing this. --129.59.26.71 19:46, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> There is no point to this article other than to satisfy the ego of ES's creator, who is not nearly as important to the game of NationStates as he seems to think himself (as stated previously in much more succinct terms).

Nor should Wiki be used as a tool for 'sticking it to the man' when one has been rightfully denied in other more appropriate venues.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: They are (or were) apparently somewhat popular in Norway. For what it's worth, the <a href="http://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbolt" class="external text" title="http://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbolt" rel="nofollow">article</a> on the Norwegian wiki has more detail. I'm not sure that that article is worth much, either, though. I cleaned up this one a little, but I would not be sad to see it go. Maybe if there were some sign that they are still active; their <a href="http://www.massacre-records.com/bands/bands.asp?bands=THUNDERBOLT" class="external text" title="http://www.massacre-records.com/bands/bands.asp?bands=THUNDERBOLT" rel="nofollow">label</a> only shows one record and doesn't suggest that we should expect anything more. —<span class="horsepunchkid"><a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHorsePunchKid_a248.html" title="User:HorsePunchKid"><span style="font-family: monospace; font-variant: small-caps;">HorsePunchKid</span></a>→<a href="../../../h/o/r/User_talk%7EHorsePunchKid_fa6d.html" title="User talk:HorsePunchKid"><span style="color: #070;">龜</span></a></span> 02:47, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<b>Comment</b>: Although the norwegian wiki article is poor (its even mainly a rip of from a festival presentation from 2004), the english version has now been made proper (the initial entry was abrupted, hence not finished) and as an entry comment I would like to point out that Thunderbolt actually achieve the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> by the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>2: International tour / gigs (they comply to both)</li>
<li>3: Two albums on 'major' labels (the second album is finished and even printed, but shipment/release was postponed by the label due to marketing reasons... however, to my knowledge it will be released within few weeks from now)</li>
<li>(4: Even if 'prominently' can be discussed, they're one of the very few metal bands besides <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satyricon.html" title="Satyricon">Satyricon</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/m/Dimmu_Borgir_e22e.html" title="Dimmu Borgir">Dimmu Borgir</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/g/Pagan%27s_Mind_606a.html" title="Pagan's Mind">Pagan's Mind</a> that are frequently mentioned in the mainstream press in addtion to the music press)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a mathematically notable integer that has unique and special properties, as shown in the article. When squared, the number produces the following number: "12345678987654321" which is all of the integers (except 0) in ascending and descending order. Mathematically speaking, this is a totally unique occurrance in the <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinite_set.html" title="Infinite set">infinite</a> <a href="../../../s/e/t/Set.html" title="Set">set</a> of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Integer.html" title="Integer">integers</a>.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 02:40, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I guess you mean digits, not integers. Yes, it is a unique occurrance, but not a particularly interesting one. We could find something unique about every integer. <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> 09:57, 6 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If you can find three different mathematically interesting and seemingly unrelated properties of the number, then <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Numbers_793f.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Numbers">Wikipedia:WikiProject Numbers</a> can endorse this article. Being the square root of a pandigital number is a base-dependent property, and as such, it is not that interesting mathematically. <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrimeFan_087d.html" title="User:PrimeFan">PrimeFan</a> 17:33, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
