Credit to Mr Goma for making the best of a bad situation he found himself in, but I don't think it makes him notable enough for an entry here - certainly not according to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. In a few days time he will be (probably gratefully) extremely anonymous again. The error the BBC made might deserve a sentence in their article, but I'm not even sure about that. Also, the transcript is probably copyrighted. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 21:47, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>If he is notable, it's for this event only. Nothing else at all is even said about him other than that he comes from the Congo, so the article is much more about the event than the person. It would be more appropriately titled BBC wrong interviewee event, 8 May 2006, which in my opinion would be much more obviously too trivial for an article. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 09:54, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>: I have my doubts that he is notable enough for an encyclopedia, and perhaps this was better off on Wikinews only, but then again this is a news event that was reported by many news agencies worlwide. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappynoodleboy_f08d.html" title="User:Happynoodleboy">Tim</a> 10:36, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This has had enormous news coverage in the UK and worldwide. I'm really puzzled by the assertion that it might not even merit a mention in the BBC's article - "major news network interviews the wrong guy entirely live on air" isn't a story that is going to be forgotten, in my view. Whilst it probably would be more appropriate to put it at BBC News 24 wrong interviewee event or some such, his <i>name</i> has been widely reported and it's likely people looking for the article will search for it - <i>I</i> did. So in conclusion, I say more Guy Goma, <a href="../../../m/o/r/More_cowbell.html" title="More cowbell">less cowbell</a>. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattley_a310.html" title="User:Mattley">Mattley</a> <a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMattley_ace2.html" title="User talk:Mattley"><sup>(Chattley)</sup></a> 10:41, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. No doubt Mr Goma will fade from public view in the next few weeks but the incident, and what happened immediately afterwards will cotinue to resonate. I've read a number of articles in newpsapers/websites this week which have detailed people who had a brush with fame and have faded away, no doubt Mr Goma will be resurrected some time in the future. <a href="../../../y/o/r/User%7EYorkshiresky_ee54.html" title="User:Yorkshiresky">Yorkshiresky</a> 10:46 20 May 2006 (UTC)

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This unusual and well documented incident has become a part of history and this man will likely remain in the memory of BBC viewers for a long time to come. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 11:41, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Could you expand on how he his notable? As it is, the article actually says nothing at all about <i>him</i>, other than that he comes from the Congo. This seems to imply he's not notable, except in the context of this incident, which would imply that he, himself, does not warrant an article. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 12:19, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Is it really necessary to add the afdanons template to this afd, and then "mark" every editor with only a few edits behind them? That isn't usual practice, and this afd discussion doesn't seem any different than normal (I don't see it flooded with anon users who have come from a user board). The votes are mature and well-worded on both sides. -- <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisterHand_55c4.html" title="User:MisterHand">MisterHand</a> 12:38, 20 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I was just concerned at the large number of votes from people with very few other edits - as of now 1/3 of the people who've posted here have less than 100 votes, which seems very high. Are you sure noting which voters have few edits is not normal practice? I've seen it done many times before. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 22:32, 20 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not unheard of, but its usually only done in cases where there appears to be an attempt "ballot stuffing" (typically, a lot of anon users coming <i>en masse</i> and voting one particular way). On this particular afd, I don't see any unusual activity to warrant usage of the template (in my opinion). -- <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisterHand_55c4.html" title="User:MisterHand">MisterHand</a> 23:42, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

I'm sure Mr Coma isn't notable (and I'd not heard his real name until today; previous reports I'd read said he was a cabbie), but the mixup is certainly worthy of reporting. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 13:01, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. This was a very notable event, as the BBC is not known to committ such a grave mistake, being the reputable organization it is seen as.

<li>It is not a personal attack, it just seems that this being listed for deletion is ridiculously overzealous considering the amount of information on Wikipedia about other topics that I'm sure have relevance to even less people than Guy Goma's.

<li><b>Keep</b> I searched for this on Wikipedia, and I was pleased to see the article was already here. If it was not, I would have requested it!
