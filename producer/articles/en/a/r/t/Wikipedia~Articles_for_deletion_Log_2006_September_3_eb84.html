<li><b>Delete</b> Wow, so many things wrong with this: <i>"He is founder and owner of G-Starz Records,"</i> his record label. Translation: self-published, or he will be when/if he actually releases something. The record label's website is the default page for the webhost; he hasn't put any content there. Google has never heard of the label. The other external link admits it has nothing to do with him; it's for an unrelated clothing chain called G-Star RAW. He claims to have earned two Thatcham Awards for his EP, which is a good trick, considering that <a href="http://www.thatcham.org/pressroom/events_v.jsp?event=6" class="external text" title="http://www.thatcham.org/pressroom/events_v.jsp?event=6" rel="nofollow">the Thatcham Awards</a> are the British Insurance Car Security Awards (in case you're interested, Audi is the overall winner this year). But my favorite part of the article is: <i>"G-Star works full-time at Blockbuster DVD to earn his crust."</i> I wish him luck. Maybe he'll actually release a CD, and people will buy it, and he can get out from behind the counter, but right now he's nowhere close to <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. -- <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 00:21, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>weak keep</b>. Barnett probably has some name recognition as co-anchor of the morning news (not prime-time evening news) for the second station in Philly, which is apparently the 4th market in the US. According to the kyw bio, she has won one award which could warrant a closer look of keeping her article (<a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> does say "multiple" however). I do not subscribe to the view that every journalist who has ever appeared on TV news to be sufficiently notable for a wiki article, and <a href="../../../k/y/w/Category%7EKYW-TV_7f7d.html" title="Category:KYW-TV">the category</a> appears to contain more than its fair share of non-notables (at least two county level reporters and a number of fill-in reporters with close to no name recognition and no awards). Susan Barnett seems to be quite a common name. "Susan Barnett" + journalist scores 146 unique out of 231 Ghits, other than the 2 wiki articles, geneology sites, the hits were mainly for other Susan Barnetts; many involved a 1992 case (before the subject graduated from Delaware University) between Food Lion and ABC, another who was Miss Pennsylvania 1996; another was/is assistant psychology prof at NW State U.<a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 03:02, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I wasn't doubting good faith on your part, just assuming good faith on the part the editor that created it. I assumed you were nominating on the grounds of non-notability, but since you didn't say, I was covering my bases in case you were claiming it was a hoax. Assuming everything that a nominator of an article says is true isn't a good way to go about discussing an AFD in my opinion. And, yes, I can read Danish, but you can turn up info on the existence and history of other of the characters without having to. <a href="http://www.pikle.demon.co.uk/diaryjunction/data/munk.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pikle.demon.co.uk/diaryjunction/data/munk.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 14:19, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. We tend to think of pirates as notable because they do so well at the box-office and get women with huge busts. But sadly, this is over-romanticized. These people steal, they do so with impunity, and they still exist--and there's nothing glamorous about floating off of the coast of Somalia and terrorizing the fleets which pass by. I have no reason to doubt the sources, either, and assume good faith--however, I think I can pretty safely assume that in this instance, there's not sufficient notability, even apart from the sourcing issue, and the google hits points to that, but isn't dispositive.-<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> 02:42, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> The listed articles may prove he existed, but I can point to reliable sources to prove <i>I</i> exist as well. The question is, is this particular pirate notable?

<li><b>Keep —</b> Difficult one this. This is the sort of information you expect to see in an encyclopedia but not as a separate article ( as being hanged as a pirate is hardly an endorsement of importance) - fortunately wikipedia has the space to have these separated or together. If 4 sources that can still be found 400 years after his death then he's more notable than many of the other pirates of the time. The article is better referenced than many pirate articles we have. Tag for importance and come back in a few months. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeripitus_dfdd.html" title="User:Peripitus">Peripitus</a> <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPeripitus_05d5.html" title="User talk:Peripitus">(Talk)</a> 12:49, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b> or <b>merge</b> with Jørgen Daae and make an article for him. Whether he was a merchant or a pirate doesn't seem that relevant. Either way he was not-notable. If for example his execution had provoked an international incident he might be notable. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 14:07, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Wikipedia can afford to include people who were notable in their own times but aren't currently the hottest items in the blogosphere. The name of the admiral is more commonly written Jørgen Daa (which also gets more hits). Whenever that article has been created, a merge may be contemplated, but that is no reason to delete a sourced article now. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+l+and</a> 17:41, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Not really, or not directly, at least. One is a historical/genealogical discussion board, the other a private webpage. But the first claims that Mendoses/Mendoza was actually a "Belgian" (Flemish, I suppose) called Mandaus, and gives reference to a report by Daa in a source called <i>Norske Riksregistranter</i>, which appears at least partly to be printed. The other is about the arctic explorer Jens Munk and is probably based on the type of printed sources already in the article here. Searching for Mendoses in Google books gets <a href="http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=mendoses&amp;btnG=Search&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wp" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=mendoses&amp;btnG=Search&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wp" rel="nofollow">three hits</a>, one of which is <i>Danish Arctic Expeditions, 1605 to 1620: In Two Books</i> (by several authors).

<li><b>Comment</b> For the book with <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 975-95659-1-9</a>, the Author is Sadan Bezeyis (<b>with</b> Ahmet Koksal, which is a very different thing).

<li>It's not generally tied to specific <i>localities</i>, as such; it has more to do with the fact that there's no standardized version of the longer variant (either in what it includes or in the order of the letters).

The ancient Egyptian use of the beetle as a symbol is certainly worth an article, but that article should have an English language title.

<p>A mod for call of duty. The article claims this used to be a popular mod, and I do not claim to know the truth of that, but the statement is unsourced. What I do know is that the homepage has an Alexa ranking in the two millions, the mod itself gets very few hits (the over 40,000 hits one gets for "call of duty" AND "heat of battle is misleading because that phrase is commonly used to describe the core game, only the first 30 or so hits deal with the mod, and nearly all of these are just download mirrors), and the article itself reads like advertsing. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 20:41, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Hello, I am the second contributor to this article. I contributed what I thought was a lot of objective, informatiive, factual information to an article that already existed before I added to it. It was very vague, and I tried to expand on it. All of the links I added were from/to companies and articles directly related to the industrial "surplus business". I am in fact employed by Radwell International, so I want to be very honest here. I added one line mentioning Radwell, and would gladly strip it out since I now see that the spam policy is understandibly very rigid. Addionally, I can add more content about other examples -- commercial and consumer venues -- relating to the topic since I have done a lot of research on the surplus topic, work in the field and have quite a bit of knowlege that readers can learn from. If there are no votes to let the article stand, then the jury has spoken and all is fair. Thanks for reading my explanation. I am a new user, and I would be glad to elaborate further if you'd like. -<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_Radwell_47eb.html" title="User:Brian Radwell">Brian Radwell</a> 2:25, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Looking into the history of this page I see that the post from "Brian Radwell" 11:30, 8 Sept 2006, was added by 12.107.75.162. After looking at the edits from that ip I see that at the same time he is "thanking" us for deleting his spam he has been adding it back anonymously to some of the same articles he defaced in the first place.

<li>Actually, they do. The article is wrong. She is not most famous for being Ellison's wife; she's famous (to a certain segment of readers) for her books. I suspect this article was written by a computer type, unlikely to be familiar with the genre at all. Scrolling through the google results with "Larry Ellison" excluded (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100l&amp;q=+%22Melanie+Craft%22+-%22larry+ellison%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=100l&amp;q=+%22Melanie+Craft%22+-%22larry+ellison%22" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>) finds a lot ofreferences to her books.

<li>Well that's because that particular search excluded any hits with the words "Larry Ellison". There are thousands of hits that include his name, but as you can see tons that don't.

<li><b>Comment</b>September 20th, 2006 - I am the creator of www.beerdiegame.com and I can assure you that it is a legit site. Some people may play it differently than others but it's all basicly the same. I learned it at Ball State University from a friend in ZBT. His brothers brought the game back from out east in the early 90's. Originally played on a door that had been ripped off frame. From there we/it evolved into what it is today. Minor changes to the game to only make it better and more competitive, like adding the net with the fringe so you can see if the die goes under the net. Circles on each corner among other rules.
<ul>
<li>I tried to use that logic last time, but got shot down by people who insisted one non-mirror ref was good enough. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 14:55, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>43 Man Squamish is, as the article notes right off the bat, notable because it was invented by <i>MAD</i> magazine as a joke, but so great was the popularity and influence of the magazine that students at a number of colleges formed teams to try and play it.
<p>I can't believe I'm the inclusionist here.

<dd>In and of themselves, no. But eliminate 25% of the ghits for this and you've still got well over 70,000. We've kept articles with far less than that as a measure of sheer notability. I believe that in this case the ghits are a proxy for whether people actually play this game. We've got multiple non-mirror sites discussing and delineating rules for this. To address a point that's come up in other drinking-game AFDs, there are places to go if someone challenges where a particular rule came from other than Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 04:39, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>No, but that is beside the point. They are contestants, exactly like these people are. There is absolutely nothing about reality television that is inherently notable. It is simply another genre of entertainment. And the point is, simply appearing as a contestant on a popular television show does not make one worthy of an article. Nobody outside of their families cared about any of these contestants a week after they lost, and nobody will remember them a year after. They are not notable. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 21:03, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Nonsense. Very few, if any (outside of <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Jennings_ed15.html" title="Ken Jennings">Ken Jennings</a>) are able to spin one of two time appearances into careers, unlike many reality contestents. Furthermore, game shows do not have the same sort of long-term cultural cache for its contestents that reality shows clearly have. Reality television <i>is</i> inherently notable. The amount of discussion, newsworthiness, and attention these shows get proves it quite easily. Perhaps when the day-to-day happenings on "Wheel of Fortune" get the sort of attention "Survivor" does, it'll be worth a discussion. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 21:13, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You are correct that the <b>shows</b> are notable, which is why the show itself is not up for deletion. As for turning an appearance on a reality show into a carreer, that may make such an invididual notable depending on what carreer and how far they get. There is no indication that any single individual on this list has done so, however.</li>
<li>Really, the only thing you have shown is that other people who have done other things have become notable after appearing on a television show.

<p>AUTHOR'S NOTE: Uh...did you ask anyone in the Cincinnati underground? Probably not, because if you did, you would not be using the word "dubious," you'd be using the word "obvious." Sorry about the discography, my bad, I fixed it. Also, I resent the idea that this article is a hoax. Just because these guys choose to show some individuality in a world of meaningless Top 40 homogenized crap in which "music" has about as much flavor for the ears as extruded cardboard has for the mouth, doesn't mean they're frauds.

<li>Lifnen is absolutely right. Electric Head's music is inventive to the point that it is difficult to really pin a genre on them. This means that it is difficult for them to find record companies that are willing to take risks on them. They're self-released stuff has been nothing short of amazing, and I fully believe that a few years down the road, they will be hailed among the saviors of rock music.

<li><i>And you can tell this band is using the wikipedia to greater the benefit the world of the internet user.</i> And therein lies the problem.

<dd>Canon, like what? Religious canon? It's trooper armor for clones, clones who do not exist, and armor which does not exist. Does their armor that doesn't exist, and a detailed examination of that non-existence, convey any content to the non-existent clones, or the very-existent drones obsessed with this fancruft? If they have <a href="../../../p/h/a/Phase_II_clone_trooper_armor_3f98.html" title="Phase II clone trooper armor">Phase II clone trooper armor</a> (which is next up, by the way), does that protect them from more non-existent things?

<li>It would appear that a large number of the google search results are cursory mentions of her as a relative of Anton LaVey, though I will grant that there are a number that appear to be specific mentions of her. However, a google search for a college professor of mine got over 2,000,000 hits and the top 50 results which I browsed are almost all mentions of her specifically, but she hardly qualifies as a notable person by Wiki standards. So I can admit that there is public documentation on Karla LaVey, but whether this constitutes anything significant enough to merit an encyclopedic entry is another matter. I also feel like her organization is perhaps not of any realistic significance except as a minor footnote of the CoS, but I do not feel like I should discuss that for POV reasons. I am acting in good faith here, there are plenty of articles about people I do not like or agree with that I nevertheless think merit an article, but Karla is not one of them. -<a href="../../../l/v/t/User%7ELvthn13_0eaf.html" title="User:Lvthn13">Lvthn13</a> 01:22, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As for my own neutrality, I have written and contributed to Wikipedia articles for some time, and in that time I've been involved in disagreements, all of which were satisfactorily resolved by mutual understanding and discussion. I have never shown resistance to making appropriate concessions nor have I showed bias by consistently removing "unfavorable" comments when they are properly sourced, and I certainly have not endeavored to remove the name of any notable figure where relevant. My actions here are in good faith, and I am not nominating a well-written full length article for deletion, I am nominating an article with minimal content about a person of questionable notability. The best way to resolve this is clearly by having this discussion now, which is why I have brought this nomination. -<a href="../../../l/v/t/User%7ELvthn13_0eaf.html" title="User:Lvthn13">Lvthn13</a> 02:39, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

Being vaguely mentioned as a relative to a famous person again does not make you validly famous yourself, nor does a few television appearances (I've done television interviews, but I don't need a Wikipedia page).

You bring up articles that are not related and most of your comments here have included an ad hominem attack on me. This does not prove anything about Karla LaVey or her article and is a red herring. You're not making it crystal clear that Karla is notable because you're not providing sources or solid evidence that she meets the Wikipedia standards of notability, you only insist that she is. If this were such an obvious issue of good faith, why would the vote presently be split as to whether this article should remain? Were it so obvious that this article belongs I should not imagine this would be the case. Further, the very discussion you have linked to indicates, again, that you are a personal acquaintance of Karla LaVey. In all good faith, I should think that if you know her so well it should be an easy matter to provide ample real evidence that she is notable rather than merely saying so. I suggest that attempting to shoot down this nomination through me rather than refute it legitimately is a negative tactic. -<a href="../../../l/v/t/User%7ELvthn13_0eaf.html" title="User:Lvthn13">Lvthn13</a> 05:24, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> The image from Fox News does not provide proof that Karla LaVey is a notable figure. For example, I've been interviewed by BBC, but I'm not notable. Also, see this <a href="http://afpf.sfproductions.net/uploads/Express2006/tim%20on%20fox%20news.jpg" class="external free" title="http://afpf.sfproductions.net/uploads/Express2006/tim%20on%20fox%20news.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://afpf.sfproductions.net/uploads/Express2006/tim%20on%20fox%20news.jpg</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Why do I bring up this link? Because the person in question is clearly visible on Fox News, is credited as president of an organization, and has web results that mention him, but probably none of us know who the fellow is and he doesn't have a Wikipedia article as a result. Just getting on the news doesn't make you notable.</p>
<p>Further evidence should be apparent in the fact that this very debate hasn't exactly generated a storm of interest. Were Karla LaVey an especially notable person, you'd think her page would generate enough traffic and be on enough watchlists that more people would be chiming in one way or another. Very few have, especially for the "head of a religious organization" of supposed notability, a topic you'd think would arouse considerable interest in her followers. I reiterate, Karla LaVey is a footnote to the life of Anton LaVey.</p>
<p>Also, the image of Karla LaVey does not contain a copyright tag. It must contain said tag to remain on Wikipedia. -<a href="../../../l/v/t/User%7ELvthn13_0eaf.html" title="User:Lvthn13">Lvthn13</a> 08:14, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's ridiculous. Look, the search didn't pick up any substantial results for <a href="../../../p/i/z/Pizza_Corner_f45f.html" title="Pizza Corner">Pizza Corner</a> as the one in Nova Scotia--the North Dakota one actually did better in term of google. Of course, we know that's not dispositive, but this is just not notable apart from this. An intersection has to actually be a landmark, or notable as a neighborhood, like <a href="../../../d/u/p/Dupont_Circle_0b4a.html" title="Dupont Circle">Dupont Circle</a>. The link you gave me shows the lack of notability--even <i>they</i> refer to it as "so-called pizza corner"--it's disingenous to call that "recognition", at least as qualifies on a global level. Look, it's just a corner in a city. That's not a notable. If it were a neighborhood, or an actual landmark, it'd be a different thing. In fact, your document states that the area is becoming an "eyesore", which argues strongly against your contention that it's a "landmark", as few intersections are--it could conceivably still be a notable neighborhood, but there's no evidence of that in any of the google searches, not on the page you gave me, really nowhere. I'd suggest you look at the Wikipedia notability guidelines, and reconsider your opinion.-<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> 22:29, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

There's no neighborhood called "pizza corner", but it <i>is</i> universally used as a reference point for other things in town. People would not say "it's in Pizza Corner" (unless it's actually on there), but would just as much say "it's near Pizza Corner".

<dd>Your definition of a landmark as that by which all other places are differentiated, like "It's near Pizza Corner", is not the proper definition of a landmark--it hasn't been designated as such, as a landmark, by anyone. When it does, you can recreate the article. Until then, there's not a scrap of information that gives this notability. It falls short on the roads criterion, falls short on the intersection notability criterion, and it's not a landmark, on its face. Reference points are not meant for wikipedia, either--should the "third stop sign after Mitchell St." be on Wikipedia? Also, on the RfC, address your comments to the item in question, Pizza Corner, and not on me--it's entirely irrelevant.-<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> 03:07, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Good technical argument here: the reference is <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basin.html" title="Basin">basin</a>, and we can't be expected to know if that's figurative or literal, but that it probably, most likely, refers to a basin, or topographical feature. None of the other links in the article do that. So I think we'd be fine with just "Baklunish", and not the basin--we don't really need fictional topographical features on Wikipedia, do we? I would err on the side of delete, because these gaming things really get out of control--let's at least try to set a limit on topography. Is there precedent as to that?-<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> 08:19, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Please note that there is already a <a href="../../../b/a/k/Baklunish.html" title="Baklunish">Baklunish</a> article (which is even linked in this acticle--perhaps you should read the entire thing before calling for deletion?), which refers to the Baklunish people &amp; culture. Wikipedia is chock-full of fictional topography. I don't see how this is different, so long as such fictional items can't be mistaken for real things. As for "gaming things really get out of control"--please explain what you mean. I was not aware that gaming articles violated Wikipedia policies any more than other types of articles. Then again, if your statement was simply meant to show a bias against gaming, then you should probably do as the above poster suggested, and "refer clearly to a <a href="../../../w/p/_/WP_84ae.html" title="WP">WP</a> policy."--<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobbstrd_a943.html" title="User:Robbstrd">Robbstrd</a> 16:42, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. No wikipedia policy has been cited here as an argument for deletion. There are many articles on fictional geography on Wikipedia (numbering in the hundreds, certainly).

<li><b>Keep</b>. There is an active community of Wikipedians working on these World of Greyhawk references, and this article will continue to grow.

<li><b>Delete</b> as a seemingly non-existant road. Current consensus on Wikipedia clearly maintains that any highwya that an American state has bothered to number as part of its state highway system is worthy of inclusion, but I'm not convinced that this road actually exists. There is a Route 309 that connects the cities mentioned in the article, but aparently no 309A.

<dd>This road is now County Road 308B (as shown on a 1997 DeLorme atlas; I may also have a photo of the signage on southbound US 17); it was State Road 308B until the mass decommissioning of the 1980s. I have an FDOT Putnam County map that says it was renumbered in 1971, and a 1965 Rand McNally atlas that shows it as 309A. So it is verifiable.</dd>

The issue is whether or not these articles should be included as part of Wikipedia based on actual notability and use of these things, despite the author being the creator of the concepts. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 06:57, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Point taken. The naming is similar to other articles in Wiki. The concept actually mainly refers to a decentralized software model. Whether it's notable, I'm not the expert, but being a software developer, the concept is intriguing. - reader <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 206.186.238.190 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_206.186.238.190_0990.html" title="Special:Contributions/206.186.238.190">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>The intriguing or naming is also not the issue either.

<li>That's a interesting term. I'm not interested in enforcing anything, but the definition of vanispamcruftisement is highly subjective. I, we, thought that wikipedia was an all encompassing encyclopedia of all things, big or small to big or small groups. I agree, ownership should be removed, but notibity is also subjective. You do what you see fit, but I'd change the name to have it suit the concept better and leave it for the public to decide. I can't help mention that Open Space Technology started on a similar foot as a concept and is still considered unimportant on wikipedia, but it's there and I can say it's in practice where I work.206.186.238.190 07:28, 26 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is an all encompassing encyclopedia, but there are issues that concern the notability, etc. of this/these computer system(s), particularly due to the fact that the original author created the program(s) in the first place. I realize that it is subjective, but when an author publishes his own work to Wikipedia, he has more to gain from that than anything else. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryūlóng</a> 07:30, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I really don't want this disputed any further. Just delete the article. I don't understand why it is such an issue to publish a concept by the author or creator of that concept who of course would know it best, and I mean any concept by anyone. Anyone can dispute ownership, but I really don't care who claims ownership over this. It's a concept, not a product, to freely share amongst the public and wikipedia looked like a good medium for it. Again, just delete it, both Federated Model and Decentralized Model, which I agree should have been named Decentralized Software Model, though I still think Federated Model is as notible as <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federated_school.html" title="Federated school">Federated school</a> which is really a type of federation, but I'm not disputing a thing at this point.

<li>"Wishy-washy word choices in industry shouldn't be in the encyclopedia"&#160;?? OK, lets look at this for a sec. Encyclopedias are full of "Wishy-washy" industry words that are NOW considered non-"Wishy-washy". For example the <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ether.html" title="Ether">Ether</a>. What is the definition of "Wishy-washy" anyway and where does it say they can't be in an encyclopedia. Talk about irrational!!64.231.64.244 05:04, 7 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The desire to redirect a rambling article about a model of a system to a concise article about the system itself seems utterly rational. I am certain that a sentence like: <i>"Decentralized systems do not lose control of it’s internal processes, functionality or data, they communicate with external systems, decide whether to use external data or functionality and vise-versa."</i> was <i>never</i> used to describe ether. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlying_Jazz_a2b8.html" title="User:Flying Jazz">Flying Jazz</a> 04:56, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> because a <a href="../../../s/y/s/System.html" title="System">system</a> is not a <a href="../../../m/o/d/Model.html" title="Model">model</a>. <i>Definition: A physical model is used in various contexts to mean a physical representation of some thing. That thing may be a single item or object (for example, a bolt) or a large system (for example, the Solar System).</i> In this case, the Decentralized Model or Federated Model refer to the physical enbodiment of decentrlized or federated <i>things</i> of which a system is a <i>thing</i> comprised of smaller <i>things</i>. We don't have to define the <i>what</i> of a Decentralized Model to merit validity to the context(s) of the <i>decentralized physical representation of some thing</i>.64.231.64.244 04:50, 7 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The word "system" is sufficiently broad to encompass all "things" which a decentralized model could model. We <i>could</i> have an encyclopedia with one article for every notable concept or object in existence and a seperate article for a model of every notable concept or object in existence, but I think most people would find an encyclopedia like that to be rather silly. Another layer of modeling is also possible. One could create an article for a "Model of a Decentralized Model." Why not? Models also exist in the real world. When I was a kid I had a model of the human heart. Before building the model, I created a model of the model on paper. Should Wikipedia have a "Heart Model Model" article? Or just an article on the heart? <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlying_Jazz_a2b8.html" title="User:Flying Jazz">Flying Jazz</a> 04:56, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The fact that this discussion has been going on for this long validates the reasoning to <b>keep</b> the article. It appears to me that no one has thoroughly verified the sources to this definition and the fact that a good portion of this encyclopedia is thinking that a <i>system</i> is a <i>model</i> in this case re-enforces the rationality in favour of this document though it's examples refer to systems directly, it is the context in which the system(s) is/are being referred to that matters. Let me remind you that it is NOT the definition that is relevant here, but the need for the subject and it's context of meaning to exist on Wikipedia so to develop the world's most comprehensive encyclopedia of world knowledge. The definition of what is non-encyclopedic is highly subjective and I strongly insist that the determination of what warrants representation in Wikipedia be <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientifically.html" title="Scientifically">scientifically</a> rationalized. 64.231.64.244 05:25, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>, nn, the closest thing is his rectorate, and that's far off. The comparisons about Pokemon get annoying with respect to historical articles--just because it happened a long time ago, or a person lived a long time ago, does not mean notability.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> as a relevant article to Wikipedia's coverage of Horatio Nelson. The content in the article would be out of place if included in the main (FA status) Horatio article, however it works in the context as a wiki-link. Of course Edmund's notability is tied into his son and all serious collections about Horatio Nelson includes references to his father. The <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Maritime_Museum_f01d.html" title="National Maritime Museum">National Maritime Museum</a> even includes a portrait <i>(referenced in article)</i> of Edmund done by the notable English painter <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Beechy_e870.html" title="William Beechy">William Beechy</a> in their Horatio Nelson collection. I think the fact that a very prominent museum deems that there is value in including this portrait in connection with their work on Horatio Nelson is very pertinent. As a "paperless" Encyclopedia who obviously does not have the <i>space or financial</i> limitations that a Museum would have, doesn't it seems foolish to have higher standards then the National Maritime Museum for content inclusion? <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 18:53, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If you are asking me, all those episode articles would be a redirect to Memory Alpha or the Stargate wiki.&#160;:) But, this AfD is not about <b>all</b> TV episode articles, it is about the ones listed above. In the context of this AfD, this is a current TV show which has not established its encyclopedic notability yet and as such, the episode detail information is not warranted. See also Samaster1991's comment below about another way to include this information without individual articles, but allows for future growth.&#160;—&#160;<a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDolomite_0b0c.html" title="User:MrDolomite">MrDolomite</a> | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDolomite_8f87.html" title="User talk:MrDolomite">Talk</a> 13:36, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

In fact, the first google result using the above search terms is an article from Kotaku about the game. I fail to see how that was "difficult". As for showing promise, the purpose of Wikipedia is not to opine about the quality of independant games. The author, Gavan Woolery, has been working on the project for approximately two years, longer than many Linux distros which also have established Wikipedia pages. -Dorin</p>
<p>I suggest, as an alternative to total deletion, renaming it to "Genesis (Online World)" as that does lead to the main site.--<a href="../../../n/0/0/User%7EN00body_ff90.html" title="User:N00body">n00b</a> 21:44, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would give this project some time before claiming that it "doesnt show promise". As soon as its homepage becomes a 404, then you can feel free to take down the wiki. As for it being noteable, how about this for starters: The engine is produced entirely by one person (unheard of for a MMORPG of this quality) The game is the first MMORPG to stray far from the norm, with dynamic content and story building The game is the first MMORPG to eliminate opponent AI...every person is player controlled The game is the first MMORPG to allow permanent death and reproduction The game is the first MMORPG to feature an open-content system with community contributions And much more...</p>

<p>The result was <b>DELETE</b>. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 23:43, 14 September 2006 (UTC) The raw comment total was 4-2 Delete prior to the final four Keep votes. All four of these are at least somewhat suspect, and one of them is that editor's only edit so far. Suspicion of puppetry, one point against. One of the Keep commentor's argument included the notion "If it's taken down, I'll just re-post the article in full." Two points against. So let's leave it at 67% Delete for a raw total. Now to the arguments. The arguments are simple: for Delete, that it fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. For Keep, <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBill_Oaf_699c.html" title="User:Bill Oaf">Bill Oaf</a>'s assertion that, as an expert in the area, he finds it to be especially notable. He may be right. However, I think that a disinterested neutral Fair Witness would find that indeed the site achieves no critera listed in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, if I read that page aright. Against that, the assertion of one editor. Again, he <i>may</i> be right, but we <i>know</i> that the fails-<a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> argument is right. And FWIW Delete has the numbers, if we discount the last four votes.

<dd><b>Strong keep</b> - I've made about 600 edits to Wikipedia on MLS topics, and this is a well-known site - the strongest, largest, and most important independent (that is, non-BigSoccer) site out there for a professional American club.

<li><b>Keep</b> from Hexlub. User:Hexlub: I rely on this source for information on the New York Red Bulls as well as Major League Soccer. A site with independent views based on fact by fans, for fans. CNNSI.com has used Metrofanatic.com as a source for their online content. If it's good enough as a reference for Time Warner I feel it's good enough for an article on Wikipedia.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> from LordGhoti User:LordGhoti: This is the best fan site of an MLS team I have come across and a highly detailed repository of team news (new and old) and the overall history of the team and league. It has been the first source to break a story about the MetroStars/New York Red Bulls on more than a few occasions and has been cited by other larger news sources (e.g. cnnsi.com). This site and its creators have meant a lot to the development of an MLS fanbase and I am confused as to why anyone would want to delete this article from wikipedia.</li>

<li>As Josland's scientific work was published in the 1950s, the Google test isn't very useful. 'Josland &amp; Salmonella' and various other possibilities come up with more hits, including a page with war poetry (<a href="http://www.iwvpa.net/joslandsw/index.php" class="external free" title="http://www.iwvpa.net/joslandsw/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.iwvpa.net/joslandsw/index.php</a>). Chief Bacteriologist at the National Health Institute, Department of Health, Wellington appears to be a claim of notability; perhaps NZ editors can assess how valid. Medline comes up with six papers on NZ Salmonella spp for SW Josland in 1950s, and I've also found multiple distinct veterinary papers on Google that aren't in the Medline listing. Google Ingenta records suggest some evidence of citation, though I don't have access to Ingenta to check. I'd tentatively suggest <b>keep</b> to avoid bias against older research; certainly the author should be given rather more time to come up with notability claims and refs. <a href="../../../e/s/p/User%7EEspresso_Addict_7f98.html" title="User:Espresso Addict">Espresso Addict</a> 02:23, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Possible claim of notability, I suppose. It depends on how high up "Chief Bacteriologist" is, but on the surface of this article, I don't see it. If he indeed published a significant number of papers, I'm willing to revise my vote when they're added to the article. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> <sup><small><small><a href="../../../l/t/p/User_talk%7ELtPowers_d522.html" title="User talk:LtPowers">T</a></small></small></sup> 14:46, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> This is not a recreation of any article.

This is a clearly defined list that cannot be met by a category, which can never include the many malls for which there are no articles. While a portion of this article is a list, the essential portion of the article is a thoroughly researched and documented article with appropriate sources and references.

<li><b>Comment</b> Please address the subject of notability. The article goes directly to the significance and <b>NOTABILITY</b> of the Shopping Mall in New Jersey, above and beyond that of those in any other state or a generic article about shopping malls. This article explicitly demonstrates far more notability for its topic not only than most lists, but than most articles. Perhaps the term <b>List</b> is throwing people off, but that does not excuse the failure to address the content of the article by any of the delete votes or by the nominator.

</ul>
<ul>
<li>HFC134 and HFC134a are not the same thing, just one of the errors on the article. The page is titled "HFC134", HFC134 is not used as an airsoft propellant, is not the same as HFC134a. The only entry on this page should be the list of chemical properties of the compound, such as on the HFC134a page. The reason I nominated for deletion rather than editing is because there is nothing of worth to edit:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"HFC134 (aka HFC134a) is the weaker of two commonly used propellants used in Airsoft gas guns."</dd>
<dd>HFC134 is not the same as HFC134a. HFC134 is not used as a propellant in airsoft guns.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"The other, HFC22, is considerably more powerful. A particularly confusing aspect of this is that both are known as "Green Gas", though HFC22 is more commonly know by that name."</dd>
<dd>HFC22 is not one of the two common propellants. The two common propellants are HFC134a and Green Gas (Propane). HFC22 is not called Green Gas, it is called Red Gas, and is not one of the two common propellants.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Many beginning airsofters confuse the two types of gasses, and use HFC22 gas in a gun meant for HFC134. The rule of thumb is if your gun has a metal slide, you can use HFC22. Typically, Taiwanese GBB airsoft guns (such as KWC and KJW) use HFC22, while the Japanese (Tokyo Marui, Western Arms) use HFC134. Using HFC22 in an airsoft gun meant for HFC134 will significantly lower its lifespan."</dd>
<dd>This could refer to HFC22 and HFC134a but is far more likely to refer to Green Gas (propane) instead of HFC22, as Green Gas is more common. Also should read KSC not KWC.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Other gasses that can be used in airsoft guns are Carbon Dioxide or Black Gas (CO2) and Red Gas, however, these gasses are more powerful than Green Gas or HFC134a and may cause damage to your gun. Do not use them unless your gun is meant to take the pressure."</dd>
<dd>Carbon dioxide is rarely referred to as Black Gas. Red Gas as mentioned before is HFC22, not another propellant. Though Red Gas should not be used in certain guns as recommended, the recommendation not to use carbon dioxide is bizarre.

<li><b>Definately Keep</b> It's a central springboard for all the various districts, the history and details of which are also present on Wikipedia. This is a fairly sizeable and notable religious domination, as are Methodist, Presbyterian, Baptist, etc. It is by no means vanity, nor are the sub-articles, as it is listed as one of the top 20 major religious groups by population (800,000) on Wikipedia's <a href="../../../m/a/j/Major_religious_groups.html" title="Major religious groups">Major religious groups</a> entry. Getting rid of this would require getting rid of the entries for most of those, as well, yet all are very notable religious groups.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Mugaliens brings up some real good points. It doesn't help the deletionist's case that he/she/xe uses unclear terminology like "listcruft," which I have no understanding of. Sub articles are stubs, to be expanded upon. They're noted as such, with UU stub templates. I made all these, and this page. They're all valid articles; it's not their own fault that they haven't been expanded upon yet. <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHellaNorCal_013f.html" title="User:HellaNorCal">HellaNorCal</a> 03:47, 5 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment 1</b> Instead of he/she/xe just use <i>User</i>. Without the image (which is all the same), and the template, the district articles are just one-liners containing an external link. I do not see information above <i>spelling the long form of an abbreviation</i>. In this case, it is not a dictionary definition, but a webdirectory entry. And wikipedia is not a website directory. Hope this is more clear.

<li><b>Speedy delete</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The user who created this article (barefact) is commiting original reasearch as he did here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Scytho-Iranian_theory" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Scytho-Iranian_theory" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>. He already has also tried his hand in <a href="../../../o/s/s/Ossetic.html" title="Ossetic">ossetic</a> where he went against all scholarly sources and flatly claimed Ossetic is non-Iranic. Now he is trying to claim Turkic origin for Massagate's using unverifiable quotes and sources and folk etymology.</p>
<p>In this article he is cut &amp; pasting materials from his site [www.turkicworld.org] which is a site full of Original Research and non-encyclopedia materials.</p>
<p>First and most improtant reason for deletion is that there is already an article about Massagetes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massagetes" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massagetes" rel="nofollow">[25]</a></p>
<p>Secondly again faulty folk etymology trying to connecti meshketian to Massagate is not shown by any scholarly sources.</p>
<p>Thirdly the author names a lot of ancient historians but does not provide the actual references, publications, publication date, pg number, edition and etc.</p>
<p>Fourth he even claims <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chorasmian.html" title="Chorasmian">chorasmian</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/c/Tocharians.html" title="Tocharians">tocharians</a> as Turkic people, which they were not!</p>
<p>Fifth the Massagetes are not related to Turks, Meshketian Turks, Huns and etc. I will just list several academic sources here on Scythians:</p>
<p>“… Scythians and Sarmatians were of Iranian origin” [John Channon &amp; Robert Hudson, Penguin Historical Atlas of Russia, 1995, p.18] , “…Indo-European in appearance and spoke an Iranian tongue which bought them more closely to the Medes and Persians” [Tim Newark, Barbarians, 1998, London: Concord Publications Company, p.6], “The Sarmatians…spoke an Iranian language similar to that of the Scythians and closely related to Persian” [Brzezinski, R., &amp; Mielczarek, M. (2002), The Sarmatians: 600 BC- AD 450. Oxford, United Kingdom: Osprey Publishing Men at Arms Series, p.3]. ,“…of Indo-European stock belonging to…the Iranian group, often called the Scythian group of peoples…they were akin to the ancient Medes, Parthians and Persians. Their language was related to that of the Avesta…” [Tadesuz Sulimirski, The Sarmatians, London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1970, p.22]. "</p>

<p>Unfortunately the originator of this article has not contributed anything to wikipedia except claiming Turkic origin for dozens of ancient people that are not considered Turkic by standard references and reliable scholars. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 09:12, 3 September 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhosrow_II_3629.html" title="User:Khosrow II">Khosrow II</a> 14:47, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong and Speedy Delete</b>- This is another one of Barefacts POV and OR articles from his website, which claims absurd things. As per Ali, I vote delete. Barefact does not even show his sources at all. He has attempted historical revisionism before with Ossetians and Scythians, and has failed.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Okay another suggestion could be to merge everything to the talk page (and not the actual page) of the Massagetae article and then work through the quotes and sentences one by one and once they are verified, then move it into the Massagetae page. But there is no way an original research article should be just inserted into the Massagetae page that contradicts the Massagetae page. --<a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAli_doostzadeh_552c.html" title="User:Ali doostzadeh">alidoostzadeh</a> 18:42, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yep, could work too. But why bloat the talk page with it? Isn't in the history behind the redirect a "safer" place to hide the B**t? Plus, we are left with the question of whether the redirect as such wouldn't be useful on its own merits. How common is the term "Masguts" as a synonym of "Massagetae"? If there's any likelihood that people might actually search for it, then a redirect would be in order in any case. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 21:05, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Well, a lot of the article has citations of primary sources, which in fact are perfectly verifiable (e.g. "[Herodotus 4.11]" easily resolves to: <a href="http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%97%CF%81%CF%8C%CE%B4%CE%BF%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%82_%CE%94%27#11" class="external autonumber" title="http://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%97%CF%81%CF%8C%CE%B4%CE%BF%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%82_%CE%94%27#11" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>.) The problem is not so much with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> than with <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> (and general issues of relevance of detail). If we could find out what the secondary source was that the article author has worked from, then an editor using careful judgment could well find interesting material in the article to be merged with the real one. Therefore: don't delete, preserve in history. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 17:26, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: The problem is that the word Masgut is not used in herodotus. The author is trying to attempt folk etymology going from Massagetae to Masgut (which is not found in any google book) to Meshkat Turks. Or check this one out from the article: <i>At around 950 Al Masudi (died in 956) describes 4 Turkic peoples: Ydjni, Badjkurt (Maskurts, Masguts, Massagetae Scythians), Badjanak (Besenyos, Russ. Pecheneg), Nukardi.</i> Doing away with the terrible grammer (which is throughout the article), the author goes from Badjkurt to Maskurts to Masguts to Massagetae Scythians, all to claim some sort of Turkish affinity! Masudi is an Arabic source and I have it available, yet the author does not give the source. Or check out this invalud quote: <i>In antiquity in the Central Asia the Sako-Massagets were closely connected with the Tochars, who in the 5th-7th cc. AD are known as Türkic nations among the Türkic[citation needed] Ephtalites[citation needed] and other Türks. M.Kashgari lists the Togars (Tochars) as Türks. [citation needed]</i> There is no source for thist, but the tochars or <a href="../../../t/o/c/Tocharians.html" title="Tocharians">tocharians</a> are indo-european and not Turkic. Furthermore the word Togar (if such a word exists in Kashgari) is not necessarily related to takharians (Tocharians). Please take a look at the standard article [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massagetae" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massagetae" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>]. In it there are sources verified by major scholars in the field. In this article there is not one major recent university scholar mentioned and the author feels like he can just make up theories. Also note google books never uses the term Masgut and this is probably the authors attempt to connection them to meshketian turks and so he goes from Massagetae to Masgut to Mashkut to Meshkat..

<dd>Reply: Don't worry, I absolutely agree the article as a whole is a mess.&#160;:-) I'm only advocating leaving it in the history as a quarry for those bits that <i>might</i> turn out to be useful for <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massagetae.html" title="Massagetae">Massagetae</a>.

<li><b>Strong delete</b> As it stands, this does contain a lot of original research. If it is not to do so, it needs to be cleaned up by including references, as currently the article is full of "citation needed" with little or no real references (compare to main article <a href="../../../r/e/a/Real_estate_bubble.html" title="Real estate bubble">Real estate bubble</a> which includes many). The tone is also too much in an essay/OR style ("that raises the question...") It could also be argued that the article is very crystal ballish, as a bubble is as much defined by the "pop" as the growth beforehand, so a bubble can only be confirmed in hindsight. The article may be salavageable, if good references are found to say "sources A+B thinks it's a bubble because of reason X,Y and Z", although caution must be applied, as introducing new analysis that are not in the sources would be original research. This article currently contains quite a lot of this type of OR, for example, one of the references is the daft report saying that the yield is ~3%. The yield figure is cited information, yes, but implying that it a bearish argument is OR, as no such implication to that effect was contained in the source. If OR like this can be removed, and good references found, ensuring that the information used is cited correctly and not given a new synthysis, then it may be kept, but until those problems are addressed the article fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html#What_is_excluded.3F" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR#What_is_excluded.3F</a>, all of which are valid grounds for deletion unless fixed.

<li>Updating qualifier after further investigation. If this topic is worth keeping, there should be an excess of reliable sources to back this up instead of a multitude of {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} tags. If by the end of the afd discusssion there are no sources forthcoming, to me that would seem to be a good indication that the topic is not as notable as others are suggesting. Also consider that these sources have been requested for over eight months. Adding {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} is only ever a temporary measure, in the end it always comes do to a simple choice - cite information or remove it, and after the length of time the unverified information was retained in this case, it is weighing very heavily for the latter option.

<li><b>comment</b> I've done some work in trying to clean it up, with some attempt at NPOV, removing the worst OR, tagging facts that need to be referenced, and putting bull/bear arguments in one facts/figures section so as to start to address some of the other OR concerns. However, it is still in quite a state, and even if citations are found for all the figures given, the article itself would comprise of a paragraph saying that some say there is a bubble, followed by a list of figures which could be taken either way, which seems against NPOV in my view. I think it would be better for those interested to add a neutral paragraph to <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economy_of_the_Republic_of_Ireland_100d.html" title="Economy of the Republic of Ireland">Economy of the Republic of Ireland</a> about house prices/bubble/mortgage fraud (which are mentioned briefly in the lead) than to try and salvage this. (In which case I'd also suggest adding to that article afresh based on the references, and not a merge, as the latter would run the risk of the uncited OR being transferred as well) Regards, <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinRe_7317.html" title="User:MartinRe">MartinRe</a> 14:30, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Impossible for the article to be NPOV. Putting a headiong of 'Opinions' isn't enough for me. A list of stats doesn't add much without context.

<li><b>Keep</b>. May need some cleaning but is undoubtedly a very important topic for those living in Ireland. Page has been slowly improving with citations being inserted over time. Criticism of reference to Daft.ie report is pretty unwarranted as a yield rate approx equal to current ECB rate is obviously a Bearish argument.

<li>Short version; AFD is not a vote. It's an attempt to build a consensus agreement as to what to do. Granted, that normally turns out to be a vote, but Wikipedia has long had a policy of trying to avoid votes of this form (to prevent ballot stuffing, mostly). If there is "no consensus" as to what to do, precedent usually suggests maintaining the status quo (i.e. keep, in this case). <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinitawowi_fe97.html" title="User:Kinitawowi">Kinitawowi</a> 19:04, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment:</b> In response to some of these concerns, I have added a description of a UU Independent Affiliate to the article along with examples of more closely affiliated organizations. Some of these organizations, even though technically "independent", are the heart and soul of the denomination, are therefore quite notable even though they do not have articles yet. For this reason, I do not believe a category, which does not support red-letter links, is the best way to develop this portion of the encyclopedia. I would also encourage persons who are interested in Unitarian Universalism to start creating articles for some of these organizations. –<a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShoaler_5952.html" title="User:Shoaler">Shoaler</a> (<a href="../../../s/h/o/User_talk%7EShoaler_4dcd.html" title="User talk:Shoaler">talk</a>) 13:37, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The result was <b>DELETE</b>. The raw comment total is 9-5 Delete (discounting one Delete vote that is that editor's only edit so far). One of the Keeps is Weak. So looking at the arguments. It's clear he's not notable as a professor or as a book author. I think I vaguely remember the email incident. I don't consider that as establishing <i>significant</i> notability. Lots of people get their 15 minutes on O'Reilly etc.</p>
<p>The Keep argument come down to two: first, he's a columnist on <a href="../../../t/o/w/Townhall.com.html" title="Townhall.com">townhall.com</a>. <a href="../../../t/o/w/Townhall.com.html" title="Townhall.com">townhall.com</a> is a notable site, and many of its columnists are clearly notable. This raises the question: does that mean that <i>all</i> columnists on townhall.com become notable by association (and by the presumably large readership of townhall.com). It's a hard question, but my answer is: no, not necessarily. We don't know how many townhall.com readers read <i>his</i> column. It's just not quite the same as being syndicated in a newspaper. In Adams's case I don't see enough proof of notability as a commentator.</p>
<p>The second argument is that his career as a gadfly is notable. Again, I don't see enough involvement in high-profile lawsuits, protest demonstrations, publications, and the like. I'm not seeing a strong enough Keep argument to overcome the arguments (and greater numbers) of the Delete commentors. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 21:49, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Townhall.com columnists are fairly well-known, especially amongst American conservatives.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Adams is certainly non-notable as an academic, criminologist, or critic of homosexuality. However, as a persistent and active critic of public universities' speech codes and selective funding of student groups (as violative of the 1st Amendment), Adams is a <b>notable</b> gadfly.

Adams was active in finding plaintiffs to file the lawsuit. See Mike S. Adams, "<a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/MikeSAdams/2006/06/30/the_fruits_of_wrath" class="external text" title="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/MikeSAdams/2006/06/30/the_fruits_of_wrath" rel="nofollow">The Fruits of Wrath</a>," Townhall.com, June 30, 2006, and <a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/MikeSAdams/" class="external text" title="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/MikeSAdams/" rel="nofollow">other columns</a> by Adams describing his role in the lawsuit.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Do you have an independent source for this, ie. not this guy's blog entry? Bloggers tend not to be notable, and I really don't think that this makes this guy any more notable <i>if</i> it is actually true. TV Newser 00:25, 2 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Response</b>: The use of the word "blogger" mischaracterizes (negatively, for the purpose of notability) the nature of Dr. Adams' columns. <a href="../../../t/o/w/Townhall.com.html" title="Townhall.com">Townhall.com</a> is a high-traffic website, one of the top websites among American conservatives, and many of the columnists there such as <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Sowell_4946.html" title="Thomas Sowell">Thomas Sowell</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Coulter_3c97.html" title="Ann Coulter">Ann Coulter</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Limbaugh_a874.html" title="David Limbaugh">David Limbaugh</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Williams_9612.html" title="Walter Williams">Walter Williams</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Parker_14dc.html" title="Star Parker">Star Parker</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michelle_Malkin_6e09.html" title="Michelle Malkin">Michelle Malkin</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Gallagher_11b3.html" title="Mike Gallagher">Mike Gallagher</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruce_Bartlett_8c36.html" title="Bruce Bartlett">Bruce Bartlett</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_O%27Reilly_9983.html" title="Bill O'Reilly">Bill O'Reilly</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Shapiro_17d4.html" title="Ben Shapiro">Ben Shapiro</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/r/Larry_Elder_266c.html" title="Larry Elder">Larry Elder</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brent_Bozell_b44d.html" title="Brent Bozell">Brent Bozell</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Will_49be.html" title="George Will">George Will</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_Buchanan_f2c9.html" title="Pat Buchanan">Pat Buchanan</a> and so forth are very notable, have their columns syndicated in newspapers, host their own radio and TV shows, or have prominently run for political office.

<dd><b>Ditto</b> to Chicken Wing as to blogger vs. columnist.

<dd><b>Running out of bold comment intros</b>: I don't know how important his role in the Georgia Tech situation was. I didn't bring that issue up. So I don't know if any sources exist w/r/t his contribution.

<li><b>Comment.</b> I have to take back what I said about being "sure" about sources on Adams other than Adams himself.

<p>How to prevent the deletion?</p>
<ul>
<li>If you're the author of the article, you would first have to showcase its notability. Start by rerencing reports of the organisation in local newspapers and magazines. Without this, the article will be deleted. Then expand the article on its history, programmes undertaken (in prose), successes, failures, notable people involved, and end with future goals. It has to be well written, well referenced, and have encyclopedic content (as opposed to agendas and proposals) <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichalp_b881.html" title="User:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">=Nichalp</font></a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENichalp_e311.html" title="User talk:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">«Talk»=</font></a> 17:35, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Non-notable musical genre. Currently, it reads as an ad for a single band (the article for which doesn't even link back to this one). I found <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Pornobilly_4f01.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Pornobilly">an old VfD</a>; while it didn't pass deletion at that point, I don't think it has gained enough of a following to warrant an article.</p>
<p>A Google search for "Pornobilly" turns up just 1,530 hits;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=20&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=Pornobilly&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=20&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=Pornobilly&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[34]</a> however, most of those are just rehashes of the Wikipedia article. A more refined search garners a mind-boggling <code><small>&lt;/sarcasm&gt;</small></code> 182 hits.<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=20&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22Pornobilly%22-%22Pornobilly+is+a+musical+genre+diverging+from+psychobilly.+Its+lyrics+are+sexually+related%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=20&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22Pornobilly%22-%22Pornobilly+is+a+musical+genre+diverging+from+psychobilly.+Its+lyrics+are+sexually+related%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[35]</a></p>
<p>Duplicate copies of Wikipedia articles do not notability make, so I think we can kill this fairly easily. It can be recreated at some point in the future if the genre is expanded with new, notable bands, but that time is not now. <a href="../../../e/v/u/User%7EEVula_5373.html" title="User:EVula">EVula</a> 17:11, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

Seems like it might (or might not) be a very useful tool for people with large projects that depend on connecting preexisting literature with their own ideas. But an encyclopedia isn't about things that deserve diffusion or should be used or would help people in their work.

<li><b>Article excerpt</b> The site name originated as the username of the owner on various websites and services when he first began using computers. The name is commonly misread as "Stewen1.com," because the double-v's sometimes appear to be a "w." The owner of the site began to wonder if the site's name was too difficult to remember, and consequently set up three mirror sites, "SexWithYourMom.com," "StevenHKeys.com," and "Goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooogle.com." "Goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooogle.com" was canceled in February, 2006. "StevenHKeys.com" was set up to bypass the owner of the site's school's block of the URL "Steevven1.com." "SexWithYourMom.com" and "StevenHKeys.com" are still working mirrors to the site. <b>END</b> <a href="../../../y/y/-/User%7EYy-bo_c77b.html" title="User:Yy-bo">User:Yy-bo</a> 21:36, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Your friends...you say...That's like less than 100 (even to a generous standard). Wikipedia articles are made for things that are notable! Consult Simon may be notable enough to warrant on Wikipedia for you, but not for the rest of us. It fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. That first link in the article only has like 500 hits!! And don't say that if <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> has an article, Consult Simon should, because you know how many people believe in Christianity? 2.1 billion people. How many follow Consult Simon? Umm...one thousand is a generous guess. --<a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="color:red"><b>Nish</b></span><span style="color:blue"><b>kid</b></span><span style="color:green"><b>64</b></span></a> 21:19, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b>. First off I have to point out that you have to be a very sad man to research exactly how many people believe in Christianity, millions of people or billions of people would have done. Also you commented that the user, Wallamanage "totally butchered" the spelling of Christianity, when he merely used a "c" instead of an "s", which was most probably a typo not a spelling mistake and again you have to be very sad to point that out. Anyway your approximation of how many followers Consult Simon has was entirely incorrect, Consult Simon is a cult worthy of over 1 million followers, how many hits a website has doesn't determine how many followers the cult has. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptaindansplashback_dbcc.html" title="User:Captaindansplashback">Captaindansplashback</a></dd>

<b>Save</b>. i think the simonic religion is very good and should not be deleted. that is all</p>
<p><b>Save</b> The Consult Simon cult has great cultural significance and heritage. I and many I know are deeply offended by the mere idea of the page being deleted. Also we think it is very sad of user "NishKid 64" to automatically make assumptions about the size of the cult without any prior research and that he is indeed very sad for finding out just how many followers the so-called <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> has. I can't understand why you wish to delete this completely ligitamate page when there are pages of obvious fiction (<a href="../../../m/u/r/Murdoc_Niccals_2424.html" title="Murdoc Niccals">Murdoc Niccals</a>, <a href="../../../2/d/_/2D_%28Gorillaz%29_93de.html" title="2D (Gorillaz)">2D</a> for examples) which are on here.

<li>Thank you. You are approaching this the right way. However, in order to show that the school satisfies, say, the <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> criteria, you'll need to cite some sources that aren't the school itself, i.e. not its web site and not its publicity blurb. Has anyone published a book about this school? Has an independent inspection agency published a report about it? Stuff published by sources independent of the school is what we need here. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:56, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>First of all, the pages for the films you listed have an infobox with a producer entry. That entry is for the producers, not the line producers or associate producers or co-producers. Secondly, the quantity of your work is irrelevant on its own merits, no matter how many films you've worked on. Finally, if you think that I actually am called <a href="../../../g/i/r/User%7EGirolamo_Savonarola_76cd.html" title="User:Girolamo Savonarola">Girolamo Savonarola</a> in real life, why don't you Google me?

<dd>Notability has nothing to do with the number of films you've worked on or how big they are - otherwise anyone with any decent experience in the film industry in any capacity would automatically qualify. <a href="../../../l/i/n/Line_producer.html" title="Line producer">Line producers</a>, as I understand it, usually are in charge of the financial aspects of a film, while UPMs and AD's handle logistics and organization.

<p>The article appears to be purely <a href="../../../o/r/i/Wikipedia%7EOriginal_research_757d.html" title="Wikipedia:Original research">original research</a>. In an edit summary, the author wrote "I am a Graduate Management of Global IT sutdent at American University Kogod School of Business. This is acedemic information we and others have been researching" after removing the {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}} tag. Further investigation appears to show that it is not possible to write an article on this subject that would not be original research at this time.</p>
<p>The "references" provided appear to either trivially use the term or are apparently merely examples of the subject (many of these do not contain the term at all), except for two. The ZDNet blog post and the "RIA to REA" link actually discuss the subject, but both are blogs. Not included in the article (I dug it up) is this <a href="http://www.jackbe.com/Resources/rea.php" class="external text" title="http://www.jackbe.com/Resources/rea.php" rel="nofollow">"About REA" page</a> from the newly-launched company/site JackBe, which seems to be the only existing non-blog sources (and then, due to it's unreliable nature, would only be acceptable in an article on JackBe).</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The last thing I have to say is that just because one can't 'link' to a source or mention it just yet doesn't mean it doesn't exist. REA is real and sources are there if one had access to the sources which some don't have the luxury at this point which is why something like a wiki is great for the world. But if you and others keep censoring input, that benefit is severely diminished and is a step back from what Web 2.0 is all about. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Wagnermr14 (<a href="../../../w/a/g/User_talk%7EWagnermr14_93a0.html" title="User talk:Wagnermr14">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wagnermr14_7d26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wagnermr14">contribs</a>) September 7, 2006.</small>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> appears to be a just-about-verifiable but insignificant diploma mill. Absent evidence of notable "alumni" claiming status of degrees from here, we probably don't need to give it the oxygen of publicity (or indeed take on the inevitable headache of policing neutrality). <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 14:02, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong delete</b> There is nothing notable or verifable. I can set up this type of "school" and promote on wikipedia in a similiar way.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Is it unaccredited? I originally sourced it that way in the article because I couldn't find proof it was. I have seen nothing from any source other than the founder and operator of the school. How is this wiki worthy? How many students attend? How many have graduated? What degrees are offered? <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 04:48, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> for lack of independent reliable sources needed for verifiability. Without such sources, there's only two potential outcomes for the article: it has unverifiable promotional material for the school, or its used to included unverifiable attacks against it. Neither is acceptable. Currently we're using "source by omission", which means a Wikipedian (in violation of core policy) makes factual claims based on the *absense* of information. This is unacceptable. We can only state something (like say something is an "unaccredited school") if a reliable 3rd party sources has made such a statement. We can't do original research, without violating <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">policy</a>, which sadly we've done by labelling this "school" as we have. The reasons for deleting this, are somewhat similiar to the ones for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Johnson_C._Philip_b30f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Johnson C.

<li><b><s>Keep</s></b>. There is ongoing debate on this school which makes it very interesting to watch. From what I see the school has special accreditation with the Indian government. The information that some have brought makes this legit in my view. It can be verified very easily. Just contact the people in India rather than making spurious attacks. One may not like what they offer but it is not enough to remove the information. Looks like some have a personal axe to grind. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 207.160.71.152 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_207.160.71.152_ce11.html" title="Special:Contributions/207.160.71.152">contribs</a>).</small> 28:35, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> There are hundreds of unaccredited schools in California alone. Without notablity or verfiablity, an unaccredited school article will become a bastion for unverified POV. I started the article because I thought the school was legitimate, but it turns out people with ties to it were simply spamming wikipedia. If this were accredited it would not need notable because we know students attend and it is verfiable. Without accreditation we need notablity to take that slack.<a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 05:22, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Only one non-list mainspace article links to it; its usefulness in terms of promoting context is limited, at best. The article focuses mostly on what it is <i>not</i>, rather than what it is, which appears to be a function of the fact that we don't have enough reliable sources to write about it with strict verifiability. The fact that it is unaccredited can be <i>very</i> easily handled with a simple mention in whatever articles it is mentioned in.

<li><b>Comment</b> And when we have enough material that meets our policy for <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> for such institutions, and when we've written up stubs that meet Wikipedia policies for all of them, perhaps we can revisit this article; in general, articles are not protected against recreation when the deletion is not related to a living person or a constant troll-magnet. In the meantime, this article is a perpetual stub that focuses on what the subject is not, rather than what it is. I, for one, think it would not be wonderful to have an encyclopedia wherein most articles consist of saying "This person is not an <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elephant.html" title="Elephant">elephant</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godzilla.html" title="Godzilla">Godzilla</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Cruise_61a0.html" title="Tom Cruise">Tom Cruise</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmylou_Harris_5639.html" title="Emmylou Harris">Emmylou Harris</a>, or <a href="../../../m/8/0/M80.html" title="M80">M80</a>", because we don't have enough material to write with strict verifiability about what it <i>is</i>. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 21:25, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete for now</b> The article should probably exist, but it's so vague and empty (and full of negatives, Cap'n) that it's not actually useful. Maybe the best course would be to delete for now, and come back with a better article. Maybe a little [WP:Vanity] would be OK, since they themselves might know what they actually do and stand for. Some of those seminaries have articles (like <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Reformed_Seminary_25b0.html" title="Geneva Reformed Seminary">Geneva_Reformed_Seminary</a>, but they don't mention it.

<p>What makes something unimportant enough to not merit a page on Wikipedia? This is a place to share information, and that is what is being done here.

The page is in no shape or form being used as a webhost. Livejournal's Next Top Model has been around long enough to have a page of it's own on Wikipedia.

<li>I am, but I still don't understand why this is unimportant enough to not have a place on Wikipedia. I've done searches before for even more irrelevant and unimporant things, and they have a rightful place here, which Livejournal's Next Top Model also deserves. I can't give you any other sources, and if there were you'd have them, but most everything I've ever read on her is original research with little to no verifiablity. User:LJNTM</li>

<li>Well, most irrelenvent/unimportant things eventually meet their demise through the same process we're going through right now.

<dd>I'll have to disagree with your original research assertion- it completely violates a policy of Wikipedia. Think of it this way: If I were to write a biography on myself, arguably I could use an autobiography as my only source because I <i>must</i> know what I'm talking about. However, a source like that would undoubtedly be biased and would only provide one point of view.

<p>Maybe it could be sunk into a generic cloven fruit page?

Of course, I'm just an anonymous poster, so feel free to ignore me.</p>

<p>Information is not entirely accurate. Engine list is wrong for 4 of the cars listed. It does not present a deep interpretation of the term "Exotic Car" but rather presents small articles of the supposed supercars. I believe that the Exotic car page sould redirect to the article <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supercar.html" title="Supercar">supercar</a>. --Cirilobeto 23:24, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Supercars are given out awards for one car that looks the best from all. That car is a exotic car. I have to agree with the first entry the author believe that all supercars are exotic ones, infact there is only one car today that has the exotic car award which is the Pagani Zonda.

<ul>
<li>Well, he is an actor and musician, a starting Japanese actor. The page probably should be classified as a stub. I don't think it should be deleted, maybe if the user who wrote the article could make the bio a bit more expansive, it'd be better. There are a lot of wikipedia articles out there that are similar to this, but they aren't deleted because they're more 'stubs' than anything. This article's a stub.<a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVera26_b156.html" title="User:Vera26">Vera26</a> 00:40, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Also, actually it's 2,200,000 hits if you type his Japanese romanized name: Date Koji, but more accurately it should be <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;rls=DVXA%2CDVXA%3A2006-22%2CDVXA%3Aen&amp;q=Date+Kouji" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;rls=DVXA%2CDVXA%3A2006-22%2CDVXA%3Aen&amp;q=Date+Kouji" rel="nofollow">Date Kouji 190,000 Ghits</a>. That's what fans call him, they don't refer to him as Koji Date. I think it's the case for all Asian actors. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVera26_b156.html" title="User:Vera26">Vera26</a> 00:42, 5 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Put "Date Koji" in quotes and try again (1500; not 2.2 Million). Your search included any thing with a Date: that mentioned anyone named Koji. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 10:06, 5 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's true that he's a starting actor, but he does have credits, and while I didn't write the article, I don't see why the article should be deleted. It just needs clean up and expansion from the original author. Otherwise than that, the actor Koji Date does have an official site and official blogs for his fans to visit. There are shorter articles out there like <a href="../../../n/a/o/Naoya_Urata_c50d.html" title="Naoya Urata">Naoya Urata</a> that aren't being subject to deletion, so I think it's absolutely ridiculous that the article for <a href="../../../k/o/j/Koji_Date_b7bf.html" title="Koji Date">Koji Date</a> is being subject to deletion. It just needs to be classified as a stub and hopefully someone with more knowlege of what Koji Date has done will expand on it. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVera26_b156.html" title="User:Vera26">Vera26</a> 10:26, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. 43k google hits for his Japanese name. Note that searching for English-language romanised names is always going to be problematic, due to both name order and ambiguous romanisation (Koji/Kouji). Anyway, the article may be insufficient at the moment but I'm not convinced it can't be improved upon. --<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERankler_6eec.html" title="User:Rankler">Rankler</a> 10:42, 5 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's definitely a weak keep, I've already labeled it as a stub. I think it can be expanded on, because I was checking up on his official site and it does seem like he's been involved in more than just the Prince of Tennis musicals, but I have no clue what the other projects are since my Japanese skills are quite limited. He seems to have a fanlisting too already. I think the article can be improved on too. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVera26_b156.html" title="User:Vera26">Vera26</a> 10:51, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I believe there was actually a successful vote to delete this, at a point when it was under the title "What's Stevie Thinking?", an alternate title for this series. Hence, this is a recreation of a deleted article.

<li><b>Keep</b> The article doesn't seem properly sourced or POV to me, but that's a reason to clean it up, not delete it.

<p>No sources cited, the only sources that could be cited are not substantial. It's just not notable--of the almost 400 episodes of The Simpsons, this features prominently in.... 1., and it isn't a "character" at all--it just gets a worker of the week award and helps save Homer in space. If we're going to do this, we have to take other inanimate objects from The Simpsons that feature prominently in all of the episodes, like the pattern on the curtains in the kitchen.

<p>I have been an avid readed of wikipedia for over one year. Never before have I been motivated to edit any page before I noticed the 'inanimate carbon rod' was subject to deletion. The reason why I believe the inanimate carbon rod deserves its own article is that characters in the episode (e.g. Lenny and Carl, as well as the whole town for its parade) personify the inanimate object, and speak and refer to it as if it was an actual person. This is why I believe the inanimate carbon rod can be distinguished from other prominent inanimate objects (as suggested, the corn curtains as well as things like perhaps Bart's lucky red hat), because of the way the charachters praise and rever the rod's bravery and courage (personification) as if it were a real person. This obviously goes to the root of the joke, which is to essentially demonstrate the incompetence of Homer.Supermegaman 13:30, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>But see, it's funny on the Simpsons, as a one-time gag with little shelf life. It wasn't brought back as prominent, it had the "Deep Space Homer" thing, and then the chart of the nuclear power plant in C'E'D'oh, but that was about it. It doesn't deserve its own article, it should be talked about in the "Deep Space Homer" episode. Again, there are things about which there is more featuring, the corn curtains, Bart's hat, but again, it is not the job of Wikipedia to let users in on a one-episode joke--let the episode do that.-<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> 20:37, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Small, specific articles about things related to a much larger topic are, in my opinion, helpful and worthy of keeping. No, the rod isn't a main character, nor is it absolutely necessary to have a page for it. But having tons of information about such a large TV series is helpful, and this particular article was about a noteworthy event in a particular episode. If they had devoted time to the drapes in the kitchen, or the lamp next to the couch, I would think that would make those respective objects more noteworthy, but since they are objects that haven't been interacted with in a meaningful way, it would be pointless to have things like that on Wikipedia. But for the sake of having as much information as possible on related items, I think this article should stay. <b>chrispiss1186</b></li>

<p>The result was <b>DELETE</b>. The raw comment total is 8-5 Delete. But two of the Keep comments are a bit fishy: one by an editor who has made two other edits, one by an editor who has made one other edit, to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Dark_Enforcer_362f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Dark Enforcer">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Dark Enforcer</a>. If we discount those two, we have a raw total of 8-3 Delete (counting one Redirect comment as Delete). The argument that the non-production of the film is of some notability is well taken; this is not just somebody's fever dream, but a real event (by being a non-event) in the history of the Batman film franchise. On the other hand, no real claim was advanced that the Batman film <i>series</i> (as opposed to the individual films) and it's backstories and financial ins-and-outs is itself sufficiently notable that a non-produced film in the series must be notable. And <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTFILM_6ee5.html" title="WP:NOTFILM">WP:NOTFILM</a> <i>does</i> specifically discourage articles on unproduced films except in special instances which are not really met here. So I don't see a really convincing Keep argument, and in the end, with an 8-3 raw vote total, I see a general consensus to delete. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 04:45, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> First of all, <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>. A film like this "should only be included if the event is notable and almost certain to take place," which it never did. Furthermore, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTFILM_6ee5.html" title="WP:NOTFILM">WP:NOTFILM</a> states that unreleased films are "generally <b>not</b> appropriate unless the <i>production</i> of the film is notable in some way." Seeing that this film never even entered production, it can't even qualify for notability. It's not even "unfinished", it was never started. If this article is kept, then it will be trimmed down substantially based on the speculative bits in the article. There wasn't even a script treatment released about this supposed film -- how can anything be assumed about what takes place? If this film article is kept, we may as well create film articles for other films that never got beyond pre-production. As I've said, <i>Batman Triumphant</i> already has its own section in the <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_%26_Robin_%281997_film%29_de33.html#Sequel" title="Batman &amp; Robin (1997 film)">Batman &amp; Robin</a></i> film article, and any information from this particular article should be adapted to fit that paragraph instead of having its own article. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> 21:27, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canceled_Superman_films_2aee.html" title="Canceled Superman films">Canceled Superman films</a> article seems pretty extensive since there were various people (such as screenwriters) attached at different points, but I'm not sure how valid of an article it really is. That's a debate in itself. <i>Batman Triumphant</i> was one intended film (under one intended script, it seems), which does not make it very notable from that particular perspective. The <i>Batman &amp; Robin</i> article seems to contain the necessary information in its sequel section, though I'm sure it could be improved. I don't know if there's been any other attempts to film a Batman movie after <i>Batman &amp; Robin</i> and before <i>Batman Begins</i>, but that could be an article in itself if <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancelled_Superman_films_2eb4.html" title="Cancelled Superman films">Cancelled Superman films</a> exists.
