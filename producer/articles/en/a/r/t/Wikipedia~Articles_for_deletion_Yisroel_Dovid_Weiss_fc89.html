<p><b>Delete</b> - The attendance of Neturei Karta at the conference may be notable, not every participant is notable. <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 06:43, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Weak keep</b> First I'd just like to say: Wow, Avi, you put so much work into it sourcing and are now nominating it/. you are a better person than I am. That said, <b>weak keep</b> Weiss is the head spokesperson it seems for his part of Neuterei Karta and has been the subject of a variety of articles such as the NYT piece which is cited in the article (the piece I think focused on Weiss. I'll look it up later to make sure)). <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 07:01, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> And they are all about the <b>VISIT</b>, not the <b>MAN</b>. See my initial comment above.

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> The attendance at the conference are notable, but the individuals are not. Most of the "citations" which are positive toward Mr. Weiss are rife with misrepresentations. From his title as Rabbi, which is not supported by any indicia of scholarship or ordination, to the extent of his support, Mr. Weiss and six or seven of his cronies have sucked many into their delusional world where they are believed to somehow espouse the true "Jewish voice." To the extent that this article is not written like others concerning eccentrics like the Joshua Norton, the self-styled emperor of the United States, or David Koresh, a self-proclaimed Messiah, this article is, to be perfectly frank, silly, irrelevant, and concerns a non-notable individual who was remarkably successful in convincing non Jews that he is somehow notable in the Jewish world. Bravo. Good Show. 67.81.158.13 15:17, 6 March 2007 (UTC) <small>— 67.81.158.13 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.81.158.13_5f38.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.81.158.13">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> This is purely a fact based issue. Mr. Weiss is not notable. He is not a Rabbi. He claims to represent an already splintered group of Neturei Karta followers. He actually claims to have HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS of SUPPORTERS, even though he has about seven. His ideas are just a ruse to justify the donations he recieved from Arafat and continues to recieve from other avowed terrorists. He claims to lecture in a school which does not exist. Frankly, every thing stated in this article is untrue, save the fact he was condemned by the entire Jewish world--whether religious or non-religious, Zionist, or non-Zionist. It is made by an imposter who has not made a single notable achievement in his entire life except fool a non Jews like bsnowball who knows absolutely nothing about what he really is about and likes him only for political reasons (even though he has never and will never achieve anything of significance because he is completely out of his mind!). How this could have been going on for so long is beyond me. I strongly advocate this stain on Wikipedia's standards and firmly hope it is removed speedily. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidCharlesII_1b3a.html" title="User:DavidCharlesII">DavidCharlesII</a> 15:25, 6 March 2007 (UTC)<small>— <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidCharlesII_1b3a.html" title="User:DavidCharlesII">DavidCharlesII</a> (<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidCharlesII_630c.html" title="User talk:DavidCharlesII">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DavidCharlesII_d7ef.html" title="Special:Contributions/DavidCharlesII">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small>

<li>David, we know you don't like the man and don't like what he stands for. Neither do I. That doesn't alter whether or not we should have an article on him. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 15:39, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am sorry, but this has nothing to do with whether I like him or not. There is nothing notable about Mr. Weiss. He is assumed to be notable simply because he is a media hound and lied to appear notable. That's not notable. The only ones who are disputing his notability are those who don't know better, or, as in the past, have very strong anti-Israel political issues. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidCharlesII_1b3a.html" title="User:DavidCharlesII">DavidCharlesII</a> 15:43, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

Whether he is a media hound and whether he has lied aren't relevant.

<p><s><b>Strong Delete</b> Wow. This is really funny. You have Rabbi 67 and Rabbi David Charles attempting to add facts into this article to at least salvage it, and others who know nothing about the issues change it because it does not feel right--all while maintaining that the lies Mr. Weiss made are somehow sourced because they are in op-eds, while other op-eds are not "reliable." Hillarious. Mr. Weiss is a non-event, a nobody. No one ever heard of him. Everything about him in this article is untrue except for the fact that he was in Tehran and is banned from everything Jewish. I mean, come on, when do we start adding town idiots and town drunks to Wikipedia? Are they important, too? Rabbi 67 and David Charles deserve commendation for what they have tried to do. I think this is a better route. Take this piece of nonsense out of wikipedia. Unless, of course, you write an article about a flat Earth, making it sound like its true--based on sources from the 14th century. Its funny, but come on, its not an encyclopedia. <small>— <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperCharedi_1dcd.html" title="User:SuperCharedi">SuperCharedi</a> (<a href="../../../s/u/p/User_talk%7ESuperCharedi_d484.html" title="User talk:SuperCharedi">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SuperCharedi_1b55.html" title="Special:Contributions/SuperCharedi">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></s></p>

<li>From a strictly neutral basis, he has been the subject of several non-trivial publications by reliable sources. Now, whether or not the article appropriately reflects his notability is something different and I'm not sure what the answer for that is. <font color="#1874CD"><b><a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeebo86_eb89.html" title="User:Leebo86">Leebo</a></b></font><small><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELeebo86_8ca0.html" title="User talk:Leebo86"><font color="#B22222">86</font></a></sup></small> 15:55, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Better yet, I am curious as to the worthiness of the sources which give the appearance of Mr. Weiss's notablity. Seeing as no one ever heard of him in the Jewish world, it is harldy likely that he is notable, aside from the lies he tells the press, which were discussed both here and on the discussion boards. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidCharlesII_1b3a.html" title="User:DavidCharlesII">DavidCharlesII</a> (<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavidCharlesII_630c.html" title="User talk:DavidCharlesII">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DavidCharlesII_d7ef.html" title="Special:Contributions/DavidCharlesII">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>David, he gets major press coverage. Whether he does that by lying to the press or not isn't that relevant. What matters is whether he passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 15:57, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But what makes him notable? Something HE did? Hardly. The meeting is may be significant in the eyes of some, but it does not make him noteworthy. Do you know everyone who fought in the Civil war? Let's get ALL the names now. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperCharedi_1dcd.html" title="User:SuperCharedi">SuperCharedi</a> 16:04, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Again, the NYT article and other sources focus on Weiss. He therefore meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 16:27, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It does not focus on Weiss. We can have an article on him saying that there was an NYU article which quoted Weiss who explained why he and six others decided to meet someone who decided he will go to Tehran. Yay. That's not notable. 67.81.158.13 16:43, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It has a large amount of material on Weiss and quotes from him extensively. For example, it includes this paragraph "Rabbi Weiss, 54, grew up in the Orthodox neighborhood of Borough Park, Brooklyn, the son of Hungarians who fled Eastern Europe before Hitler’s troops closed its borders to Jews. He married 18 years ago and has six children. The family moved to Monsey seven years ago, solidifying Neturei Karta’s presence in the town." among others. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 16:53, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sounds incredibly trivial. His connection with the Tehran conference was what was important. While we are at it, you might have a point. An old lady was quoted today in NYT--Gertrude Rothman--she is 87, lives in the Bronx, likes to shop at the store across the block. She went there to buy salmon. she was wearing a pink blouse. Oh yeah, the subject of the article was about a robbery next door. 67.81.158.13 18:59, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Um, this is a) more info than that, b) the example paragraph is not the only one about him c) as already observed, there are other sources as well, such as the Fox News sources. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 19:20, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a balanced, well-sourced article which makes a solid case for Weiss' notability. <i>And notability is the only issue which falls under our purview.</i> I am militantly disinterested, as I hope the closing admin will be, in whether Weiss is "entitled" to be called a rabbi, the popularity (or lack thereof) of his organization or the degree to which he is obviously loathed by a faction here on Wikipedia. It does strike me as odd that so many folk know so much about someone they are claiming is non-notable, but ultimately, it's well to remember this: Wikipedia is not written to personally please you. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 18:50, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Well, frankly, were I an anonymous IP with no other edits on Wikipedia save for this discussion, I wouldn't myself presume to preach on what justifies an entry here or not. For my own part, I'm still bemused that so many people seem to know so much about a fellow they then go on to claim is non-notable.

<ul>
<li>Well I appreciate that you are bemused. I find it amusing that my history shows that I have made so few edits. I made hundreds. And I can preach on what makes fundamental sense. I would gladly prepare a beautiful article on Gertrude Rothman, a sweet, bubbly 87 year old lade who was quoted in the NYT. She likes fish, especially trout, believes that kids are not the way they used to be, and likes to shop in a stor across the street from her house. She lives in the Bronx. Even though she was quoted in the broader context of a burglarly next door, I think she is noteworthy. She was quoted in the Post, too, after all. Weiss is no less. Naturally, it is somewhat surprising that people know "so" much about him. Like the fact he was excomunnicated by every Jewish faction--Zionist or or anti-Zionist. Or that he lies about the extent of his support (a fact several anti semites refuse to allow in the article), claiming he has Hundreds of Thousands of followers, when, in fact, he has less than a dozen. But this is what happens when someone goes out in the open, pandering to the media, and calling himself Rabbi (demanding the title, actually, he did that on Radio), and proclaiming himself to be the true voice of Judaism. Before proclomations are made, one must find out who on Earth this eccentric is. If this article was written about an eccentric, Like Joshua Norton, for example, I would not have a problem with it. But to make him sound any more defies logic, common sense, and most significantly for wikipeida, the facts. The reality is that we don't write articles about mongrels on the street who are quoted on the news. We don't write articles about town drunks who people may know about. We certainly need not write an article about someone whose only significance is that he claims to lead a organization which he does not. Neturei Karta was split up between Rabbi Blau's followers. Weiss, at best, follows the view of one of those followers. Because he was excomunnicated by all, how could he be regarded as legit? How could this not be qualified in the article about him? Because all he is doing is talking about this follower's orgniazation, and its efforts in America to pander with the axis of Evil, we can quote it within the broader scope of what he's talking about. But there is no need to write about its insignificant, deranged messenger.67.81.158.13 19:37, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Let's see. Mr. Weiss would probably fall under Creative professionals: scientists, authors, editors, journalists, filmmakers, photographers, artists, architects, engineers, and other creative professionals.</li>
<li>This would mean he would have to be:</li>
<li>The person has received a notable award or honor, or has been often nominated for them.</li>
<li>The person is regarded as an important figure or significant expert by peers.</li>
<li>The person is known for originating a significant new concept, theory or idea.</li>
<li>The person has created a significant or well-known work, or collective body of work, which has been the subject of multiple independent works, reviews, or documentaries.</li>
<li>The person or their work has been widely cited by authors, or is the basis for respected curriculum.</li>
<li>The person's work is or has been displayed in notable museums or exhibitions, or as a recognised monument.</li>
<li>Mr. Weiss does not fall under this category. Furthermore, "Trivial, or incidental coverage of a subject by secondary sources is not sufficient to establish notability. Once notability is established, primary sources may be used to add content. Ultimately, and most importantly, all content must be attributable." Most of the coverage on him is trivial, incidental coverage. moreover, there is little content to add aside from his date of birth, the amount of children he has and what he claims. Everything is else is completely made up. The problem is that anti semites refuse to allow in the sources that prove this. Believe me, many have tried to clean up this cesspool of lies. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.81.158.13 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.81.158.13_5f38.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.81.158.13">contribs</a>) 20:43, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</small>

<li>Quite. I'm waiting for that myself, amidst the blizzard of straw man arguments, loaded statements, insults and other irrelevancies. Frankly, there have been a number of hugely contested Judaism-related AfDs lately, and I can't be the only editor weary to death to the degree to which Wikipedia policies are plowed under the torrent of ideological squabbling boiling down to nothing more pertinent than "We hate this subject so it needs to be deleted."

<li>On form, I doubt he will; I'm getting the strong impression this is far less about verifiable fact than about propaganda.

<li>Leebo you are obviously not following my point. I am comparing the <i>content</i> of articles.

<li><b>Response</b> The primary criterion for notability, per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, is "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of secondary sources that are reliable, independent of the subject and independent of each other."

As I said when I nominated this for deletion, the EVENT may well be, and in my opinion, IS notable. But NOT Mr. Weiss. None of these sources are about HIM outside of the EVENT.

<li>The part where you link, inaccurately, the sum total of Weiss' notability with said event, and the inference that someone isn't notable outside the setting for his or her notoriety.

<li>People become notable from what they do, and what events they participate in. He has become notable by participating in the conferences, and by delivering the speech he gave there. This makes him notable, and it is shutting one's eyes to reality that make it possible to think otherwise. He if had merely gone to the concert and said nothing, <i>and</i> if no articles had been written centered around his activities there, then there would be a case. (I think that even then there would have been coverage about him a an individual, because the very fact of someone from his community going there was N, and recognized so in news coverage even before the speech was given.--and that would have made him notable. But after the delivery of the speech, probably every newspaper in the world had an article focused on him--the items given are a very small selection. <i>Articles focused on his individual contribution to the meeting, not just about the meeting.</i> We do not make it less Notable by eliminating the article--what we do, is make ourself unreliable as a source for major newsworthy figures of our own time.

<dd>I have bad news. Mr. Weiss and his seven followers have been banned by Neturei Karta itself.

This puts the already onerous problem about writing that Mr. Weiss is an adherent of Neturei Karta (I always tried to be factually correct and maintained that he CLAIMS to be an adherent of Neturei Karta) but also begs the question as to whether he should be put on the NK article. It would appear that all we can write about him is his name, his age, the amount of his children he has, his claim he is a member of NK, and the ban NK, and the rest of the anti-Zionist and Zionist world imposed on him and his seven followers. Everyone in the know, from the Agudah to the NK calls him a liar, a delusional, a fox in sheep's clothing, etc. He clearly lied to the media. Notable? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidCharlesII_1b3a.html" title="User:DavidCharlesII">DavidCharlesII</a> 15:04, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, the <i>cheirem</i> makes him MORE notable <a href="../../../s/m/i/Image%7ESmile.png_3237.html" class="image" title="image:smile.png"><img src="../../../upload/shared/2/26/Smile.png" alt="image:smile.png" width="20" height="20" longdesc="../../../s/m/i/Image%7ESmile.png_3237.html" /></a>, I'm afraid. I'm still not sure that I would change my vote, and I won't, but for NK to put someone in cheirem for an anti-Zionist activity is pretty rare. -- <a href="../../../a/v/r/User%7EAvraham_9604.html" title="User:Avraham">Avi</a> 18:30, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>David, you just don't get it, do you? <i>Whether or not Weiss is the real deal or a con man has not one single thing to do with this AfD.</i> The <i>only</i> grounds for deletion would be on the basis of non-notability or lack of verification of the article's assertions. Avi is quite right; the more verifiable attention the world gives this fellow, the more notable he is. As it happens, under the Wikipedia article for <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cherem.html" title="Cherem">cherem</a>, the pronouncement against Weiss and his followers is one of the two specific incidents used as an example, and one of the only few attributed ones in recent centuries. That's beyond "pretty rare" and well into "nearly unprecedented." <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 18:59, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I am not Rabbi David. Second, it shows that Mr. Weiss is not a spokesperson for NK. It also demonstrates that he lied to all the sources which form the basis of his notability. 67.81.158.13 19:37, 9 March 2007 (UTC) So basically you can write an article about how someone fooled the media the president of Iran for a while. I guess articles of that nature can be notable. 67.81.158.13 19:39, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Regarding your identity, you could disclose the reason why you removed the discussion of sockpuppetry from David's user talk page.
