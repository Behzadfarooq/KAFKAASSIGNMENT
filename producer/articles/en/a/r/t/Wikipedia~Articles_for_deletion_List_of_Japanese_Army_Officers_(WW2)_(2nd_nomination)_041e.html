<p>The <i>List of Japanese Army Officers (WW2)</i> was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Japanese_Army_Officers_%28WW2%29_804a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Japanese Army Officers (WW2)">previously nominated for AfD</a> in August 2006. It survived by virtue of there being no consensus, thus defaulting to keep. In the four months since, absolutely no attempt has been made to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> any of the information on the list or to provide any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sources</a>. Without verification or reliable sources, this compilation is essentially <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. I have since discovered the companion article, <i>List of Japanese Navy officers (WWII)</i>, which suffers the same fatal flaws as the army “article”. Both articles fail all three essential content policies of wikipedia. I could also add that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">wikipedia is not a directory or memorial</a>. These are indeterminate lists that do what a Category:Japanese Army Officers or Category:Japanese Naval Officers ought to be doing. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 18:41, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Lists and categories are separate animals and can work in tandem. That said, I see no need for listing all officers below the rank of General or Admiral respectively. Below that, it should only be notable officers with blue links or reasonable red links. This seems more like a tag/cleanup issue than one for AFD. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 20:45, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Weak <b>Keep</b> and cleanup — Agree with Dhartung, although Captains would also be acceptible. Many of these entries may never have an article, so better a list than a category. That being said, however, it'd be good to have more information than a simple list on this page. — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> (<a href="../../../r/j/h/User_talk%7ERJHall_bed4.html" title="User talk:RJHall"><i>talk</i></a>) 20:57, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> If this were a matter of cleanup, I'd have tagged it with {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup_258a.html" title="Template:Cleanup">cleanup</a>}}. However, these articles are contrary to the main content policies of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. As those have not been addressed over the lifespan of these articles, and as it does not appear that it will be addressed, these articles cannot remain. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 21:09, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> we've been through this before. Not only an unmaintainble list, but also vague listcruft of the worst sort. Where do you set the bar for inclusion? And by whose standard? <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 00:18, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> As there is no "bar" for inclusion, this would be a totally unmanagable, and probably unverifable list. Make it a category - not a list. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkierRMH_4ae2.html" title="User:SkierRMH">SkierRMH</a> 04:28, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><small><b>Note</b>: This debate has been included in the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Deletion_sorting_Japan_10b0.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletion sorting/Japan">list of Japan-related deletions</a>.</small> <small>-- Huwe 6 04:39, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</small></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> and let it get cleaned up. <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">There is no deadline.</a> <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 07:36, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per above. Making it a category and not a list does nothing to address verifiability, except spread the problem out. Categories and lists co-exist peacefully in most cases, and I don't know what makes these two lists particularly unmaintainable. The bar for inclusion is probably set too low for these two lists, but AFD is not for cleanup. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 07:58, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am not advocating cleanup. I am advocating deletion based on the paramount policies of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, among other things. I am also not advocating moving all the listed names into categories; the suggestion is merely that the <i>very few</i> verifiable people on this list can be categorized as such. Unless and until the content policy issues are addressed, these articles simply cannot exist. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 18:44, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And, I am not arguing against cleanup either. I'm arguing against deletion. I don't see how <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> applies to this list at all. From that page, original research is any of the following:
<ul>
<li>It introduces a theory or method of solution;</li>
<li>It introduces original ideas;</li>
<li>It defines new terms;</li>
<li>It provides or presumes new definitions of pre-existing terms;</li>
<li>It introduces an argument, without citing a reputable source for that argument, that purports to refute or support another idea, theory, argument, or position;</li>
<li>It introduces an analysis or synthesis of established facts, ideas, opinions, or arguments in a way that builds a particular case favored by the editor, without attributing that analysis or synthesis to a reputable source;</li>
<li>It <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_neologisms_5320.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms">introduces or uses neologisms</a>, without attributing the neologism to a reputable source.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As for verifiability, history books are awash with the names of generals, etc. <a href="../../../y/a/s/Yasukuni_Shrine_834e.html" title="Yasukuni Shrine">Yasukuni Shrine</a> probably has a list by rank of every soldier who fought for Japan. If there is a questionable name on the list, then tag it with {{cite}}; there's no need to delete the entire list. The higher the inclusion bar is set, the more sources are likely to be found. That's why I agree with a couple of others above who recommend deleting names from the lower echelons of the lists. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 13:01, 21 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> requires those wishing to keep the article to provide the verification (please refer to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html#Burden_of_evidence" title="WP:V">"Burden of evidence"</a> in that policy). The article provides no verification or reliable source. As for tagging with {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_7db3.html" title="Template:Cite">cite</a>}}, it was simply more efficient to tag the whole article with {{<a href="../../../v/e/r/Template%7EVerify_1f97.html" title="Template:Verify">verify</a>}}, a template that has been there since August 15. In fact, the better alternative is to delete every unverified name from the list (again, see "Burden of evidence"). As for <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, as far as I can see from the lists, they appear to be unpublished data or a sythesis of information from unverified, uncited sources. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 19:47, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> The list was created just for the sake of having such a list, the list is a violation of Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information, the content is unverifiable, the list is unlimited and/or unmaintainable, the list has no content beyond links to other articles, so would be better implemented as a (self-maintaining) category, and the list is unencyclopaedic, i.e. it would not be expected to be included in an encyclopaedia. This statement concerns me: "<a href="../../../y/a/s/Yasukuni_Shrine_834e.html" title="Yasukuni Shrine">Yasukuni Shrine</a> probably has a list by rank of every soldier who fought for Japan." It seems very much like an advocation for a data dump. This type of thing would be great for Wikisource or Wikibooks, but not for Wikipedia. To quote the founder "An encyclopedia is not a data dump. It serves to give readers a quick essential summary of what they want and need to know. In order to do this effectively, we must exercise careful and thoughtful editorial judgment, and one part of editorial judgment is an understanding that treating irrelevant data as on equal footing with the essentials, is confusing and a disservice to the reader.--Jimbo Wales 16:32, 16 October 2006 (UTC) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Havok&amp;oldid=81810155" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Havok&amp;oldid=81810155" rel="nofollow">link</a>" While the original argument was about notability, I believe his argument applies to this case as well. Certainly creating an article or mentioning the name EVERY Japanese military officer from WWII is counter to Wikipedia's notability goals. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 02:24, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
