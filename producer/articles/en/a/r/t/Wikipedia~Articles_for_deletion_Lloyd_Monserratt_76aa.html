<p>The result was <b>no consensus</b>, and thus <b>keep</b>. While the claims of not meeting WP:BIO are true enough on their face, WP:BIO itself is a only a guideline - even if it is to be used, a weak but real argument can be made for meeting it. The fact that this AFD was not closed after five days (indeed, it is now over ten) indicates that this is a tough decision, and I'm going to lean towards no consensus/keep. Keeping the page around does no harm, and while not as notable a person as Paris Hilton, it does seem likely that someone may come to Wikipedia one day looking for information about this person. The information is verifiable, it is not original research, and it adheres to a nuetral point of view. Were any of those three even remotely in doubt, a stronger case could be made for deletion, but the page as it exists seems to violate none of these. (P.S. The existence of suspicious sockpuppety "Keep" voters duly noted). <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 05:35, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Upon primary perusal, this entry seemed to be more appropriate for UCLAwiki (if such a thing exists). And after rereading the specifics of WP:BIO, he doesn't quite seem to fit any of the standards. However, the way the standards are written, activists would only fit into the "politics" category, which exclude local activists (many of whom already have Wikipedia articles) and others whose influence never extended beyond their own communities. For example, I'd hate to see my article on <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Zinzun_562d.html" title="Michael Zinzun">Michael Zinzun</a>, who never held any office at all, deleted just because he was only active in Los Angeles. These types of figures seldom receive the media coverage they deserve, especially when they are more <i>eminences grises</i>, like Montserrat was, than politicians. The way the standards are written, they favor the "dominant history" and even worse, pop icons who have no lasting influence on society, just because they have a "cult following".

<li><b>Keep</b> I was asked to look at this article by another user and render judgement. The first thing I did was make a <a href="http://www.google.com/custom?q=lloyd+monserratt" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/custom?q=lloyd+monserratt" rel="nofollow">google search</a>. I was surprised by the number of hits that came up, and that wikipedia ws number one, a couple are referenced in the article. The <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> has an <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE7DE103BF93AA15756C0A96E948260" class="external text" title="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE7DE103BF93AA15756C0A96E948260" rel="nofollow">article about</a> him. He was also quoted by <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Magazine_89f3.html" title="Time Magazine">Time Magazine</a> in a <a href="http://www.timeforkids.com/TFK/class/wr/article/0,17585,93897,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.timeforkids.com/TFK/class/wr/article/0,17585,93897,00.html" rel="nofollow">Texas election</a>.

I think that it is appropriate to leave the article. More importantly, I think that articles like this, and the process that admins use to get rid of articles is shortsighted and unfair. This article may be short and limited in scope, but after reviewing the notability standards, I think it just squeaks by.

<li><b>Comment</b> both of the articles you've mentioned would constitute a "trivial mention" per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, the other source was a blog by the mayor he worked for, which isn't a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> in my estimation and is also trivial. Also, he does not have 2 buildings named after him. He has one building named after him and one "dedicated" to him. Regardless, having a building named after you does not satisfy <i>any</i> of the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria.

<li><b>Comment</b> I would disagree with you on the first and second point because I think from all the links provided here (and what I've found looking around) all the mentions of Mr. Monserratt would be clasified as trivial. The newpaper articles mention him in passing or are obituary in nature. I don't see anything that establishes that he has achieved renown for newsworthy events. As for the Google Test/Verifiability... these are so called "Alternate tests" that have not gained any community consensus. Personally I don't think they have any value at all (the Google Test in particular is a rather poor marker of "notability") and as such are not a good indicator of "notabilty" or lack thereof.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 19:50, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Pretty much I agree with South Philly, above, but I think the article, while worthy of a wiki entry needs a bit of work to bring it to encyclopaedic standards, hence the "further development". --<a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMurcielago_d7c0.html" title="User:Murcielago">Murcielago</a> 03:15, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Final Comment</b> I am not going to be around for a few days - and the discussion on this will end before I come back. I just edited the article one last time. I feel like the article is worthy of keeping, and that Lloyd was notable. --<a href="../../../e/v/r/User%7EEvrik_3a44.html" title="User:Evrik">evrik</a> 18:54, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Parts of the story might only seem to some to be interesting only for those around southern Cal.

<li>These are statements of everyone's opinions, not policy. I'm sure there are any number of people with biographies on Wikipedia I would NOT find interesting but I'd get shouted down quite loudly if I nominated them on AfD. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnDBuell_751c.html" title="User:JohnDBuell">JohnDBuell</a> 14:07, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>It should also be noted how far this page has evolved since the afd tag was applied: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lloyd_Monserratt&amp;diff=66628369&amp;oldid=66002476" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lloyd_Monserratt&amp;diff=66628369&amp;oldid=66002476" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnDBuell_751c.html" title="User:JohnDBuell">JohnDBuell</a> 14:48, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>The problem is that while it has "evolved" it still has not evolved into an article that meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> The <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> list is preceded by the following disclaimer in bold text: "This is not intended to be an exclusionary list; just because someone doesn't fall into one of these categories doesn't mean an article on the person should automatically be deleted." The subject of this biographical entry certainly received press coverage during his lifetime, but would have received much more had his personal mission and style not been to work behind the scenes supporting and influencing others. It would be a shame to exclude him because he wasn't a publicity hound. Measured in terms of his impact on others and, through them, on politics and the quality of life in Los Angeles and elsewhere in California, Monserratt's impact was enormous. No doubt future Wikipedia entries relating to the people he worked with and inspired will mention Monserratt's role in their lives, and it would be helpful to be able to cross-reference those entries with this one.--<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Cocreatordude (<a href="../../../c/o/c/User_talk%7ECocreatordude_f536.html" title="User talk:Cocreatordude">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cocreatordude_8095.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cocreatordude">contribs</a>).</small> 09:00, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I have noticed a certain amount of bias and ignorance among wikipedia administrators. There are plenty of articles about middling white people, but an administrator who is ignorant about <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latinos.html" title="Latinos">Latinos</a> and their politics has free rein to try and get an article about a notable Latino deleted. If this article is deleted, it is a sad commentary on wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Since there seems to be an anti-Latino bias going on here, we had better start to bulk up the bios of <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Pacheco_2e86.html" title="Nick Pacheco">Nick Pacheco</a>, <a href="../../../x/a/v/Xavier_Becerra_a9de.html" title="Xavier Becerra">Xavier Becerra</a> and <a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Reyes_d884.html" title="Ed Reyes">Ed Reyes</a>, all of whom have bios shorter than Monserratt's.</dd>

An "Articles for Deletion" discussion is not the place for unfounded accusations (and I would add that if you spent a few weeks watching the AfD pages you would see there are just as many - if not more - deletions of articles about "middling white people" as you call them as there are about latinos, african americans, or any other ethnic group). Article length has nothing to do with it... <a href="../../../x/a/v/Xavier_Becerra_a9de.html" title="Xavier Becerra">Xavier Becerra</a> in particular from your example above most definitely meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, no matter how short his article is. <a href="../../../l/l/o/Lloyd_Monserratt_cba9.html" title="Lloyd Monserratt">Lloyd Monserratt</a>, for all the length of his article, does not meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> that is the issue here.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 17:54, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
