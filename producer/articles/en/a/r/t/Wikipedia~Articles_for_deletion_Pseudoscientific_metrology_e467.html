<li><b>Comment</b>: This is an excellent example of failure to even attempt <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a>. The article title displays a definite POV, and the body displays a different POV. If it were <i>entirely</i> up to me, I would rename the article to something like <b>Historical Metrology</b>, and set out both sides of the debate, being careful to maintain a balance between the sides.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>For those just tuning in, the debate is, basically, whether all current systems of weights and measures can be traced directly back to a set of African or Middle Eastern measurements of antiquity. Part of this is whether the source society knew enough about geometry to base their measurements on something as arcane as a <a href="../../../d/e/g/Degree_%28angle%29.html" title="Degree (angle)">degree</a>, one 360th part of a circle. There are reasoned arguments on both sides. Side questions include accuracy of the ancient measurements, which ancient society was the theoretical donor, and a bunch of things I'm leaving out intentionally.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> This page <b>Pseudoscientific metrology</b> is full of original research, ie; it consists entirely of opinion and speculation, and is full of phrases like ("seems to have been"). What it has for cites or references do not support that any of its allegations are true.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The article is a polemic against the anti metric movement which is attacked at least three times in the course of a page because it "spurred further activity".</dd>
<dd>It doesn't say what the activity was, but then goes off on a tangent to allege "many different" unspecified "theories" have a "common theme" and attempts to associate the anti metric movement with the French Acadamie of Sciences, Jean-Adolphe Decourdemanche, August Ox√©, Livo C. Stecchini, John F. Neal, Alexander Thom and his ideas about a Megalithic yard.</dd>
<dd>Additionally this article engages in several other unsubstantiated attacks which have no basis in fact and taken as a whole is essentially patent nonsense. <a href="../../../r/k/t/User%7ERktect_7070.html" title="User:Rktect">Rktect</a> 01:01, August 23, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Woah, woah, woah, are we looking at the same article here? What I see is strongly sourced and very well written.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I originally wrote this, and I will thus not cast a vote. I can easily see much room for improvment in POV bias in the wording. It is also a problem, like for other areas of pseudoscience, that the ideas of <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stecchini.html" title="Stecchini">Stecchini</a> et al has largely been ignored by the scientific community. But the real issue is how Wikipedia should treat claims like:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The ancient units of measure of Mesopotamia and Egypt (dating from several thousand years BC) are directly defined by the circumference of the Earth.</li>
<li>All ancient systems of measurement were built on each other, and exact definitions existed that related them</li>
<li>There exists a <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megalithic_Yard_fe8f.html" title="Megalithic Yard">Megalithic Yard</a>. It can be directly linked to the Mesopotamian measures</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Etc. I guess if this is to be accepted and described as bona fide science then Wikipedia is not what I though it was. -- <a href="../../../e/g/i/User%7EEgil_938c.html" title="User:Egil">Egil</a> 03:22, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Is the Megalithic Yard truly pseudoscience? Or is it just controversial? The article makes it seem "weakly controversial". In physics there is a pretty clear delineation between controversial and pseudoscience, and the wiki articles reflects that in phrases like "widely considered psuedoscience" or "considered controversial" etc. etc. You might want to retitle the article here however. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> 03:30, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, rename to something less obviously slanted. There is extensive precedent in WP to document widespread, well-known crankery. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWile_E._Heresiarch_9879.html" title="User:Wile E. Heresiarch">Wile E. Heresiarch</a> 03:40, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Lets get the terms straight.

<li><b>Rewrite and merge</b> with <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metrology.html" title="Metrology">metrology</a> as historical context.

<ul>
<li>The problem is that it '<i><b>doesn't'</b></i> cite good authority as to why these theories are wrong. It speculates, opines and expects you to agree that well obviously they must be wrong without any proof. That is what makes a thing pseudo science in the first place.<a href="../../../r/k/t/User%7ERktect_7070.html" title="User:Rktect">Rktect</a> 16:07, August 26, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep,</b> probably rename, rewrite to NPOV. Interesting and valid topic. Rename to what? I don't like "historical metrology," that's <i>too</i> nonspecific and neutral, i.e. there could be and I expect there is a valid "historical metrology" but this isn't it. This would seem to be closely related to <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyramidology.html" title="Pyramidology">Pyramidology</a>. More so than to metrology, I'd say, but of course that's my own POV showing. Maybe the title could reflect this somehow. (Actually our articles on <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyramidology.html" title="Pyramidology">Pyramidology</a> and <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyramid_power.html" title="Pyramid power">Pyramid power</a> seem to be very thin, don't they?) <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 14:29, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>How could you rewrite this to NPOV without deleting everything it says? As an architect I consider measuring, weighing and judging based on the evidence to be the very essence of science</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>so labeling what people have learned about measurement "pseudoscience" or "pyramidology" seems pretty weird.<a href="../../../r/k/t/User%7ERktect_7070.html" title="User:Rktect">Rktect</a></p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I beg to differ on two accounts:
<ul>
<li>Over-use of terms like <i>metrologist</i> and <i>geometer</i> are typical indicators of <i>bs</i>.</li>
<li>The Megalithic-Yard-believers are just one fraction. There are many others. What about <a href="http://www.sonic.net/bernard/saturn.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sonic.net/bernard/saturn.html" rel="nofollow">this beauty</a>? So I think merging with MY is not good. I would also hate seeing this stuff merged with <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metrology.html" title="Metrology">metrology</a>. Also, <i>historic meterology</i> is plain misleading. This <b>is</b> pseudoscience, but a more NPOV term can be found, like <i>alternative</i>. I'd rather call a spade a spade, however.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and possibly rename. It is useful to synthesize the various more-or-less heterodox theories positing hidden uniformities in ancient measures. The article could of course use more work, but every article can. I am not sure what a good title would be, though. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 21:39, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Call a spade a spade. Calling pseudoscience what it is not POV ladened, it's simply being honest. Changing it to <i>Historical</i> or <i>Alternative</i> is misleading. This stuff is what it is: pseudoscience. If we are renaming it, let's at least keep it honest and not wishy-washy.
<ul>
<li>As Egil says, the megalithic yard is just part of the story so we can't move it there. We could, of course, move MY here but I don't think this is a good idea. There is enough content in MY to warrant a seperate article.</li>
<li>It is little surprise at all that the nomination for deletion comes from our friend Rktect. Please take no offence, Rktect, I mean no personal attack. I'm sure you fully believe in what you're claiming and think what you're doing is the right thing.</li>
<li>For those unfamiliar with what's going on: Rktect has been avidly working on many measurement articles. His contributions generally promote this one-and-the-same-system-throughout-history theory. Before slapping the VfD tag on this article he rewrote it.
