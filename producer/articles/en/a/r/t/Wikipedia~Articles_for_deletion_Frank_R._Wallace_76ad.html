<p><a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>.</p>
<p>OK, allow me to give some background of this whole matter. Once upon a time, there was a man named Wallace Ward. He decided to call himself Frank R. Wallace, and then started a publishing company called I &amp; O Publishing, later called <a href="../../../i/n/t/Integrated_Management_Associates_87e9.html" title="Integrated Management Associates">Integrated Management Associates</a> (IMA). This company sells books expounding a philosophical doctrine called Neo-Tech. So we have 3 things:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <b>person</b> — Frank R. Wallace;</li>
<li>the <b>company</b> — I &amp; O Publishing a.k.a. Neo-Tech Publishing a.k.a. IMA;</li>
<li>the <b>philosophical doctrine</b> — Neo-Tech.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, here's the thing: there are something like 0.000 reliable sources — as in, peer-reviewed journals or news sources with editorial oversight — which specifically discuss Wallace the <i>person</i>. Where news sources discuss Wallace, their stories are about his <i>company</i>, i.e. IMA: see</p>
<ul>
<li>2005. <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Mystical-letter-scam-warning/2005/05/03/1114886348579.html" class="external text" title="http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Mystical-letter-scam-warning/2005/05/03/1114886348579.html" rel="nofollow">'Mystical' letter scam warning</a>. <i>The Age Online</i>.</li>
<li>Levene, Tony (2005). <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian_jobs_and_money/story/0,3605,1385255,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian_jobs_and_money/story/0,3605,1385255,00.html" rel="nofollow">Secret society rubbish is fit only for the bin</a>. <i>Guardian Unlimited</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBridge_%26_Tunnel_0efc.html" title="User:Bridge &amp; Tunnel">User:Bridge &amp; Tunnel</a> has tried to show that Wallace the <i>person</i> is "notable" by appealing to the following sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Friedman, Stan (2006). <i>Dogs Playing Poker: Poker Kit</i>. Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1402734484</a>.</li>
<li>Schreiber, Lee Robert (2005). <i>Poker as Life: 101 Lessons from the World's Greatest Game. Hearst Books</i>. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1588164616</a>.</li>
<li>Hope, Tony: Hart, Markus; Wilson, Vicki (2005). Fresh Wisdom: Breakthough to Enlightenment<i>. BookSurge Publishing. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1419618555</a>.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>However, as far as I can tell, these sources hadn't undergone any rigorous fact-checking or peer-review process, they weren't written by known authorities on the subject at hand (i.e. Frank R. Wallace, the <i>person</i>), and neither do they devote significant amount of space to discussing Wallace the man.</p>
<p>Also, although this article was marked with the {{Notability}} tag only this month, it had already been in an unreliable state as long as it existed (since 2005 Dec 22).</p>
<p>-- <a href="../../../b/i/_/User%7EBi_fef5.html" title="User:Bi">Bi</a> 15:47, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Of course "Bi" above left out some sources like the law textook "Laws of Evidence" which discusses Wallace's legal escapades. It devotes over a page to the matter and entitled the section "Can 'Truth' By Replaced with 'Fully Integrated Honesty?'" And he neglected to mention that the New York Times had an article about it <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10610FD3D5E0C708EDDA10894DA494D81&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fI%2fIncome%20Tax" class="external autonumber" title="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10610FD3D5E0C708EDDA10894DA494D81&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fI%2fIncome%20Tax" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. And he left out the fact that DC Comics issued a comic book series based on Wallace's philosophy of Neo-Tech called <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarky.html" title="Anarky">Anarky</a>. And he neglected to mention that Wallace is a prolific author. Do a search on Amazon or other book outlet to see how many books he's written. <a href="http://amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/104-2451330-3996736?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=frank+r.+wallace" class="external autonumber" title="http://amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/104-2451330-3996736?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=frank+r.+wallace" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBridge_%26_Tunnel_0efc.html" title="User:Bridge &amp; Tunnel">Bridge &amp; Tunnel</a> 17:24, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The law textbook and the New York Times article are about a specific court case. This means that the <i>court case</i> is notable, but says nothing about the notability of Wallace the <i>person</i>. (Besides, even if one admits these sources, all they say is that Wallace changed "truth" to "fully-integrated honesty" in his oath. Certainly not enough to justify having an entire article on the man.) And Anarky certainly isn't a peer-reviewed source by any stretch.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, Wallace being a prolific author has nothing to do with notability. Again, the issue is whether any <i>peer-reviewed</i> sources by <i>other people</i> have mentioned Wallace the <i>person</i>.</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - although the nominator's point is valid about the distinction between the person and his idea/philosophical doctrine, the long list of external sources does demonstrate some notability for both the man and the concept. Bear in mind also that <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-Tech_71c3.html" title="Neo-Tech">Neo-Tech</a> redirects to this article, so if the concept of Neo-Tech is notable (which it seems to be, owing to the wide number of external sources quoted in the article) then this article can't be deleted. Alternatively, <b>rename</b> to Neo-Tech to reflect the fact that the concept is more notable than the person. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 17:27, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that the philosophy Neo-Tech is more notable than the person, but the person is still notable. If someone's books and philosophy are then by default the author of those is notable. Besides his classic court cases which are cited in legal studies books make him notable too. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBridge_%26_Tunnel_0efc.html" title="User:Bridge &amp; Tunnel">Bridge &amp; Tunnel</a> 17:34, 23 February 2007 (UTC) <small>— <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBridge_%26_Tunnel_0efc.html" title="User:Bridge &amp; Tunnel">Bridge &amp; Tunnel</a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBridge_%26_Tunnel_7686.html" title="User talk:Bridge &amp; Tunnel">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bridge_%26_Tunnel_38ba.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bridge &amp; Tunnel">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></dd>

<dd>As I've pointed out above, most of this "long list of external sources" isn't anywhere near reliable. It seems that the only sources that talk about this whole bunch of stuff with any amount of reliability are the two newspaper articles I quoted above, and they're both about IMA the <i>company</i>. <a href="../../../b/i/_/User%7EBi_fef5.html" title="User:Bi">Bi</a> 17:47, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b><s>Weak</s> Keep</b> The nominator lost me when he started talking about peer reviewed articles etc, and the sarcastic 0.000 references. Peer review is not a requirement for recognizing notability. We are not advocating his teachings, just reporting that he exisited and why he is notable. I do think that the article vcould use some cleanup. <s>If the nominator seriously defeated the intergrity of each reference in a cogent manner, I could be convinced to support the nomination.</s> --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 20:39, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

The nominator maintains his own anti/ridicule-Neo-Tech web page <a href="http://zompower.tk/" class="external autonumber" title="http://zompower.tk/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and seems to spend all his time on the internet in various message bases trashing the philosophy, Frank Wallace, and others involved in it. If it's not notable then why would he devote so much energy to it? I suspect he wants to delete it simply because someone has added material to it recently that he doesn't like. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeMystical_c76d.html" title="User:JoeMystical">JoeMystical</a> 03:10, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Why wait a year? I can explain that: one reason's that I wasn't that familiar with Wikipedia policy a year ago, and it didn't occur to me to put this article up for AfD.

<li><b>Comment</b> Also, peer review, or at least reliability as per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <i>is</i> indeed a requirement for recognizing notability, according to the policy write-up itself.
