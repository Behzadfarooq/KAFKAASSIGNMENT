<li><b>Keep</b> Actually, I read the New Yorker article, and it was phenomenal and enlightening.

<li><b>Keep</b> Obviously you all were not at symphony hall to hear Fulton’s virtuosic performance of the Korngold Concerto. Check out the Boston Globe’s review. Heifetz, who sent the concerto back to Korngold calling it unplayable, sat in the audience and listened incredulously as his student mastered the piece’s demanding technical elements while handling the delicate melodies with style and flair. It is ignorant of you to dismiss Fulton so quickly. I believe she is one of the greatest musicians of our time as well as an insightful social theorist. –George Thkanhktopsis, Distinguished Professor of Economics, University of Chicago.
<ul>
<li>When did this supposedly happen? There is no "Ria Fulton" in the Boston Globe's online archives.

<li><b>Keep</b> Capitalist, I am aware of Google's limitations when it comes to such geniuses as Ria Fulton. Her works are highly undocumented because of her largely reclusive personality.

<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia may be the only way to expose the world to Fulton, although what is known about her amazing life may be in cryptic form, wikipedia's open editing has allowed everyone to contribute his own piece to the puzzle. Johnny Stephenson, North Carolina Historian.

<li><b>Keep</b> We noted a typo which has most likely been causing a lot of confusion... Fulton was born in 1952, not 1982. And the references to Phillip Glass and John Cage were meant metaphorically, of course. Hope this clears everything up. - James Wannamaker, Director of Folklore and English Studies at Boston College

<li><b>Comment</b> You’re not supposed to scare away new users by calling them childish. I took Fulton’s class at Sloan, The Laguna Beach Love Triangle and Communism. She was very secretive; she lectured from behind a screen and used some sort of voice modulator. Nevertheless her insights were profound. Today’s culture is not taken seriously by many modern scholars; it is refreshing to see Fulton’s open-mindedness showcased here on Wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> At the opening of Memorial Hall in Chapel Hill this weekend (September 10, 2005) Itzhak Perlman spotted a member of Fulton’s entourage, Nat Shelness, in the audience. During intermission Perlman approached Shelness and asked about Fulton, who was listening to the concert from the Royal Box. Perlman was admitted to the box and invited Fulton to perform. Reluctantly, Fulton agreed to perform Bach’s Double Concerto. Fulton performed from behind a screen. Leonard Slatkin dropped his baton in amazement during the first movement. Fulton’s papers are kept under lock and key, they will be published posthumously at her request, at the Southern Historical Collection in the Wilson Library at UNC-Chapel Hill. She is also discussed at length in one of Gerald Moore’s autobiographies, of course he doesn’t refer to her by her name. -Dylan Roberts, Poet Laureate of the Judith Oakley Institute for the Advancement of the English Language.
<ul>
<li>Hm. Nat Shelness seems to be yet again another student in Winston-Salem, in the same high school class as Ria Fulton. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 21:28, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am writing a book on the folklore and mystery surrounding Fulton’s life. My agent is in contact with Simon and Schuster, Little, Brown, and Bantam.
