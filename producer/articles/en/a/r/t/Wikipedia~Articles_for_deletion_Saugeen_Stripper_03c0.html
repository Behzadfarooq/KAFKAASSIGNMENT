It appears to me that some people are confusing the concepts of encyclopedic value and news-worthiness. Many topics make the news, even at a national scale, that have little or no encyclopedic merit. In my opinion, the Saugeen stripper made the news simply because the story was sensational, rather than the story having any social value. Irrespective of my beliefs, the article stays because of a lack of consensus. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMindmatrix_3c6f.html" title="User:Mindmatrix"><font color="#8B4513">Mind</font></a><a href="../../../m/i/n/User_talk%7EMindmatrix_738b.html" title="User talk:Mindmatrix"><font color="#EE8811">matrix</font></a> 17:00, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>How about because <a href="../../../i/s/n/WP%7EISNOT_f5c2.html" title="WP:ISNOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information?</a> Every day countless billions of things happen, millions of them are reported locally, thousands of them are reported more widely, hundreds go on to become continuing stories, and one or two might become globally notable events - and only after time has lent some perspective can we tell which is which. Given that this article doesn't even have basic facts like date and names, I would suggest it is a minor titillating story to pad out local newspapers on a slow news day and of no discernible encyclopaedic merit. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 20:22, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep keep keep</b>. All of the sources are legit. It is a legitimate pop culture occurence that has received tons of national and international press. This deserves an entry, absolutely and without question. There may be moral questions, but those who have a problem with it can cite nothing other than personal feelings for the subject. Should we start allowing subjects of wikipedia articles based on true events determine what is said here? This is a SOURCE for information based on real happenings!! ... clearly, those who are pushing most ardently for the removal of the page are doing so based not in any violation of wikipedia policy, or lack of relevance in information, but rather due to personal relationships with the apparent subject of the article. Deletion for these reasons and these reasons alone is a slippery slope. THAT to be seems to be the most dangerous precedent of all. That said, I will defer to the decision of the admin, but I strongly believe deletion would be wrong.<a href="../../../t/o/k/User%7ETokyojoe2002_0497.html" title="User:Tokyojoe2002">Tokyojoe2002</a> 19:13, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>The story is more the mainstream propogation of the story, and how quickly that happened (granted over 2 months after the event), the actual events are a footnote compared to that, furthermore, reporting on the speed of how quickly a story spreads, in the mainstream media, is effectively giving the story a very large booster shot, which in my oppinion makes it a conflict of interest, as then the media sources are directly involved in the story on which they are repeating.

<li>To the admins, when making your final call, I ask that you consider the that a number of those on the delete side seem to have an agenda other than providing Wikipedians with information. IF the story is legit, and has spawned national and internation interest, and has spread onto over 22,000 websites, then it IS A STORY and it belongs here for people to know about. As of now, no real names are used, and while I think that it would be a valid piece of information to the article, the fact is, it can stay that way if needed. But to keep the story off of the pages here for some arbitrary moral reasons that fly in the face of the provision of information is not the answer.<a href="../../../t/o/k/User%7ETokyojoe2002_0497.html" title="User:Tokyojoe2002">Tokyojoe2002</a> 01:25, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm wondering, other than the fact that you made the article, what is your stake in this? Do you really believe that wikipedia must educate the world about how some nameless girl stripped for a room full of guys one night in unversity? Why is this worth reading? If you live in saugeen I'd love to sit you down and ask you in person why you feel it is so completely important that you educate the masses on exactly what happened that night in that room. And if you don't live in saugeen, why is this so important to you? It would just be some drama that happened "over there" at the UWO. I knew far more about the story than is posted in the article <b>the day after it happened</b> and you don't see me vehemently defending the article I created about the incident. I'm sure I've said this before, cause I think it's pretty catchy and illustrates the point very well, but please, show her the respect that she (arguably) didn't show herself that night and just let it go. I really have nothing else to add. I sincerely hope that you see where I'm coming from with this. -<a href="../../../o/x/x/User%7EOxxiox_0825.html" title="User:Oxxiox">Oxxiox</a> 01:13, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> as non-notable and hardly verifiable. Not all events having had media coverage (even at the level of national broadcast) are for WP: I have seen a report on a car accident in the last TV news program, but yet we don't have and should not have an article on it. - Liberatore(<a href="../../../p/a/o/User_talk%7EPaolo_Liberatore_53e0.html" title="User talk:Paolo Liberatore">T</a>) 19:07, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia inclusion is merited as this story had a very brief, but very loud, impact on the web. this is a term coined in national media that now has name recognition and a story behind it. scanning the list of articles on the afd page, most had very little meaning to me, but this one had instant recognition and the article, while lacking many details (and needing a rewrite), provides an outline of this semi-major media event. <a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPhantasmo_d655.html" title="User:Phantasmo">Phantasmo</a> 20:15, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak delete</b> I'll concede that it's received some attention in press blurbs and blogs, but ultimately I think it sets a bad precedent to include flash-in-the-pan stories like this. It's certainly not the first time something scandalous has happened in a dorm. <a href="../../../o/h/n/User%7EOhnoitsjamie_fc14.html" title="User:Ohnoitsjamie">Ohnoitsjamie</a> 18:28, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
