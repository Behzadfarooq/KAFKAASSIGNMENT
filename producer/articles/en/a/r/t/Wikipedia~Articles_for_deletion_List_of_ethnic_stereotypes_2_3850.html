<li>This re-nomination is sooner than I prefer, but if one actually reads the list, it is clear that it is NOT informative, as many line-items are not widely held, which means they are original research and/or unverifiable. Austrians "Annoy people by singing everywhere they go..."? Puh-leaze, I am in the US and I'm not aware of anyone who supports that view. Suggesting the list should be moved to 'US stereotypes' assigns the US even more of a small-mindedness than it deserves. Dutch "speak English better than British or Americans"? Sez whoo? Icelanders "...love to fight when intoxicated"? since when is that not true of a good percentage of any nationality? Native Americans "often live on reservations"--well duh, but is it by choice? WASP Americans "favor Gin &amp; Tonics over other drinks, call them G&amp;Ts"--my ancestors are all from the British Isles, except for one German and one Flemish, but give me vodka&amp;7-up any day. And many have entries like "women have large breasts", "alcoholics", "smoke too much"--like any of these are really limited to certain nationalities/ethnicities, and to whatever extent it may be true isn't accurately represented in this list. <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 19:38, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Even after removing the many things on the list that are <b>not</b> stereotypes, if any of this information was accurate, useful or interesting, we would have seen at least some of it added to each ethnicy/nationality entry. While such a list may seem to have potential at first, I think the case against it is made more clear when one considers the prospect of having this information listed on each ethnicy/nationality entry. It seems to me that a vote to keep is a vote for including its contents on respective ethnic/nation entries. Please also consider the reasons why nothing on this list has its own entry. I agree with all reasons listed by Neutrality. --<a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParaphelion_56c8.html" title="User:Paraphelion">Paraphelion</a> 21:00, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I think there's an excellent article to be made on this topic, and it would be fascinating to learn where all these got started, how they're perpetuated, how accurate they are (if at all), backlash against them, etc. If it's just a context-free list though, it isn't really helping anybody. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 22:36, Feb 26, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I support having a list of ethnic stereotypes, but only if it is sourced and the stereotypes are attributed to the people who hold them.

<li><b>Keep</b>. A descriptive list of what stereotypes are out there is encyclopedic and maybe even useful. It is irrelevant whether we like them or not.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This descriptive list of stereotypes is highly encyclopedic. Of course many of them are hateful. Shall we just put our heads in the sand and pretend that prejucice doesn't exist?

<li>An article under this title could be very useful and scholarly; it could discuss the history of each stereotype, who holds or held it, and even what incidents it derives from. This article, by contrast, reads like a bunch of random surfers put it together... um, well, yes. That said, <b>keep</b> for now in the hopes that someone completely rewrites it; you never know, they might find the examples useful by way of a sort of skeletal framework. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 01:29, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm sure we can all agree this article is crap the way it is now. It's more important than usual to carefully verify <i>everything</i> so we make sure nobody's slipping in POV and original research, which is pretty easy to do with a list like this. It's a daunting task, but it's been done before. List of celebrities with links to the US Republican Party, a VfD survivor with somewhat similar POV and verifiability pitfalls, now has a source for every entry. While that article's not exactly feature quality, it's a good example of how articles headed for the VfD scrapheap can be saved. <a href="../../../s/z/y/User%7ESzyslak_7117.html" title="User:Szyslak"><font color="green">/sɪzlæk</font></a><a href="../../../s/z/y/User_talk%7ESzyslak_c549.html" title="User talk:Szyslak"><font color="green">˺/</font></a> 02:14, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That list has one very important feature that this list lacks - items deserving of their own entries. Having said that, that list is still pretty poor. Have you looked at the references? One reference on some obscure blog or one mention of a donation is all it seems to take to label an actor as linked to the Republican party. That's a pretty useless list, to be used as nothing more than a rumormill. Respective articles on snopes.com would probably be more informative. This list has even less potential. --<a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParaphelion_56c8.html" title="User:Paraphelion">Paraphelion</a> 09:47, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Specatular double fallacy. You haven't shown that Germans aren't allowed to forget their sins. Even if that is true, the accountability is not a result of this list, therefore this list would not be substantial as far as whether or not other race's sins are allowed to be forgotten. By the way, what a lovely concept that you believe in, this 'sin of races'. --<a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParaphelion_56c8.html" title="User:Paraphelion">Paraphelion</a> 19:14, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Current contents are unverified (and in my opinion, nonsense in many cases). If someone <i>does</i> find evidence documenting specifically who held each of these beliefs and under what circumstances, that content would be far better discussed either in the article about the ethnicity or the article about the bigot. This "list of" article conjoins topics that do not really relate to each other. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 07:24, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. If there's an encyclopedia article hiding in here, I can't find it. If there is something encyclopedic to be written on this topic, let someone start with a nice clean redlink.

<ul>
<li>The result was <i>not</i> keep; there was no consensus. I count 24 deletes and 17 keeps (of various forms). Relisting is perfectly kosher. —<a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorath_83d6.html" title="User:Korath">Korath</a> (<a href="../../../k/o/r/User_talk%7EKorath_cda5.html" title="User talk:Korath">Talk</a>) 12:23, Mar 2, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's strange because there is "The result of the debate was KEEP" at the top of the old VfD page. That was the admin's decision, probably based on the fact that many of those who voted delete aren't familiar with the deletion policy (which doesn't list POV/lack of sources as the reason for deletion). <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue">Grue</a> 12:53, 2 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's a <i>deletion policy</i>, not a deletion <i>rule</i>. It rather sounds to me like you're unclear on the difference between <i>policy</i> and <i>rule</i>, and don't seem to understand that the deletion policy isn't some sort of constitution that VfD decisions are required to adhere to: what the VfD voters decide -- and how the admins interpret them -- <b>is</b> policy, no matter what legalistic rule-to-the-letter that Wikilawyers attempt. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 07:00, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: I can't see how this can be POV, when it's clearly stated in the article that these are stereotypes and not facts.

<p>This page is now preserved as an archive of the debate and, like some other VfD subpages, is no longer 'live'. Subsequent comments on the issue, the deletion, or the decision-making process should be placed on the relevant 'live' pages. <b>Please do not edit this page</b>.</p>
