<p>This article is unencyclopedic. All it materially consisted of was a cut and paste from the Internet Sacred Text Archive from a source dating to somewhere in the 1800s, meaning that it is possibly completely inaccurate with respect to modern obligations. Without that, as the article currently stands, there is nothing else to say about the topic that isn't already mentioned in the main <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freemasonry.html" title="Freemasonry">Freemasonry</a> article. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 00:39, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If it makes you happier, I am perfectly happy to "disclose" being a Freemason.

<dd>A discussion on the reliability should probably take place on the talk page of the article, but the first couple of paragraphs, which are on the subject of <b>Obligations in Freemasonry</b> are verifiably referenced. The aspect that there is a problem with is self-referential, therefore not inherently verifiable. But that's not the point of this is it?ALR 17:53, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

That many voters on this page are Freemasons is only to be expected, given that the article is part of Wikiproject Freemasonry (which obviously attracts Freemasons).

<li><b>Delete</b> - The problems with the 1800s source go beyond being inaccurate with today's masonic rituals. It was not even accurate in respect to any ritual used in the 1800s. While the selection that was cut and pasted conveniently did not include it, another section of the source has Masons swearing to obey the rules and regs of a "General Grand Royal Arch Chapter of the United States of America" - a body which never existed. Without that material, the article is indeed duplicative of the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freemasonry.html" title="Freemasonry">Freemasonry</a> article. And while "secret masonic rituals" may be an interesting or "cool" topic for non-masons, an article that is duplicative of another is unencyclopedic. And before the usual "Keep, but clean up" croud chimes in... the article already says everything that can be said on the topic. There is nothing that could be added to "clean" it up. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 02:57, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Schmucky, The article itself is not a simple cut and paste, just the quotations taken from sacredtexts.com (now deleted). Nor is the article (as it currently stands) untruthful swill. The current material is actually very well referenced and factual. The issue is that it is duplicative of material that is already presented elsewhere. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 14:09, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> That's precisely the trouble - there is no true and current version, because there is no one single universal Masonic ritual. It is decided upon individually by each Grand Lodge. There are always going to be differences, and there's no one obligation that takes precedence as "correct". People are constantly going to be debating on this, changing the article so it matches what they know. If this article material exists on ISTA, why simply duplicate it here? This is not WP's purpose, and there's nothing that can be said that isn't already mentioned in the main Freemasonry article. I fail to see the <i>encyclopedic value</i> in this article, which is why I put it up for AfD. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 19:26, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>There is also the problem that Masonic rituals have traditionally been unpublished. The few versions that <i>have</i> been published are all like the source that was deleted from the article: they are either outdated, unverifiable, demonstratibly wrong, or proven hoaxes. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 20:36, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll just point out that you should have picked up that there is a reference to at least one current set of obligations and given that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia rather than a repository of source material, then it's inappropriate to copy that verbatim.ALR 23:08, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> I understand what you are getting at, but you cannot republish current, verifiable versions as to do such would be a gross breach of copyright. I am breaching no masonic rule when I tell you that they were last majorly revised (under UGLE juristriction) in 1986, and can perfectly legitimately be found within <a href="http://www.lewismasonic.com/product_info.php?products_id=53" class="external text" title="http://www.lewismasonic.com/product_info.php?products_id=53" rel="nofollow">this book</a>, if you are willing to pay £12. I cannot speak for other juristrictions. To reiterate, these are not secrets and so there is no reason why masons would be trying to hide them. The versions given on the article are not at all verifiable, and so should be removed. Once they are removed, there is nothing in this article that isn't in the freemasonry article. Therefore, the article should be deleted. Dave 21:53, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>AFD/Prod brings attention to the page, I never knew MSJ did that before this came to my attention.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> The article content itself doesn't appear to add anything to the existing portfolio and appears to be a vehicle to bear un-representative material. The explanation given already indicates why the padding is superfluous and inaccurate, providing a reference for contemporary material. I suppose there could be potential to expand into a discussion of obligations in general, perhaps including material about the promises one makes when being baptised and confirmed in the Christian church etc, but without this broadening it's an de-contextualised section from elsewhere which doesn't say anything more than is already explained in context.ALR 23:07, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> As articulated by <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">User:Blueboar</a>, the only material that remains after removal of all that is non sourced is duplication of article content found elsewhere upon wikipedia. Dave 00:23, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per Blueboar and others and <b>redirect</b> to main Freemasonry article - without the alleged (and I've yet to see any proof it is accurate, or was/is used by any masonic body) obligations, nothing here that isn't covered allready in main article. As to the wisdom of including alleged obligations without any proof to it's accuracy... I feel that goes against <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, but others milage may vary. <a href="../../../w/e/g/User%7EWegianWarrior_abbf.html" title="User:WegianWarrior">WegianWarrior</a> 07:17, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> if only source for full reproductions of obligations is Sacred Texts Archive, then we have a few problems: first of all, ISTA is currently being looked at for a number of copyright violations by the heirs of some author's whose work is on ST. This makes Sacred Texts, as a source, a poor choice. Secondly, given that all jurisdictions use their own version of the ritual, there is no way for the article to be a comprehensive encylopedic look at it. All that can bee said, if direct quotes are given, is that "This is what Duncan's says the obligations are. What the actual versions as used by various jurisidictions are, is speculative and original research."--<a href="../../../v/i/d/User%7EVidkun_7f51.html" title="User:Vidkun">Vidkun</a> 17:25, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> both objections are spurious. As Duncan's was first published in 1866, there is no possibility that it is still protected by copyright. Also, it is available in print as well as from ST. ST provides a convenient source for instant verification. Two, Masonic editors keep removing or revising two sources which say that Duncan's is still in use in some Prince Hall jurisdictions, particualar Missouri. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrater_Xyzzy_0e2b.html" title="User:Frater Xyzzy">Frater Xyzzy</a> 17:37, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> neither objection is spurious. Sacred texts as a website should not be used because of the ongoing copyright issues on various other items. I'm well aware that Duncan's is public domain, however, <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> has commentary about not linking to sites which reproduce copyrighted material. ST <i>themselves</i> say they can't get copyright clearances on some of the stuff they reproduce, thus disqualifying them as a source for wikipedia. And as for the second, you can show that one Masonic author claims the PHA Missouri uses Duncan's. Can you prove that any other one does? If not, why not title the article "Obligations of Freemasonry from Duncan's exposé, as used by PHA MO"? why aren't you trying to include the material from "Three Distinct Knocks" or "Jachin and Boaz", which would easily show that, among the exposés there is disagreement on what the obligations are.--<a href="../../../v/i/d/User%7EVidkun_7f51.html" title="User:Vidkun">Vidkun</a> 17:44, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> not that's TOTAL BS. WP is a collaborative project. I have access to certain material, which I am using. If you have access to other material, then use it.

<p><b>A plague on both your houses.</b> The anti-masons are so desparate to include whatever material they can - as such, they are constantly creating articles like this one that are basically crufty crap but refrenced. The masons are so desparate to hide whatever stupid secrets they have that they are constantly flying right off the handle with what amounts to serial revert-wars and mass procedural attacks on anything that purports to reveal the sooper sekrits. Yet another case where if I was in charge, I'd get rid of each and every one of you. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 21:59, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As I've mentioned on the article talk page, I am not anti-Masonic. Nor do I see any evidence that any of the editors voting to keep the article are doing so for anti-Masonic reasons... <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrater_Xyzzy_0e2b.html" title="User:Frater Xyzzy">Frater Xyzzy</a> 22:11, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There may a dichotomy at play, but not it's probably not that simple.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I think the article breaks up the rather lengthy Freemasonry article and provides a sample of obligations. Concerns expressed about the validity of the obligations shown and their applicability universally should be adequately described in the article. <a href="../../../b/d/e/User%7EBdevoe_29d8.html" title="User:Bdevoe">Bdevoe</a> 22:14, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
