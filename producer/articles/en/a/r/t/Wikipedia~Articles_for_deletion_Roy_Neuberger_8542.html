<p>To: Wikipedia</p>
<p>The article about Roy Neuberger should be deleted immediately for the following reasons: it contains a malicious, personal attack on Mr. Neuberger and his son, Roy S. Neuberger, and entirely falsifies their relationship - which is close and not at all estranged - and contains anti-Semitic overtones. Mere editing will be insufficient, because the earlier version would always be accessible. The article is causing family members great pain and must be deleted; it serves no good purpose to let it remain online. The attached article contains accurate information about Mr. Neuberger and should replace the deleted article.</p>
<p>Sincerely, James Kaufman Esq. Attorney for Roy R. Neuberger and Family 70.110.155.253 18:39, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Roy Neuberger</b> (born <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_21.html" title="July 21">July 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1903.html" title="1903">1903</a>) is an <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> <a href="../../../f/i/n/Financier.html" title="Financier">financier</a> who has contributed to the cause of public awareness and publicity of <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_art.html" title="Modern art">modern art</a> through acquisition of painting and sculpture and donation of many pieces of art to educational institutions and museums. He is the founding partner and eponym of the investment firm <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neuberger_%26_Berman_22f4.html" title="Neuberger &amp; Berman">Neuberger &amp; Berman</a>.</p>
<p>Neuberger was born in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridgeport%2C_Connecticut_494c.html" title="Bridgeport, Connecticut">Bridgeport, Connecticut</a>, and spent his childhood in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>. He was orphaned at the age of 12. He describes himself as having been interested during high school in tennis and "the ladies". He matriculated at <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_University_dca5.html" title="New York University">New York University</a>, originally to study journalism, but grew restless and dropped out without obtaining a degree.</p>
<p>His first job was working at B. Altman's, then the leading <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan.html" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> department store. There he learned the ins and outs of business.</p>
<p>Leaving his job at Altman's, he sailed to Europe at age 20 on an inheritance from his parents and went to live in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>. He lived his <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohemian.html" title="Bohemian">bohemian</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/a/Roaring_Twenties_f9df.html" title="Roaring Twenties">Roaring Twenties</a> existence there, where he visited the <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louvre.html" title="Louvre">Louvre</a> three times a week and met his lifelong friend <a href="../../../m/e/y/Meyer_Shapiro_267a.html" title="Meyer Shapiro">Meyer Shapiro</a>. He studied art in Paris and throughout Europe.</p>
<p>In 1928 he read Floret Fels' biography of <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vincent_Van_Gogh_ee92.html" title="Vincent Van Gogh">Vincent Van Gogh</a>. Neuberger was startled when he learned how Van Gogh had only sold one painting, and was heartstricken to learn that Van Gogh, like so many other artists, had lived in pain, poverty and misery. Thousands of excellent artists were suffering in obscurity and the world might never know what they had created. Neuberger wanted a way to give deserving but unknown artists a chance at fame, recognition and financial success.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, Neuberger decided to go "where the money is." He moved back to the United States and entered <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wall_Street_9499.html" title="Wall Street">Wall Street</a> in 1929, seven months before <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Tuesday_4d0f.html" title="Black Tuesday">Black Tuesday</a>. He started out with the firm of Halle &amp; Steiglitz and sold RCA shares short, right through the stock market crash at the beginning of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a>. He founded Neuberger &amp; Berman in 1939 with Robert Berman. By then he was in a position to make his first major acquisition, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Hurd_0ef5.html" title="Peter Hurd">Peter Hurd</a>'s <i>Boy from the Plains</i>. He allowed <a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelson_Rockefeller_e416.html" title="Nelson Rockefeller">Nelson Rockefeller</a>, another avid art collector, to use <i>Boy from the Plains</i> in a travelling American art exhibition. Rockefeller's exhibition travelled to <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South America</a>.</p>
<p>Among the other major artists whose works Neuberger collected are <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jackson_Pollock_e5b4.html" title="Jackson Pollock">Jackson Pollock</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Shahn_a351.html" title="Ben Shahn">Ben Shahn</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Baziotes_c594.html" title="William Baziotes">William Baziotes</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Calder_7e5d.html" title="Alexander Calder">Alexander Calder</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stuart_Davis_1e09.html" title="Stuart Davis">Stuart Davis</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Eilshemius_e386.html" title="Louis Eilshemius">Louis Eilshemius</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Hopper_da4d.html" title="Edward Hopper">Edward Hopper</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacob_Lawrence_30b9.html" title="Jacob Lawrence">Jacob Lawrence</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Levine_b10f.html" title="Jack Levine">Jack Levine</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Smith_dbf7.html" title="David Smith">David Smith</a> and especially <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milton_Avery_23a4.html" title="Milton Avery">Milton Avery</a>. Neuberger purchased dozens of Averys, the first of which was <i>Gaspé Landscape</i>, which he bought during a snowstorm. The artist wrapped it carefully to protect the canvas in the way home. It still hangs in Neuberger's apartment to this day.</p>
<p>Neuberger also began donating works to institutions, among them the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_e36a.html" title="Metropolitan Museum of Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Museum_of_Modern_Art_08fc.html" title="Museum of Modern Art">Museum of Modern Art</a> and the <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitney_Museum_1230.html" title="Whitney Museum">Whitney Museum</a> as well as many college and university museums.</p>
<p>Neuberger's friend and fellow collector Nelson Rockefeller, when he became governor of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> arranged for the donation of a substantial portion of Neuberger's collection to the state. To this end, he established a Neuberger Museum of Art as part of the <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_University_of_New_York_41c3.html" title="State University of New York">State University of New York</a>. Designed by architect <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Johnson_44b5.html" title="Philip Johnson">Philip Johnson</a>, the Neuberger Museum opened on the SUNY <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purchase_College_7286.html" title="Purchase College">Purchase College</a> campus and opened in 1974.</p>
<p>Neuberger was married for over 60 years to the late Marie Salant Neuberger, also a distinguished patron of the arts. Together they had three children and many grandchildren.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The vfd is a blatant attempt to intimidate WP into changing this into a POV article written the way the subject wants it written. Relevant material from Neuberger's proposed version can be merged in. I don't see any anti-Semitic overtones at all.--<a href="../../../b/c/r/User%7EBcrowell_f3ce.html" title="User:Bcrowell">Bcrowell</a> 19:37, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> if that's the best the OP can do. The article obviously needs a <b>lot</b> of work, but with patience it can be cleaned up into something worthwhile. (Is it okay to editorialise here? If so, here goes: The stated reason of "you <b>must</b> delete it because mere changes aren't good enough for us" is bollocks, and extraordinarily arrogant besides). --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">MarkGallagher</a> 19:55, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Actually, the article (before I just edited it) did incorrectly state that father and son were estranged. I've fixed it, and sourced a Ha'aretz article that quotes both father and son getting along as G-d and Ethical Culture intends. Nothing anti-semetic at all about this, at least when I last looked (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roy_Neuberger&amp;oldid=20648049" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roy_Neuberger&amp;oldid=20648049" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>).

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>cleanup</b>. If Mr. Kaufman doesn't like the article, he is welcome to contribute, but deleting page histories because they are offensive isn't how Wikipedia works and we shouldn't change that here.
