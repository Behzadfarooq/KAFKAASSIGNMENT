<li><b>Strong Keep</b> ---Has anyone here, other than myself, read the book? I found it on Google Books (is that a credible source?). The book seems to be garnering alot of attention since it's release only a month ago. Do all IUniverse books make it on to Google Books? Don't know the answer. Maybe some time should pass before this deletion decision is made. To me, Wikipedia is a forward-looking dictionary, antcipating new ideas/books/events. It seems logical to keep something garnering interest (the book is all over the internet and Google Books and other sites, not too mention the 10-15 members who created this site). At the least, delay deletion until more facts can be gathered. The ISBN # is accurate. I don't know about LOC #. Also, the poorly attributed material (Amazon ban, who knows if it's true but there is a link on Google Books that no longer works) and the Craigslist Review (have been removed). Now that I think about it, change my vote from "Strong keep" to "Keep until more details are developed". <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Reader5372 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Reader5372_f4e8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Reader5372">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Who are these fact-checkers?</b> - Just ran the Google Books search (put in IUniverse to GOOGLE BOOKS), 219,000 pages came up BUT only the first 9 pages (about 90+ books) were IUniverse. The rest had the words "Universe" and "I" in the same sentence (not the publisher). Also some just had the word "Universe". Not published by IUniverse. So if there's 10,000+ books on IUniverse and only 90 are in Google Books, maybe that is notable.

<li><b>Criteria (as per WP guideline):"Nonetheless there is no dictum against any book that is reasonably spread or otherwise well-known or remarkable.

</ul>
<p>Does this book satisfy said criteria?</p>
<p>1st test - 'reasonably spread' - (Satisfied) Put it in Google and found over 10 pages (100+ sites mentioning it)</p>
<p>2nd test - 'several libraries or bookshops or no-subscription website' - (Satisfied) We already have a website (IUniverse - free previews), Google Books (free chapter previews) and Library of Congress (and more in google search).</p>
<p>3rd test - 'easily consult book' - (Satisfied) Again, chapter available on Iuniverse (free site), and Google Books (free site).</p>
<p>4th test - 'on-line reviews' - (Satisfied) as stated earlier in Svhoong and on other sites.</p>
<p>5th test - 'must have ISBN #' - (satisfied) No debate here.</p>
<p>6th test - 'availability' - See above on all sites listed.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The evidence being used in support of this book having an article is very weak, and the guideline being cited by the supporters probably needs to be tightened. Having an ISBN is not a sign of notability for a book, just that the author/publisher paid the small fee to secure such a number. (I don't blame the supporters for citing that, but it should be irrelevant.) The fact that the author/publisher have chosen to make free previews available on the publisher's web site and Google Books does not indicate notability. <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince_83fd.html" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a> doesn't have a preview on Google Books, and America Deceived does, but that has everything to do with the permissions granted by the respective author/publishers and nothing to do with their relative notability. Nor is having a copyright registration a sign of notability, and no evidence has yet been provided that any library keeps this book in its collection. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 14:13, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> the above claim that criteria are met is, to say the least, unconvincing. The first test seems to be the number of ghits. I'm not sure this is not a typo but saying that 10 ghits is a sign of notability is, ahem, weak. The 2nd and 3rd point claim that the book is in several libraries and easy to consult which is <b>factually wrong</b>: the IUniverse and Google Books only have excerpts available and the Library of Congress does not have the book as several people have already explained. The 4th and 6th test concerns reviews but there is no indication that any of these reviews have appeared in any source of a reasonnable credibility. Schvoong? Come on... The 5th test is indeed passed but this simply should not be a criterion as Metropolitan90 has pointed out. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 15:17, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. No more notable than any other book from a vanity press.

<li>No, I have not read the book, but the discussion should be about the assertion that Homeland Security is violating the 1st Amendment by caging protestors and forcing book outlets to stop stocking ("America Deceived" by E.A. Blayre III).</li>
<li>Iuniverse is a subsidiary of Barnes and Noble.</li>
<li>The very fact that a discussion of this nature is a recordable piece of contemporary American history should be posted.</li>
<li>It does not take a crystal ball to see where jailing dissenters, false flag scenaria and the erosion of civil liberties lead to - book banning for starters. History tells us quite clearly that there are progressive steps on the path America seems to be taking.</li>

<li><b>Final comment</b> (I've put in a few...) If you search google for "america deceived" and Blayre you get a grand total of 70 hits<a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rlz=1B2GGGL_enCA176&amp;q=%22america+deceived%22+blayre" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rlz=1B2GGGL_enCA176&amp;q=%22america+deceived%22+blayre" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. Pretty much all of them are blogs (already a dubious source) but on closer inspection, the reference to the book is in fact part of the user comments... On a slightly related note: this debate motivated the creation of a new set of proposed <a href="../../../b/k/_/WP%7EBK_5e06.html" title="WP:BK">guidelines for the notability of books</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 16:32, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
