<p>The claims of pedophilia made against Clarke should be mentioned here. They were big news a few years ago, and I've heard told that more cases arose which were not grabbed by the tabloids. I'm unsure of how to broach the subject without risking slander, however. <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKricxjo_d8c0.html" title="User:Kricxjo">Kricxjo</a> 22:48, 31 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Court document is best, then book, then reputable newspaper report. Don't add anything if you don't have at least one of those to cite, whether online or paper. It's not slander if your report is factually correct ("X accused Y of Z" may be true even if the accusation itself is false). <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStan_Shebs_9ea8.html" title="User:Stan Shebs">Stan</a> 00:44, 1 Nov 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've read elsewhere that the allegations were eventually found to be false, but this wasn't picked up by the tabloids. I'd suggest doing a fair bit of research first on everything that happened and putting it together.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The allegations were indeed dismissed as false in 1998, and can be read about in the PlanetOut archive. All the wire services carried the report of the exoneration, but the fact that "the tabloids" didn't do so suggests that such an exoneration didn't serve their interests. jcsherwood1950 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think that it needs to be mentioned, and if it was exonerated, that be included as well. I had heard about Clarke's pedophilia and was wondering how that resolved -- and see nothing in the article at all about it. It was prominent enough that I think it deserves mention because it hit people's public consciousness of the subject. No reason we can't include both claims and exoneration to make things quite clear, but coming to the talk page and seeing just this isn't effective. — WCityMike <sup>(<a href="../../../w/c/i/User_talk%7EWCityMike_fb24.html" title="User talk:WCityMike">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WCityMike_e8da.html" title="Special:Contributions/WCityMike">C</a>)</sup> 03:00, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Sunday Mirror was the first tabloid to make the claim that they recorded an interview with Clarke in which he stated that he had sex with boys at his home in Sri Lanka and that he had no idea how old they where. Clarke was then cleared by the deputy inspector-general of police, MSM Nizam, who said: "We are satisfied that he has not violated any Sri Lankan laws or committed any crime. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/s/w_asia/74938.stm" class="external free" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/s/w_asia/74938.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/s/w_asia/74938.stm</a>. Eventually the whole story ended up with Interpol critizing The Sunday Mirror for refusing to supply the tape. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/150223.stm" class="external free" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/150223.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/150223.stm</a> IMO, the story isn't worth spreading on Wikipedia is no more than a nasty rumour. On the subject of Clarke being gay. Clarke denies being homosexual. <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/sciencefiction/story/0,,374388,00.html" class="external free" title="http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/sciencefiction/story/0,,374388,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/sciencefiction/story/0,,374388,00.html</a> Clarke always gives the same puckish pro forma answer: "No, merely cheerful." To top if off, Clarke was actually once married. See the same guardian article "...He was married briefly to an American, Marilyn Mayfield, now dead, whom he met while diving in Florida in the 50s." Yes he does live in Sri Lanka, which may sound like a strange place for an old English man living alone, except for the fact that there are about another ten thousand Western litrature writers living there also.

<dd>This is supposed to be an encylopedia. It is a *very* well-known fact that the Mirror started this hoo-hah and that Clarke was *not* knighted when he should have been. This has nothing to do with whether he is/was a pedophile, a homosexual, or even a little green alien. This is a fairly major happening in his recent life, I would say. The <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_A._Heinlein_4b75.html" title="Robert A. Heinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a> article has lots of info about his medical ups and downs and how they may have affected his writing. Wouldn't you say that a delayed knighthood is of equal importance in a *long*, supposedly NPOV article about a *very* well-known personage? Let's say that Ken Lay is found innocent of all charges against him in the Enron trial. Are we going to let a Ken Lay supporter edit the Wikipedia article about him so that all mention of the trial just *vanishes*? That's akin what you're trying to do here by removing this info. <a href="../../../h/a/y/User%7EHayford_Peirce_5729.html" title="User:Hayford Peirce">Hayford Peirce</a> 04:59, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Edited out. By the end of this episode the evidence indicated nothing other than defamatory libel spun from whole cloth by a tabloid. It does not provide any significant information about Clarke, and there's a compelling interest in not perpetuating the report of the libel - unlike "he said she said" journalism, Wikipedia should be based on evidence. It's no better than using <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_weasel_words_0886.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words">weasel words</a>, e.g. "according to some critics..." and it's far worse, in the case of something for which removing the "according to..." clause would instantly convert the Wikipedia entry itself into a defamatory libel that would be liable for civil damages, probably of far greater magnitude than from any copyright infringement. A tabloid could print libel against anybody at all. That would not make the libel a significant aspect of the target's life. - <a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7EReaverdrop_37ac.html" title="User:Reaverdrop">Reaverdrop</a> 04:58, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Anyone who's read ACC's work since the early 1970's can't doubt he is bisexual. What's the quote from Imperial Earth (from memory, so probably not verbatim) "He [the central character] couldn't understand anyone who's sexuality was exclusively polarized in one direction or the other". Also see the 70's rewrite of 'Songs of Distant Earth' (not the original short story or the 80's novel, the extended short story with the 2-men-1-woman threesome. Central character was called Falcon I think). Even the pin-up Kumar from the 80's Songs novel "had slept with all of the girls and most of the boys in his agegroup". Of course, just because he writes about it doesn't mean he does it.. but for a unsentimental writer like Clarke it's telling that bisexuality forms such a staple ingredient. It never happened in Asimov novels!! It's not as if Clarke is socially innovative generally (eg Iain M Banks).</p>
<p>Incidentally, none of this is intended as a critisism. He's an old man living in a country where (I think) homosexual activity is illegal - I can understand why he doesn't want to rock the boat. 80.177.152.35 22:07, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why is it not relevant? Or perhaps you just wish people didn't talk about such things at all Muugokszhiion? A topic that so heavily infulences his writing is obviously relevant, must more so that his brief marrage, which is mentioned 80.177.152.35 17:29, 24 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, for one thing, none of these instances cited above have anything whatsoever to do with the story plots or any important aspects of the stories. If, let's say, the bisexuality of one of the characters led to him/her getting the post of captain of the starship, and then got him/her into trouble with a major character in the book, then it would be relevant to mention it. In articles about the Saint books, or the James Bond books, is it relevant to mention that Leslie Charteris or Ian Fleming were heterosexuals? I don't think so. In fact, let's say that they *weren't* -- what possible difference would that make to the books as they are written? If we say in this article that Clarke *might* be bisexual, do we then say in the Asimov article that he was *clearly* heterosexual, as based on the fact that there are married couples in his books? But how do we *know* Asimov was 100% hetero? Etc. etc. etc. <a href="../../../h/a/y/User%7EHayford_Peirce_5729.html" title="User:Hayford Peirce">Hayford Peirce</a> 18:20, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This arguement just isn't logical or consistent. The article is packed full of details that arn't relevent to the plot of his books, (eg Place of birth, working as an auditor, marrage and rapid separation). Also, the bisexual nature of some of his characters is *highly* relevent to stories. See Imperial Earth or Songs for examples (I can supply page refs if you like).</dd>
<dd>The auguement that 'it doesnt affect the books so lets not mention it' misses the point. It manifestly influences a number of his later books (see above), and even if it didn't, by mentioning his marrage ACC's heterosexuality is implied. The article is about the man, not just the books.</dd>
<dd>Frankly the 'lets not mention it' arguement is a bit 1950's (least said soonest mended etc etc), the 'not relevent to his stories' one is just dumb.</dd>
<dd>The only good arguement is privacy and ACC's reluctance to 'out' himself - which is fine with me. I guess we have to wait for his death, and the publishing of his archives to find out for sure. (if you're reading this Arthur, sorry to be anticipating your demise! I wish you'd clear up the matter - you conspicously havent so far.

<p>I removed "autodidact" - he studied at one of the England's most prestigious universities. The fact that he did it after a short period of employment and then his military service doesn't mean that he was self-taught (at the time he went to university, it was usual to be studying while in mid to late 20's). Admittedly he was already publishing sci-fi by that time, but many sci-fi writers start young. The fact that they haven't finished their formal education before starting their occupation doesn't qualify them as autodidacts, as far as I can see. And just because the degree wasn't in English literature or similar, doesn't mean he counts as an autodidact just because his occupation was not a direct branch-out of his degree. --<a href="../../../v/i/v/User%7EVivaEmilyDavies_9249.html" title="User:VivaEmilyDavies">VivaEmilyDavies</a> 00:57, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Isn't Clarke considered the inventor of the telecomunication's satelite?</p>
<p>I think he was the first person to think up the idea of a geostationary satelite. For people interested in communications, get a copy of his non-fiction book "When the World Was One"</p>
<p>He wrote about satellites in his short stories that were published. He did not think that they would come as soon as they have done so he did not patent them. However when the companies saw that the satellites could make a lot of money they tried to patent them but Clarke pointed out that he had invalidated their patents.</p>
<dl>

<p>He is listed as "co-author" on a number of Clarkes' later books. I believe "ghostwriter" would be more accurate. If one reads the books it appears that they were actually written by Lee and then published with Clarkes' name on them. They do take place in Clarkes' settings and use Clarkes' characters. Their styles are quite different. Clarke is a first rate author. Lee would quickly fade out of print if he published under his own name. Based on his fiction, I had not realized Lee had any real scientific background. Would it be appropriate to change the Wiki article to reflect this?</p>

<dd>Having read some of the Clarke/Lee works, I agree that it's difficult to detect any trace of Clarke's style in them. The notion that Lee ghost-wrote them is quite plausible.

<p>Is it compatible for Clarke to be categorised both as a "Deist thinker" and an agnostic? I thought he was an atheist--I believe that's the category he was in some time ago.</p>

<p>Clarke is also well known to many for his television programmes Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World (1981) and Arthur C. Clarke's World of Strange Powers (1984).</p>
<p>Does anyone know if there are any plans to release either of those shows on DVD? I remember hearing rumors on and off but does anyone know what the story is? Or even if Clarke is aware that these works are not available on DVD? (Simonapro 21:28, 10 June 2006 (UTC))</p>

<dd>Thanks. I've no idea who put it back — if anyone did. My edit of 11 August is missing from the history, which makes me suspect some sort of glitch in Wikipedia's servers.

<dd>Absolutely. I *know* that I made a minor edit in another article about the same time, in which, like here, I simply removed a sentence, then saved it. A while later I went back to the article and discovered that there was no record of what I had done. Just a Wiki glitch, I guess. <a href="../../../h/a/y/User%7EHayford_Peirce_5729.html" title="User:Hayford Peirce">Hayford Peirce</a> 03:58, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>2. "'The Sentinel' (1948) introduced a religious theme to Clarke's work, a theme that he later explored more deeply in "The Star". His interest in the paranormal was influenced by Charles Fort and embraced the belief that mankind may be the property of an ancient alien civilization. Surprisingly for a writer who is often held up as an example of hard science fiction's obsession with technology, <b>three</b> of Clarke's novels have this as a theme."</p>
<p>I know <i>Childhood's End</i> is one. Which are the other two?</p>
<p>3. I also think that the article should say a bit more about Clarke's involvement with the BIS and his life on Sri Lanka. WRT the latter, I know he played an important role in a school or university in Colombo -- Chancellor or some such.</p>
<p>4. Concerning who are the "Big Three" authors of the Golden Age of Science Fiction, see the article on A. E. van Vogt. There's a potential conflict there.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not really. Van Vogt was a big shot *before* Clarke first appeared. Clark did not really become a major writer in the SF world until, oh, let's say the late 40s, early 50s. By which time Van Vogt had partially vanished. The "Big Three" was probably not used for Clarke, Asimov, and RAH until the 60s, or maybe even later. <a href="../../../h/a/y/User%7EHayford_Peirce_5729.html" title="User:Hayford Peirce">Hayford Peirce</a> 01:29, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>5. Finally, having a list of books here and a separate article about his books (collectively) with a similar list seems like overkill. --<a href="../../../c/p/w/User%7ECPWinter_f063.html" title="User:CPWinter">ChrisWinter</a> 01:02, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article says "he ... was involved in the early warning radar defence system which contributed to the RAF's success during the Battle of Britain.". Is this really right?

<p>I added the Cingalese nationality, because Mr Clarke has double citizenship of UK and Sri Lanka. By the way, the meaning of the word is controversial: properly, nationality has to be reffered only to ethnic-cultural-language belonging, while citizenship has to be referred to the belonging to a territorial State. However, some peoples (and some dictionaries, too) consider to two words as having the same meaning and I think it was used in this way on this site. Only - I'm sorry - I fear to have had a mistake in digit and saved in a wrong way. I'll try to restore.</p>
