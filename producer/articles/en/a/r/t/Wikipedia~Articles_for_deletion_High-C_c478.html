<li><b>Keep</b> High-C was the first nerdcore rapper on the Internet (see citation in the Nerdcore hip-hop comments).

<dd>I'd like this to be addressed. If High-C is an analog of Jason Gortician, and Jason Gortician can easily be established as an artist of note, then the High-C page should remain. A quick peek in the hip-hop newsgroups would also show that High-C is more well-known than just about any other nerdcore artist out there. This whole discussion is petty.

<dd>Most? That's two. I'm amazed at the snobbishness exhibited here. "This label is more notable than that label." They're tiny indy labels. Furthermore, I'm stunned at how fiercely Friday and others police the nerdcore page, without contributing anything of value.

<dd>Imbalance Records also has a listing at discogs.com, which is a guideline site just like AMG. The label is now defunct, so asking about the size of the label today is a bit disingenuous. Jason Gortician 01:52, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't know how Frontalot got to where he is. I think he found a better way to promote himself than posting an encyclopedia article about himself, and he released his recordings on a label that hasn't gone defunct. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElkman_Esperanza_be6e.html" title="User:Elkman/Esperanza"><font color="green">E</font></a><a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElkman_f6c6.html" title="User:Elkman">lkman</a> - <sup><a href="../../../e/l/k/User_talk%7EElkman_bf81.html" title="User talk:Elkman">(talk)</a></sup> 02:29, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The label was never major, not even when it was still viable. The quote from the label's founder on the page you linked clearly says as much, as Elkman pointed out earlier.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I've tried to be extra patient and nice here, but my patience is exhausted. The author of this vanity article has been quite rude, accusing editors of snobbishness, calling me names, and accusing me of having a "blatant lie" in my Afd nomination.

He's now claiming that his other former band makes him a significant musician even if High-C does not. He thinks his own postings on usenet are verifiable proof of his influence. He doesn't show any interest in wanting to understand <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, he just wants to rudely insist that his self-promotional content needs to be kept.

<li>I sat in my room and made music on my Amiga too, when I was a kid. This in no way involved establishing a tradition or school in a particular genre. If Rolling Stone says you were the the first nerdcore musician, you've got something. If <i>you</i> say you were the first, and there are no sources to back it up, you've got nothing. Your own assertions of the tremendous influence of your former unsigned metal band are hardly credible. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 13:55, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Mheh. Friday, you're really clued into both the nerdcore and metal scenes, aren't you?&#160;; ) Gortician outcharted major label acts with boombox tapes, have had songs written about us, founded the Death Metal Music Association, were one of the first extreme metal acts to play live online (@ KCUF.org), are credited with influencing other acts (Benalto, for one), have a race named after us in Space War online. I could go on and on. Just because you're ignorant of these things doesn't change reality. Carry on. Jason Gortician 14:10, 14 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To be honest, I don't find any of those things particularly persuasive, as Benalto, the DMMA, and Space War Online all seem pretty non-notable themselves. What was the name of your metal band? -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 14:43, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Amazing, you don't know what band you're even talking about? Try reading more slowly, next time. Out-charting major label acts with boombox tapes isn't note-worthy? Funny, it meets wiki's criteria for notable bands. Oops, maybe that's why you ignore it? <a href="../../../6/5/2E/User%7E65.13.184.164.html" title="User:65.13.184.164">65.13.184.164</a> 17:44, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, so the band in question is named "Gortician"! I had assumed that you were just speaking about yourself in the third person. They seem equally non-notable, so I'm sticking to my opinion. -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 16:50, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>There's a <b>chart</b> for boombox tapes? I didn't know that. Maybe you could point us in the direction of this chart, instead of yelling at us for being ignorant.
