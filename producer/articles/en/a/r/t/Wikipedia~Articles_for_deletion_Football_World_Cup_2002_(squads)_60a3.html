<dd><a href="../../../e/v/e/Everything2.html" title="Everything2">Everything2</a> is NOT an encyclopedia.

Wikipedia is primarly supposed to be an encyclopedia and not an everything2 online community. Thats why football squads and any similar not instructive or not educative articles have to be rejected.

<dd>Even if you want to apply the rules from a traditional encyclopedia to this, see the first line of the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">Encyclopedia</a> article: <i>An encyclopedia (alternatively encyclopaedia) is a written compendium of knowledge.</i> Which is what this article is. But wikipedia is NOT a traditional encylcopedia; in fact, there are various sports encyclopedias out there, just search Amazon.com for "sports encyclopedia" or amazon.co.uk for "football encyclopedia". I don't know why this needs to be argued any further, since this is clearly one person's quest to bring down this article. --<a href="../../../d/r/y/User%7EDryazan_bb4e.html" title="User:Dryazan">Dryazan</a> 14:40, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Look, its not that I dont like football. I just think football squads are not encyclopedic.

<dd>I am sorry about your hard work. It isnt that it is not a good work. I just think that your work has to be moved somewhere else, as long as it is not instructional or educative, and the purpose of an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a> is to be educative. Can you point to a single instructional institute that teaches football squads? Faethon 07:24, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Staffordshire University, with the so-called "David Beckham Studies" degree (a cultural studies degree with emphasis on media and football culture).

<dd>Sorry I didnt know that. IMHO those odd studies are not notable. Especially "David Beckam studies" seems to me like advertisement. Even if we accept that these are real studies, I still believe that no student there is forced to learn football squads. Can you point to a lesson named "football squads" or something like that in those academies? And how long shall we keep football squads in wikipedia? Shall we write all squads from 1901 until now? I think an encyclopedia with football squads does not make sense.Faethon 11:50, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Students might not use the list for class (they also might; it would be very relevant to an undergraduate sociology paper on say, German-Dutch or Anglo-Argentine fan animosity), but fans and sports journalists can use it as reference.<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENateji77_10a2.html" title="User:Nateji77">Nateji77</a> 14:07, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
