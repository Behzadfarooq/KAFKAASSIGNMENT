<li><b>Comment</b> - With regards to my previous comment, I apologize for joining a deletion debate so soon after getting my Wikipedia account, action which I now realize is frowned upon. I will do my best to make contributions to other articles. What I said still stands, though. I think the arguments should be weighed by their content, rather than by how many edits the poster has made. Sorry if this isn't the right place to post this. As I said, I'm still new to this community. If I'm making a mistake please let me know, and I'll avoid repeating it. GabiAPF 13:05, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Article seems rather crufty to me, but might be improved. Being on <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keenspot.html" title="Keenspot">Keenspot</a> is sufficient for a webcomic to be notable in my opinion. <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenning_Makholm_0024.html" title="User:Henning Makholm">Henning Makholm</a> 03:10, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The author of this webcomic has asked that the readers revise the article, so it is constantly being improved and updated. The comic has a large following with a growing number of interested readers. Also - since other online webcomics from Keenspot have entries, this one should as well. I have been reading this comic for a little over a year and I have seen the transfer from ComicGenesis to Keenspot. Keenspot would not have invited Kel to host her comic on that server unless the comic had a large following. I see no reason to delete this entry in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../k/a/e/User%7EKaelan69_6253.html" title="User:Kaelan69">Kaelan69</a> 21:24, 09 December 2006 (Central Time)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> notability is not subjective, significant reliable third-party reporting does not exist.

<ul>
<li>It hasn't been accepted at <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>; <a href="../../../k/e/e/Talk%7EKeenspot_8f48.html" title="Talk:Keenspot">Talk:Keenspot</a> is not a policy, or a guideline, or even a widely cited essay like <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">User:Uncle G/On notability</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 16:13, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Note that <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28web%29_6df7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (web)">Wikipedia:Notability (web)</a> says, "Even if an entire website meets the notability criteria, its components (forums, articles, sections) are not necessarily notable and deserving of their own separate article." In other words, even if a webcomic host is notable, each and every webcomic it hosts is not. Also, keep in mind that WP:WEB is only one guideline, and it should not be read in isolation in such a way that it contradicts official content policies like <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 18:29, 10 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But number 3 in the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> clearly says that "The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster." And <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keenspot.html" title="Keenspot">Keenspot</a> is notable and indepedent of the creators of the comics that it publishes. Which makes all it's comics pass the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, which should be enough to at least let the article remain for more than the week it has been up. So that it can be stub and be improved upon. TheAmazingTick 20:12, 10 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Keenspot is not "well-known" outside of its subculture. Note that the idea that "Wikipedia should have articles on every Keenspot comic" didn't work on the first AfD for this webcomic, or on any of the many other previous Keenspot-related AfDs that have resulted in deletion, so it's unlikely to be effectiv ein this "do-over." Again, this is because we can't stretch the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> guideline to the point that it lets us write about topics we personally feel are "notable" by resorting to original research, our own points of view, and other unreliable sources. As far as I can see, the only new information since the last AfD is that this comic was written about in the weekly student newspaper of a college with an enrollment of 2,200. This is not the type of multiple reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy that we, as an encyclopedia, require. If you'd like to write webcomics-related articles without the burden of our content policies, I suggest <a href="http://www.comixpedia.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.comixpedia.org/" rel="nofollow">comixpedia.org</a>. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 20:46, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> States that there is an exceptions for Self Publish/dubious reliabity sources if claims aren't contentious, it's obvious who wrote it, and it's not self serving. As for <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keenspot.html" title="Keenspot">keenspot</a> not being "well-known" in the outside world there are article about it in both the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Chronicle_5d76.html" title="San Francisco Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a> and <a href="../../../p/u/b/Publisher%27s_Weekly_c64c.html" title="Publisher's Weekly">Publisher's Weekly</a>.TheAmazingTick 21:43, 10 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The claim that this topic has had any great impact or is historically significant is not reliably sourced. That this article has already been deleted once would signify that such a claim is at best "contentious." Yes, I know that Keenspot has been written about in a few decent sources (I'm the one who added the two newspaper references to the Keenspot article). This does not make it generally well known outside of its subculture. For what it's worth, we've deleted articles on websites with much better sources and larger readership than Keenspot. This is getting really long. The basic idea here is that for encyclopedia articles we need sources that are at least as good as those we'd use for a junior high school research paper. We don't have those for this article. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 22:19, 10 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> states only ONE of its criteria must be met. This article meets the letter of the rules under criteria 3 by being published by Keenspot, even if the talk page on it isn't gospel yet, that's no arguement for deletion- the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> does not say that notability has to be unanimous. While it needs to be improved and added to, historical significance (I don't see any claims to that?) and impact, claimed or otherwise, are <i>irrelevant</i> to the notability of this subject. It's fictional work published by a notable source independant of the author, therefore it is itself notable. Delete votes need to state clearly some reason why it's not meeting the third <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criteria. This shouldn't be an AfD until it's determined whether or not being hosted by Keenspot meets the notability requirement. (54x 21:39, 12 December 2006 (UTC))</li>
