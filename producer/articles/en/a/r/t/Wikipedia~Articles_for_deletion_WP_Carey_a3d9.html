<p>Same user has created several pages regarding Arizona State University that have little importance outside the university community. Some have pertinence (such as the head coach of their basketball team), but others (such as this, which refers to one man who has apparently contributed money to their business school) are of no use to Wikipedia. <s><b>Delete</b>.</s> <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">jglc</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/s/User_talk%7EJasonglchu_8af4.html" title="User talk:Jasonglchu">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jasonglchu_1515.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jasonglchu">c</a> 18:28, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> and I will say that something is wrong here that an 18 year old porn starlet <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jordan_Capri_6617.html" title="Jordan Capri">Jordan Capri</a> on this same page gets 8 keep votes to 1 delete vote and we are even talking about deleting a man whose name is on a major investment company and the newly-renamed business school of a major American university. His name will be on diplomas long after anyone even remembers her name. <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 00:59, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think that it says even more that the porn starlet has an article approximately seven times as long as the man whose name is on a major investment company. But, in principle, I suppose I agree with you - just that the content of the article, right now, does <i>not</i> justify keeping it. The article does not even contain a full sentence - merely a fragment. If he is to be remembered, it will be as more than simply a "major benefactor" to a single university (though that may be part of his legacy), but as the head of a financial institution - which is <i>not even mentioned</i> in the article. <b>Cleanup</b> or, as I said before, <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">jglc</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/s/User_talk%7EJasonglchu_8af4.html" title="User talk:Jasonglchu">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jasonglchu_1515.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jasonglchu">c</a> 01:06, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

Well I'm sorry Jason, I don't have alot of information on the articles I am making, but my INTENT was to get things started, and have other users contribute the rest. You've gone and marked for deletion more than half of EVERYTHING I created, which was kind of rude considering that they all had only been on Wikipedia for LESS THAN AN HOUR!!! I'd appreciate it if you stopped marking all my articles for deletion, when you honestly had no idea what it was you were removing. <b>Keep</b>. (I am the creator of this and all the other articles appended to my IP address. Please vote to keep all of the articles I made. I promise they are all relevant, contrary to how small or short they may be.) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.251.21.122 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.251.21.122.html" title="User talk:24.251.21.122">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.251.21.122_f9cd.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.251.21.122">contribs</a>) 02:26, 17 Jun 2005.</small></p>

<li>
<ul>
<li>Several of the articles that you have created <i>are</i>, in fact, I still feel, subject for deletion (<a href="../../../s/d/i/SDIC_2a11.html" title="SDIC">SDIC</a>, Andrew Harrison, and <a href="../../../a/s/u/ASU_Cares_529e.html" title="ASU Cares">ASU Cares</a>). I was wrong to add WP Carey to the VfD page, but please keep in mind that, at the time, the only text on the page was "William Polk Carey - Benefactor to the Arizona State University College of Business." I agree that I ought to have done more research before adding him to VfD, but there are many articles added every day with text like that (or, in some cases, more carefully thought-out and thoroughly written text) that are absolute hogwash.</li>
<li>The fact that one of your creations has encyclopaedic relevence does not affect the status of the other articles, which have little pertinence to anyone outside of your immediate university community; if an event such as <a href="../../../a/s/u/ASU_Cares_529e.html" title="ASU Cares">ASU Cares</a> is encyclopaedic, then so is my university's Community Day. I might also add that the most important fact about Mr. Carey - that he heads a large financial institution - was <i>not</i> mentioned in your article. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">jglc</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/s/User_talk%7EJasonglchu_8af4.html" title="User talk:Jasonglchu">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jasonglchu_1515.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jasonglchu">c</a> 03:25, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Why not create these in one section on the ASU page. If they do grow to be encylopedic there to the point that they need an article then you can merge the text to a new page. Also being in one place it is more likely that someone will see them and work on them as a group. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 05:53, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
