<p>Frankly, it is time this went. I have waited a reasonable amount of time - over 3 months - before renominating this article to see if any multiple reliable sources would be forthcoming - they have note been. The article is <i>not</i> suitable for any reliable encyclopaedia, which Wikipedia should strive to be. As Wikipedia seems to finally have turned the corner on what we allow, and actually are applying policy and guideline (<a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>) to internet meme garbage fanboy articles (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Eon8_%282nd_nomination%29_5c3c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Eon8 (2nd nomination)">here</a> or <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Dramatica_%283rd_nomination%29_8050.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/EncyclopÃ¦dia Dramatica (3rd nomination)">here</a>, it may finally be time for this to go.</p>
<p>The article has 1 (one) even remotely verifiable source, which is a small article in a single edition of a fairly low circulation (53,860 or 1 in 150 Belgians) Flemish language newspaper that requires a subscription to read. This is nowhere near being sufficient for <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> (multiple reliable mainstream print journals), and the article is therefore <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverified</a>. The article even says this, itself - <i>Despite its reported prevalence this is the only mainstream report of The Game.</i> All the other 'sources' provided are either bloglinks, or a website made up purely to ensure this cack was no consensus'd in a prior AFD. And even if it were sufficiently verifiable, I would suggest that this is not <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notable</a>. <b>Strong delete</b>. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 10:21, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"This is nowhere near being sufficient for WP:RS (multiple reliable mainstream print journals), and the article is therefore unverified" Can you point me to where it says in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> that articles require "multiple reliable mainstream print journals" for verification? <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKernow_6302.html" title="User:Kernow">Kernow</a> 21:21, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think this is an accurate objection, as I've explained below. Also, it's better to insert comments in chronological order on an AfD rather than here at the top, to avoid confusion. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat"><font style="color:#DC2163;">Z</font>iggurat</a> 22:28, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - note that I have <b><font color="red">semi-protected</font></b> this AFD proactively, as previous AFD discussions have been rife with vandalism and first-time voters on both sides of the debate.

<li><b>Keep</b> as before. Nothing has changed, and it's been mentioned in a third party publication. AfD shouldn't be used over and over to get the desired result. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 11:10, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The article has been tagged requesting sufficient <b>reliable</b> sources and references for more than three months since the last AFD. This is not using AFD over and over. And note that the 'desired result' - deletion - has already been consented on twice. The same argument could have been made at the last AFD, when the prior two results had been 'delete'. The addition of one link to one low-circulation non-English account-restricted newspaper article is not enugh to pass <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 12:57, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The article has a source. The fact that this is the <i>fifth</i> nomination shows that, yes, it has been AfD'd over and over, and this is a borderline speedy keep because of it. Just because it was AfD'd 3 times and people finally got the desired result doesn't make it correct now. My position stands. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 13:06, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. It has one non-trivial mention - the same can be said for many passing things. Heck, I have friends who can claim the same if not greater coverage, and they don't have or merit articles either. GassyGuy 12:10, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep again</b>. The Game is well known across many countries, and hundreds of reputable wikipedians attest to its existence. A second good source has yet to be forthcoming, still, which does detract from the article, but as and when we can fix that we will - in the meantime, the article should stay, awaiting completion, rather than being deleted. That was the consensus from previous AFDs, and nothing has changed. --<a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughcharlesparker_a9f4.html" title="User:Hughcharlesparker">Hugh<small>Charles</small>Parker</a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/u/g/User_talk%7EHughcharlesparker_6d32.html" title="User talk:Hughcharlesparker">talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hughcharlesparker_62d0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hughcharlesparker">contribs</a>)</small> 12:26, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, the consensus(es) from previous AFDs were keep, keep, delete, delete, no consensus. Please ensure you have your facts correct. On the last AFD, many keep 'voters' (in speechies as AFD not a vote) said it was awaiting sources organically and other such platitudes; in three months exactly this much has been provided: nothing. A re-AFDing after three months when no such sources have been provided is not unreasonable. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 12:57, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It should also be pointed out that the circulation of a newspaper doesn't affect its validity as a source. --<a href="../../../h/u/g/User%7EHughcharlesparker_a9f4.html" title="User:Hughcharlesparker">Hugh<small>Charles</small>Parker</a> <small>(<a href="../../../h/u/g/User_talk%7EHughcharlesparker_6d32.html" title="User talk:Hughcharlesparker">talk</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hughcharlesparker_62d0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hughcharlesparker">contribs</a>)</small> 12:28, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"the consensus(es) from previous AFDs were keep, keep, delete, delete, no consensus" - The first delete was for an article with a different name that referred to the same game, so that has nothing to do with whther this article should be deleted. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKernow_6302.html" title="User:Kernow">Kernow</a> 21:17, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. There are sources, and it is notable. A quick google test (with appropriate extra words) reveals a number of sites devoted to The Game. Since none of these sites <i>created</i> The Game, there is little possibility of vanity, and thus The Game is notable. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari"><span style="background-color:#DDDDFF; font-weight:bold"><font color="#0000FF">Da</font><font color="#0000CC">rk</font> <font color="#000099">Sh</font><font color="#000066">ik</font><font color="#000033">ar</font><font color="#000000">i</font></span></a> 12:46, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Note that most of the sites 'devoted to the game' were created purely to exist as sources for the Wikipedia article to exist (read the last AFD - <a href="http://www.savethegame.org" class="external text" title="http://www.savethegame.org" rel="nofollow">savethegame</a> is one of these. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 12:58, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I didn't see that one on Google--its probably way off the first page of results by now. One of the sites, for example, is a site offering game-related merchandise and the like, along with an FAQ as to what the game is and various other resources. While obviously it isn't a news source, it attests to the notability of The Game because it isn't related to Wikipedia nor did it create the game in the first place. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari"><span style="background-color:#DDDDFF; font-weight:bold"><font color="#0000FF">Da</font><font color="#0000CC">rk</font> <font color="#000099">Sh</font><font color="#000066">ik</font><font color="#000033">ar</font><font color="#000000">i</font></span></a> 13:07, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> AfD abuse per above comments to get desired results. If someone doesn't like the fact that the WP system doesn't comport to their view of what the encyclopedia should include, change the system, don't game it (no pun intended). If something lived through so many AfDs, it's notable enough to at the least warrant a stub. I often harp on this but again the boat is missed: personal tastes really matter for nothing. It's all about what merits inclusion in the WP site, and this does. This also isn't Britannica, and we have no physical limitations.

<dd>This is my enitre point. Some wikipedia editors decide this game looks silly to them. Then, short of overwhelming evidence that it is a huge cultural phenomena, they are going to try to get it removed. Just rooting around on the internet I've seen a bunch of disconnected places where it shows up. Take a look at all the people who try to edit different variations and approaches they've seen into the article. This seems to me a sign that it is not an isolated thing for one or two groups of people.

Official policy excludes many kinds of information which would are obviously useful to many people such as recipes, how-tos and dictionary definitions, nevermind obscure internet memes like The Game. This is because Wikipedia is primarily intended to be an encyclopedia. It is crucial for the authority of encyclopedias that they uphold official standards of verification and reliable sourcing (and some would argue also for encyclopedic notability, but this is very controversial and not official policy, although it is the basis of a number of official guidelines). Inadequately verified, obscure memes such as the Game are better suited to user-written websites like <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_Dictionary_cc65.html" title="Urban Dictionary">urbandictionary.com</a> which have fewer and lower standards <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 20:44, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

On this <a href="http://www.losethegame.com/strategies.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.losethegame.com/strategies.htm" rel="nofollow">page on losethegame.com</a>, planting mentions in the media is recommended as a game strategy. Sole "reliable source" media reference is, in fact, unreliable. The article is <u>trivial</u> in content - it is not a news report but a column (so not subject to news fact-checking). Furthermore, the writer does not substantiate his claims about the popularity of the game, and people should consider that the writer himself may be playing the game (since spreading word of the game is supposed to be "winning" behaviour). (I've lost the link that had the translation of the original article. I'll try and find it again) The writer is also wrong when he claims that readers who read his article have played the game and lost (though this is an indication that he himself is playing the game). One only loses by wanting to play the game (One can think about the game and not "lose" anything if one doesnt' want to play). <a href="../../../w/a/r/WarGames_1483.html" title="WarGames">This is a stupid game - the only way to win is, in fact, not to play</a>.

Notice that even this writer calls the game only "a modest hype" and fails to provide evidence that game has notable following.

<dd>* This has also been discussed before. You do not need to give consent to be a participant in a game. For example, I invent a new game called "Kernow's Game" and the rule is that the next person to edit this page will lose.

<dd>I don't understand your reply, but what I am saying is not irrational. The fact that I'm the only one aware of Kernow's game doesn't mean it doesn't exist. A game is an abstract concept with no physical existence. Therefore one only needs to conceive it for it to exist. Regardless of whether you want to play a different version where you don't lose, you have still lost my version of Kernow's game, and hence you have still lost a game without knowing you were playing it. For a less abstract example, what about the Roman gladiators? That was a type of sport/game and I'm fairly sure most of the participants did not want to play. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKernow_6302.html" title="User:Kernow">Kernow</a> 23:07, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>weak Delete</b> I was previously a major proponent of keeping this article. However, at this point, after three months I have concluded that 1) it is not notable (if it we're the many people trying to find sources would have found more than 1 by now) 2) The De Morgen article only barely meets <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 21:48, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm sure that in the last AFD you acknowledged that The Game was notable, and that the issue was with verifiablity? Is there any guidelines for how many people need to be aware of something for it to be classed as notable? As a result of the DeMorgan article alone there must be hundreds of thousands of players by now and that was only published a few months ago. Personally, I have been playing since 2002 so I think there must be many more players than this. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKernow_6302.html" title="User:Kernow">Kernow</a> 22:41, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> A lot of people are referring to the existence of savethegame.org as if this makes the lack of sources more relevant.

<li><b>Delete</b> [[WP:V] is policy. Consensus can not trump policy (if 1 in 4 AFDs keeping even is a consensus to keep). Absence of multiple reliable sources after an extended opportunity to generate them and multiple discussions is more than adequate evidence that such sources do not exist at the present time. Accordingly, the article should be deleted, and deletion review should not send it back again absent evidence of multiple reliable sources. Once we have multiple reliable sources, we can move on to the not yet adequately answered questions as to whether this is notable/encyclopedic. It sure looks like a prime case for elimination under <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 00:14, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Already Voted</b> It seems to me people are mixing together the two separate objections:
<ul>
<li>Verifiability - The article contains only a small ammount of info: what the game is, where it is played, etc. The newspaper article, even if it is not pulitzer winning journalism substantiates these claims. Could anyone credibly claim between that article and a glut of internet sources that any of the information is wrong? Do you think the game does not exist or has other rules? The rules, variants, etc. of <a href="../../../m/a/o/Mao_%28game%29.html" title="Mao (game)">Mao (game)</a> are much more poorly sourced than this and no one is complaining about it's verifiability. What is it you feel isn't verified exactly?</li>
<li>Notability - Although the subject has to be notable, there is no rule saying that notability needs to be established through reliable sources. For example, there are lots of websites which have been affirmed in AfD as notable internet memes, despite having no printed sources about them at all (for example <a href="../../../z/o/m/Zombo.com.html" title="Zombo.com">Zombo.com</a>). My point is that there is no universal requirement that Notability be established with print sources.</li>

<li>The De Morgen article does not count as a reliable source. The De Morgen is a major Belgian newspaper and no one has quoted any policy which would invalidate this source.</li>
<li>Verification requires <i>multiple</i> reliable sources. Despite my multiple comments asking for someone to quote the policy that says this, no one has.</li>
<li>The Game isn't notable. Notability of The Game was established in the last AFD. Notability does not need to be proven by reliable sources, it is up to people to use their common sense. Try searching Google for "I just lost The Game" or "I lost The Game" and the majority of hits are in reference to this game. There is evidence that The Game exists in many countries. I would be willing to let someone check the IP addresses on the losethegame.com forum to confirm this. The stat counter on losethegame.com clearly shows that around 500 new IPs view the main page every day.</li>

<dd>Actually, if you look at <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, you'll note that in almost every instance 'reliable sources' is plural, and by implication most people interpret this as articles requiring more than a single source for an article to be retained. It's pretty hard to achieve a neutral point of view with only one source, too. In any case, it's clear that people dispute whether the single source provided is sufficient, so a good consensus would be the appropriate course of action. Seeing as we have apparently yet to reach a consensus on this, more discussion is the key, not less. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat"><font style="color:#DC2163;">Z</font>iggurat</a> 21:12, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, what I'm saying is that one of the reasons we require more than one source is to ensure that NPOV is possible - if it's not possible (here I don't believe it is) then a tag is inappropriate. I personally don't like the concept of notability, so it's really reliability and neturality that are important here. While I also personally feel that there should be a baseline standard for how many reliable sources there are for an article to be included, that's a policy debate for another time.<a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat"><font style="color:#DC2163;">Z</font>iggurat</a> 21:34, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Although "reliable sources" is used in the plural, the only reference I can find which actually discusses whether they are required is "you shouldn't necessarily be satisfied with a single source". As for NPOV, can you point to which parts of the article might be considered biased? It is really just stating the rules of The Game and where it is played, there isn't really anything in the article which could be opinion or a biased point of view as far as I can see. I agree that the existence of multiple sources would be more important if the article's neutrality was being disputed, but as far as I am aware it isn't. <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKernow_6302.html" title="User:Kernow">Kernow</a> 16:52, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
