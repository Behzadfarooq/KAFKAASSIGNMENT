<dd><i>The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the article below. <span style="color:red"><b>Please do not modify it.</b></span> Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>).

<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>. Many of the keep comments can be discounted on the basis of their being based on the commentors experience rather than applicable policy. The argument that this should be kept because it doesn't fit in the main article is somewhat redundant, if it is POV there then it is POV here. There don't seem to be enough sources to warrant a separate article from the parent, and with the quotations removed from the article, it would be best presented in the main article, giving the information the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">due weight</a> it deserves.

<li>Please read the verifiability policy carefully:<i>Articles should rely on <b>credible, third-party sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy</b>. For academic subjects, the sources should preferably be peer-reviewed. <b>Sources should also be appropriate to the claims made: outlandish claims beg strong sources.</b></i>. One peer reviewed obscure journal article (with a sample size of six subjects ) plus some large scale surveys whose only source is a Falun Gong promotional page is not sufficient here, especially given the enormous claims made by these reports. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 23:17, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks for pulling out the text for me. I think the article itself did not make outlandish claims, instead, it may just report some seeming outlandish claims and leaves the readers to decide.

<li>No, technically it's not the business of WP to report primary sources in the first place. Our job is to wait until it gets picked up by a secondary source, such as a textbook or compendium, from which we turn it into a tertiary source. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 04:51, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>ok. that seems a good comment. If I understand correctly, so you mean although the source is a published journal paper, it has to be cited by any other source to be cited on wiki? Although I personally think it is kind of too much, I follow your suggestion to find where it is cited. I found '<b>two'</b> places.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> per the above. Over 50% of the article is text copied from elsewhere. Might as well read the original studies if you want the info. (ADMIN: Please watch for sockpuppets in this vote.) -<a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMedtopic_fe40.html" title="User:Medtopic">Medtopic</a> 06:44, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, I second fnhddzs's words and want to add that, as part of the Falun Gong article, this information is very relevant since one of the most common claims made by Falun Gong practitioners, as well as the founder himself, is that it is beneficial to health. The page mostly contains results from actual scientific and physiological research and surveys. Although these researchers may support Falun Gong, that does not render their findings POV. The fact that they were published in scientific journals furthers their credibility. I don't know what you're talking about regarding a connection between the editors and the researchers. Also, like all wiki pages, this page is subject to improvement and further editing. I expect that the majority of the quotes will be better summarized in the near future.<a href="../../../m/c/c/User%7EMcconn_bf39.html" title="User:Mcconn">Mcconn</a> 07:18, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> These are NOT genuine scientific research and surveys. Take a closer look. They're more like hoaxes. See my further comment below <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 18:09, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> As I mentioned above, wiki does not care about whether it is genunine or not. For example, if Wallstreet newspaper said a physicist named ABC said the moon is tetrahedron. Wiki articles could report it as long as it mentioned the source since the Wallstreet newspaper is a nice source. <a href="../../../f/n/h/User%7EFnhddzs_3193.html" title="User:Fnhddzs">Fnhddzs</a> 19:39, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and retain <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> tag, add wikify tag. This appears to be an article with a fairly busy discussion page in the process of addressing its (fairly considerable) POV issues. Assuming those are eventually fixed up, this is - on the face of it - a work in progress but valid spin-off from a long main article (which has POV problems of its own). --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 08:00, 24 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm sorry. If an article starts with <i>Research into</i> I expect an article on a research <i>field</i>. Something that has produced enough peer-reviewed journal articles to write a balanced review <b>summarizing</b> the key theories and disputes. Replicating the findings of <i>one</i> third-tier article is not what the title of this article implies, and looking at the edit history I'm not confident that this article will go anywhere, lengthy discussions on the talk page or not. But maybe someone surprises me and cuts this down to size. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 08:46, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Falun Gong is not very comparable to Tai-Chi, as Tai-chi doesn't have a cult movement leader that claims to have supernatural divine powers and claims to be humankind's saviour who will turn all his followers in gods after the coming apocalypse . <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 15:53, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'd say it's relevant of course, no issue with that. But the source used here seems to be a primary source, and - according to <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html#Some_definitions" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable_sources#Some_definitions</a> - primary sources used in WP must be from a reliable publisher. The publisher of claims of positive health benefits from their own research surely cannot be "reliable" in this sense. Note the definition of a primary source includes the following: "In general, Wikipedia articles should not depend on primary sources but rather on reliable secondary sources who have made careful use of the primary-source material." I don't think (from what I have seen) this has occurred in this case. But I say Keep, and feel sure it will be sorted given time. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 13:38, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The large-scale surveys sourced from <a href="http://www.falunau.org/healthsurvey.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.falunau.org/healthsurvey.htm" rel="nofollow">this page</a> appear to be highly dubious too. For instance, these supposedly official scientific studies demonstrate their methodological authority by stating "The data was input into a computer.... The data was analyzed with Microsoft Office 97 Excel version 8.0" (how impressive!). To confirm (why does this have to be confirmed in this way?) something as simple as gender and age distribution of their sample size, the researchers confidently state that used two different statistical methods (again with the indisputable Excel 8.0). The conclusions of the surveys are also completely pro-Falun Gong with very little scientific discussion. In fact, they sound like propaganda or advertising: <i>"The survey showed that the number of people learning Falun Gong was growing bigger and bigger. This was, based on the analysis of the survey, because 1) the practitioners of Falun Gong were able to prove its extraordinary effects through their own practice. After doing Falun Gong, their health was improved. Their intelligence was enhanced. Their minds were widened and clarified. Their bad habits were quit. Their family lives were in amity. They become compassionate in their hearts. Their relationships with other people were harmonized."</i>. This is nothing like genuine scientific research.

<p>"Verifiability" in this context does not mean that editors are expected to verify whether, for example, the contents of a New York Times article are true. In fact, editors are strongly discouraged from conducting this kind of research, because original research may not be published in Wikipedia. Articles should contain only material that has been published by reliable sources, regardless of whether individual editors view that material as true or false. The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is thus verifiability, not truth.</p>

<dd>Well, aside from the issue of basic verifiability in terms of the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_method.html" title="Scientific method">scientific method</a>, the only source for the large scale surveys is a Falun Gong promotion page. Take the large scale surveys out, and you're left with a sample size of six with six control subjects in a peer reviewed journal, which, well, raises the issue that not all peer reviewed journals are equally believable.

<li>Peer review is not sufficient to guarantee reliability of a source. Anyway, regarding the research study example which remains - this study, <a href="http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/acm.2005.11.29" class="external text" title="http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/acm.2005.11.29" rel="nofollow">according to its full abstract</a> takes 6 (six) Falun Gong practitioners who exercise in a Falun Gong way for 1-2 hours a day (and possibly exercise in other ways too for more time - the abstract isn't clear), for at least one year previously, and up to 5 years. These Falun Gong exercisers are then compared to a control group of 6(six) people who <i><b>have not followed any exercise program of any kind for 1 year or possibly longer</b></i>. This second group of people are called a "normal and healthy" group by the research authors. Now, I'm kind of a couch potato, but even I know that doing NO exercise whatsover for a YEAR is not "normal and healthy" (unless you're in some kind of manual labour job), and even a 6 year old can predict that the 6 who are doing special exercises 1-2 hours a day (more than most people!) possibly besides any other exercising will turn out to be healthier than the control group. Again, peer review is not the hallmark of sound research. Now I'm off to the gym machine. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 02:39, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I posted some impact data on the journal and the lone cite to the article on the Talk page. As I mentioned there, the article is probably worth a one-liner, with a caveat about micronumerosity. For those who don't know the scientific publishing industry,m at the bottom of every specialiaztion there are a lot of journals that are essentially scams that milk university libraries for shitloads of money. This journal, by impact factor, seems slightly above that level. It's still not anywhere near what I would consider a sole reliable source for a science article, not to mention that the article itself should write about seconday sources (textbook science), not paraphrase primary sources at length.

<li><b>Keep</b>. To get it out of the way, I've only got 31 main namespace edits, but no vested interest in the fate of this article. I've been reading the <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falun_Gong_9fb1.html" title="Falun Gong">Falun Gong</a> and related talk pages for a while, and at this point I tend to agree that this article is both required and probably the most neutral formulation of the name available. In response to Cordesat's argument, this isn't an indiscriminate list of information, as, from what I've read since first hearing about Falun Gong (May something or other), health benefits are pretty central to the practicioners' claims. Moreover, I tend to disagree with TeaDrinker that the name is inherently POV, or, rather, wonder if anyone can think of a better phrasing? "Supposed health benefits of Falun Gong" implies they're dubious, at best; "Health benefits of Falun Gong," that they're confirmed and true; perhaps, "Claimed health benefits..." As it stands now, the name only states that the claims of health benefits are being studied. All of this has been hotly debated on the main article's <a href="../../../f/a/l/Talk%7EFalun_Gong_1301.html" title="Talk:Falun Gong">talk page</a>. I'm the first to agree with Bwithh that the study which made up much of the content (it has since been removed) is an utter sham; that doesn't invalidate the topic, in my eyes. The current quality is marginal, but the numerous editors of the FG pages should be given a chance to keep working and clean this up; it's taken them quite a while just to get this far. At least let trialsanderrors' suggestion of <a href="../../../p/r/_/WP%7EPR_690c.html" title="WP:PR">WP:PR</a> run its course. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilodespotos_0942.html" title="User:Philodespotos">Philodespotos</a> 05:17, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> First, on the name, I would recommend <i>health effects</i> rather than <i>health benefits</i>, but that's a minor issue.

Third, I tend to agree that health effects of FG warrants its own article <i>if there is in fact a research field on the topic</i>. And I'm less sanguine than you that this field actually exists in any meaningful way. Discussing one unvetted article at length is simply non encyclopedic, regardless of its scientific value. So the question is: <i>what other material is there to turn this into an encyclopedic article</i>? I see that the editors are trying to comply with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, but as long as that's the only piece of clay they have, it'll never turn into a sculpture. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 05:40, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strongly Keep</b>. Many sociological analyses of Falun Gong's spread in China are <a href="../../../r/e/d/Reductionism.html" title="Reductionism">reductionist</a> instead of acknowledging that the relevant questions are extremely multifaceted. Falun Gong's popularity cannot be taken out of the context of its alleged (and possibly empirically verifiable) health effects. The Chinese government initially promoted Falun Gong because it could potentially save large sums of medical expenses. Falun Gong won several prizes and was nominated twice as the "Star Qigong School" in Beijing's Asian Health Expo in 1992 and 1993. The Chinese qigong community has cultural competence to evaluate the effectiveness of different practices, and Falun Gong is the most popular and widespread form of qigong in history. In addition, supernaturality has been one serious discourse in the scientific research on qigong for a couple of decades, so Falun Gong's extraordinary (and fantastical?) claims are no reason to belittle any serious considerations of its validity. Last but not least, this is a <b>daughter article</b>.

<dd><b>Comment</b> You know what. I think the word "Research" implies some negative doubts on the object following it. It does not mean this article has to be about academic research. I am willing to change the title of the article. But I am ok with this current title too. I hope people could understand what I mean.

<li><b>Keep</b> A really important aspect is that Falun Gong practice has really profound health benefits. Even Master Da Liu the Master who introduced Tai Chi to North AMerica said at the age of 95 that he now asks all his students to practice Falun Gong.. So research into health benefits of the system is really relevant. Further the research was done at Baylor College- one of the Nation's top 10 medical institutes..</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> First congratulations to the great health benefits HappyInGeneral received. I would say although Falun Gong practitioners all say Falun Gong is good (even after 7 years of persecution), they say it with a solid reason of which health benefits are significantly correlated. Yeah, maybe personal testimonials here are not very to the point. But media reports mentioning health benefits would be helpful, I will try to find more of that. By the way, the cause for nomination of deletion was POV, now it changed? Anyway, we are doing a vote. Cause is not that important, I think. <a href="../../../f/n/h/User%7EFnhddzs_3193.html" title="User:Fnhddzs">Fnhddzs</a> 03:38, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I vote to keep.</li>
</ul>
<p>although science would probably be unable to completely prove health benefits of Falun Gong and qigong practices - since there is still an issue of belief and enlightening - there are at the same time hundreds of thousands if not millions of cases. Alot are also documented as self evident testimonies.<br />
It would be silly to ignore the experience of such a huge number of people just because they hadn't published it in a well known newspaper.<br />
Falun Dafa never bragged about being able to cure people, this is not a main purpose of the practice and there is no need to show those to prove or validate for Falun Dafa. It stands for itself in all its glory and splendor.<br />
For Wikipedia, which aims to have factual information, health benefits surely happened and there is no problem to mention it.<br />
Just my opinion, Kobi Lurie.<br />
