<p>Please see links to other glamour photographers on Wikipedia, they too share the bios of the photographers, some of which are Rolando's friends today.</p>
<p>As a published author for the second largest photography book company, Amherst Media, and a writer for Cygnus Publication magazines including Studio Photography, PMA Daily, and others I disagree. Not to mention Rolando came on board in 1999 with what Google.com ranked as the top glamour photography site for many years, now Glamour1.com.</p>
<p>Gomez has 27 years of photography, worked with many glamour models and even discoverd the April 2006 Playboy Playmate Holley Dorrough. Gomez has taught over 85 "Glamour Photography" workshop from Canada to Mexico and as a photographer has worked in 39 countries. His recent glamour photography book has even made the Amazon.com list, not to mention his previous DVD on glamour photography was produced by the author of many glamour books, Gary Bernstein.</p>
<p>Gomez has spoken on glamour photography to record breaking crowds at Photo Plus Expo in NYC, the top photographer's annual show, Photo Imaging Design Expo in San Diego, Fotofusion in Del Ray Beach, Fl., and has taught glamour the Palm Beach Photographic Center and the Julia Dean Photo Schools in Los Angeles. For more information see his biography at www.rolandogomez.com</p>
<p>Not to mention, the recent issue of Leica World News magazine ran a three page article on Gomez and his glamour photography. Gomez is sponsored by Leica, the Rolls Royce of cameras, Olympus, Chimera, Hensel Lighting, Lexar and many other companies. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Rolandogomez (<a href="../../../r/o/l/User_talk%7ERolandogomez_5776.html" title="User talk:Rolandogomez">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rolandogomez_8dd9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rolandogomez">contribs</a>) 23:38, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>Mr. Gomez, I hope you realize that every one of your edits to Wikipedia is recorded under your logged-in name - that is, Rolando Gomez. The article you've created is on its face obviously about yourself, and that is the main problem here. Generally speaking, it is much better to wait until someone else writes about you, since that helps indicate that you are notable enough for inclusion. Please also consult <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a> for further explanation. <a href="../../../r/i/d/User%7ERidG_2ba7.html" title="User:RidG">RidG</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/i/d/User_talk%7ERidG_5b69.html" title="User talk:RidG"><font color="#6666CC"><font size="0.5">Talk</font></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RidG_4a2c.html" title="Special:Contributions/RidG"><font color="#6666CC"><font size="0.5">Contributions</font></font></a></sub> 00:01, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

What I don't understand, if you go to Wikipedia and search under "glamour photography" you find similar photographers, such as my friends David Mecey and Andy Chabot. David's Wiki page is similar to mine, my bio and creds.</p>
<p>I'm more than happy to "clean up" or edit what you may need, but I have made significat contributions to glamour photography in the past ten years, enough to earn a spot in the masthead of Studio Photography and as a successful author for Amherst Media, a top photography book publisher in the United States. Not to mention my contributions in general as a photographer and photojournalist. I'd be happy to provide tearsheets.</p>

<p>""Comment"" Thanks Tevildo--I'd be happy to send you a copy of my new book, email me an addy. As I mentioned before, I'm still learning this, and when I initially posted the article, I was still editing, I didn't expect an automatic review and for it to be sent to the deletion category.</p>
<p>Now, since I'm still learning this, have five kids and my own business to run/take care of, what is the next step? Is the article going to be deleted? How is it taken out? Etc. I might add, I saw in the WP link to "vanity" where "newbies" should not automatically be added to the deletion category immediately, they should be addressed first to give chances of correction before arbitrarily judged. Not trying to be mean here, as printed words are often harsher than spoke words, but please understand, I'm new to this and I can contribute as I learn more, in fact, as mentioned earlier, I was asked to come here by another person. Respectfully, Rolando Rolandogomez 01:10, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Rolando - The purpose of the AfD is precisely to avoid "arbitrary judgment" - having this up allows you, me, and other users to have a discussion on the issues with the article, which makes it easier for administrators to arrive at a decision.

<p><b>Note:</b> I may have inadvertainly removed this from the AFD log file when I first saw this notice, this was not done on purpose. I was in the middle of editing this when I was hit with the ADF notice, being a "newbie" I was poking around trying to figure this system out. I'm still learning it, so please bear with me.

<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>To help you in your decisions, I'll share a few observations. I have a long bystander interest in the development of computers, information systems / data bases and worldwide understanding and have met many of the pioneers of modern computers and the world wide web. Hence, I am a fan of Wikipedia. I also enjoy photography as a hobby and took a workshop class from Mr. Gomez. It is evidently that juxtaposition of interests and my comments which gave rise to the current discussion.</p>
<p>First I applaud (as I think would Mr. Gomez) the volunteer efforts of editors to include useful, and exclude non useful, entries. I rather admire this effort.</p>
<p>Relative to the case at hand:</p>
<p>Mr. Gomez did submit amateur model Holley Durrough to Playboy which led to her success in becoming a Playboy "centerfold" model (Miss April 2006). While I was at a workshop taught by Mr. Gomez I met Ms. Durrough. I found her to be an exceptionally photogenic model and a very candid, ambitious, and personable young lady. She (and other models) expressed confidence in, and loyalty to, Mr. Gomez. Mr. Gomez enjoys a very high level of respect from such models.</p>
<p>In the interests of disclosure, such confidence on the part of the models and the enthusiasm of Mr. Gomez led me to enter into a minor business relationship with Mr. Gomez. However, such minor relationship is insignificant relative to my posting.</p>
<p>I empathize with you in dealing with matters of taste, art, politics and personalities. Relevant to the definition of 'glamour photography' my take is that it need not be "erotic". I suggest "including erotic images and other images which are somehow focused on attractiveness in a way not usually found in day to day life". OK, call me verbose, but I think some enlargement would be good.</p>
<p>Good luck with your deliberations.</p>
<p>Steve H</p>
