<li>Well, they're <i>listed</i> for a couple thousand $US. Listing and appraisal don't equate to sale value.

<li>Those sources are short blurbs from websites that sell art. If he were truly a notable late nineteenth or early twentieth century artist, one would expect to find him discussed in books or scholarly resources, but Google Books and Google Scholar turn up goose eggs. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 16:34, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> He's obviously not as well known as Picasso, but he's an artist who received enough note to still come up in a basic web search. He seems notable to me, from what I've seen. I think more citations should be added to the article, and that it should be cleaned up. I also think any portion that is a copyvio should be cut out - but none of those are reasons to delete (rather than just trimming back to a stub, at worst). In any event, I wouldn't jump to the conclusion that the author of the page was somehow associated with the painter (e.g. a dealer or relative). It seems to me just as plausible that he is a huge William Barr fan, noticed the lack of an article about the artist, and signed on just to make one - precisely the sort of thing we like to have happen. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 04:49, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hmm. I'll assume good faith, and maybe I'm in a bad mood (it's pretty early in the morning), but your response seems overly sarcastic and antagonistic. Anyways, I'm not going to get into a debate with you about how many Ghits equals notability - but here I see enough. You disagree? Ok, please feel free. Oh, and are there 5000+ other artists on that website whose names start with the letter B? Great.

<li>I haven't mentioned ghits at all. Now that you mention it, if I put in more than two or three relevant words into a Google search, I come up with nothing. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22William+Barr%22+%22Anne+Beaton%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22William+Barr%22+%22Anne+Beaton%22" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> shows nothing, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22William+Barr%22+%22John+McGilvray%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22William+Barr%22+%22John+McGilvray%22" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> brings up unrelated genealogy, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22William+Barr%22+%22Paisley+Cross%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22William+Barr%22+%22Paisley+Cross%22" rel="nofollow">this one for his "notable painting"</a> shows zero hits. Frankly, if one were to remove all unreliable info from this article, very little would be left. From the tone of it, I wouldn't be surprised if it were a copyvio from a book but I can't prove it.

<ul>
<li>We aren't talking about Ghits? I was under the impression that we were, since that's what you were responding to - but I'll take your word on that. Anyways, the searches you've run (including "Anne Beaton" (I don't know who that is) and "John McGilvray" (same problem - though I see the name in the article)) seem to me to be poor indicators, and I'm in no way surprised that an individual work of art by a minor artist doesn't show up in a Google search. (I'd suggest running the artist's name and "artist.") To address your other points: if the article is about someone on whom there is reliable information, but is not based on that reliable information - write something reliable (or add a tag asking someone else to). If it's a copyvio, cut it down to a stub. I disagree about the claimed "spammy" tone - I rarely receive spam regarding early 20th century artists, and sincerely doubt (unless you can point me to something more than a naked allegation) that it's blatant advertising. I would be very surprised to find someone actively advertising the works of a long-dead painter. On the other hand, articles about them are precisely the sort of thing I'd expect to find in an encyclopedia. So I'm still on the side of keep. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 15:56, 15 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Search this page - the first mention of Google and ghits is not mine. The three searches I just did were all with the first three unique-looking things I saw in the article. We agree that the whole article should be chopped down to a stub - and it will be if no one finds sources for it all. The search you suggest is a common misconception at AFD - if you search on his name and "artist", all you've proven is that he's an artist. I'd like something to prove that he's a <i>notable</i> artist - or at least more notable than the 5,000+ artists that start with the letter B on that page. You yourself just characterized him as a "minor artist" which doesn't speak well for his notability. I'll drop the spamminess hints - at the very least, the last sentence left me with a spammy feeling. The whole thing leaves me with a copyvio feeling: <i>William Barr was struck by the beauty of the California landscape...</i> - how does anyone know that? <i>John McGilvray was a successful builder...</i> - based on what? Who says? I'll bet whatever brochure it was copied from says. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 19:59, 15 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wait - your comment is under mine, and I took it to mean that you were discussing what I was saying. Are you <b>not</b> discussing whether my comment on web searches was accurate? (I suppose the web search we were discussing could have been done with Yahoo, but I think that's a distinction without a difference.) Anyways, I don't think it matters, and will gladly grant you that it was my idea to talk about Ghits if that will resolve that part of the question. You are, however, confusing (if you'll excuse my saying so) notability with fame. They aren't the same thing - and a notable artist <i>can</i> be a minor artist. (Wikipedia should include minor, perhaps even obscure, artists.) I also disagree about the "searching his name with artist only proves that he is an artist." If I searched for Joe Smith with artist, and got lots of pages saying "Joe Smith is an artist," that's probably (though not always) a notable artist - notable enough to have been mentioned as an artist multiple times. Have I found something saying "Joe Smith is a notable artist who probably would meet the standards of AfD"? No - of course not. But if I've found enough about the person (and I think I have here), then he's probably notable. So, I'm still in Keep. The copyvio thing - yeah, like I said, I get the same general feeling. As I've said all along, I think it should be trimmed and cleaned up.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 21:39, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
