<li><b>Comment</b>, I wasn't aware of the previous nom when this was nominated. However it stands as the deletion of several other racial groups has now set a preceedent.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Your opinion of what we need or don't need is not relevant. At present, you are aware of the previous nom and the result of Keep. Your nom should be immediately withdrawn on procedural grounds. Otherwise, I assume this nom was made in bad faith from the beginning. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 19:12, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>As I said, that is your opinion, however the fact that serveral lists of people by race have been deleted since that AFD counters your opinion.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 22:21, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: If you bothered to follow VfD, you would know that some were deleted before this list was voted Keep. Some lists have been kept repeatedly. Some are deleted. The fact that certain lists may or may not have been deleted in the last two weeks changes nothing- particularly regarding wikipedia policy. There have been no material changes to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Precedents_b87f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Precedents</a>.

<dd><b>Further Comment</b>: In fact, this nom is pure <b>bad faith</b>. You have not disclosed that <b>you created</b> List of Caucasian Americans on Nov 29 to make a point. Furthermore, you have stated above that you were not aware of the previous nom for the Native American list. In fact, you talk directly about it here <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html#List_of_Caucasian_Americans" title="User talk:Calton">User_talk:Calton#List_of_Caucasian_Americans</a>.

<dd>The fact I created List of Caucasian Americans is irrelevant and it was not created to make a point as it was a legit article based on preceedent set by the AFD on List of African Americans, however that preceedent has now been superceeded in my opinion by the deletion of the Caucasian list. And I don't see what that link has to do with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Native_Americans_4323.html" title="List of Native Americans">List of Native Americans</a> or this <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Indigenous_people_of_the_Americas_0d42.html" title="List of Indigenous people of the Americas">List of Indigenous people of the Americas</a> as it was neither mentioned in that discussion you link to nor even implied.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 23:42, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. This list can never be accurate. Ethnicities are not yes/no things. You cannot say this person is an Indigenous person because somewhere down the line they had a relative who was Indigenous person. My great-grandfather emigrated to Canada from the Ukraine. Does that make me Ukrainian? If so, then I'm also Scottish, French and Irish. This list would be fine if it was about culture or religion (things people choose to take part in and can be referenced - or do we not need proof for the labelling we do?) but ethnicities are too blurry of a concept. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMaclean25_1193.html" title="User:Maclean25">maclean25</a> 00:14, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>. Shades of Indian Removal and assimilation! This list takes up little space, gives people an introduction to some noted people of Indian ancestry. I don't understand the claim that it's unmaintainable. That's up to people who care about it. As for questions of "authenticity", if you're unsure, ask an Indian. This isn't just about *ethnicity*, it's also about *culture*. And some history that some folks may find uncomfortable. <a href="../../../t/w/a/User%7ETwang_e849.html" title="User:Twang">Twang</a> 02:05, 14 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This isn't about culture. I'd be ok with culture-oriented lists, such as 'List of Aboriginal Artists' or 'List of Native American writers'. But this list is only about ethnicity. It gives the wrong impression to readers: that somebody is either an 'Indigenous person' or not. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMaclean25_1193.html" title="User:Maclean25">maclean25</a> 06:07, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
