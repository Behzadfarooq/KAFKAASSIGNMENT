<p><b>del</b>. An article obviously written by a Westerner who doesn't know Russian language (probably based on a newspaper article written by a similar ignorant). In Russian language "novostroika" simply means "new construction"/"new construction site", without any alleged relation to the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collapse_of_the_Soviet_Union_340c.html" title="Collapse of the Soviet Union">collapse of the Soviet Union</a>, and hence the term bears no specifically "Russian" flavor. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 03:09, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The text is useless in its primitivistic form, especially for such a general topic you suggest, to cover problems, changes (eg in financing and techniologies) and developments.

<li>Not arguing with Mikka about the term, just want to say that user:Mno is indeed fluent in Russian nd Ukrainian and is indeed a Kievan. I corresponded with him by email in Russian. He made a mistake all right but the article is worth something. So, I'd still move it with all due respect to the nominator. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 19:18, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>I will say that you are free to do as you wish. The topic does have a lot of issues. However, I would argue that what I originall wrote was giving a relatively accurate view of the subject after the mid-90s. I was wrong in not mentioning that a literal translation is "new construction". Sure, remove the second paragraph, and rearrange the first. The last paragraph comes directly from the Russian Governments television report in the news on RTR. In response to personal attacks that I don't speak Russian, I do. Thank you to Irpen for pointing that out. I was born in Kiev and do speak both languages fluently. Such personal attacks without any proof whatsoever should be considered as proof to question the attacker. (Ironically, part of the original nomination was lack of proof.) <a href="../../../m/n/o/User%7EMno_3310.html" title="User:Mno">mno</a> 20:38, 1 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK I made mistake about the knowledge of Russian by the contributor. It was simply beyond my understanding how a Russian native speaker would write <i>Новостройка is a term used to refer to Western-style apartment buildings</i>, which is so obviously wrong. It is just like to write <i>"<a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_poetry.html" title="Russian poetry">Russian poetry</a> is a term used to refer to literary works of <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Pushkin_8d12.html" title="Alexander Pushkin">Alexander Pushkin</a>"</i>. But the key phrase from the article is <b>"The most, and usually only, difference is the fact that there were constructed more recently"</b>.
<ul>
<li>My reasoning behind this now that I think back over it, is that I wanted to emphasize that they were not necessarily better than the old buildings. You are right, the most important point has to be that it simply means new construction, and perhaps ideas from the rest should be moved elsewhere.&#160;:) <a href="../../../m/n/o/User%7EMno_3310.html" title="User:Mno">mno</a> 21:34, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This says it all. If one wants an article about Residential construction in Russian Federation, it must be way better than that. There is no big deal for the original author and those who support him, to salvage what is salvageable from the text, do a little bit more google search and start a new, decent article for an important, but missing topic. A single RTR news report is not enough. Also, please don't forget to list the sources; see <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">wikipedia:Verifiability</a>. Not to <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 21:05, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>In fact, there is even no Residential construction in wikipedia at all! Even <a href="../../../c/o/n/Construction.html" title="Construction">Construction</a> article has no such section. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 21:23, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Just to add: I generally do not just publish something and let it be there. I always ask for comments from others indirectly by announcing my articles somewhere. Perhaps announcing it only on the <a href="../../../u/k/r/Portal%7EUkraine_New_article_announcements_8640.html" title="Portal:Ukraine/New article announcements">Portal:Ukraine/New article announcements</a> was not enough, considering the breadth of this article. There was no response from anyone, and now there is the motion to delete the whole article. Why not instead cut it to make it what is should be? As some others pointed out, there is some text there that could be scalvaged. Regarding RTR: of course, it's not enough for the whole article, but it is proof, regardless. <a href="../../../m/n/o/User%7EMno_3310.html" title="User:Mno">mno</a> 21:40, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. (from another native Russian speaker). The usage of the word "Novostroika" I am most familiar with is to refer to the areas of the cities containing mainly apartment complexes, usually built in the last 20 - 30 years. Often these areas are very different from older parts of the city. The word existed (with the same meaning) even before the collapse of the USSR. Not sure if it deserves a separate article in Wikipedia. I removed the mentioning of the collapse of the USSR from the article, so it should not bear on the decision to delete or to keep the article Vlad1 01:57, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks, Vlad. I think that since now we have significant attention on this article and topic (which is actually a very backwards way to give it attention, but that is partially my fault, too), I would like to propose that we <b>not delete</b> the article but rather work on it to make it viable. Maybe split it into several sections or articles. If you still feel that you don't want to have the original article visible through the history, then I guess that would be OK if we delete and then recreate it. However, I don't see any point to this, as I'm sure there are articles that have had a lot of incorrect information in them not be deleted but rather changed, with the history still there. <a href="../../../m/n/o/User%7EMno_3310.html" title="User:Mno">mno</a> 03:25, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
