<p>I've never heard this term used in the music business. It's unencyclopedic. Keeping this article is like keeping an individual article for every type of -phobia and -philia that can be lexically constructed. Eventually, there will be a List of three hit wonders, List of four hit wonders, List of five hit wonders, etc.. It's better to end this now before it gets out of control. <a href="../../../h/c/t/User%7EHct_70e5.html" title="User:Hct">Hct</a> 06:02, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - despite the attack of the sockpuppet wonders, I think two-hit wonders is about as valid a topic as one-hit wonders - in my experience, they tend to be one-hit wonders who are able to parlay the fame of that one hit into... a <i>second hit</i> (which is usually a cover of another band's previous hit). I would stand against three- or more hit wonders, because, well, they're really not wonders. -- <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates">8^D</a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><font color="DarkGreen">gab</font></sup></a> 07:21, 2005 Apr 7 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, it goes against my religion to agree with sockpuppets, but googling "Two-hit wonders" +music pulls up over 2000 hits.

<center><s><b>WHY YOU NEED TO VOTE TO KEEP</b></s></center>
<center><s>ATTENTION TWO HIT WONDER FANS AND PROSECUTORS!</s></center>
<p><s>I just want to say that Two hit wonders are real!</s></p>
<p><s>If you are reading this, you may or may not know that the two hit wonder community's faithful devotion to two hit wonderism is currently under siege from doubters of the two-hit wonder craze. Those of you who frequent the hit wonders section of Wikipedia.com may notice some recent vfds. Click them to see the travesty of Wikipedia. A faithful member of the two hit community by the alias of "KelisFan2K5" has spoken out against prosecutors of the two hit wonder craze.</s></p>
<p><s>The problem right now is that there is a group of ignorant two hit wonder opposers who believe that two hit wonderism is "non-sense" and is vandalism and/or a false proclaimation. TWO HIT WONDERS ARE REAL AND IS SWEEPING THE GLOBE. OPEN YOUR EYES.</s></p>
<p><s>In order to support all the offended two hit wonder fans out there, and also to back up KelisFan2K5's bold stand, I will lay out my argument in a series of proofs.</s></p>
<p><s>Proof #1: It should be quite obvious by now that Two Hit Wonder Forums is a lively and growing fan community. What started out as a simple means of communication between friends of the wonders turned out to be an extensive base and archive of information regarding our mysterious two hitters. Unlike many fan forums, Two Hit Wonder Forums is actually active and is visited/updated almost every day. Also, it should be noted that the rumour mill is still live and kicking despite the paucity in two hit wonderism for a good 9 years or so. Other X-hit wonders that do not have a "mania" named after them do not have fans that generate rumours about the next wonder. Two hit wonders has very faithful fans that generate rumours because they are excited and anxious to see a two hit wonder in their next appearance due to "Two hit wonder fever" (which is a symptom of "Two hit wonder mania"). And plus, isn't the whole point of rumours a sly way for artists to gain popularity and ground before a huge upcoming release of their work? Enough said.</s></p>
<p><s>Proof #2: Considering the internet did not become popular until well after the casettes sales ended, it can be concluded that Two hit wonders came into existence after other two hit wonders left the spotlight of the music industry. However, the "VFD" section of the website clearly shows that people still greatly care for two hit wonders even after they left the music spotlight. That is a proof of "Two hit wonder mania" because TWENTY-TWO dedicated fans posted with their deep heartfelt thoughts on two hit wonder's unfortunate ejection from the spotlight. Now, from a worldly perspective, 22 is not a big number at all. But Two Hit Wonder Forums is not a huge and official website and is just a simple and humble fansite dedicated to the topic. Therefore, it would be difficult for it to gain a lot of traffic. However, despite the lack of popularity, TWENTY-TWO people still managed to find that website and post their thoughts (some of which are very touching and serious songs and poems). Now, for those of you who doubt the existence of such a dedicated fanbase, I bid you to consider how you may have seriously offended such devoted people, you sick and inconsiderate "Two hit wonder mania" doubters.</s></p>
<p><s>Proof #3: Two hit wonder fansites still exist, despite their disappearance from the mainstream music scene for the clean 9 years. Not to mention that these are not only fansites but there is also a "Page of Worship". "Worship" is normally used to define someone's unconditional praise towards a god-like figure. To simply think that there are fans out there that would out and out worship the "Great Two Hit Wonder" itself, is proof enough that "Two hit wonder mania" is indeed a true phenomenon. I would go as far to say that any "Two hit wonder mania" doubters are intolerant of this religion, belief, and creed. By doubting the exist of "Two hit wonder mania", you also neglect and disacknowledge the existence of a worship medium towards the enigmatic Two Hit Wonder. You know what happens when you become an intolerance extremist? You turn into a nazi. And do you guys want to know what happened to the nazis of Germany? They lost World War II and are regarded as one of the most disrespectful groups in all of history. If you doubt the existence of Two Hit Wonder worshippers, you should very well just say "let's eradicate all visible minorities because they are 'non-sense' and a 'vandalism' to the world".</s></p>
<p><s>Proof #4: Dedicated Two Hit Wonder fans have held private Two Hit Wonder statue dedications to commemorate such great and joyous artists. That's right, for the past two years on January 7th, Two Hit Wonder fans have gathered for the annual "Two Hit Wonder Statue Commemoration" to celebrate such an important day in the history of mankind. During these parties, the fans get together and buy a customized statuette that features a two hit wonder's face in order to recognise their greatness.</s></p>
<p><s>This easily proves the existence of "Two Hit Wonder mania" because only topics with a "mania" named after them have such dedicated fans that would be obsessed enough to have a statue commemoration for the subject without him/her even knowing. Also, "obsession" is another symptom of "Two Hit wonder mania" and obviously, these fans display that. EB 07:52, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</s></p>
