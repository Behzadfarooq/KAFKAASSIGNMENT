<dd>1. That it does not exist</dd>
<dd>2. That it should not be included in wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>This term has come to use due to an as-yet uncatalouged niche in the music scene, both localy and internationally. The term "alternative rock" is currently being used to describe a wide plethora of music styles which show no similarity. Hence it should not be deleted because it is in reality defining a part of a very ambigous style of music.

<li><b>Keep.</b> The term may, as yet, be alien to Americans and Brits, but it is fairly common among us Maltese, and I have often heard the term used to refer to the wide category of 'weird pop' which the article speaks about.

<li><b>Keep.</b> as per Il magistrat. Strampop is a relatively new term and has only just shown up on the Internet. It's obvious that Google returns no results! The term 'Strampop' is commonly used among us locals, therefore Google can not be used as an accurate measure. Many words in the Maltese Language will not return any results on Google. Would someone like to say that they don't exist? The 'Google Excuse' is no valid reason to delete the Strampop Article. Quite a stupid reason if you ask me. AlanPulis 10:35, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Strampop is part of the ever expanding Maltese culture, and is steadily becoming ingrained into University life. I have heard people talking about strampop, and others saying they would normally turn to wikipedia for clarification. My scope was to create a 'hit' for these people, once they type it into the searchbox (seeing as Google returns no hits). It should be kept, for completeness' sake. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilbosh_c595.html" title="User:Kilbosh">Kilbosh</a> 12:40, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Request: Please refrain from twisting words and citing only part of the argument. The origin of any term is to describe an <i>"as-yet un defined niche"</i>. This page is an attempt at cataloguing a neologism which has now gained usage in the community. With regards to the merit of classification, one must accept that genres are very fluid concepts, and that music follows no science. Your failure to see the connection with the afore mentioned bands is not something which I can judge, but nor should it be the basis for <i>the strongest delete of all time, ever</i>. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilbosh_c595.html" title="User:Kilbosh">Kilbosh</a> 15:32, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Clarification No. 2</b> I think <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">User:Proto</a> is assuming that the article in question is flawless when he states that sane classification of music that could suggest Arctic Monkeys, Radiohead, Pink Floyd and Weezer are in the same genre. Assuming that <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">User:Proto</a> is an expert in musicology and a good connoisseur of these aforementioned bands I do believe that the article does need revision since it did not explain clearly enough the concept of Strampop still I think it should be kept.

<li>I think <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">User:Proto</a> can assume for himself, thanks. Kilbosh, in that case, perhaps you could provide sources for usage of this term in the community. Don't worry about them being in Maltese, although an English one is preferable.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I have heard Noise Pollution perform several times and I have to agree that their style is hard to pin down yet i can associate it with the afore-mentioned bands. The beauty of the english language is that it is an ever-changing language and constantly borrows words and phrases from other languages(albeit Maltese not one of them till now) so if one is finding it hard to define this new genre in current english, why not find a word to define it? 212.135.170.82 17:08, 14 March 2006 (UTC) Vazetto</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b>. music is a subjective matter. I strongly believe in the freedom of expression oneself even through music. this is a new style... but so were all the others when they started. why not give these artists space to be creative in new and innovitive ways. i really hope this contribution is not deleted because it is a contribution to culture, something i have at heart. <i>Zuli</i> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 212.56.128.2 (<a href="../../../2/1/2/User_talk%7E212.56.128.2.html" title="User talk:212.56.128.2">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_212.56.128.2_643b.html" title="Special:Contributions/212.56.128.2">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>Yes this term DOES exist and has been used for quite a while. It is part of our maltese culture and I am glad that after god nows how many searches I managed to find it hear. I think that the world should know about this new maltese genre and its attributions. Like it or not this exist amd including it should strengthen and not weaken wikipedia - after all it's the 'from the people to the people' that wikipedia is so known about, and its what makes it so updated and fresh. Off course I agree to some degree of control but in this case this genre does exist and we as 'the people' feel that this should be included, since its part of our culture. <small>—This <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment is by Richardpull (<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERichardpull_b13d.html" title="User talk:Richardpull">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Richardpull_eafb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Richardpull">contribs</a>) .</small>

<li><b>How very funny!!..Not!.. The gist of the phrase above is that the term "strampop" is, perhaps, a colloquialism and, as such, one would not expect it to appear on any Maltese site.

Although my earlier comment was my first contribution to wikipedia, it should not be considered less valid. I use wikipedia from time to time in my research but have never contributed an article.

<li><b>Comment</b> It seems as though some people missed the point. Strampop is a neologism. It is a neologism which has been created in Malta a while ago because of the lack of a suitable genre to describe a certain class of music some people continue to call "Alternative Rock". The whole point is not whether this is a neologism but whether it meets wikipedia's "notability standards" which in actual fact have a lot to say about bands and grammy awards but say nothing about the inclusion of Music Genres. You may not want to accept this fact but strampop does exist. And you may not want to accept this fact but I still believe that it is and will be included in Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> I am not a sock puppet - Name Charles Cassar, Adress 62, Salina Street, Marsaskala, Malta. Come over for a chat if you want to assess my bodily seperation from the other proponents of the term strampop. I am sure the other proponents will equally glad to treat you to tea and crumpets. You can google my name to confirm my existence, since google seems to be the measure of all things. Also please do respect the definition of 'idiolect' given by wikipedia itself; 'An idiolect (sometimes spelled ideolect) is a variety of a language unique to an individual. It is manifested by patterns of word selection and grammar, or words, phrases or idioms that are unique to that individual'. Any one who suggests that my patterns of word selection are equivalent to Killbosh's or Il magistrat's has serious problems. There is, you will be amazed to discover, more than one individual in these islands who can string together five coherent sentences, and the fact that all the proponents of 'strampop' actually possess this ability does not imply that they are one and the same person. Please bring reasoned arguments against the inclusion of strampop not this sockpuppetry cop-out.

I have discounted all the votes by new and anonymous users as per <a href="../../../d/g/f/WP%7EDGFA_21d3.html" title="WP:DGFA">WP:DGFA</a>, given the horrible amount of blatant sockpuppetry, and reviewed the article myself even though it's very clear that this was either an unverifiable, non-notable neologism (unacceptable for Wikipedia) or a hoax. Deleted it is. --<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.
