I don't see what is hurt by keeping it, and I can see many articles that would be hurt by not being linked to it. There is a fuzzy line between neologisms and legitimate accepted terms in new fields of study. It is not a black and white distinction. If anything, we have to draw that line closer to neologisms and allow some of the better examples. This is one such case. I never heard of this term until I saw it referenced somewhere else, and I learned something from reading the article.

<li><b>Keep</b>. A useful term that is actually reasonably widespread among this field; I can try to find more published uses, but a quick google revealed its use in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN0977325008&amp;id=RUfMrW4Pzp0C&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=cisgender&amp;sig=DrZ6iHvnZo83XNEWn0vhPy_ntIw" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN0977325008&amp;id=RUfMrW4Pzp0C&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=cisgender&amp;sig=DrZ6iHvnZo83XNEWn0vhPy_ntIw" rel="nofollow">this book</a> (Medical Therapy and Health Maintenance for Transgender Men: A Guide For Health Care Providers, by R. Nick Gorton MD, Jamie Buth MD, Dean Spade JD), in addition to a reference found in google scholar (not sure if it's the same one referred to above, but this one <i>has</i> been published): <i>Debating Trans Inclusion in the Feminist Movement: A Trans-Positive Analysis</i> (by Eli R. Green), in: "<a href="http://www.haworthpressinc.com/store/product.asp?sku=5799" class="external text" title="http://www.haworthpressinc.com/store/product.asp?sku=5799" rel="nofollow">Challenging Lesbian Norms:</a> Intersex, Transgender, Intersectional, and Queer Perspectives", Edited by Angela Pattatucci-Aragón, PhD Director, Center for Evaluation and Sociomedical Research, University of Puerto Rico, San Juan. Perhaps those keen on deleting pages that define specialised terms and lack references can turn their attention to <a href="../../../c/o/o/Category%7ECooking_techniques_d7e7.html" title="Category:Cooking techniques">Category:Cooking techniques</a> — none of these terms (e.g. <a href="../../../s/a/u/Saut%C3%A9ing.html" title="Sautéing">Sautéing</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basting.html" title="Basting">basting</a>) have cited references from academic publications as far as I can tell. <a href="../../../n/t/e/User%7ENtennis_4280.html" title="User:Ntennis">ntennis</a> 00:49, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If you think <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basting.html" title="Basting">basting</a> is a neologism... nevermind. That is the same paper from google scholar though, I was incorrect that it was not published (the version I read stated it was yet to be published). The <i>Journal of Lesbian Studies</i> is at least described as peer-revied by others. The book seems to be unpublished as far as I can tell. It is a book that is released under GFDL and googling for the ISBN comes up nothing. This is still a far way from demostrating that it has significant use. I'm changing my vote to <b>Transwiki</b> though. kotepho 01:37, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - A term and concept in development. Cisgender was referred to at the recent (2006) ILGA World Transgender pre-conference. Its usefulness is still being explored, one thing for certain it has far more possibility of theoretical usage than 'RG" (real girl) and bio-boy (STW, 02-04-06)--68.203.186.198 19:49, 3 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"usefulness still being explored" seems to me to be the <b>strongest case yet made</b> for this article's deletion. Personally, I think that it <i>is</i> a useful term, but that's not the issue here — it's more relevant to note kotepho's failure to find usage of it in a search of academic databases. Until there is some wider consensus on its usefulness and usage, this term does not fit on wikipedia: see <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> or <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, let alone <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">WP:WINAD</a>.<br />
I fear that some contributors to this discussion appear to be applying inappropriate criteria, by asking whether the term is useful to them <i>personally</i> rather than whether it fits wikipedia's criteria. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> 13:23, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This is from the top of the WINAD page: "Nearly everyone here agrees that in general, stub articles are to be encouraged, provided they meet certain criteria. There are likewise some differences of opinion as to whether just definitions are acceptable for beginning an article. If you want to make everybody happy, add a little encyclopedic information of some sort —don't just give the meanings of the word." It seems to me that this article already has encyclopedic information in talking about the social and political context in which the word emerged, who uses it and why. It would fail to meet this policy if it only consisted of the lead section. The article could certainly be improved though; perhaps you would like to help? <a href="../../../n/t/e/User%7ENtennis_4280.html" title="User:Ntennis">ntennis</a> 03:12, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, if it were <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, it would have been created by the authors. We didn't create it, it's a part of our understanding.

<dd>Did you even read <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>? <i><b>Original research</b> is a term used on Wikipedia to refer to material added to articles by Wikipedia editors that <b>has not been published already by a reputable source.</b></i> It hasn't been published. It is original research. kotepho 19:39, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You can interpret this two ways. I've always read it to mean that "material added to articles <i><b>authored</b></i> by Wikipedia editors that has not been published <i><b>in a book, journal or on the web</b></i> already..." rather than "material <i><b>from any source</b></i> added to articles that has not been published <i><b>in a book or journal</b></i>..." If it is the second case, all of my work on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_largest_suspension_bridges.html" title="List of largest suspension bridges">List of largest suspension bridges</a> is original research because all of my sources were from the web. It is, as far as I know more up to date than anything to be found on paper. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 01:26, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just reporting back, I couldn't find any other published uses of the word. i guess it is mainly confined to less formal forums like personal websites and discussion lists. <a href="../../../n/t/e/User%7ENtennis_4280.html" title="User:Ntennis">ntennis</a> 14:15, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
