<p>It reads like it's just some paintball team that has won some odd tournaments. I'm not seeing any notability. I had it speedy nominated, but the author removed that, so I'm doing it the hard way. Anyone else want to chime in?

<li>Actually its not my team. And i said its greatly considered to be the best in the world. And thats fact just look at the stats that they have. What else can i do to make it a real "article" <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonkeyfloop_0513.html" title="User:Monkeyfloop">Monkeyfloop</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. True, the article needs some sources, but they are easily verifiable, as easy as googling to show some other prima facie cruft or neologism is <i>not notable</i>. When an article claims things like "First Pro Team to win the World Cup"; "Series Titles..." and then a list of multiple world championships, I can't understand why you would state that you are "not seeing any notability". The assertion of notability is there in spades. Here's my two second google results: "The WB and CBS, channels 5 and 8, actually shot some staged play by local Professional teams XSV and <b>Dynasty</b>...NBC will be here TODAY filming several live shots from 3:30 - 6:30 pm." <a href="http://www.paintballnews.com/articles/jan082005/fp.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.paintballnews.com/articles/jan082005/fp.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>; "Dynasty are the reigning champions of the NPPL and PSP circuits" @ about.com's listing of <a href="http://paintball.about.com/od/proteams/" class="external text" title="http://paintball.about.com/od/proteams/" rel="nofollow">Professional Paintball Teams</a>; more info <a href="http://www.warpig.com/paintball/articles/pressreleases/automated/082203dynasty.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.warpig.com/paintball/articles/pressreleases/automated/082203dynasty.shtml" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.68caliber.com/news/story041725.php" class="external text" title="http://www.68caliber.com/news/story041725.php" rel="nofollow">here</a>. --<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 20:33, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The assertion was present, but sources were absent. I'm still not completely convinced, but I may change my mind in light of some of this. That's a big may. Just because NBC or whatnot had a few things from one of their events is not a notability thing, since the local news has recorded various dumb things around my own city that would never get in the Wiki. Also want to add: Monkeyfloop has removed this nomination from the AfD page, though that's been reverted. Please don't. -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">Talk</a> |</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, professional sports teams would appear to be notable under any circumstances, even for minority sports such as paintball.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> non notable team of a non notable sport. Is paintball even organized to the level that there can be professional teams in the true sense of the word? I doubt it.

<li><b>Comment</b> Strothra please do research on the sport before you ask if it is organized. Also maybe turn on ESPN 2 sometime. They are showing one of the world's biggest Paintball Tournaments right now. And also Oliver Lang (who is mentioned in my article) makes 100,000$ a year playing paintball. I'm pretty sure that's professional enough. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonkeyfloop_0513.html" title="User:Monkeyfloop">Monkeyfloop</a></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Strothra, how about www.pbstar.com I think that this is sufficient "notability" for you. Look at all the videos on that site, See how many tournaments have been played by how many people? See all the Locations for the tournaments? New Orleans, Huntington Beach, Tampa, Austin, LA, Paris, London, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Bangkok, Shanghai... How is that for "notability"?</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The Research speaks for itself. <a href="../../../l/i/v/User%7ELiving_large_0d22.html" title="User:Living large">Living large</a> 02:47, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'll roll with a <b>Weak Keep</b>. Some non-primary sources mentioning Team Dynasty or the paintball tournaments they've been involved in would still be appreciable though; especially some more general news / sports news. -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">Talk</a> | 02:49, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>0_o?</b> How are the sources not primary? They come off of the teams official website. That makes absolutely no since to me. Since a primary source is about someone who was actually there, these people were actually there and this is their website thats primary in my opinion. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonkeyfloop_0513.html" title="User:Monkeyfloop">Monkeyfloop</a></li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Ye've flipped it. I said I wanted <i>non-primary</i> sources. These are sites that are <b>not</b> affiliated with the team. Those are more objective by nature. Like I said, it seems like they meet the notability requirements (hence my <b>weak keep</b>), but I'd like to see some mention of they or the tournaments they've been in outside of their own website or the tournament's own website. -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsumed_Crustacean_06d3.html" title="User:Consumed Crustacean">Consumed Crustacean</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EConsumed_Crustacean_e411.html" title="User talk:Consumed Crustacean">Talk</a> | 17:42, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, I will be adding some... <a href="../../../7/1/2E/User%7E71.96.163.107.html" title="User:71.96.163.107">71.96.163.107</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This article does seem to have POV issues, but that can be easily fixed by editing the article. And please people, it is much easier to do basic research before putting an article for deletion. And if something seems to have a biased POV you can fix it to become a better artical, remember constructive criticism is better than just saying something is wrong. <a href="../../../s/m/i/User%7ESmile_Lee_d2f2.html" title="User:Smile Lee">Smile Lee</a> 09:10, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
