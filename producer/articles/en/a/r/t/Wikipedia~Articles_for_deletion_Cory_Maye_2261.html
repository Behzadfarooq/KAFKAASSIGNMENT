<p>This is a non-notable person.

<li><b>Keep</b> this case <i>is</i> having a far reaching effect, I'd usually say delete, but this is much more notable <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Corey+Maye" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Corey+Maye" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. <font color="#708090"><b><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza">ε</a></b><a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncyclopedist_b147.html" title="User:Encyclopedist">γκυκλοπαίδεια</a><i><a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">*</a></i></font><a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncyclopedist_baa9.html" title="User talk:Encyclopedist"><font color="#708090">(talk)</font></a> 19:36, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>The article as I found it had his name misspelled and his birth date off by 2 years. Thanks to Encyclopedist for catching these errors and correcting them. If we keep this article, then we certainly need to continue to clean it up. Currently it seems to be sourced from a single blog and that blog has not been very precise with factual details. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_ac1a.html" title="User:NoSeptember"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> <a href="../../../n/o/s/User_talk%7ENoSeptember_6dda.html" title="User talk:NoSeptember"><font color="blue"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 20:40, 15 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Clean it up!? Well there is a novel idea... almost makes me wish we had posted it to a forum that allows that to happen in an open manner. If it is deleted no more than 3 days after it is posted in the first place where is the collaboration to come from? Do you understand what the strength of an interactive and user managed Wiki is?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Keep as per Encyclopedist. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 20:04, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>! Non-notable? The guy is to be put to death, he was not even supposed to be arrested. The original "raid" lacks physical documentation. This is VERY pertinent.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as this issue is being followed across the blogosphere.</li>
<li>Seems like a keeper to me also --<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECensorwolf_2a85.html" title="User:Censorwolf">Censorwolf</a> 20:18, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> it should be in the news. It's not. Please don't censor it from here as well.</li>
<li>This deserves explanation: Corey Maye is a prisoner on death row in Mississippi. Police officers entered his apartment on a search warrant. He shot and killed one officer. He had no criminal record prior to this event. The police found one joint and/or trace amounts of marijuana in the residence. There was no other associated crime. Maye claims he was sleeping when the police entered and that he fired in self-defense, unaware that the man approaching him was a police officer. His defense attorney had never handled a capital case before. Maye is black and the officer was white. He's garnered some attention in the liberal blogosphere (which isn't encyclopedic, unfortunately). Two legitimate news outlets have covered the story: a local newspaper and the local NBC television affiliate. I checked the websites for Amnesty International and the NAACP: neither site returns any results for his name. After some hard thought I'm voting <b>keep.</b> Two mainstream news sources is enough. This has encyclopedic interest as an example of the United States death penalty system. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 21:00, 15 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Having an explanation was a good idea. People need to realize that a blog is not necessarily a good or credible news source. I expect most of the unsigned comments on this page came here from the blogs. There are literally millions of people in prison and many if not most assert their innocence. Being imprisoned and claiming innocence is not enough to be a notable person. As noted in the nomination, this is a stand alone article linked to nothing else, most likely created by a blogger who desired an article on this person. There seems to be some interest in the case, which is fine by me, but that is a case by case thing. Being on Death Row does not make one automatically notable. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_ac1a.html" title="User:NoSeptember"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> <a href="../../../n/o/s/User_talk%7ENoSeptember_6dda.html" title="User talk:NoSeptember"><font color="blue"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 21:27, 15 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> This looks like an unusual case. I gather that this became eligible for the death penalty because the court found that the shooting occurred in the commission of a crime. This logic normally applies to armed robberies, not misdemeanor drug possession. While I'm no legal expert this certainly piques my interest. So does the defendant's lack of any prior criminal record. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> It's a capital murder case because the prosecution says Maye knew Jones was a cop. Killing a cop is worse than killing a mere "civilian", you know. <a href="../../../t/a/m/User%7ETamfang_5c14.html" title="User:Tamfang">Anton</a> 02:21, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> While the story is developing and not all the facts are fully known yet, I don't think this is non-notable. --<a href="../../../e/r/r/User%7EError28_2263.html" title="User:Error28">Error28</a> 21:32, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, I've heard about this person many times before seeing his page on wikipedia. Definitely notable. Strong keep. --<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPierremenard_b03f.html" title="User:Pierremenard">Pierremenard</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> While merely saying "he should be in the news and he's not" is not a reason to keep an article (I'm glad to see that our recent policy change has um, encouraged, more people to actually open user accounts, the new people need to realize what arguments they need to use, and not use, in deletion votes. This will be instructive). I believe this case is arousing national interest in the U.S. and will eventually be covered by the major media. I know we <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">don't consider blog posts to be serious sources</a> (a policy I think deserves more nuance) but the fact here is that an awful lot of bloggers, people who usually don't agree on much, are picking this case up and drawing attention to it. There is a website devoted to it which has nothing to do with the blog. Eventually the media we consider reliable sources will do stories. I'd rather have the article now than recreate it later. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 22:20, 15 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: "<i>links to no other articles in en.wiki.</i>" Huh? Within hours of the article being added, I spent one myself slavishly going through and linking where necessary. I have since dabbed a bunch. At the time this AfD was posted, there were plenty of links to other articles. I cannot see how I can assume good faith here, given that the many links in the article were present at the time and could not have been missed. I think that argues even more strongly for a keep. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 22:28, 15 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I was referring to other articles that linked to the Corey Maye article (click on "What links here" to see what links to the article). In other words, there are no incoming links, you added plenty of outgoing links. Please don't let your "good faith cushion" run so thin.&#160;;) <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_ac1a.html" title="User:NoSeptember"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> <a href="../../../n/o/s/User_talk%7ENoSeptember_6dda.html" title="User talk:NoSeptember"><font color="blue"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 22:46, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Maye himself is not notable, but then that's partly the point: the guy had no criminal record yet is slated for death after a murder that might have been a justifiable killing.
