In various forms Biblical criticism has been going on for almost 2000 years.

Talk about subjects like the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genealogy_of_Jesus_8dec.html" title="Genealogy of Jesus">Genealogy of Jesus</a>, not the verses one by one. The verse structure is a mediaeval construct. Often the books were divided into verses and chapters simply in such a way as to get a nice or significant number of them, like 50 (n.b. one of the gospels, I believe it is Mark, has <a href="../../../n/u/m/Number_of_the_beast.html" title="Number of the beast">666 verses</a> in total), rather than trying to respect the original sentence divisions. The only reason they weren't deleted/merged half a year ago is because the closing admin was biased and chose to count the vote as a keep despite the fact that twice as many people voted to delete and/or merge the articles than did to keep them. --<a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">Victim of signature fascism</a> | help remove biblecruft 01:51, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> -- At the end of the day there is very little value to individual articles on most Bible verses; there are of course exceptions, but for the most part it's logically fallacious to draw any conclusions from a verse in isolation. In addition, if an effort was made to put said verse in context (both Biblical and cultural), the resulting article would be ungainly and suffer from redundancy issues with nearby verses. If there is a precedent set for indiscriminately keeping articles on arbitrary Bible verses, then it's a bad one. If there's an acceptable level of granularity for such writing, it isn't this (except, possibly, in the case of Proverbs). (In the case of the Quran, it's likely to be by sura, though even then there's individual verses that stand out. I make no such definitive claims for the Bible, as even chapters are later emendations.) <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 04:45, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, whoa whoa whoa, guys, I'm not religious at all, but the Bible (and the New Testament as part of the Bible) is the most obsessively studied and interpreted and commented upon book in human history. Every single verse has been subjected to endless hair-splitting and analysis by theologians. There is more than enough material out there for a lengthy, informative article on any bible verse. Are Bible verses less notable than individual characters from video games? I think not. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 01:24, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You presume that I think characters from video games should have articles. This is a single, unimportant verse from the Bible. You might find, in a very large concordance, an analysis of every single verse in this way, but it's far more likely that you would discuss a passage rather than a verse. I can't think of very many verses which are in and of themselves notable, one being John 11:35 ("Jesus wept") which is famous mainly for being the shortest verse in the Bible. What people remember is passages, like Ps.23 or Is 9:1-6 (The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light, etc. - an aria from Handel's Messiah). Individual verses are almost without exception ridiculously trivial. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 12:01, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
