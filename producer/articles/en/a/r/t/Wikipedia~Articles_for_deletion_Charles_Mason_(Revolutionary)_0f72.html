<li><b>Keep</b> What? Vanity page? If you talk to those who know about these things in the UK, this is hardly a vanity page. This is a man who was imprisoned for a lengthy period of time for his beliefs, and has never fully recovered from his experiences. Talk to any genuine left-wing student at any of Britain's more 'academic' universities, and you'll find his name held in the highest esteem. It's mainly due to the UK's capitalist press that he's been almost excised from general political consciousness (such as it exists now in the UK) - not the case whilst the Morning Star (Socialist Worker) was still around. Is this yet another attempt by capitalist society to try to delete this hero of so many true socialists from ever having existed?

<li><b>Delete</b>. Google doesn't have anything to say about the guy, (after filtering out Charles Dixon and misspellings of Charles Manson). Always ready to lend support in the fight against sockpuppets, (the sock puppet revolution will not be televised). <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunc_268d.html" title="User:Func"><tt>func</tt></a><a href="../../../f/u/n/User_talk%7EFunc_0951.html" title="User talk:Func"><tt>(talk)</tt></a> 00:02, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I think there's a lot of supposition going on here. Maybe MI6 are still blocking the guy. Not fair to delete on such skimpy evidence. Suggest we leave it up.

<li><b>Keep</b> It shouldn't be the function of Wikipedia to try to blot out left-thinkers just because their politics don't fit in with current political fashion

<li>This is User:62.252.224.17's <b>third</b> vote.

<li><b>Keep</b> That's the whole point some people are missing here. Of course he doesn't show up anywhere. Wikipedia is the one place the thought police can't get at - though I see they're trying to. I'm a student at LSE in London, and there are lecturers here who say they know of this guy from way back - I believe them.

<li><b>Keep</b> I went to Sheffield University during the 90s and seem to remember a brief article in the student paper about him - we had a discussion about it with lecturers in the Department (Politics) and one of them had studied with him at university, although didn't remember him particularly favourably! Slightly dubious about the conspiracy theory argument but people certainly knew about him at Sheffield - think it would be wrong to delete in case there is some kind of cover up.
<ul>
<li>The above edit was from 212.50.160.44 (<a href="../../../2/1/2/User_talk%7E212.50.160.44.html" title="User talk:212.50.160.44">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_212.50.160.44_acd2.html" title="Special:Contributions/212.50.160.44">contribs</a>). Dear Mr. 212.50.160.44, if there is a "cover up" going on, wouldn't the better place to "post" this nonsense be to news agencies rather than an encyclopedia? Please stop playing here.

<li><b>Keep</b> I hit upon this stuff a few minutes ago, and I don't believe what I see. Who is this 'Func' person anyway? An American. What the hell does he know about British (or indeed world) politics? Just take a look at his user page and form your own opinion! Who is playing games here? Who is trying to be funny? Lack of political awareness and a peculiar skill for playing with IP addresses does not give you the right to control who is or is not relevant to Wikipedia. This is an international resource (including the UK), and not just for Americans, despite what you might think. You are not the only person with an opinion. Take a look above - this is so obviously not the work of whoever created this page. You are entitled to your opinion, but whatever you might think, you are not a God. Far from it.

<li>Right, and as an American, I was not aware that the city of <a href="../../../d/i/s/Diss.html" title="Diss">Diss</a> derives its name from Dante's <i>The Divine Comedy</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Diss&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=14605596" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Diss&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=14605596" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, nor did I know that Diss is a "seperatist stronghold".

<li><b>Keep</b> There's enough on this page alone to verify the article. This guy is obviously a cult left-wing hero, pretty well known in the UK if not in the US. Whether or not there's some sort of attempt to obliterate him from public knowledge isn't clear, but it does seem possible, and Wikipedia shouldn't allow itself to be hijacked in this way. Let it stay.
