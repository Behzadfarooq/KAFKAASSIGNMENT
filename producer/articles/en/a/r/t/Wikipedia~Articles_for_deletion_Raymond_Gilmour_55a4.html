<li><b>Keep</b> - Most of the IRA biogs that have been added recently are not very notable in my opinion. This chap, however, is. One reason for this is that he was a member of both the PIRA and the <a href="../../../i/n/l/INLA_887e.html" title="INLA">INLA</a> while also working for the RUC Special Branch. When he becamea supergrass his testimony was used to convict a large number of republicans. His paramilitary career is therefore a notable, though minor part of the history of the Troubles. Perhaps more importantly, he has written a book about his time as a republican paramilitary, "Dead Ground -Infiltrating the IRA", (Warner Books 1998 ISBN 075152615)<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dead-Ground-Infiltrating-Raymond-Gilmour/dp/0751526215" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/Dead-Ground-Infiltrating-Raymond-Gilmour/dp/0751526215" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Excuse me, but what exactly is not objective here? The Diplock Courts were special anti-terrorist courts with no juries. Under the supergrass scheme, the only evidence was the testimony of the informer. For this reason, most of the cases brought before it were thrown out by Lord Lowry, who did not find the witnessses to be credible. Where is the bias in what I wrote? Please explain. I edited this article in good faith and resent the allegationof bias. Gilmour is notable, aside from his role in the supergrass trials, because he is the subject of a high selling book and numerous newspaper articles. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Independent_de8a.html" title="The Independent">The Independent</a> article here <a href="http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/theatre/features/article13312.ece" class="external autonumber" title="http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/theatre/features/article13312.ece" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></dd>

<dd>The only alteration I made was including the term 'Diplock courts'. So I don't see where you got the "(very) doubtful objectivity" from. It's ok though, I accept your retraction. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJdorney_3c50.html" title="User:Jdorney">Jdorney</a> 16:17, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not sure what you think I have retracted, but I stand by all my comments above. If you read the article from the viewpoint of someone coming to it without any specialist knowledge they would get entirely different impressions between reading the first draft and the revision. Excluding the reference to <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diplock_courts.html" title="Diplock courts">Diplock courts</a> makes it read as though a <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kangaroo_court.html" title="Kangaroo court">kangaroo court</a> was involved; including the reference makes it slightly clearer that, despite extraordinary circumstances, legal principles were adhered to.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Unfortunatly Gilmours activities as a tout led to many arrests of people, particularly in Derry. His activities as a tout have been well documented and have been investigated by numerous journalists - Peter Taylor being a prime example who deals with him in his book and documentry 'Provos'. He has also been in the news recently (which was a headline story in Ireland).
