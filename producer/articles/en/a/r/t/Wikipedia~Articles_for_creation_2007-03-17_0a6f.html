<p>THE STILL LIFE explores the fragile separation between failure and success and love and tragedy through an artist who struggles to regain himself and his identity after giving in to conventional success.</p>
<p>THE STILL LIFE details the life of reclusive, alcoholic artist Julian Lamont <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Barry_26e5.html" title="Jason Barry">Jason Barry</a> and his journey along a path of destructionism – a new genre of art that he accidentally develops during a night of self-loathing. Throughout the film, he is faced with a myriad of relationships that force him to take responsibility for his personal choices and to make a decision about the kind of artist that he wants to be.</p>
<p>First-time director, Miller gained experience in the film world by serving as a set dresser on numerous productions, including “All the Rage.” Previous to forming Albion Entertainment, he worked at a recording studio for acts such as <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Idol_d44e.html" title="Billy Idol">Billy Idol</a>, he later toured with bands including <a href="../../../g/u/n/Guns_N_Roses_2c3f.html" title="Guns N Roses">Guns N Roses</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stone_Temple_Pilots_669e.html" title="Stone Temple Pilots">Stone Temple Pilots</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Cranberries_e8aa.html" title="The Cranberries">The Cranberries</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poison.html" title="Poison">Poison</a>. While traveling with these bands, Miller gained an even deeper appreciation for art and began working on THE STILL LIFE. Miller took his film and music experiences and brought his idea to fruition.</p>
<p>THE STILL LIFE came together incorporating up and coming actors and established musicians to create an entertainment powerhouse. The film also features Holly Fields, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_O.C._1fa0.html" title="The O.C.">The O.C.</a>; <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angel_Boris_9305.html" title="Angel Boris">Angel Boris</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Hospital_da91.html" title="General Hospital">General Hospital</a>; and Robert Miano, <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donnie_Brasco_e2b2.html" title="Donnie Brasco">Donnie Brasco</a> along with a myriad of cameos ranging from <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan_Davis_2560.html" title="Jonathan Davis">Jonathan Davis</a>, lead singer of <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korn.html" title="Korn">Korn</a>; <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tiny_Lister_8978.html" title="Tiny Lister">Tiny Lister</a>,<a href="../../../f/r/i/Friday.html" title="Friday">Friday</a>; <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josh_Todd_558a.html" title="Josh Todd">Josh Todd</a>, lead singer of <a href="../../../b/u/c/Buckcherry.html" title="Buckcherry">Buckcherry</a>; Domenica Cameron-Scorsese; <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kato_Kaelin_0798.html" title="Kato Kaelin">Kato Kaelin</a>; <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Snow_b97c.html" title="Al Snow">Al Snow</a>, WWE Wrestler; <a href="../../../y/o/l/Yolanda_King_17db.html" title="Yolanda King">Yolanda King</a>, Daughter of <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Martin_Luther_King_Jr._96e9.html" title="Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.">Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</a></p>

<p>Subliminal Punctuation is the abnormal yet deliberate use of punctuation inside of text. It was developed, in part, as a response to search engines to enable certain words to be marked yet preserve their function inside a sentence. And example of subliminal punctuation is: A-dot .wanted. to mak.e a point, yet three more were made.</p>
<p>Pioneered by graffiti artists, the abnormal (or specialized) use of punctuation posed a problem when certain computer programming symbols are read as commands for a program to follow. Through the use of Subliminal Punctuation, artists were able to open a new door: one rightfully called the potential of punctual identity, (sic).</p>

<p>W. “Slash” Shaani</p>
<p>An immortal creature. He simply exists. Repeated suicides have failed; as have assassinations. Despite many attempts to destroy internal organs with various and assorted poisons and blunt objects (note--illegal substances) has managed to survive and is quite possibly the most self-deprecating creature in existence.</p>
<p>Born: in the time of Christ. Shaani has been cited by several noteworthy witnesses (note--apostles Peter, John, and James) as being present at the time and place of the crucifixion of Christ. Appears in Bible in Proverbs 14:27: “The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, That one may avoid the snares of death.” Eats souls to sustain life, because he has none. What was thought was a poisoning of the Roman Emperor Claudius by Nero has been attributed to the soul-sucking antics of one W. “Slash” Shaani. After killing Claudius, fled to China to escape imprisonment by his successor, Nero (Nero’s suicide may also have been the work of Shaani, nothing has ever been proved). While in China, fed off souls of royal family and killed off the end of the Han dynasty. Left China after realizing that people were on to him. Tried to build an army by leading the Mongols into Europe. Tried to teach them his soul-sucking techniques, to no avail. This is generally attributed as the reason the Mongols did not establish a long-term rule on the European continent. Relocated to what is now modern-day Ireland and the United Kingdom. Lived off souls of snakes in Ireland (disappearance commonly to St. Patrick, though Shaani is the culprit for snakeless Emerald Isle). Caused first schism between eastern and western churches because of unexplained disappearances across Europe of little boys (at this point, he had graduated from simple soul-sucking to molestation as well). After his departure from Europe, leaving a path of destruction in his wake, the churches reconciled. Temporarily. Before he left, he (not Mordred) killed King Arthur, legendary king of the Britons. Beowulf written at some point after this, with Shaani as inspiration for Grendel. This was after Shaani went underground and was believed to be myth. While underground, killed Duncan (just for shits and giggles--completely screwed Macbeth, but inspired incredible play by William Shakespeare.). Went down to Jerusalem for First Crusade. It was a period of mass gorging for Shaani. Souls didn’t have a chance in hell. Only in Shaani’s belly. Killed Thomas a Beckett in England. He didn’t particularly care for Archbishops of Canterbury, though he did enjoy the taste. Killed Richard the Lionhearted. Except Richard was a flaming homo and his soul tasted of elderberries and grilled cheese. That instilled in him a hatred for homosexuals, which he passed down to his daughter. He moved back to Asia, under the alias of Genghis Khan. He is said to have a fathered a line that has resulted in the creation of John Kil. The unexplainable phenomenon of the Black Plague is now known to have been a soul-sucking binge of Shaani’s. Briefly dated Joan of Arc, before she caught sucking the soul out of cattle. It didn’t end well for Joan. Sucked souls of black slaves en route to America, resulting in death of many Africans before they reached shores of New World. Wrote under pen name of Machiavelli. Had many other aliases, some of the more well-known ones being Hernando Cortes, Francisco Pizarro, Jefferson Davis, Adolf Hitler, and William Shatner. Convinced Henry VIII to murder his wives. Responsible for mysterious murder of friend and mentor of Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe. Caused defeat of Spanish Armada by Britain because Spanish souls tasted better. At this point, he drops out of history, although we know he went to Cuba. He resurfaces in the 1970s. He went on vacation in Vietnam for awhile. It was good pickins’. Introduced Jim Morrison (of The Doors) to drugs, an especially underhanded way to get his soul. Thrived in these Cold War years. Was very unhappy when Cold War ended and killed Kurds in Iraq (attributed to Saddam Hussein) one of his tempers. Guest-starred on Three’s Company as a repairman in Episode 7 from Season 3. Though it is commonly believed that David Hasselhoff brought down the Berlin Wall, it is actually the work of Shaani. He was hungry. Created Limeade, possibly the only good thing he has ever done in his entire existence. Was the inspiration for J.K. Rowling’s character Lord Voldemort of the Harry Potter series. Threatened to take Elian Gonzales’ soul, which was the true reason for his return to Cuba. Furbies are made in his likeness. He sucked out Jessica DiNardo’s soul--the only surviving victim of Shaani--and sold it for a Samoa (note--Girl Scout cookie). **if any information on other survivors is available, please contact us. Believed to be succeeded by one daughter (mother generally to be dead or addicted to heroin) who currently resides in the state of Pennsylvania in the United States by name of June Matwijec. Carrying on Shaani’s legacy, she ruthlessly rips out souls of homosexuals. Some say he is the international music artist Gunther.</p>

<p>crux tooth and nail recording artists The year was 1993 and from the ashes of longtime Portland punk band EMPTY TOMB, arose the punk powerhouse that was to The year was 1993 and from the ashes of longtime Portland punk band EMPTY TOMB, arose the punk powerhouse that was to be called CRUX. Upon the demise of Empty Tomb (Kevin left to do Sometime Sunday, Steve was having health problems) the remaining guys quickly began to regroup in the shadows, and within 4-5 months emerged onto the scene with a new vocalist, a new sound, and energy unlike any they had before. The coming together of these four guys from their different backgrounds musically just flowed. With precise, yet room for breath drumming of Mike, the punk and thrash metal and chops of Greg, Andy's melodic punk tendencies, and Rich, the classically trained jazz singer together with the prolific and though provoking socio political/ topical lyrics that all the members contributed to (but Andy and right primarily wrote). Crux had something to say and believe me, with a sound like theirs, people listened. Within a short time upon forming the band put together a demo (nicknamed the green tape) and the guitarist Greg and I formed boot to head records, and we released it (though it was more like we put our name on it). The response was nothing more than shocking, they were getting rave reviews from all over, and even impressed Shawn Stern (youth brigade/ better youth organization (BYO)) so much he called them directly and wanted to hear more. Unfortunately nothing happened with BYO (I'm only speculating here, but perhaps they finally understood the bands conservative leaning lyrics upon further listens)... none the less Crux moved on... within a year we released a new split 7" series titled "Don't spit on me" and the volume one featured two brand new and (I'd say best Crux tracks ever, hard heavy, and ohhh so powerful)... this 7" along with the green tape solidified Crux's place on the roster of the then fledgling label Tooth and Nail records. It wasn't long and Crux went into the studio with Drew Canulette (longtime renown northwest recording engineer) and to record their t&amp;n debut "failure to Yield", this album, overall is the best Crux release ever, this the album simply put, shined. It included the best tracks from the green tape recorded at a great studio this time, along with a handful of brand new scorchers, including one track sung by Andy (foreshadowing what was to come with shorthanded). After the release of this album Crux embarked on a tour with friends and label mates MxPx that covered a good portion of the states, and they berated people with their melodic (sometimes) but always-catchy punk rock sounds... Shortly after this tour, the bands biggest hit came when original bassist, co-songwriter/ lyricist and longtime friend quit the band to peruse his own thing (which would become shorthanded), this stunted the band in the short term, and changed their sound a bit in the long term. But, they would eventually find a good match and collaborator in the youngin Bob Gossett. There is no doubt this new lineup rocked just as hard as the original, but in the process they lost a bit of their melody and replaced it with thrashier, faster, more balls to the wall crossover influences. And soon they had a whole set of new songs and began to record their sophomore t&amp;n record titled "Cakewalk". This time in the studio with Kevin Nettleingham at the helm. Cakewalk turned out to be a great record in its own right, but as expected Crux got heavier in the process, and thrashier, but thankfully they never lost their punk power, their drive or their knack for writing a good punk song. The band toured a few times on this alum, spreading the love to those so lucky as to catch them. But unfortunately this album didn't take them to the next level they needed, and the label began to loose interest and the band and label parted ways. This was good in that it gave the band back some more freedom to do what they wanted, but it also left them without an immediate outlet to release the next record which they had already started writing. It was early 1999 and soon enough Crux decided to give boot to head the option of putting it out, and we were more than pleased to release "How Does It Go?" (again recorded by Kevin Nettleingham), and Crux came home. Unfortunately, the band calling it a day shortly after the record came out shortened Crux's stay at Boot to Head. It was just time, their day had come like all good legends and bands alike. So what's the moral to this story...? You tell me!</p>

LART is a single board computer (SBC) designed by staff of the University of Delft/Netherlands. The creators advertise complete layout by means of CAD files, software and kernel patches for Linux, all released unter the GNU GPL. However they actually don't sell any hardware and their website is currently down.<br />
A standard LART configuration may feature 32 MB DRAM and 4 MB Flash ROM. Most interesting is the low power consumption of less than 1 W while providing ~ 250 MIPS, making it an ideal system for embedded computing.</p>

<p>We would have to start out small if we were to explain the fifth demension. The first demension is a line, right? The second demension is a line squared, a square. The third demension is the square squared, a cube. The fourth dimension is a cube squared. You couldn't exactly draw it with a pencil as you could the others so you could call the fourth demension Time. Now, the fifth demension, you would have to square the fourth demension and you obviously couldn't draw that at all, but the fifth demension could become a tesseract so that you oculd travel through time and space. It is all very confusing, but it is true, a tesseract is basically the fifth demension.</p>

 Gerhardt Krugenkleigel Day is an Alpine Holiday celebrating the fearless actions of Gerhardt Helmut Krugenkleigel.
</pre>
<p>On May 9, 1469, after numerous years of harsh Alpine Winters, Gerhardt Krugenkleigel set out on a mission for the forests of the Alps with his staff in hand.</p>
<p>He began to tap and wrap the trees of the forest with his staff, believing he could frighten the evil spirits away and usher in a more prosperous (and very needed) spring harvest. Coincedentally, the Spring harvest was the best his village had seen in years and it was largely believed that the actions of Gerhardt were to thank for this. As a result of this prosperity, he continued the ritual for the next sixty-eight years, until his death at the age of ninety-two.</p>
<p>The tradition has been carried on by admirers of Mr. Krugenkleigel (with the obvious breaks during the various European wars over the years) to this very day, however, now these celebrations are not limited to the original Alpine reigon alone.</p>
<p>Gerhardt Krugenkliegel Day has been a family tradition for many and, as such, has been passed down through the generations. Krugenkliegel Day is celebrated all over the world, with celebrations taking place primarily in Luxemburg, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Italy, The United States, and Argentina.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Air_Force_e156.html" title="Royal Air Force">Royal Air Force</a> Mountain Rescue Service (RAFMRS) provides land rescue over the mountain areas of the United Kingdom. RAF <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mountain_rescue.html" title="Mountain rescue">Mountain rescue</a> teams (MRTs) were first organized during World War II to rescue aircrew from the large number of aircraft crashes then occurring on high ground (1). The practice at the time was to organize ad-hoc rescue parties from station medical sections and other ground personnel. Experience demonstrated that this could be dangerous. While the mountains of the United Kingdom are not very tall, they contain much formerly glaciated terrain with steep cliffs, talus slopes, high peaks and cirque basins, and generally experience a sub-arctic climate at relatively low altitudes. Snow, and high winds, sometimes in excess of 100 miles per hour, are posssible any month of the year. Rescue operations in these conditions require personnel with specialized mountaineering training and equipment.</p>

<p>An RAF medical officer, Flight Lieutenant George Graham, is credited with creating the first organized team at RAF Landwrog in North Wales in 1943. Graham's team rescued dozens of allied airmen from Snowdonia before Graham was posted to Burma, where he took part in an early pararescue operation (strikingly similar to one generally credited as the beginning of United States Air Force <a href="../../../p/a/r/Pararescue.html" title="Pararescue">Pararescue</a>), saving the life of a <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Canadian_Air_Force_3f81.html" title="Royal Canadian Air Force">Royal Canadian Air Force</a> navigator, Flying Officer W. Prosser (1). Shortly after the war the fledgling service was reorganized and retrained along professional grounds through an influx of trained mountaineers, particularly Sergeant J.R. Lees, whose involvement with the service is recounted by author and mountain guide <a href="../../../g/w/e/Gwen_Moffat_a52a.html" title="Gwen Moffat">Gwen Moffat</a> in her 1964 book about the early days of the service, Two Star Red (Hodder &amp; Stoughton) (2). Other notable early team leaders include Austrian guide Hans Pick, Colin Pibworth, and John Hinde (1).</p>

<p>A mountain rescue operation is known as a "call-out." Particularly noteworthy call-outs include the extended search for the remains of the crew of Lancaster TX 264 of 120 Squadron (RAF), which crashed into Scotland's 3313-foot Beinn Eighe on March 14th, 1951. Recovering all the remains took several months, and led to public criticism of the fledgling service from mountaineering groups, which helped prod the RAF to provide specialized personnel, better training, and proper equipment. Less than a year later, an Aer Lingus Dakota crashed into a mountain near Porthmadog in Snowdonia with 23 people on board, and RAFMRS personnel recovered the remains. Over the 1950s, the service became more professional and better coordinated with civilian authorities. Many noteworthy civilian volunteer <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mountain_rescue.html" title="Mountain rescue">mountain rescue</a> teams in the UK began as RAFMRS "sub-units." Two air crashes high in the mountains of Turkey during the 1950s provided call-outs for the first of several overseas teams of the RAFMRS, based at RAF Nicosia in Cypress. Both crashes had a sense of Cold War espionage, involving secret nuclear papers and equipment. To this day the service's historians feel they lack all the details. Other overseas teams were based in Aden, Yemen, Dubai, and Hong Kong (1). The RAF allowed women team members for the first time in 1988. Since their formation the teams have rescued thousands of civilian walkers and climbers and responded to hundreds of aircraft crashes. Perhaps the most famous call-out of all was for the crash of <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan_Am_Flight_103_91ad.html" title="Pan Am Flight 103">Pan Am Flight 103</a> over <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lockerbie.html" title="Lockerbie">Lockerbie</a>, Scotland in 1988. This terrorist incident resulted in the scattering of human remains over a wide swath of southern Scotland. The call-out involved four of the six teams then in existence and stretched the personnel involved to the limits (1).</p>

<p>All RAF MRT members are volunteers. For reasons lost to history, RAFMRS team members are known as "M.R. troops" or just "troops." Traditionally, team membership is reserved for enlisted men and women; although officers may serve as officers i/c (in charge), this is not at all the same thing as being the team leader. That position is reserved for a senior NCO, generally a grizzled veteran. For some, service on a team is a primary duty. For others it's a part-time activity for which they are granted relief from other normal secondary duties, such as guard duty. Most training is done "on the hill," the term for mountaineering training days. Only a minority pass the three-week trial period required to join. Once accepted, new troops are considered "novices." A "badge test" after the first year is the mark of a trained troop, and permits the wearing of the mountain rescue badge on dress uniform. Walking, mountain navigation, high-angle rescue techniques, rock climbing, and winter mountaineering are the primary training activities, which are carried out in all weathers. A minority of troops practise <a href="../../../f/e/l/Fell_running.html" title="Fell running">fell running</a>, a traditional country sport in northern England, and excellent training.

<p><b>BIOGRAPHY</b> Outstandingly talented rapper group, MIC BANDITZ is giving shape to a new Hip-Hop style initiated by m-flo’s VERBAL. The founder of espionage records, VERBAL is one of this group’s members. They’ve been continuously seeking original and unique style which wouldn’t resemble anything else following VERBAL’s idea of reinventing Japanese Hip-Hop. Their search process can be seen in their musical output such as The Visitors"and "SIXTH SENSE". As Hip-Hop firmly established itself in Japan and the local scene is becoming more and more saturated, it’s no exaggeration to say that the MIC BANDITS are like a ray of light!!</p>
<p><b>VERBAL</b> Needless to say that he’s a member of m-flo. In addition he’s a producer of Heartsdales and SUITE CHIC. Moreover, he collaborates with many artists such as BoA, DJ HASEBE, Fantastic Plastic Machine. He produces not only Hip-Hop but also often ventures into other musical genre.</p>
<p><b>Arkitec</b> His sense of rhythm is above average for a Japanese person. His style is flexible enough to collaborate with Crystal Kay and Namie Amuro. Apart from being a member of MIC BANDITZ, he’s also a rapper of Lovedelic who fuse various genres of music, from Hip-Hop to Jazz to Rock.</p>
<p><b>ClenchMr.Blistah</b> He actively held gigs as “Clench&amp;Blistah” as well. His charismatic stage performances are definitely worth checking out. He also collaborates with one of the most popular Japanese female pop singers, Kumi Koda. He freely works for both underground and J-pop music. 51-GOICHI- In the past, he recorded his solo debut released on WARNER MUSIC JAPAN. He spent his childhood and adolescents (4 to 16 years old) in South London. He subtly utilizes his bilingual skills rapping in both English and Japanese.</p>
<p><b>COYASS</b> His unique rap style and his original view on lyrics are absolutely peerless. In addition, he is also a dentist.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-03-17_0a6f.html" title="Edit section: Krugenkliegel Day (May 9th)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Krugenkliegel Day (May 9th)</span></h2>
<p>As the story goes - on May 9, 1469, after numerous years of unforgiving winters, Gerhardt Helmut Krugenkliegel set out into the forests of the Alps with his walking stick in his hand and a mission on his mind.</p>
<p>He began to wrap the trees of the forest with his staff, thus frightening the evil spirits away and ushering in a glorious and prosperous spring growing season. Gerhardt continued the ritual for almost seventy years, until his death at the age of ninety-two.</p>
<p>Krugenkliegel Day is a heritage-based holiday originating somewhere in Alpine Europe. Over the years, the holiday has almost completely ceased to exist primarily due to the renaissance, the church and the geographical ambiguity of the holiday’s origins.</p>
<p>In the mid-1400s Europe had many newly forming and overlapping areas of power. For instance, the area that Gerhardt Krugenkliegel hailed from was known of as the “Small States” but, portions of the Small States were now under the control of the Duke of Burgundy, the Duke of Milan or Austria. It is quite difficult to actually determine where and under which rule exactly Herr Krugenkliegel lived.</p>
<p>Another fundamentally important thing to recognize about Krugenkliegel Day is that it originated at the onset of the Renaissance Period. Many people were beginning to recognize the importance of education and learning. As an example of this changing of the times Matteo Palmieri wrote in the 1430s: 'Now indeed may every thoughtful spirit thank God that it has been permitted to him to be born in a new age.' The renaissance was now born, and it would be a brand new age where a focus on education would prove to be essential.</p>
<p>Many people in Gerhardt’s village believed that he was directly responsible for chasing away the bad spirits that corrupted their previous Spring harvest and planting season. Unfortunately, when word of his heroism spread to those outside of the village (and newly educated as a result of the renaissance), it was quickly learned that he, in fact, probably had nothing to do with the change in luck for the villagers. This is probably the leading reason why Krugenkliegel Day is largely unknown by so many today.</p>
<p>An interest in the man behind the holiday has prompted a slow and steady resurgence in interest. Today, Krugenkliegel Day is celebrated all over the world, with celebrations taking place predominantly in France, Germany, Austria, Italy, Belgium, Switzerland , Luxembourg, The United States, Brasil and Argentina.</p>
<p>In retrospect, Gerhardt Krugenkliegel truly believed that there were demons and evil spirits in the ground that could access the world through the trees; he also knew that his village’s livelihood depended heavily on a strong first harvest. Herr Krugenkliegel felt that it would be better to take the wrong action than to take no action at all – so he set out to change the course of the future.</p>
<p>The important thing to recognize is that was a man who faced the darkest fear he could imagine – completely alone – for the benefit of his whole village – with no guarantee that he would ever return. Krugenkliegel Day (May 9th) continues to gain momentum to this day as a celebration (and arguably a reminder) of the bravery that is within us all that we refuse to tap into due to its inconvenience. It is a reminder of our place in society and that sometimes we need to put the greater good ahead of our own personal comfort. It is mostly celebrated because it is an excuse to enjoy enormous quantities of good food and great beer!</p>
