<li><b>Delete</b>. The so-called reference cites only five cases, all collected by one author, with no evidence whatsoever to suggest that the symptoms described were caused by the withdrawal of the SSRI. The study he reports is bad science. I have personally prescribed SSRIs since their inception and have never seen the conditions he describes, with the single exception of persistent depression, which, of course, is just a pre-existing condition re-manifesting. Also, is not original research prohibited in wikipedia?--<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony.bradbury_30fb.html" title="User:Anthony.bradbury">Anthony.bradbury</a> 00:56, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete - but merge.</b> It is the term "PANES" that is dubious, rather than the condition itself. This phenomenon is relatively rare, but it most certainly exists, usually in previous long-term users of SSRIs - there are a great many examples of these long-term after effects of SSRIs cited in medical literature (PubMed will throw up many cases). There are, however, no sources for anything called "PANES", since the term is not in common usage, and the website linked to here is insufficient. It is also bad practice to name a "syndrome" which is not fully understood, and which may not be properly defined as a syndrome at all (two different patients may exhibit symptoms which do not overlap, and could conceivably result from two entirely separate adverse reactions to discontinuation). The whole subject is wreathed in controversy - what seems clear is that it is entirely wrong to write off this information as "made-up FUD", but it's also entirely wrong to apply a spurious term to a phenomenon which has not been fully investigated (a term which is, in any case, not recognised by any prominent scientists). In my opinion, this page should be deleted, BUT the information (or a rewrite of the information acknowledging the conflicting opinions on this subject) should be merged into <a href="../../../s/s/r/SSRI_discontinuation_syndrome_cbb3.html" title="SSRI discontinuation syndrome">SSRI discontinuation syndrome</a>.

<li>There is already a Persistant adverse effects topic in the <a href="../../../s/s/r/SSRI_discontinuation_syndrome_cbb3.html" title="SSRI discontinuation syndrome">SSRI discontinuation syndrome</a> article, listing some symptoms (akathisia, sexual problems...) there is no information on this page that should be kept since thoses most of these symptoms are not reported in the litterature. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnvai_50f9.html" title="User:Johnvai">Johnvai</a> 16:01, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>At the risk of being pedantic, there are actually well over 100 reports of SSRI-related movement disorders listed in PubMed alone. WP's own page on tardive dyskinesia lists chronic SSRI use as a possible cause. An overview can be found at <a href="http://www.socialaudit.org.uk/58092-DH.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.socialaudit.org.uk/58092-DH.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.socialaudit.org.uk/58092-DH.htm</a> under the section heading "Therapeutic / Normal Dose Dependence". Another page containing pertinent information is here: <a href="http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/mar3/adrac/adrac.html" class="external free" title="http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/mar3/adrac/adrac.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/mar3/adrac/adrac.html</a> ... I have never heard of neuropathic pain as a post-SSRI symptom, but all the other symptoms listed here have been reported from time to time and appear in online case histories. It is perhaps a good idea to add them to the section of <a href="../../../s/s/r/SSRI_discontinuation_syndrome_cbb3.html" title="SSRI discontinuation syndrome">SSRI discontinuation syndrome</a> mentioned above, albeit with a caveat stating that these symptoms are rare and there *may* not be a direct connection to discontinuation of SSRIs (although anyone with even a passing interest in psychiatry will appreciate that the concept of chronic use of psychotropic medicines producing adverse neurological effects is hardly outrageous). However, as I stated above, I agree that this page is essentially redundant and should be deleted. The information presented here does not qualify as OR (despite the lack of sources provided) but it is not presented in a suitable manner - chiefly because of the spurious use of the term "PANES".

<li>The spurious use of the term "PANES" as the title and subject of the article is itself more than enough reason to delete it once it's been proven that nobody in the medical community uses that term. My use of the phrase "made-up FUD" was in regards to the attempt by the article's creator to turn these symptoms into their own "disease", almost certainly for the purpose of scaring potential patients from considering the use of SSRIs whatsoever even if they could greatly benefit from them. I have no quarrel with anyone taking any legitimate parts from this article and putting them into <a href="../../../s/s/r/SSRI_discontinuation_syndrome_cbb3.html" title="SSRI discontinuation syndrome">SSRI discontinuation syndrome</a> along with any necessary disclaimers about conflicting opinions on the issue. There's no need to wait for this AfD to finish before doing that; I'd do it myself, but I'm not an MD or a pharmacologist. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 18:07, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
