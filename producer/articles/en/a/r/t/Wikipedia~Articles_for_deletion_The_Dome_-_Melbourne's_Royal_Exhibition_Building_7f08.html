<li>Striong disagree. You are obviously unfamilar with the work involved. tb is a hiostorical record. i suggest that you continue to act in a vanalistic manner and continue to remove posts that others whcih to make a contribuition.
<p>The information published is a very relvant bhistorical reciord on teh nomination of the Royal Exhibition Buildings and Melbourne heritage. I do not believe you read the content before you acted so recklessly. If you continue to act in such a manner I will lodge a complaint with the editor. now which version have you removed. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Melbcity (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMelbcity_6097.html" title="User talk:Melbcity">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Melbcity_8530.html" title="Special:Contributions/Melbcity">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The nominator of this post is not a vandal. Melbcity, Wikipedia isn't an indiscriminate collection of information. It has specific requirements as to what is suitable for inclusion, such as articles being encyclopedic in style, not copyrighted material, written from a neutral point of view, be fact and not opinion, and notability. The deletion of this article isn't a reflection on the content of it, just that it is completely unsuitable for Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuq_73ab.html" title="User:Chuq">Chuq</a> 09:13, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>You are wrong this is a historical record of a public forum related to the nomination of the Royal exhibition Bulidings. I most certainly have seen many other posts that I would claim to have been subjective and not worthy of inclusion. I have chosen these particular opsost for good reason.
<p>Those that are commenting and seeking to remove this information are not aware of nature of teh issue involved. The State premier wanted to demoplish the Royal Exhibitiuon Buidlinsg and it is only as a result of this public camaign that the nomination for world heritage progressed. It is a historicazl record relected to the hsitory of this significant Melbourne land mark.</p>
<p>I chose to publish it as a seperate article in much the same way as other articles are published and linked. You either want to support a community based contributuion or you don't. The material is not copyrighted. it is ion the public domain. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Melbcity (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMelbcity_6097.html" title="User talk:Melbcity">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Melbcity_8530.html" title="Special:Contributions/Melbcity">contribs</a>) 2006-10-22 09:21:36 (UTC)</small></p>

<li>Unfortunately, recent well-intentioned edits by <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolden_Wattle_e28c.html" title="User:Golden Wattle">Golden Wattle</a> (<a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGolden_Wattle_52fc.html" title="User talk:Golden Wattle">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Golden_Wattle_703d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Golden Wattle">contribs</a>) have actually obscured what this article is. It is clearer in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Dome_-_Melbourne%27s_Royal_Exhibition_Building&amp;oldid=82967071" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Dome_-_Melbourne%27s_Royal_Exhibition_Building&amp;oldid=82967071" rel="nofollow">this version of the article</a>. The article is a collection of primary source texts, namely a copyrighted newspaper article, some presentations, and some minutes of meetings, with a couple of extra, apparently personal commentary, paragraphs thrown in. From the comments above, where xe is talking about complaining to "the editor", and the comments on Talk:The Dome - Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building, where xe is talking about this being a missing chapter from a book by David Dunstan, it appears that Melbcity (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMelbcity_6097.html" title="User talk:Melbcity">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Melbcity_8530.html" title="Special:Contributions/Melbcity">contribs</a>) has mistaken Wikipedia for a self-publishing service or a magazine. Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">It is not a free hosting service, nor a document repository, nor a publisher of first instance</a>. The place for publishing additional chapters for books is elsewhere. The place for re-publishing copyrighted newspaper articles is elsewhere, too. I see no evidence whatsoever that, as Melbcity claims, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Age_3d42.html" title="The Age">The Age</a></i>, a publication that asserts copyright over its archives and that charges a fee for back issues of articles for as far back as 1990, has waived its copyright over its 1996 article written by Arnold Zable. Even if it had, Wikipedia wouldn't want it.
