<p>The result was <b>delete</b>, after discounting 'votes' from anonymous IPs (who could be from numerous people or one), and with regard to the good research done on the nature of the external links.</p>
<p>It would be nice if 'vote tampering' was simply reverted on sight (watchlist AfDs, please). Alerting me of it at the end does not help much, because there's no way I can find out everything that was changed and repair the damage at this late stage. Some random diff-clicking made me notice that Dlyons' withdrawal of his 'keep' argument was reverted by an IP <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Richard_Albrecht&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=70851551" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Richard_Albrecht&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=70851551" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, and this was never reverted.

<dd>To closing editor, it appears to me that Leibniz has some particular axe to grind on some of these deletions. The article states this man has published eighteen books (although not naming them all). That is sufficient notability. I think this deletion is in bad faith. I just don't have the time to investigate what's really going on here, but my gut tells me something peculiar. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 22:03, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> To Whom It May Concern, including The Closing Editors, about the truth, the only truth, and nothing but the very truth. The facts can be verified by everybody, he or she, wikipedian, ordinary people or whosoever: <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leibniz.html" title="Leibniz">Leibniz</a> <b>manipulated</b> in a way which verifies me first posting: “The Leibniz-spoors, Aug. 19, 2006, show a personal annihilation policy of Mr. Leibniz against these three entries: <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolfgang_Abendroth_5509.html" title="Wolfgang Abendroth">Wolfgang Abendroth</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Albrecht_f9ac.html" title="Richard Albrecht">Richard Albrecht</a>, and <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reinhard_Opitz_0315.html" title="Reinhard Opitz">Reinhard Opitz</a> - all of them German social scientist &amp; left-wing scholars. M. Falke, Aug. 20, 2006”.</li>
</ul>
<p>– I had a look on the “history” of the very method Leibniz systematically did apply in the “case” of Dr <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Albrecht_f9ac.html" title="Richard Albrecht">Richard Albrecht</a> the last three days since he nominated Dr A. for deletion (Aug. 19, 207, 18:32)[1]: for example Leibniz not only neglected the wikipedia principle according to “Living People” like Dr. A. (who, as far as I know, is still alive): “potentially libellous material <b>must be removed</b> immediately”, but also any rational rule of any “open debate” run publicly and expressed in another wikipedia-principle according to the deletion process. Moreover, whenever read thoroughly, the Leibnitz-“history” from Aug, 19, 2006, to Aug, 22, 2006, clearly and without any doubt demonstrates that this man is manipulating as his best: what Leibnitz stigmatized as <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essay_mill.html" title="Essay mill">essay mill</a> when characterizing scholarly texts of Dr A. on Aug. 20, 2006, 14:23, the next days got what sociologists name "<a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-fulfilling_prophecy.html" title="Self-fulfilling prophecy">self-fulfilling prophecy</a>” (<a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_K._Merton_a0cc.html" title="Robert K. Merton">Robert K. Merton</a>): prominent en.wikipedia-member Leibniz himself - and nobody else - defined what he had proclaimed as such (Aug. 22, 2006). Finally, for detecting Leibniz´ numerous manipulations needs some time, Leibniz declared, for reasons, Dr. A.s “nomination” for deletion as an <b>urgent case</b>, thinking that after Dr. A´s entry will be wiped out nobody will be interested in this individual “case”, and what he, <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leibniz.html" title="Leibniz">Leibniz</a>, really did will be hidden forever. - M. Falke, Aug. 23, 2006</p>

<li><b>Commentary - Keep Albrecht. Delete Leibniz</b></li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Somebody self-naming after the German philosopher <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leibniz.html" title="Leibniz">Leibniz</a> was at work 11:50, 21 August 2006. Under the label "ridiculous self-promotion and spam link to essay mill" this man deleted a passage in the <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_Engels_f952.html" title="Friedrich Engels">Friedrich Engels</a> entry on "The General &amp; His Shadow". The passage Leibniz deleted runs as follows:</p>
<p>"In remembrance of the historical democratic and socialist movements in Germany in 1848/1849, the <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germans.html" title="Germans">German</a> <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_psychologist.html" title="Social psychologist">social psychologist</a> <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Albrecht_f9ac.html" title="Richard Albrecht">Richard Albrecht</a> read a public lecture in Cologne (Rhineland), 150 years later in 1988, on the specific role Frederick Engels played as an anti-Prussian partisan and counterpart of the Prussian police agent Dr. Wilhelm Stieber (alias Schmidt). This scholarly piece first appeared in print in 2000 (<i>Almanach der Varnhagen-Gesellschaft</i>, ed. Dr. Nikolaus Gatter, vol. 1 (2000), 197-208, Berlin: Verlag Arno Spitz <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 3-8305-0025-4</a>; but it became available online free of charge in 2004. It gives insights into the personality of Frederick Engels (nicknamed "the general") before, during and after his emigration (first to Basel in Switzerland, then to Manchester): see Richard Albrecht, "Gegenspieler - Der General und sein Schatten: Engels, Stieber &amp; die preußische Reaktion 1851/52. Historischer Bericht zum ersten Kommunistenprozeß zu Köln" [Counterparts - The General and His Shadow: Engels, Stieber &amp; the Prussian Reactionary Forces, 1851/52. Another look at the first "Colonial Communist Trial"] [<a href="http://www.hausarbeiten.de/faecher/hausarbeit/jul/25110.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hausarbeiten.de/faecher/hausarbeit/jul/25110.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>]."</p>
<p>Who so ever will read this documentary essay written by an experienced German <a href="../../../a/u/t/Author.html" title="Author">author</a>, e.g. the online-version (I did, and gave the actual link), will, as a matter of fact, ascertain that this piece, originally a public lecture, in 1998, published in 2000 (printed, in an anthology which appeared at Arno Spitz, Berlin), and 2004 (as published online by GRIN Verlag für akademische Texte, Munich) is by no means any "<a href="../../../e/s/s/Essay_mill.html" title="Essay mill">essay mill</a>" in the definition Leibnitz coined out when, yesterday, posting five times (starting 13:39, and ending top 20:25): "a business, usually online, which dishonestly sells essays and other forms of homework assignments to students who are incapable or unwilling to do it themselves"), but is a legitime scholarly publication completely free of charge.</p>
<p>Friedrich Engels himself once stated: "The proof of the pudding is in the eating", and that´s why I do hope that relevant en.wikipedia.org-admins will, as soon as possible, stop future vandal acts of Mr. Leibniz as a chap who indeed, the last days, was running amok when executing his personal policy of annihilating Richard Albrecht and other still living German left-wing scholars and civil right figures. -M. Falke, Aug. 23, 2006</p>

<p>I Personally don't think that the the article needsw to be deleted, but it should be re-written as a more neutral article, since the current one seems to just be pro-Albrecht.-GDJC</p>
