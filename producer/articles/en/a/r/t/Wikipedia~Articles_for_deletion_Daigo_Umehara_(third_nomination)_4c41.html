<p>It's been 6 months, and the article is still unsourced. (See AfDs from <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Daigo_Umehara_3b1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Daigo Umehara">July 2006</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Daigo_Umehara_%282nd_nomination%29_4b19.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Daigo Umehara (2nd nomination)">August 2006</a>). Arguments raised in the past for keeping this include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>, <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS</a> --- no response necessary</li>
<li>"He's on jawiki" --- however, <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">inclusion is not an indicator of notability</a>, and the jawiki article doesn't cite any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> either. Also note the jawiki article had an <a href="../../../../ja/%E5%89%8A/%E9%99%A4/%E4%BE%9D/Wikipedia%7E%E5%89%8A%E9%99%A4%E4%BE%9D%E9%A0%BC_%E6%A2%85%E5%8E%9F%E5%A4%A7%E5%90%BE_1fb7.html" class="extiw" title="ja:Wikipedia:削除依頼/梅原大吾">AfD in Feb 2006</a>, but that was closed on the grounds of the article being a copyvio, and didn't get a full discussion. The article was later recreated, and no one's bothered to raise an AfD again since. (I'd do it myself, but I don't even have an account over there).</li>
<li>"He's notable in Japan, <a href="../../../c/s/b/WP%7ECSB_93c9.html" title="WP:CSB">let's counter systematic bias</a>" --- does not seem true, a search on 梅原 大吾 shows <a href="http://www.google.com.hk/search?hl=zh-TW&amp;q=%E6%A2%85%E5%8E%9F%E5%A4%A7%E5%90%BE&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.hk/search?hl=zh-TW&amp;q=%E6%A2%85%E5%8E%9F%E5%A4%A7%E5%90%BE&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">1k GHits</a>, but all blogs and forums. Don't see any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> there either. Nor any non-trivial coverage. The only external link on the article itself is to someone's personal site.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I'm still a proponent of not having a Daigo article. Having one but not having an article on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Shoryuken.com_9f5c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Shoryuken.com">Shoryuken.com</a> or Bang the Machine (a documentary about the fighting game scene in America featuring Daigo) sets a double standard as to the notability of fighting games. As it stands, the Wikipedia article is made up mainly of tournament results and quasi-legends. <a href="../../../j/u/j/User%7EJuJube_a9d8.html" title="User:JuJube">JuJube</a> 00:47, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, your logic is flawed. The <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governator.html" title="Governator">Governator</a> is notable, but several of his earlier works are probably not so. <a href="../../../m/c/k/User%7EMckaysalisbury_3eaf.html" title="User:Mckaysalisbury">McKay</a> 08:32, 13 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's not even apples and oranges. That's apples and rocket fuel. Would you care to try an actual rebuttal this time? <a href="../../../j/u/j/User%7EJuJube_a9d8.html" title="User:JuJube">JuJube</a> 00:50, 14 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I myself don't find the logic of SRK being not notable to equal to Daigo being not notable. Daigo is in no way affiliated with SRK. His only relation to SRK is that he is a regular player for their main tournament (EVO), but he had also played in many other tournaments such as <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tougeki.html" title="Tougeki">Tougeki</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's another example: there is a Wikipedia article for <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Hoang_ba9c.html" title="Ken Hoang">Ken Hoang</a>, one of the best <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Smash_Bros_31c5.html" title="Super Smash Bros">Super Smash Bros</a> players in the world. But is there an article about Smashboards? Daigo and Ken are notable because they are one of the best in what they do, which is professional gaming. Are SRK and Smashboards considered one of the most notable websites, and is Bang the Machine considered a notable documentary? Are Daigo/Ken only well-known by members of SRK/Smashboards? Therefore I would say that is an insufficent reason to say Daigo not well-known enough. Afterdeath 10:29, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

According to <a href="http://www.tanomi.com/insanity/sf.html" class="external text" title="http://www.tanomi.com/insanity/sf.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>, a booklet and DVD package about Street Fighter II competition features a 'special interview' with him.

<dl>
<dd>See, this is how it should work. Kusunose did a trivial amount of legwork and found that there are good sources about him. If I had any semblance of how to cite japanese sources. I'd be all over this. Until then, I'm going to put in these articles as references.
<dl>
<dd>The DVD is barely skirting the edge of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>; the production house, INH, consists of six people, and the only place it seems to be orderable from is their own website. Also I'm not too clear on the business relationship between INH and Capcom; if this is a product produced under licence or commission from Capcom, then it's not an independent source. Don't know what to say about Arcadia as I'm not closely familiar with Japanese video game magazines. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliforniaAliBaba_4aaa.html" title="User:CaliforniaAliBaba">cab</a> 13:43, 13 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Some further research shows that Arcadia Magazine's publisher Enterbrain are also the organiser of the Tougeki tournament in which Umehara participated (see bottom of <a href="http://www.tougeki.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tougeki.com/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> or enwiki's page on the subject at <a href="../../../t/o/u/Tougeki_-_Super_Battle_Opera_0cad.html" title="Tougeki - Super Battle Opera">Tougeki - Super Battle Opera</a>), so again, I don't think Arcadia qualifies as an independent source in this matter, but rather as a promoter with an obvious self-interest in hyping a participant in their company's tournament. Has Umehara been mentioned in more mainstream publications? <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliforniaAliBaba_4aaa.html" title="User:CaliforniaAliBaba">cab</a> 01:05, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>, but I want to keep it. He seems notable enough, but I don't see any sources proving it (sources that say "I know a source" don't count).

<li><b>Keep</b>. The sources cited by Kusunose, even if in Japanese, suggest some level of notability as a tournament arcade game player.

<dd>Can you explain exactly what systemic bias I am demonstrating here? Do you think my past contributions on Wikipedia demonstrate a systemic bias against Japan-related topics without English coverage (see my userpage, for example)? I read the articles and did some checking about the magazines in which they were published. My response was in my comment above: <i>I don't think Arcadia qualifies as an independent source in this matter, but rather as a promoter with an obvious self-interest in hyping a participant in their company's tournament.</i> If this guy is truly not<i>able</i>, he would have been not<i>ed</i> by publications without a direct financial interest in those tournaments. This is true whether you're talking about American gamers or Japanese gamers. Third time questioning: can you provide such sources? <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliforniaAliBaba_4aaa.html" title="User:CaliforniaAliBaba">cab</a> 05:35, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Agree with AfterDeath re: SRK.com notability. The main problem is the lack of sources.
