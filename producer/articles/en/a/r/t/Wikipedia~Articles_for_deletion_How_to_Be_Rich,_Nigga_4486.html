<li><b>Keep</b> or merge. Since when is that a metric, Quasi? We should throw out notable books because they sold poorly with the public recently? Will this be, to paraphrase Network, "the first known case of a book being removed from history for having low sales ratings?" Many notable books may not sell like hotcakes to the public in 2005. I spent about 2 minutes trying to think off the top of my head something that might be a good example (obviously dependent on what the top of my head looks like), and so far I've at least come up with "The Philosophical Writings of Descartes: Volume 1" and "Black Beauty" which are both in the 200ks, as well as Mrs. Lirriper by Charles Dickens which, by your metric, is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1843911310/qid=1125373351/sr=1-201/ref=sr_1_201/102-8283018-9401730?v=glance&amp;s=books" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1843911310/qid=1125373351/sr=1-201/ref=sr_1_201/102-8283018-9401730?v=glance&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">HALF</a> as important as the subject of this VfD since it weighs in at 1200k on the Amazon Cashometre. I understand the temptation to use arbitrary rankings, especially in these times of high information availability, rather than looking at the specific circumstances in each case, is very strong. But a lot of temptations are strong, so what? <a href="../../../d/g/_/User%7EDG_58ec.html" title="User:DG">D.</a> <a href="../../../d/g/_/User_talk%7EDG_200a.html" title="User talk:DG">G.</a> 03:45, 30 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's a metric in this sense because it can be used to measure something. I found an edition of Black Beauty at about 25K; the fact that they have multiple editions should ring bells, as well as the fact they're still in print after a century. Instead of pointing at Black Beauty and asking why it has a page, why not point out why this is notable? --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 08:23, 30 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And, we don't have a page on Mrs. Lirriper, so if it were valid to judge a book by sales on one edition a century after it was first published, that still wouldn't help your case.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 05:46, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Please note, that when I voted on this article, it said: "It has achieved unexpected success, eventually being accepted for sale on amazon.com and at Barnes &amp; Noble's bookstores in the United States." So, I was voting based on its own claim of being note-worthy and found it lacking.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The book's no Harry Potter, but it's also not something that's sold 10 copies out of some guy's basement (which would be more in line with my definition of not notable).

<li>I'm biased with regard to POD/self-publishing, but I don't think a book being self-published should be used as a reason to delete it. It's sales, readers and the author and subject matter that are important. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 09:06, August 30, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, or <b>merge</b> to author if possible. Do we want pages on the top 20,000 books on Amazon? Expanded through history, there's millions of books we could have pages on that are more notable than this one. Usually, we put book information on the author page, unless the book itself is very notable, or the author and book are notable enough to have seperate pages, so put it on the author's page. (Especially since the press releases kept talking about the series of books.)--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 08:23, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - if the author doesn't even warrant a page, why should his really low-selling, self-published book? Selling fifty copies of a book would get it in the top 500,000 on Amazon - a rank of 608,099 means about thirty copies sold.

<li><b>Keep</b> -- needs expansion and verification, but the article is not just about the book but about its success.

<ul>
<li>The problem there is that its supposed success is entirely self-proclaimed and thus unverifiable. Certainly, no real success is reflected in its Amazon rank if it sold just 30 copies (as estimated above). Most people, if they "published" a book, could sell more than 30 copies just among their immediate friends and family. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 23:00, August 30, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Amazon sales ranks uses the <i><b>total sales ever</b></i> of a book when calculating its rank if below 100,000; not just the sales in the last year (10,000 - 100,000), month (1,000 - 10,000) or week (1 - 1,000).
