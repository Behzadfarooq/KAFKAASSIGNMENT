<li><b>Keep</b> - Well, from the sources used in the article so far it appears that a reasonable article was possible to construct. Also, one would imagine that being in the NFS series would confer considerable notability on the game in question. Perhaps when the game's title is officially announced, move it to the title.

<li>The article is well sourced and provides plenty of useful information. It is about a future game, it's not supposed to be 100% facts.

I recommended deletion for [[<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Legend_of_Zelda_%28Wii%29_85b4.html" title="The Legend of Zelda (Wii)">The Legend of Zelda (Wii)</a> because of its lack of proper sourcing.

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep assuming references check out</b> WP:Crystal Ball does not require that the game be "officially announced". It only requires that the information about a future game come from reliable, referenced sources. So if the sources in the article are reliable publishers talking about things that are very likely to occur, then that is perfectly acceptable. Keep the article, and remove any unreferenced information. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 20:47, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

</li>
<li>P.S. You can even have articles about games that have <i>never</i> been released, and might not ever be released, provided there is enough published information about the "vaporware". <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke_Nukem_Forever_0d65.html" title="Duke Nukem Forever">Duke Nukem Forever</a> is a good example of an article about a game that, even if it is never actually released, has enough references and notability to remain on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 20:56, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, well it's clear that you feel so, but I don't think that there has been one single good argument for keeping this article. The game is unnannounced, and none of the sources used in the article qualify as <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>.

<dd>That is your opinion, obviously. I see plenty of good arguments to keep it. One of those is, as I wrote above, the sources are no more unreliable then many other sources related to CVG articles. It may not be offically announced, but EA is already talking about it unoffically. This game will come in quarter 4, as every other game in the <a href="../../../n/e/e/Need_for_Speed_%28series%29_6d31.html" title="Need for Speed (series)"><i>Need for Speed</i> series</a> have done each year since <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motor_City_Online_17aa.html" title="Motor City Online">Motor City Online</a>. --<a href="../../../m/r/s/User%7EMrStalker_a10a.html" title="User:MrStalker">MrStalker</a> 11:52, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> per RockMFR, Hbdragon88. As there's no deadline, we don't need to have an article until there are things to say which are <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATTributable</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> The article is just about all speculation (the rumored cars, rumored release date, the fact that the game hasn't even been announced by EA). <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 06:36, 3 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That depends on how you define "speculations" and "romours". Everything in the article is properly sourced. An interview with an EA employee is not what I call speculations. And, there's nothing that says Wikipedia cannot have some speculations as long as they are properly sourced, especially for an article about a future game. --<a href="../../../m/r/s/User%7EMrStalker_a10a.html" title="User:MrStalker">MrStalker</a> 09:20, 3 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>All that interview did was say that the "Pro Street" subtitle was bullshit. There are ZERO facts in this article, and no confirmation the game even exists. WP policy says this article should be deleted until some details are known, it's the same reason articles on the PS4, and other future movies/games get deleted. These articles are not supposed to be up until some details are known (not "the game could have this", "some of the rumored cars are", "information may be announced at E3" type of stuff). <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 09:34, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
