<li><b>KEEP</b> This company is a pivotal creative collective that has influenced artists all over the world. Their monograph is held in the highest esteem by and is in the literary collections of such prestigious institutions as the Tate Gallery in London as well as the Museum of Modern Art in NYC. In fact, it was selected as staff pick by MOMA. It is also in the library of the Atlanta College of Art. not once in the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> does it ever state that "&lt; 1K results" on google is a criteria.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>You can see very clearly that it specifically states:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"A company or corporation is notable if it meets ANY ONE of the following criteria:
<dl>
<dd>The company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>the emphasis is on "ANY ONE", which GH avisualagency more than fulfills. as a matter of fact, if you look up "GH avisualagency" on google you will see <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22GH+avisualagency%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22GH+avisualagency%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">831 results</a> and if you look up "GHavisualagency" (their common alternate spelling) on google you will see <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22GHavisualagency%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22GHavisualagency%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">498 results</a>. if you look up "Graphic Havoc" (the actual name that GH stands for and another commonly known name for the company) you will find <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Graphic+Havoc%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Graphic+Havoc%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">771 results</a>. another name that they are commonly listed as"GHava" gets <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22GHava%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22GHava%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">828 results</a>. 831 + 498 + 771 + 828 = 2928, which negates the above grounds for deletion in the 1st place. google those 4 ways to look up GH avisualagency and you will see very clearly that they more than amply meet the criteria as delineated by Wikipedia.

<dd>GH avisualagency included as one of 23 groundbreaking New York studios in the new book, “Infiltrate | The Front Lines of the New York Design Scene” by Alexander Gelman</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>“some of the most original design thinkers and practitioners New York has to offer today”
<dl>
<dd>- Alexander Gelman</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>“It's hard to say whether Gelman has discovered a new direction for American design, or whether he's merely unearthed a mutant, semi-underground strain. But there's an introspection here that's rarely found in American design which even in its more avant garde guises maintains a muscular directness and immediacy.”

<li>The quotation from "Creative Review" is about Gelman's book as a whole, not about GH specifically. The book's website has an "About Infiltrate" section, which says: "Well known, lesser known and completely yet unknown studios are featured in the book". So inclusion in the book <i>as such</i> isn't much evidence of notability. (I don't have the book; maybe what it says about GH is evidence of notability.) <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGareth_McCaughan_2f50.html" title="User:Gareth McCaughan">Gareth McCaughan</a> 08:03, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> - I can't believe that there is even such a debate on this issue! Yes, from my understanding, GH do commercial work but are primarily an artist collective that remain so through such work. The huge explosion of street art and the ensuing school of design that stems from it is hardly deletable. If you do not allow GH in, who are a very well-loved (internationally) outfit, then you will need to remove all of the others who live and practise the same balance of art and commercial art. That means no Shepard Fairey, no Futura, nobody that has walked the necessary line of artistry and design work. Are you to deny people interested in this generations leaders in street art/design culture voice and a place in Wikipedia?

<li>Generally, these appeals result in scores of never-used-Wikipedia-before users blindly voting keep based solely on their experience with the subject. I do not claim that you do not have some loyal members, but their lack of knowledge in the policies of Wikipedia regarding inclusion and exclusion of topics is not constructive to the AfD process, even if the subject turns out to be notable. — <span style="font-variant:small-caps;font-family:sans-serif;"><a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbush_Commander_08e2.html" title="User:Ambush Commander">Ambush Commander</a></span><sup style="font-family:serif;">(<a href="../../../a/m/b/User_talk%7EAmbush_Commander_60e0.html" title="User talk:Ambush Commander">Talk</a>)</sup> 22:59, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Nothing wrong with that. It simply is NOT what Wikipedia is about. It is not a popularity contest and it's not about winning votes.

<li>it is interesting to note that newstoday.com's public posting about this AfD has brought both DELETE as well as KEEP votes from new users, rendering the topic of fairness of public posting questionable. it is also interesting that if you go to the newtoday.com site, one can see that there is a lively debate both for and against the article. also want to mention that newstoday is a totally separate entity from GH and not affiliated in any way. they posted this independently and of their own volition. <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInspectorpanther_cc78.html" title="User:Inspectorpanther">Inspectorpanther</a> 05:21, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - not notable. One of many thousands of advertising agencies. Calling yourself an artists' collective does not actually make you one. This is just a regular old commercial venture.

I also note that not a single top-tier university library or museum has started collecting this group's work.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I think this is clearly a vanity page. Did GHava author this? This article lists services offered, if you refer to an article on Jan Tschichold for instance, this article does not list the services he offered, the only reason I can see for listing this information is commercial gain, and not in keeping with the spirit of Wikipedia. Ditto that for Peter Saville's listing, Alan Fletcher's listing, and many others.</dd>

<dd>Also, Pentagram is not on here, one of the most important design studios of the modern era. They have been FAR more widely publicised, awarded, praised and have done FAR more to further the cause of modern design, have broken much more new territory and dragged graphic design in much more interesting directions. Particularly the collaboration between new media, graphic design and architecture that they foster.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is, in my opinion, laughable that GHava hold themself to the same strata of importance as REAL pioneers and trailblazers such as Paul Rand, Saul Bass, El Lissitzky, Jan Tshicold, Josef Muller-Brockman, Neville Broday etc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In regards to their claim as a serious 'art collective' - they call themself an agency - that in itself an obviously commercial position to take. The work they list and show is mainly for premier brands, Coke, Adidas, Volkswagen and MTV - perhaps they came to design from a art background, but they are obviously and wholly working within the commercial design service realm, but maintain an 'artistic' practise on the side.

<li><b>KEEP</b> Mrethan 21:29, 16 December 2005 (UTC) I notice that many entries on this page keep being deleted. This is supposed to be a forum of open debate. Erasing others' statements is intellectually dishonest. One can only wonder if the vandals are employees of competing agencies. In any case, this is what I originally wrote: This company clearly meets wiki's requirements for inclusion, in spite of the fact that those requirements are slanted in favor of public corporations. GH--which is almost as much a collective of artists as it is a company, and deserves inclusion on that basis alone--is admittedly in no danger of being used to index stock prices any time soon. But these five individuals have made an impact far disproportionate to their numerical strength through their seminal work with many listed companies, such as volkswagon and MTV (aka Viacom). And unlike many design agencies, these guys have had fine art shows as well. Wikipedia is enhanced by their inclusion. It should be, among other things, a storehouse of current knowledge about design, not simply a memorial to past movements.</li>

<li><b>DO NOT Delete</b>. This company clearly meets wiki's requirements for inclusion, in spite of the fact that those requirements are slanted in favor of public corporations. GH--which is almost as much a collective of artists as it is a company, and deserves inclusion on that basis alone--is admittedly in no danger of being used to index stock prices any time soon. But these five individuals have made an impact far disproportionate to their numerical strength through their seminal work with many listed companies, such as volkswagon and MTV (aka Viacom). And unlike many design agencies, these guys have had fine art shows as well. Wikipedia is enhanced by their inclusion. As for the detractors? I'm not seeing much thought put into their calls for deletion, beyond sycophantic adhesion to the arbitrary "1K" plus google hits metric, which GH meets in any case. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 208.27.111.121 (<a href="../../../2/0/8/User_talk%7E208.27.111.121.html" title="User talk:208.27.111.121">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_208.27.111.121_7c86.html" title="Special:Contributions/208.27.111.121">contribs</a>) 23:10, 14 December 2005.</small></li>

<li>What he says about red links versus blue is correct. There are several notable cases where contributors purposely have left their user pages blank in order to help discourage the notion that users without user pages are less credible (it has been, however, of minimal effect). Inspectorpanther seems to have a solid grasp about Wikipedia's policies, even if he only has several edits. However, concerning meat puppets, it is general practice to make comments on the number of contributions users have when participating in AfD discussions.

<li><b>Do not delete</b> the Graphic Havoc article from this website. They are a valid collective that provide individuals, companies, and art groups with support, work, ideas, and inspiration. They are a professional and creative group that are equally valid in the coorperate world as well as artistic communities. This kind of dual existance is rare and neccessary. I am not sure who has the time for negative comments towards people that handle themselves in a both professional and sensitive manner. It is my beleif that individuals that have the time to "diss" hard working people are nothing more than haters or someone with a bone to pick and their comments should be taken with a block of salt. Obviously someone that has free time to output negative are simply not using their time wisely. Time wasted on spreading negativity are neither proactive and most likely not productive. Negative chatter, in my mind, equals too much free time.</li>

<li>I agree. The purpose of AfD is not to delete articles without debate, but to examine the merits of articles. In this particular case, however, it seems to me that the meatpuppet comments above assert notability without proving (or providing significant evidence of) notability. Working with listed companies is not evidence of notability. The existence of entries for comparable companies is not per se evidence of notability (per HorsePunchKid above). And none of this addresses the advert/vanity issue, as the article was created and almost entirely written by one of the principals in the firm. The sock- and meat-puppetry (and two instances of vandalism) are secondary to the discussion; their importance is in the tally, which is why I've tagged them. | Klaw <small>¡digame!</small> 21:18, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>KEEP: If not for being blessed with talent &amp; creativity, then simply for being young, motivated and courageous. The people behind GH avisualagency have embraced the world with their ideas full force. Those of you who say they are not innovative are just plain silly (for lack of a better word). Is there any art or music that is not influenced by something that came before it? I have not seen everything that GH avisualagency has produced but what I have seen is extremely philosophical and having this article listed on this website is very necessary because it is one more resource that can help the lucky people who stumble upon it to grow and see other artists perspectives about this huge world we all live in together.

We know the article could be encyclopedic, and the main case being made against it is notability.

<li>KEEP: Whether GH is categorized as a small corporation, commercial agency or artist collective is besides the point. It is just a title. What’s more important for this discussion is to focus on the work GH has created. As a whole, their work and skills range from commercial to fine arts and many times meet somewhere in the middle, a combination that is lacking in most commercial work today. Graphic Havoc is both a notable and creatively influential design organization. As a first time Wikipedia user, I have read through this entire discussion and am fairly surprised at the adolescent tone of the debate. I’d like to stay focused and say that I see no real reason for the deletion of Graphic Havoc. The vanity issue seems to be the most reoccurring point, however, I read through the guidelines and found this line, “it is preferable for the initial author not to be an owner or employee of or an investor in the company”. Note the word preferable. Grounds for deletion would surely need more backing than this.Katiedecker 00:20, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

Just because some of you aren't interessted in design or art, doesn't mean this entry is not useful for anybody. Actually makes me quiet angry that something like this gets considered for deletion.

<li>that is the equivalent of saying that bands should not be on here but only the individual musicians that make up the band. art collectives function in the same way as bands where a group of creative individuals pool their talents together to make art. just because the wikipedia categories are limited, does it not bring attention to the fact that one might need to be created to allow for articles about art collectives? also, nowhere on <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> did i read that it had to be about an individual person. it does however say that it can be about artists. why can it not be about a group of artists? <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInspectorpanther_cc78.html" title="User:Inspectorpanther">Inspectorpanther</a> 06:15, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete: The entry is a resume. No one is "threatened", it just is not that important yet. Perhaps at a later point in time the contribution to culture will be more significant. A note to the supporters: whining about "anti-creativity nazis", "haters" and "business minded folks" does nothing to show the value of your organization. The list submitted by lerner shows remarkable egotism as well as a disregard for the community he so desperately craves to belong to. To compare one's fledgeling design agency to certain of those movements, some of which are from the sixties and seventies, is preposterous.

<li><b>KEEP</b> Ghava™ is an art collective, not only one of most inspiring design studios in New York and in the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>Their work, artistic and commercial, is very important because of their original experimental multi-disciplinary approach. It's possible to find precursors of the figure of the artist/designer in the history of art and design (pre-raffaelites, the Bauhaus school, Kandinskij, Munari, Warhol, only to name a few) and it would be stupid to consider ghava™ only as a mainstream advertising company. They operate in the border zone between art and design, between experimentation and design work, between research and commercial needs. Keep ghava™ in wikipedia.

<li>Wikimeister, please familiarize yourself with Wikipedia's <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html#Sockpuppets_are_bad" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">deletion process</a>. Being a new user does not help your credibility on one sentence votes. You are welcome to argue and present facts in favor of the article's inclusion, but simply saying "I see no grounds for deletion here" does not contribute anything useful to the discussion besides another voice saying "I agree." For long-time contributors, their approval/disapproval means a lot, but without that credibility, people will be prone to discount your opinions if they are not backed up with facts.</li>

<dd>If you did sign up in order to vote specifically for this issue, I hope you are understanding and continue to edit Wikipedia. Meatpuppets can become valued Wikipedia contributors, and the sooner we clear up misunderstanding, the better off we will be. — <span style="font-variant:small-caps;font-family:sans-serif;"><a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbush_Commander_08e2.html" title="User:Ambush Commander">Ambush Commander</a></span><sup style="font-family:serif;">(<a href="../../../a/m/b/User_talk%7EAmbush_Commander_60e0.html" title="User talk:Ambush Commander">Talk</a>)</sup> 20:17, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
