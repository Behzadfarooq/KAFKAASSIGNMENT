<li><b>Comment</b> I haven't finished researching this school yet (getting close to bedtime) but one student did place first in a low level state gymnastic competition- I have added a note about that to the article. The only other mentions of the school that aren't directory entries or something similar seem to be <a href="http://knoxville.yourhub.com/POWELL/Stories/Spirit/Military/Story~89356.aspx" class="external autonumber" title="http://knoxville.yourhub.com/POWELL/Stories/Spirit/Military/Story~89356.aspx" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> which might have some relevant data, it notes a "military theme" for last graduation and has a few other minor details which might be able to be incorporated into the article. This <a href="http://knoxville.yourhub.com/POWELL/Stories/Education/School-News/Story~128390.aspx" class="external autonumber" title="http://knoxville.yourhub.com/POWELL/Stories/Education/School-News/Story~128390.aspx" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> discusses their accelerated reading program and may also have a few details if anyone really wants to sort it out. The only other interesting one is <a href="http://www.whitestonechurch.org/studentmin.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.whitestonechurch.org/studentmin.asp" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> where the mention is incidental (and unreliable in any event- they can't even spell - "Bible studies") but sounds like it might be a first amendment case waiting to happen (except given the location this sort of thing might be taken for granted and without more details it is hard to see precisely what they are doing. The description is consistent with completely legal behavior- I may just be a cynical evil liberal). Presumably if they get an interesting case about that then the school would become notable but that obviously hasn't happened yet. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 06:34, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s>*<b>Weak but almost normal delete</b></s> Ok, mainly per some of the above comments and my own comments earlier. Despite researching I could find nothing notable about the school. The only reason why this is weak delete is that I don't know enough about gymnastics to tell whether the mentioned gymnastic result could be arguably notable or not. From my limited knowledge my impression is no, but I'm not completely sure- the most reasonable test for that - presence of non-trivial coverage, indicates a lack of notability in the gymnastic success. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 06:41, 10 November 2006 (UTC) Changing to full <b>delete</b> per evidence/comments from Fram below. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 16:59, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Oh, and just for completeness, the school is also mentioned in participating in some minor program here <a href="http://web.utk.edu/~tpte/elementary_ed/licensure.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.utk.edu/~tpte/elementary_ed/licensure.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.

<li><b>Keep/merge</b>. The entire school was demolished and rebuilt, and but wikipedia readers in the area aren't supposed to be able to find this out? If merged, might want to omit some of the details, as well as JoshuaZ' signature. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 07:41, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>ooh, Don;t know how that fell in there. took it out. Thanks. Will respond to the other comments tommorow probably. Have a goodnight. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 07:46, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Expanding on my earlier comment, could you explain how being demolished and rebuilt is an indication of notability? One of the local drug stores he got demolished and rebuilt too. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 16:59, 10 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Repeating my question, can you tell me why wikipedia readers shouldn't be able to find out that an entire school in their area was demolished, rebuilt and renamed? <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 04:48, 11 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sure, as The Way observed below, having schools demolished and rebuilt is common and not at all a notable event. If they want to find out about it they can find from local resources. Wikipedia is not the history of every little thing that random city government decided to do. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 04:54, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. The gymnast mentioned was competing at a really low (well, the lowest) level, as evidenced by e.g. this<a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Myths-About-USA-Gymnastics-Level-4-Gymnasts&amp;id=121402" class="external autonumber" title="http://ezinearticles.com/?Myths-About-USA-Gymnastics-Level-4-Gymnasts&amp;id=121402" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> article about Level 4 gymnastics. Thta also explains why it only gets one local passing mention in an article and no more coverage. No other discerning qualities, so no reason to keep this one. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 10:03, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> It's bad enough that we tend to keep every single high school, please don't make a precedent of keeping every single elementary school as well. This is non-notable and so what if it was demolished and rebuilt? Two different elementary schools in my hometown, both of which are just as non-notable, have had the same thing happen to them and I'd assume it's not very uncommon across the US, let alone across the world (especially in developing countries). I must point out, as I have a tendency to do, what kind of precedent keeping this would set. First of all we'd have to take every elementary school, not only in the US but worldwide, that fits is as notable as this school, meaning most elementary schools would be able to get articles. This is not something Wikipedia needs, it amounts (as does keeping high schools, but that's an entirely different topic of discussion) essentially to a detailed directory and Wikipedia is NOT supposed to function as a directory.
