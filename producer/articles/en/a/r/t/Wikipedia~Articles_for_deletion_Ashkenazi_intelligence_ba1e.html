<li><b>Delete</b> There are other places some of the info here could go to, but most of it is about the calibre of flat-worlder logic. If this does not get deleted, I'd probably consider creating a "Ashkenazi Incestousness" wiki, and we will see if the same people use the same arguments for keeping it. We will use all sorts of fun stuff, like propensity for genetic defects, inbreeding customs, and niffty anecdotal things like Einstein marrying his cousin. Then we can all watch what a crock wikipedia is.

<dd>Whether it has diffs supporting it really isn't the point though. Things can be 100% true and that still doesn't necessitate a stand-alone lenghty article. Would you support the creation of a Sub-Saharan African Intelligence page with the many IQ studies proving that Sub-Saharan Africans have IQs in the low 70s just because it is well-documented and there are many examples supporting this claim (violence, backwardness)? Or would that be considered racist to highlight it with its very own article and give it such strong credence? <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsedup_4065.html" title="User:Usedup">Usedup</a> 08:47, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. However the page is very POV, and needs to be improved. I am the one that started this page. I actually started it in order to move this material off the Ashkenazi Jews page, and to drive away all the crackpots that beat the drum for this material. In other words, I actually started this page not because I believe in this dreck, but because I didn't like the way the Cochranites had taken over the Ashekenazi Jews page with their somewhat fringy ideas. The Ashkenazi Jews article is already too long. This is material that has been in the news a lot. I would call the Cochrane stuff just slightly better than fringe theory. It has actually been published in a so-called peer-reviewed academic journal, although that doesn't mean much, and the journal is only borderline in respectability. It is a coherent idea, but it just happens to be wrong. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetzenberg_43b3.html" title="User:Metzenberg">Metzenberg</a> 05:43, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't like to see the baby thrown out with the bath water. I would rather see a much better article written that would be balanced and inclusive. Barring that, I would like to see the Cochran material moved onto the page about <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_Cochran_683c.html" title="Gregory Cochran">Gregory Cochran</a> himself, not back onto the <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashkenazi_Jews_79ef.html" title="Ashkenazi Jews">Ashkenazi Jews</a> page. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetzenberg_43b3.html" title="User:Metzenberg">Metzenberg</a> 11:24, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Metzenberg. Whether or not these ideas are correct they are notable ideas that has been discussed in many reliable sources and the main article on Ashkenazi Jews is way too long. Agree that this needs to be NPOVed though. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 05:49, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Remember, this afd isn't on completely deleting the material - it is on deleting the article. What reason is there behind having a separate unprecedented article when this information can nicely trimmed and merged into <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashkenazi_Jews_79ef.html" title="Ashkenazi Jews">Ashkenazi Jews</a>? <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsedup_4065.html" title="User:Usedup">Usedup</a> 15:49, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I think Metzenberg's motivation (see above) was reasonable in creating the article. But in my opinion, "Ashkenazi intelligence" is an inappropriate (and POV if not racism-begging) premise for an article, and perhaps as a result, the article is beyond repair. I think that the facts of this article should be applied in a different context (for instance, in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregory_Cochran_683c.html" title="Gregory Cochran">Gregory Cochran</a> entry and others). But the fact that Ashkenazim have a high average IQ score and do disproportionately well in academia -- while interesting -- is not worthy of its own encyclopedia entry. <a href="../../../o/r/g/User%7EOrgan123_6dff.html" title="User:Organ123">Organ123</a> 06:37, 15 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Organ123 - There actually is much better material written on this subject than what is written here. It's too bad that somebody like the neuropsychologist Miles David Storfer can't take a crack at this material. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetzenberg_43b3.html" title="User:Metzenberg">Metzenberg</a> 10:54, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> This is appropriate as perhaps a minor side note on a Ashkenazic Jewish page, but by itself it is basically an article for a study and since there is no precedent for this type of thing, I'm gonna say delete. There are many studies in all reaches of race and intelligence but they don't have their separate article. Equivalently an article called The European and American domination of Arts and Sciences probably wouldn't pass very well although it could be VERY VERY WELL sourced and just as User:Izak up there gave us great examples of famous Jewish personalities who exhibited high intelligence we could fill up that article with many similar examples. If there was a famous study conducted proving that the Jewish people have a genetic tendency to be <a href="../../../f/r/u/Frugal.html" title="Frugal">frugal</a> and it was equally well-sourced, I have a feeling there wouldn't be as many keeps; it would just be called "anti-semitic." <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsedup_4065.html" title="User:Usedup">Usedup</a> 08:39, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Just seaching for <i>ashkenzai iq</i> on google gets you 53,000 hits. While this article needs to be expanded and cleaned up, it is certainly notable, verifiable, and not junk-pov. A title change would be fine, but that should be discussed on the article's talk page. -- <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshdboz_c913.html" title="User:Joshdboz">Joshdboz</a> 11:37, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The main argument in favor of deletion seems to be a presumption that the topic in question has an overwhelmingly obvious correct answer and additionally that discussing the topic is politically unpalatable, hence, the article and discussion should be quashed as the article has no substantial merits and significant de-merits. What's wrong with this argument? (1) This is a common point of view, that Ashkenazi Jews on average are more intelligent than other groups, and it is legitimate to discuss this body of thought and opinion regardless of whether one agrees with it, (2) In fact, those who argue for deletion would do better to expand the body of knowledge available on this page regarding the topic in question by posting information regarding how this commonly held body of opinion regarding Ashkenazi Jews is flawed, rather than attempting to quash discussion about it. (3) My personal opinion - it is glaringly obvious that Ashkenazi Jews are on average more intelligent in certain ways than other groups. Those with a political axe to grind are actually those who don't like the conclusion and want to enforce mandatory adherence to the dogma that intelligence is not heritable. Sharpening and using such political axes is not the point of Wikipedia. There is a body of research, thought, and opinion regarding the question of Jewish intelligence; the fact that the evidence overwhelmingly points to conclusions that some find politically offensive does not mean that information regarding this widespread body of thought and opinion should be blocked from Wikipedia. -Me 02:16 am 16 February 2007 (UTC). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_58.10.64.46_7d52.html" title="Special:Contributions/58.10.64.46">58.10.64.46</a> (talk) 02:17, 16 February 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

I'm sure that the concept raises political correctness issues with many, but the theory that improved intelligence conferred advantages to Ashkenazi Jews is no different from the claim that <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sickle_cell_anemia.html" title="Sickle cell anemia">sickle cell anemia</a> confers advantages in Africa by providing resistance to malaria or that Northern Europeans are more likely to be lactose tolerant assisted in their survival.

<li>So African American genetic predisposition to crime would be a fine article to keep if it existed because there's boatloads of research proving it? I'm finding it hard to believe if this article had a negative connotation you would still wish to keep it with the same reasonings. Why is it so necessary to make an entirely separate article about this? Most of the article is about a study that isn't even that famous. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsedup_4065.html" title="User:Usedup">Usedup</a> 09:11, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I can only address the article that has been proposed here for deletion. This article discusses a theory that increased intelligence conferred adaptive advantages to Ashkenazi Jews, so that this trait was enhanced and selected for through evolutionary and cultural changes. The claim that the "article is about a study that isn't even that famous" is utterly irrelevant to notability. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 18:16, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's not true. The fact that there are many other studies on intelligence more famous than this one that DON'T have separate articles highlighting them makes it seem as if wikipedia gives more worth to this one over others. On the other hand, if this was just a segment of the <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashkenazic_Jew_438c.html" title="Ashkenazic Jew">Ashkenazic Jew</a> article, it wouldn't seem as if the encyclopedia is trying to hold it above all others. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsedup_4065.html" title="User:Usedup">Usedup</a> 15:47, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Well if as you say there are more famous cases, that's not the fault of this article, and I believe not relevant to this AfD. If I understand you correctly you are not arguing against this article in most of your commentaries, but the fact there are not similar articles for different ethnicities. Well the simple suggestion would be to create them, as you say there are more famous cases than this one, so with 53,000 Ghit this one has already demonstrated basic notability let alone it's verifibility etc. So if they are more famous it will not be difficult for you to start these articles, or I you don't have the time, you may go to <a href="../../../a/f/c/WP%7EAFC_0d2b.html" title="WP:AFC">WP:AFC</a> with the basic premise and I'm sure they wil be started for you. To quote you <i>...makes it seem as if wikipedia gives more worth...</i> it <b>might</b> make is semm but it could be just an editor who loves all things Jewish has created this article, but no-one has bothered to do the others. But the lack of other articles is not a problem of this article, and I will say again is a strawman argument. Oh and just for the record I think the theory is bunkum, but although the subject matter is controversial I'm voting on the article, it's notability, verifibility, and not whether I believe it or not. <sup><a href="../../../k/h/u/User%7EKhukri_e3b4.html" title="User:Khukri"><b><font face="verdana" color="#6633CC">Khu</font></b></a><a href="../../../k/h/u/User_talk%7EKhukri_0ba4.html" title="User talk:Khukri"><b><font face="verdana" color="#CC66FF">kri</font></b></a></sup> 08:37, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think the word "intelligence" is throwing you off. It is merely a measure, not a value judgement. So if the sources were available, an article entitled African Americans and crime would be appropriate because it recognizes that there is a notable issue, but does not make a judgement on it. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshdboz_c913.html" title="User:Joshdboz">Joshdboz</a> 11:24, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What difference does it make if the article title makes a judgement or the article itself does? This article is making a judgement immediately at the header. The judgement is backed up by a thorough study but so are many other judgements and we don't have separate articles for each one of them. Why is it so necessary to report this one so directly? Nobody seems to find the dozens of studies on the average IQ of <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese.html" title="Japanese">Japanese</a> being significantly higher on visuospatial tests so important as to make an article about it. The importance of that study is well rooted and has many of the same explanations as this (cultural and historical changes). I think the fact that so many people actually vote keep on this article shows the inherent bias of wikipedia. Most wikipedia editors are white males, and I'm sure almost everyone on this AFD is one too. (Please don't chime in and say you're not...there's a reason I put "almost.") So naturally, we're going to feel more strongly about keeping an article on Ashkenazic Intelligence than one on Japanese Intelligence or Aborigine Intelligence. But this is problematic, because the fact that we HAVE an article on Ashkenazic Intelligence and not on the main other well-studied researches equivalent to it shows that we are lending more worth to that study than others. I'm not against reporting these studies, I'm against highlighting them as is being done now. Why not just add this to the Ashkenazic Jewish article in a couple of sentences? It can be done and has before. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsedup_4065.html" title="User:Usedup">Usedup</a> 15:47, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. I soon give up the whole Wikipedia. Should this not be a lexika??? It seems like this is a advertising-"lexika" for some special ethnic groups on this earth. Wikipedia seems NOT like a serious lexika. Should it be written an aricle about "German intelligence"?? Some will say an article like this sounds stupid, but it is in the same street as "Ashkenazi intelligence". The biggest survey on Ashkenazi intelligence is done among 1300 diasporic jews (All other inquiries was a done on a very small number of diasporic jews), the average IQ here was was 107. Germans and the Dutch have scored higher average IQ in two different inquries. STOP this "look how much more intelligent and better we are than other"-thing. Have we not have enough of it in our history on this earth?? Wikipedia seems simply as a kind of propaganda-"lexika" for some ethnic groups.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 84.209.194.178 (<a href="../../../8/4/2E/User_talk%7E84.209.194.178.html" title="User talk:84.209.194.178">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.209.194.178_b81d.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.209.194.178">contribs</a>) 22:07, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</small></li>
