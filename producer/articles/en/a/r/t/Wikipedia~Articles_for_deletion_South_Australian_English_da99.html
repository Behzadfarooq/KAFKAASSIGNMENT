<dd>So you don't find "According to some people" to be POV then? Perhaps "Disputed" would be a better term for this article. Plus "much vocabulary attributed to South Australians is used elsewhere."

<li><i>Redirect</i> — Silversmith has used the wrong term. It is not POV; it simply makes unattributed claims. The main point is that this article is <b>pointless</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b> although a merge wouldn't be disastrous. I have previously stated that I thought the article should be merged and redirected to <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_English_375b.html" title="Australian English">Australian English</a>, but that was at a stage when it was a woeful stub with seemingly no potential. Since it has been expanded upon (though, admittedly, it still has a way to go) I can see it developing into a useful article. I do, however, take issue with the labelling of theories of a distinct South Australian accent as "myths" given some linguists would undoubtedly assert this. A more detailed and referenced discussion is required in that regard. There was previously exploration of "South Australian English" in the Australian English article, but this was progressively removed, most probably because the dominant opinion is dismissive of regional variations in AusE.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">Talk</a> 15:31, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Do not merge. Given that a reference book does exist, I think this article is sufficiently verifiable and notable. The fact that many Australians dispute the existence of this dialect is worthy of mention therein; the fact that South Australians might take pride in differences is also worth mentioning.

<dd>No, I didn't say that, read the second half of my parenthetical. I think the best option would be a single page discussing all regional varieties of English (you could then put a para there about how South Australianisms are more often derived from Cornish and German, if that's the case, then in other dialects). That webpage you link me to is full of colloquialisms, yeah, but has a lack of things like stras/devon. Should we have an article on 1932 English in Adelaide? The colloquialisms they used then were probably quite different from those in 1832 Adelaide. The page also doesn't have a whole lot to say on other things you could discuss like pronunciation differences. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECassowary_f04f.html" title="User:Cassowary">Felix the Cassowary</a> 12:57, 22 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, I meant there aren't many noncolloquialisms on that site (that I could find, but it's not a great site in that way), not that there's none. Of course the stras/devon/polony/windsor thing's mentioned there, otherwise I'd hardly've known of it. Now if the significant thing in Aussie regional variation is words, can you show me why (given the three regions in SA), SA English forms a unit? Just for political reasons, or are there actual linguistic regions for that?

<dd>The Australian Word Map site identifies 27 "dialects". However, <i>none of these crosses a state/territory border</i>. There are good reasons why this is the case, such as the history as six separate British colonies (by the time of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_federation.html" title="Australian federation">Australian federation</a> anyway). This set up economic/education/media/etc ties to the state/territory capital cities. In parallel with Jauncey's book there are also publications about West Australian English (also 3 dialects), Queensland English (5 dialects) and so on. It is conceivable that 27 articles could be written at some stage but for obvious reasons I'm not keen to do that at present. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">(Talk)</a> 04:30, July 24, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
