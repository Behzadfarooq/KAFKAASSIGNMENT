<li>Yeah, it's not really significant. Not a big deal at all. <i>Only like the second-largest furry MU* in existence,</i> that's all. =) Raises an extremely tricky question though: It's a MUD. We don't exactly have solid notability criteria for MUDs. And the problem is, only the biggest of the biggest of the MUDs ever get big mainstream recognition. I can personally remember one. <a href="../../../b/a/t/BatMUD_16d3.html" title="BatMUD">BatMUD</a>. MUDs are, and stay, as esoteric topic, where they are rarely mentioned <i>anywhere</i> by name, and even if they are, they're mentioned trivially. We have precious few sites that rank MUDs according to activity and popularity - and even they can't really be trusted, because the MUD users themselves may not vote for them. The MUD Connector <a href="http://www.mudconnector.com/mud-bin/adv_search.cgi?Mode=MUD&amp;mud=Tapestries+MUCK" class="external text" title="http://www.mudconnector.com/mud-bin/adv_search.cgi?Mode=MUD&amp;mud=Tapestries+MUCK" rel="nofollow">claims</a> the game has been in operation since 1991 and has 100+ players online at any given time.

I have no vote one way or another - this MUCK may not be a significant topic in the grander scheme of things. But heck, <i>it's a big MUCK among the (significantly large) group of people who are its main target group</i>. I'm just lamenting the fact that this is a good example of a case that's been around forever, has had its impact, is important within the community... yet within Wikipedia, this is probably merge / external link worthy material <i>at best</i>.

<li>And lastly, apologies to everyone for going off like this. I'm sorry if someone finds this sort of outbursts disruptive. (I'm sometimes stupid this way. Now kick me. I've earned it.) For whatever it's worth, yes, I'm an user of the MUCK, yet when I pull on my Wikipedia Admin hat, I have no problem if the article is deleted if that's what the community thinks; it's just that there's definitely something funny in Wikipedia's policies what comes to situations like this. And to make things worse, it's hard to pin down <i>exactly</i> what is so funny in this. The world, it seems, is a complex and frequently illogical place. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 01:46, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Guys, I sympathise. Really. The fact is, we have to have good sources, and there <i>are</i> none for this, as far as I can tell. WikiFur can cover it in all its glory because they don't have verifiability and neutrality policies to worry about, but we do - the largest <i>furry</i> MU* is also not that much of a claim; the furry community is not that big to start with and the subset that plays MU* games is (as noted above) in the hundreds or low thousands at most. Every day we delete web forums and online games with mroe users than this, for the very same reason: no substantive coverage in secondary sources independent of the subject. Directory listings, fan forums and nothing else. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 09:48, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>First of all, I agree on principle; I just disagree slightly with your assessment of the numbers.<br />
One thing to consider: Above, I'm speaking of <i>concurrent users at a specific time</i>, not <i>total</i> number of user accounts, so these numbers are not exactly comparable. <a href="../../../g/a/i/Gaia_Online_5051.html" title="Gaia Online">Gaia Online</a>'s front page they have 13,541 users online. Suddenly looks pretty small. Also says there's 5,026,922 users <i>total</i>. Not so small any more. There's no numbers on the total user count in Tapestries, which is pretty nasty.<br />
Secondly, as I tried to hint above, <i>Tapestries is a very large MU* compared to all other MU*s</i>, not <i>just</i> compared to other furry MU*s.<br />
<i>Basically</i>, we're sitting on top of the exact thought experiments that the policies use (or used, last I checked): Sure, we have a <i>big</i> MU* here, everyone knows it's a big and important MU* that has had tons of impact, but <i>we can't prove it's big and important through sources,</i> so apparently it's not fit to be included in Wikipedia. (And bees can't fly, either, if you believe the sources.) Using thought experiments is kind of flimsy, so I propose we change these policies to use this as a living example of what we <i>can't do.</i> We need a good example of "criteria for inclusion is verifiability, not truth". We need an <i>example</i> of <i>truth</i> that we can't include, enshrined forever in our policies. If we're to delete this, <i>let's make an example out if it.</i> It's entirely reasonable in my opinion.<br />
And again, sorry for going off like this. Yours truly, probably the single most troublesome editor in the past weeks, --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 12:31, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Neutral</b> Oh, man, I dunno about this one. Part of me wants to just say <i>"Strong Keep, Duh, of course it's notable!"</i> and leave it at that. If only things were that simple. On one hand, this is extremely notable within the online furry community, both widely-known and widely-played. On the other hand we have the fundamental problem of reliable sources: even with the many gaming magazines out there, few of them ever bother to cover the comings-and-goings of the MUCK world, and if they did they'd still probably stay away from the adult-oriented Tapestries. Finally, there's the issue of precedent-setting: articles about MU*s tend to attract more articles about MU*s, which the creators then vigorously defend because if there's even one MU* article on all of Wikipedia then they have a constitutional right to theirs too. To sum it all up, I'm torn. I'd love it if somebody showed up with some realiable sources os we could keep this, but if not, well, there's always WikiFur. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 03:32, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The largest, and among the oldest, mucks dedicated to its particular fandom. It's also one of the oldest and most populous adult-oriented mucks. It's apparently been featured in a <i>Wired News</i> article, a 1999 public radio international feature called <i>Beyond Computers</i>, a San Francisco Bay Guardian article from 1998. It was a link of the day at <a href="http://www.igda.org/sex/archives/2005/10/link_of_the_day_55.html" class="external text" title="http://www.igda.org/sex/archives/2005/10/link_of_the_day_55.html" rel="nofollow">Sex &amp; Games</a>, published by the International Game Developers' Association -- and that's just from five minutes of searching. Its existence is quite verifiable, and the wealth of weblinks to it (about 25,000 Google hits for Tapestries +muck -wikipedia) should speak to its noteworthiness as an internet phenomenon. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 08:42, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
