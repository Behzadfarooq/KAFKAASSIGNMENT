<dd>This article has a history of IP addresses adding and removing NPOV, joke and deletion notices. (Please note - I didn't put on the joke tag - but it made me read the article more carefully than I had before.)</dd>
<dd>Some editing has come from a Cambridge University IP, including an edit summary saying, "<i>remove - it's a spoof page, as demonstrated by the bizarre humour and mockery behind its composition</i>". The charity appears to be led by one particular couple. Their <a href="http://cambridge.gumtree.com/cambridge/18/4188318.html" class="external text" title="http://cambridge.gumtree.com/cambridge/18/4188318.html" rel="nofollow">advertising</a> for a nanny probably led to these remarks being added:<i>"HaMaayan also employs a nanny who is responsible for the needs of HaMaayan's under-5 population." ......liberating women from having to endure pregnancy, is theologically important for HaMaayan."</i> I guess this is a private joke: <i>HaMaayan prides itself as one of the most litigious organisations in the UK.</i> In general, it seems to poke fun at the charity's stated aims, which seem surprisingly ambitious for the Cambridge area: "<i>It is believed that if several thousand Jews can be persuaded to buy properties in Cambridge, and several hundred thousand pounds can be raised then the project could be extremely viable." "There is also a proposal to build a Talmud Torah and an eruv in nearby Newmarket which, after extensive market research is believed to be a location which many Jews may be interested in moving to.</i>" (Also, I couldn't find any reference to HaMaayan on Lexis-Nexis UK)--<a href="../../../h/j/m/User%7EHJMG_daa3.html" title="User:HJMG">HJMG</a> 21:54, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I would urge a little bit of caution before rushing to delete this page - there are two google references to the organisation as cited above (one from the cambridge evening news which is a proper newspaper)and I tried the links at the bottom of the page and they worked, one being to the website of the charity commission, which is a government site. It could be that someone has added a joke into the article at our expense (that's not exactly infrequent here!) but that doesnt mean we should get rid of the whole thing. If we did that there'd be no profile for George Bush, Tony Blair.... Perhaps someone knows of some way to get in touch with the organisation to ask them directly. )--Camuvan<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Wikigreps (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wikigreps_20fa.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wikigreps">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>actually the CEN with gilinsky that talks about how her faith is centred around the law of the land might actually support their claim to attribute holiness to the court system - not such a strange idea to believe that judges do the work of God etc etc - i wil actually add that to the article to see if it makes things any more useful to us.

<p>I understand what you are saying but as far as I can see the organisation is real, as shown from the google search and the charity commission website. If it is small, it was nevertheless big enough for its trustee to be interviewed by the Cambridge Evening News as a representative of the Cambridge Jewish community so it can't be that small. In any event, wikipedia has hundreds of pages on individual churches, synagogues, temples or cults with only a few hundred members (i've certainly read quite a few here!). HJMG - would you not agree with me that we should maybe be concentrating on making the page better and not removing it based on current knowledge. look forward to hearing your thoughts - i am new round here so apologies if i have something wrong.

<dd>Having an article about an organization does not imply that Wikipedia "endorses" it as a "bona fide synagogue". Many organizations we have articles about are not affiliated to the Federation of Synagogues. What does count is that they are not notable. What is worse (as far as I can see) is that most of the information here is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>. For all we know, HaMa'ayan could be <i>fiercely opposed</i> to all forms of extrauterine gestation, and traditional litigation. By the way, the name just means "well" or "spring" in <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a>, and there are more organizations that have this name. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 20:51, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> this article seems to be generally quite accurate. they may be a small organisation but they definitely exist as there is information about them on several locations on the internet. we must help improve the article though --Camuvan</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> the page is clearly about a real organisation, so let's keep it wikigreps</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>.
