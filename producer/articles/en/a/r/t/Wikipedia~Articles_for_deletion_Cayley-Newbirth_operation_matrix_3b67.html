<p>Cayley-Newbirth operation matrix was proposed for deletion. This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record. The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>.</p>
<p>This is a suspect page, not verified by independent sources on Google and reminiscent of hoax pages in the names (Bayleigh is probably just from Cayley ...). The topic is also obscure and minor at best. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 07:04, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Keep and Cleanup</b> This is not a hoax.</s> Cayley is actually a rather well known figure in mathematics, and this is one of his lesser contributions to the world of pure mathematics, but this article is poorly written. Then again, most math articles on Wikipedia need to be rewritten so that they can be understood by someone other than a math major. —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 07:19, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<li>It is not disputed that <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Cayley_9a49.html" title="Arthur Cayley">Arthur Cayley</a> is a major figure; James Newbirth is not someone I have been able to trace. This is a well-constructed hoax (I assume - would not otherwise have lasted here) written by someone mathematically informed and literate. Unless I am mistaken it skates on the limits of saying something, but is actually meaningless - so cleaning it up isn't really an option. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 07:42, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<li>If it is a hoax, it's at least 40 years old. It appears (albeit as the Cayley Operational Matrix, without Newbirth credited) via several mentions and footnotes in my 1964 edition of <i>Handbook of Mathematical Functions</i> from the U.S. National Bureau of Standards. That alone leads me to think it isn't a hoax. —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 07:56, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)

<li>Perhaps there is some confusion between this "Cayley Operational Matrix" and the concept of a "Cayley Operator Table" (or just "Cayley Table"? That <i>is</i> a valid mathematical concept, and indeed the suspect page appears to be an extremely confused variant of a Cayley Table. <a href="../../../t/e/o/User%7ETeorth_1d14.html" title="User:Teorth">Terry</a> 04:56, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Odd, doesn't appear to be a hoax though. Most of the math makes some sort of sense to me, but I don't quite understand how one can compose two binary operators unless they're using some non-standard definition of compose; probably my fault and not the article's though, though it could do with a lot of cleanup.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm pretty sure it is not Abramowitz and Stegun, regardless of what is said above (if it is in A&amp;S though, I will of course vote <i>keep</i>). Neither Bayleigh nor Newbirth is listed in MathSciNet, a vast database of mathematics papers, and the three references to "operation matrix" in MathSciNet talk about clearly different things. I also looked into the Science Citation Index, to no avail (Bayleigh appears once as a misspelling of Rayleigh). At the very least it is not notable. However, as Fvw notes, binary operators cannot be composed, and the sentence "the result of composing addition with any other operator except addition is that of a multiplication operation" does not make sense, so I think it is a hoax. I do not know what more research one can do. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> 23:48, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC) (via edit conflict)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I have examined Abramowitz and Stegun, and until and unless somone posts a page number, I won't believe it is in there. It's not a 40-year old hoax; it's an 8-month old hoax, one perpetrated with enough pseudo-mathematical nonsense to take in an uneducated or careless reviewer. --<a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDominus_070e.html" title="User:Dominus">Dominus</a> 23:54, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Delete unless exact citation is given. Considering that the <b><a href="../../../a/b/r/Abramowitz_and_Stegun_930b.html" title="Abramowitz and Stegun">Abramowitz and Stegun</a> <i>Handbook of Mathematical Functions</i> from the U.S. National Bureau of Standards</b> is published in several places online, the fact that <i>"Cayley Operational Matrix"</i> gets zero hits seems to make some of the claims above suspect. Also, while my local public libraries' online DB has heard of Arthur Cayley, it has not heard of anybody Newbirth, nor Bayleigh, nor this matrix by any of the names suggested. The first two anons that added this article added too little else to make any judgements, but the IP that added it to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_matrices.html" title="List of matrices">List of matrices</a> has consistently been reverted as a vandal, for making edits, for example, changing the part of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internal_combustion_engine.html" title="Internal combustion engine">Internal combustion engine</a> that said "depending" to "poopy ending". <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 00:23, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. As someone with a Master's degree in mathematics, I can attest that this article is mathematical nonsense. A group doesn't have multiple operations; something that has + and * is called a <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ring_%28mathematics%29.html" title="Ring (mathematics)">ring</a>. Furthermore, even in a ring, one never talks about "composition of operators". Finally, I've never heard of Newbirth, Bayleigh, or the red-linked "operator equivalence symbol". I specialized in <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geometric_group_theory.html" title="Geometric group theory">geometric group theory</a>; I would have heard of this topic if it wasn't a hoax. <a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbenbenn_44bf.html" title="User:Dbenbenn">Dbenbenn</a> 03:40, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>I haven't yet seen any attacks on the factual integrity (god that sounds pompous, but you know what I mean) yet that are this subtle yet confine themselves to their own article which noone will stumble upon. There's obvious hoaxes and pranks, but the people trying to add subtle misinformation always do so to established articles people will actually come across. If this is a hoax, the only way people would find it is via random page or external links. And then there's also the fact that everyone who knows what a group is just scratches their head at this one, instead of putting a wrong year in their report or whatever else the consequence of a normal disinformation attack are. <a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">&amp;#0xfeff;</a> --<a href="../../../f/v/w/User%7EFvw_ae32.html" title="User:Fvw">fvw</a><a href="../../../f/v/w/User_talk%7EFvw_8876.html" title="User talk:Fvw"><small><font color="green">*</font></small></a> 15:06, 2004 Dec 23 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think the editors who voted to keep should have a long think about their policy in voting.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The article informs us that Cayley-Newbirth operation matrix <i>outlines the effects of the composition of group operators on elements of a group.</i> (whatever "<i>outline the effects of</i>" may mean). At the very least, it should specify how the entries of this matrix are determined. Some of the assertions are nonsense; for instance, those containing the expressions + * or + * . What does composition of + and * mean exactly? This is a poorly constructed practical joke by someone vaguely familiar with mathematical terminology. Probably having a couple of books on basic algebra and a book on classical mechanics would be enough. The final sentence <i>It is possible to express the Hamiltonian of a time-independent mechanical system in terms of Cayley- Newbirth operation matrices</i> is a dead giveaway that this is complete nonsense. <a href="../../../c/s/t/User%7ECSTAR_0140.html" title="User:CSTAR">CSTAR</a> 03:41, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
