<b>Reject</b> - A previous reviewer noted that the Emmy award was merely a <i>local</i> Emmy - which is vastly less prestigious than a national one. But in any case, Wikipedias guidelines for articles about living people stresses time after time that because of legal issues, articles about living people must only be accepted if they are extremely well sourced - and this article is not remotely well sourced...even adequately sourced. In fact, all we can trace back to sources is the Emmy award. I think this article is not up to the standards of notability or the standard for references in the case of living persons - so it's a reject. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 16:30, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Francisco Giadach is a pianist, guitarist, bassist and drummer that records, edits and performs his songs and arrangements by himself. "Using advanced recording technology, he merges music tracks together to create suitable polyphony and rhythm." (Enigmas, 32) Unlike any other musicians of these times, Francisco Giadach expanded his relatively insignificant fame using P2P networking programs such as LimeWire, or others that use the Gnutella network. His work was slowly recognized by local music firms and was first distributed on the radio in November, 2006. Since then, and with the help of outside parties that admired his ability to mix, edit, compose and arrange diverse pieces of music, Giadach first signed a contract with the BMG logo for an album that is in the progress of being recorded.</p>

<p>Capt. James J Jines (Jr.) was with the 1st Air Commando Wing, stationed at Eglin Auxillary Field #9 (now Hurlburt Field, FL) of Eglin AFB in Fort Walton Beach, FL. He was a fighter pilot and instructor. He was responsible for training most of the A-1 pilots from near the beginning of the program until his death in 1965. Many of those he trained can be seen posed by his aircraft on the Skyraider.org website, and include two Medal of Honor recepients, Bernard Fisher and William Jones. Capt. Jines was killed June 24, 1965 in a mid air collision involving two A-1E propellar planes and two F-100 jets. Both of the jets pulled out, but all of those in the two A-1E's were killed. The crash took place near Crestview (Seva) Florida during what was supposed to be a routine training mission, but Capt. Jines was actually trying to replicate a prior shooting down of a Soviet MiG by a Navy A-1. The 1st Air Commando Wing was responsible for air to ground support fighting early in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. They later flew in such missions as the Son Tay prison raid. Hurlburt AFB is now home to the Air Force Special Operations Command, the successors to the Air Commando Squadrons.</p>
<p>Capt. Jines, born in 1932, graduated from Louisiana State University where he took ROTC, then entered the USAF as a 2nd Lt. in March 1955. He was stationed in Greenville, MS, Selma, AL and then Bainbridge, GA where he completed flight training and was asked to become an instructor himself upon his graduation. He later was transferred to Laredo, TX and then to Hurlburt, FL, where he was instrumental in the A1 training program, which used propellar aircraft to do much of the air to ground support combat in Southeast Asia. He was chosen for the program based upon his skill and experience, as well as his rapport with fellow officers and enlisted personnel alike, in addition to rigorous testing done by the USAF to determine his abilities to participate in the early specialized program of the Air Commandos.</p>
<p>Capt. Jines completed two tours of duty (TDY) in southeast Asia in 1962-1963 and in 1964-1965. He was in South Vietnam, Cambodia, Loas, and Thailand. He was part of the Jungle Jim and Ranch Hand operations. Besides A-1's, he also flew B-26's, T-28's, T-33's, among other planes. He was presented with the Purple Heart Medal by Brig. General Rolin T. Anthis, for injuries received while flying as an A-26 pilot while stationed at Bien Hoa Air Base, RSVN, according to the Hurlburt AFB historian's information provided on a historical photograph. The aircraft he was piloting sustained substantial damage from enemy fire, but Capt. Jines managed to get the plane and all crew members safely back to base despite his own injuries received during the bombing of the plane. Capt. Jines also received the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal with three oak-leaf clusters, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, Small Arms Expert Marksmanship Ribbon, and numerous other awards during his service in the USAF.</p>

<p>The Lost Boys (previously called Falling Through Tomorrow) are a 5 piece hardcore band from northern new south wales. It consists of 5 mates; Blake Northfield - vocals Will Howden - Guitar Simon Doe - Guitar Matt Peters - Bass Samuel Northfield - Drums.</p>
<p>With influences ranging from Black my Heart, Throwdown and On broken Wings, The Lost Boys formed in late 2005. In mid 2005 there were just four musicians who had nothing to show their talent with untill it came up to start up a band. They only played with 2 guitarists but then found Tom in early 2006. Tom left mid 2006 due to other commitments. Soon after we found Matt. And hopefully there wont be anymore changes. We do this merely for fun. The Lost Boys started by playing covers from other bands but now have their own songs which will hopefully there will be more up soon. Demo out Winter 2007. We now also have merch so check out our blog for more details. You can also check us out at www.purevolume.com or www.mp3.com.</p>

<p>Group Bio</p>
<p>Consists of:</p>
<p>NOYZ, 3 Thirds, Yung Sip, and 7k</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Southern Artist covering such states as Texas, Georgia, Mississippi, and New Orleans. Formed while all members were in the United States Marine Corps. All Group members have been to Iraq twice and have seen and/or experienced combat numerous times. Each one fitting together like an intricate piece of a puzzle the members of SouthuNoyz; (pronounced like:South"N"Noyz) collectively bring an alternative perspective to the south and southern regions.</p>
<p>SouthuNoyz' differs from most groups as they compose what they've coined to be Rap &amp; B. A mixture of Rap and R &amp; B. Individually they bring a different yet important part to "The Movement". "NOYZ", the visionary behind the group, and probably the most experienced of the four members, brings the blues to the rhythm. With his smooth R &amp; B "NOYZ" brings the calm to the quiet storm. "3 Thirds" along with "Noyz" became the founding members fo the group "SouthuNoyz". Together they began sketching out the plans in January 2002 under such monikers as "Black 'N Mild" which was the duo's name before the addition of the other two members. "3 Thirds" brings the lyrisist mentality and thought provoking yet clever word play to put a weak mind on its edge. "Yung Sip" the third member of the group, brings the dirt to the mix. With his "straight to the point" lyrics he brings the pleasures and pains of the street life for all to feel. Lastly, 7k "Tha Kool Kat" became the fourth member. Because of his constant shifting from city to city he brings light from 'the hood to the woods' and back. With his strong vocals he brings the catchy and witty phrases that catch the attention of the most diehard fans of all genres of music. their diversity is apparent throughout their music, starting from the traditional southern crunk of 'BIG RYMZ' and 'Fitted Hat' to the more thoughtful sounds of the '10 in tha Wind and SouthuN Ryde'. Not to mention the 'ode to the south of the track Kuntry. It is evident that SouthuNoyz has something for everyone to prove that they are not a group, but a "MOVEMENT"</p>

<p>The Hellawack website, known to most members of it as the Matrix-Rayne website. It was based on the slightly famous modification Matrix-Rayne, made by Djperegrine, founder and admin of the site, and upon the popular Flash game Madness Interactive, based on the as much popular Madness Combat Flash movies. This modification was losely based on The Matrix, but with new characters, like Rayne, and Hank J Wimbledon. The site has changed internet address many times, but is now <a href="http://rayne.hellawack.net" class="external free" title="http://rayne.hellawack.net" rel="nofollow">http://rayne.hellawack.net</a>.</p>

<p>The site is home to many talented artists who although are not admins are seen as people of “power” or “fame” some include Storagebox_7, Flipped_Out_Cookie, issac, and more. Many members believe that the encroachment of “noobs” posting poor quality “Pivots” or Art and spaming the forums. Some known people who generally hate this are G3A3 and Flipped_Out_Cookie, but FoC has offered a “noob-less” forum site simply called “teh forum” for MR members, such as Storagebox_7,FoC himself, Baker, and more. The site has moved from the mods and art to the forums of which there are 4 catagories, there are a total of six sub-catagories shown to non-admins. “General”, “Madness”, “Drawing”, The Site”. The sub-catagories are “Anything”, “Mods”, “Drawing Links”, “Techinques”, “Bugs”, “Features”. There's also one sub-category only shown to admins, called "admin". As of now, a new “craze” may actually happen on the site, comics… so far two members are avidly showcasing their’s: Storagebox_7 and Mach 3, both have at least a minimal fan-following that is more or less positive.</p>

<p>Usergroups on the Hellawack forum are unlike other forums made by users, not by requests from the admins. Users sometimes change their names to show what "clan" they are in. Most known are:</p>
<p>Contract Technology. Members: pyrofalkon, Stealth Monkey, Eggward, Box_o_Bullets. CT mainly draw guns. They are working on a mod called the Contract Technology mod, but under mild secrecy. Grounded by pyrofalkon.</p>
<p>MRAP. Grounded by Theseus. Existed only during October 2006. Members were too many to count. MRAP attacked Pivot (an animation tool) animators and their work.</p>
<p>ZXProductions. Members: tomfitz, Madness49, Flipped_Out_Cookie, Pvt_Johnson_v2, Baker, issac, george18264, Joshcena, Eggo_Waffles, Knutz and FueledByMountainDew. Grounded by tomfitz. They mainly collaborate with things.</p>

<p>The mod simply known as “The Best Mod Ever” is the center of mystery and dispute to all but the Admins and old members, even though many dispute the mods “claim to fame” because of the lack of Code altering and the only change is a poorly drawn “strongbad” being the character. But do not say such things as the Admins and a few experienced members will “hate” you, this is because it is arguably the first mod ever and was the inspiration for the entire site, therefore is held close by the Adims and members. There are more Reasons not made clear to some members but over all the Mod is considered a low quality mod. This does however work as an efficient way of finding "Noobs", as only a newbie to the site would dare insult the mod as “terrible” and therefore forever label themselves as "noobs". The site’s influx of new members is generally seen as bad for the site, but no comment for admins has been seen. If any MR member or admin wishes to alter this you may do so.</p>

<p>The "Editor's Picks" category on the side menu is the mods among the best posted on the website acording to the admins. Some picks, however, are animations or other games than MI (Madness Interactive) mods. The most apreciated are The HK Mod by lkegley9, the HD mod by Eggward, the Halo: Slayer mod by Compass and the Carnage Combat mod by Box_o_Bullets (changed his name to Bobby_Bullets after forgetting his original password). I, however, suggest that you should play through all of them. Good mods can also be found in the lists of users that have got one Editor's Pick or more. Those are mainly Eggward and lkegley9, who have made the Überactive mod and the All Madness Interactive mod.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-01-02_5185.html" title="Edit section: Wurld Media">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Wurld Media</span></h2>
<p>Wurld Media was founded in September 1999 as a privately held company based in Saratoga Springs, NY, by Gregory Kerber and Kirk Feathers.</p>
<p>The company set out to create and manage systems to leverage online markets. Its first product was launched in 2001. Wurld Media's initial consumer product, Grow Hope™, created an online marketing opportunity for nonprofit organizations to reach new and existing supporters with an online solution for earning additional donations through e-commerce purchases.</p>
<p>A second product, BuyersPort®, grew out of Grow Hope™. Combined, they power the HelpUSA program to allow online shoppers to support nonprofit causes at no cost to the consumer. By private labeling, the BuyersPort®/Grow Hope™ platform and membership program, nonprofit partners such as the Child Safety Network, the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, and the Arthritis Foundation have created an affinity program for their supporter base.</p>
<p>BuyersPort® is a commercial online marketplace consisting of more than 500 of the Internet's top retailers, including Expedia, eBay, Dell, Overstock, and Barnes &amp; Noble. The difference between BuyersPort and other online shopping malls is that BuyersPort members earn cash back from their purchases. Partners include <a href="../../../p/r/i/Priceline.html" title="Priceline">Priceline</a>.com, <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expedia.html" title="Expedia">Expedia</a>.com, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Travelocity.html" title="Travelocity">Travelocity</a>.com, <a href="../../../o/r/b/Orbitz.html" title="Orbitz">Orbitz</a>, <a href="../../../o/v/e/Overstock.html" title="Overstock">Overstock</a>.com, <a href="../../../d/e/l/Dell.html" title="Dell">Dell</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barnes_and_Noble_2102.html" title="Barnes and Noble">Barnes and Noble</a>, <a href="../../../e/b/a/EBay_4cc0.html" title="EBay">eBay</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Staples.html" title="Staples">Staples</a>, <a href="../../../j/c/p/JCPenney_6d69.html" title="JCPenney">JCPenney</a>, The <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_Depot_19e8.html" title="Home Depot">Home Depot</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/p/Gap.html" title="Gap">Gap</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Nordstrom.html" title="Nordstrom">Nordstrom</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circuit_City_a200.html" title="Circuit City">Circuit City</a>, and others.</p>
<p>BuyersPort® was used by <a href="../../../s/t/r/StreamCast_bcdc.html" title="StreamCast">StreamCast</a> in 2002 to help create an online shopping experience for <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morpheus.html" title="Morpheus">Morpheus</a> users. Although Morpheus is ad-supported, many users were not happy with the way a <a href="../../../b/r/o/Browser_helper_object.html" title="Browser helper object">browser helper object</a> named Wurld Media redirected specific web addresses to BuyersPort® member sites.</p>
<p>Continuing to seek out high-growth consumer markets, Wurld Media launched a third product in March 2003, LX Systems™. LX Systems was envisioned as a distributive computing technology to help multimedia providers efficiently market and distribute content to millions of consumers on the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a>. LX Systems uses the same <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer-to-peer.html" title="Peer-to-peer">peer-to-peer</a> architecture utilized by <a href="../../../b/i/t/BitTorrent_9cbd.html" title="BitTorrent">BitTorrent</a>. LX Systems first customer was the US Army's recruiting video game, <a href="../../../a/m/e/America%27s_Army_60f6.html" title="America's Army">America's Army</a>.</p>
<p>With a scalable and secure content distribution technology under their belt, company founders Kerber and Feathers said they saw an opportunity in the emerging pay-for-play Internet music marketplace of 2004-2005. The digital media file sharing service <a href="../../../p/e/e/Peer_Impact_e556.html" title="Peer Impact">Peer Impact</a> was launched in August 2005.</p>
<p>Peer Impact is a legal pay-for-download file-sharing service which utilizes a peer-to-peer distribution system similar to BitTorrent to speed downloads of digital media, including radio, video, audio books, and video games. Wurld Media has digital distribution contracts with four large content providers: <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sony_BMG_a405.html" title="Sony BMG">Sony BMG</a> Music Entertainment, <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Music_Group_a819.html" title="Universal Music Group">Universal Music Group</a>, <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warner_Music_Group_9933.html" title="Warner Music Group">Warner Music Group</a>, and <a href="../../../e/m/i/EMI_68e5.html" title="EMI">EMI</a>.

<p>DeShaun Xavier (President)</p>
<p>David Sean Xavier (born March 26, 1983 in Roslyn, New York, United States) is a American entertainment mogul, hip-hop <a href="../../../r/e/c/Record_producer.html" title="Record producer">record producer</a>, arranger, keyboardist, and instrumentalist of Jewish descent. He also owns the famous Royal Palms Hotel &amp; Casino, as well as the growing restaurant chain, Pizza and Burgers. His main project in 2005 was teaming up with scientists from Glenville Science Academy to find a way to create a contact lens that doesn't ever dry and is water-proof.</p>
<p>After moving to Boston, Massachusetts where he became a "ghost writer" for several rappers. Xavier began experimenting with his own productions by making beats for Nas. He then left Boston, and learned more about the art of making beats by working with several New York producers, as Xavier's sound and style became more commercial. He is now one of the most in-demand hip-hop producers today, working on beats for a wide variety of artists. Much like Kanye West and 9th Wonder, Xavier heavily relies on samples to compose a beat, often using old jazz songs.</p>
<p>DeShaun (nickname for Xavier) also lives a very extravagant lifestyle. In a recent interview with Stuff Magazine, Xavier says he enjoys buying and wearing jewelry that represents power. He has been known to have a love for cars. His collection includes a Rolls Royce Phantom, a Bentley Continental GT, an Aston Martin V12 Vanquish, a Ferrari 360 Spider, and a Porshe Cayenne.</p>
<p>Xavier's own production company is called DXavier Productions. Xavier also has his own record label, called DXavier23, which is distributed under Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment.</p>
<p>Xavier made his first appearance in Jim Jone's Certified Gangster's music video. His second appearance was at the end of the new music video by Jay-Z entitled 30 Something hasn't yet been released. As of late Xavier has produced songs for 50 Cent, for his new album Before I Self Destruct, as well as for Coldplay, Styles P., Nas, Serius Jones, Papoose, as well as Young Buck of G-Unit. Just recently, Xavier produced tracks called Reloaded and New Orleans State of Mind off of Lil Waynes up and coming album, Tha Carter III.</p>

<p>His name is David Sloan, but many in the ODU athletic community know him as "Superfan." The sports management major from Herndon, Va. is a 2005 graduate of Old Dominion University. While as an undergrad, The Superfan could be found at nearly every home game, no matter what the sport. He Went to baseball games, basketball games, soccer matches, field hockey games and women's lacrosse contests.</p>
<p>He would show up in his Old Dominion ball cap, which is often turned backwards. Sometimes, he painted "ODU" on his face. He would come armed with sheets of statistics and a small megaphone. To this day, He's the loudest student at ODU athletic events. Sometimes, he's the only student there as she still finds the time to come to ODU Sports even though he's graduated.

<p>The Little Humbacked Horse is a Ballet in three acts, plus a Prologue. It was choreographed in 1864 by Arthur Saint-Léon, with music by Cesare Pugni. It is based on a poem by Pyotr Pavlovich Yershov.</p>
<p>A short outline of the ballet:</p>
<p>Prologue</p>
<p>The protagonist, Ivan, is guarding hay, and catches a magic horse, who is trying to eat it. In return for releasing him, the magic horse gives Ivan two fine horses, and one Little Humpbacked horse.</p>
<p>Act 1.</p>
<p>Ivan and his brothers go to sell the two horses in the capital, where they ar bought by the Tsar. Ivan then brings the horses to the palace.</p>
<p>Act 2.</p>
<p>A jealous advisor of the Tsar finds quests for the Tsar to send Ivan on. With the help of his little horse, he is successful. He is sent to the top of the silver mountain, and to catch a firebird. The last quest is to bring the Tsar the magical maiden of the sea, and to this end he travels into the sea to fetch her.</p>
<p>Act 3.</p>
<p>The maiden will not marry the Tsar though, finding him to old. There is a magic method of rejuvination though, starting with being dipped into boiling water. To be safe the Tsar decides to first test it on Ivan. The horse casts a spell on him, so that he will be kept safe, and he comes through it all transformed into a handsom prince. The king then plunges into the cauldren, and dies of boiling alive. Ivan then marries the maiden, becoming the Tsar.</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>Feasting and celebrations.</p>
<p><br />
There was a notable version from Petipa in 1895. A later revival (1960) of the ballet had the music revised and re-orchestrated by Rodion Konstantinovich Shchedrin.</p>

Scaggsville is an unincorporated town in Maryland. It is located at the southern tip of <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_County_51b1.html" title="Howard County">Howard County</a>, between <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laurel.html" title="Laurel">Laurel</a> and <a href="../../../f/u/l/Fulton.html" title="Fulton">Fulton</a>. The name Scaggsville appears on exits for MD Route 216 off of Interstate 95 and MD Route 29. The town mainly consists of residences, with some commercial establishments. Scaggsville generally falls within zip code 20723. Places have Laurel addresses, so Scaggsville can be considered a suburb of Laurel. It once had its own post office, but has since been downgraded.</p>
<p>The town is named for the Scaggs family who have long lived in the region and continue to do so. Some residents have advocated changing the name to Rocky Gorge, since the community borders the Rocky Gorge Reservoir (also known as the T. Howard Duckett Resevoir). In addition to the resevoir, Scaggsville is home to Hammond Elementary School, Hammond Middle School, and the Maryland milk production facility.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-01-02_5185.html" title="Edit section: Chrono Trigger Resurrection Project">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Chrono Trigger Resurrection Project</span></h2>
<p>Chrono trigger was made by a group as known as the dream Team in 1995 who worked for Sqauresoft now as known as SquareEnix.</p>
<p><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Http://www.opcoder.com/projects/chrono/Logo.jpg">Image:Http://www.opcoder.com/projects/chrono/Logo.jpg</a></p>
<p>The Chrono Resurrection Project Started in in April 2003 The team had 7 members working on the fan project.</p>
<p>Nathan Lazur</p>
<p>Role: Project Director, Programmer</p>
<p>Biography: I started programming when I was 16 and haven't been able to stop since. My first inspiration to start programming was to make a game as good as Chrono Trigger. I programmed on the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation when I was in High School as guide to understand how a game like Chrono Trigger would be made, with the limitations present on a console.</p>
<p>Due to my previous experiences, I was hired as a professional videogame programmer at the age of 18. Ever since, I've been constantly learning, trying to better myself to realize that goal I had back when I was 16. This project is a tribute to that goal and to Square.</p>
<p><br />
Favorite aspects of Chrono Trigger: The battle system, graphics, music, story, and planning.</p>
<p>I think Square did an absolutely brilliant modification to the Active Time Battle system. The ability to combine attacks made you want to play with every character to find out if they could do techs together. Anytime I would face the same enemy in a specific part of a world, I would try to defeat it a different way. Even today, no other RPG's battle sytem has kept me so enthusiastic like Chrono Trigger's.</p>
<p>The characters were excellently designed and each character had a significant contribution to the story. The fact that you could alter some of your characters (and other NPC's) lives showed me the possibilities of what proper game planning could do to impact the overall feel of the story.</p>
<p>Yasunori Mitsuda's score serves as an inspiration to me and a motivation factor when I'm not working on this project. I personally think that Chrono Trigger would not be the same game without his wonderful music.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Luis Martins</p>
<p>Role: Art Director, Concept/Texture/Lighting/Effect Artist</p>
<p><br />
Biography: I started drawing at an early age of 5. Ever since, it has been part of my reality through High School and college. During that same period, I had become an avid videogame player. Being born through the eyes of western cartoons and media in mind, I searched for new grounds and discovered Japanese animation and art. The sheer variety and quality appealed to me the same way videogames did.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough one day to meet a very talented Art Director, José Holder. I decided to join his studio and learn to improve my artistic knowledge. After Freelancing and doing fan base artwork, I was given a chance to join in the videogame business. That’s when it all started. 3 years later, here I am today being part of this project, hoping to bring quality and justice to this challenging task.</p>
<p><br />
Favorite aspects of Chrono Trigger: Basically, I came a little late to realize how good this masterpiece is. Never the less, I have been impressed by its popularity and content. The visuals are really captivating, among the best pixel art ever created. The game is so colorful and rich, the detail never ceases to amaze me. Even today, the graphics have aged incredibly well! Needless to say, the originality of its story, art, and score are truly something to be impressed about. What is better than having artists like Akira Toriyama and Yasunori Mitsuda to provide richness to this game?</p>
<p><br />
Name: Moise Breton</p>
<p>Role: Background/Main Character Modeler, Texture Artist</p>
<p><br />
Biography: I’ve always been addicted to games and always wanted to make some but never knew where to start until I saw 3D studio Max for the first time in '97. Seeing the Final Fantasy series evolve in the CG field was a great motivational and inspirational factor. Hours of gaming were soon reduced to hours of modeling and texturing...</p>
<p>I was hired as a 3D artist in early 2000 and have been working since... Unfortunately work does not always satisfy my creative hunger so I am soon to find myself working on side projects. I was glad to meet with Nathan and Luis, and seeing the potential this project represents I decided to jump in.</p>
<p><br />
Favorite aspects of Chrono Trigger:</p>
<p>Just about everything! Square ruled the SNES era with the best game content and Chrono Trigger is just a good example.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
Name: David Ying</p>
<p>Role: Background/Character Modeler, Texture Artist</p>
<p><br />
Biography: I started doing art work with 3D graphics at age 15 ever since I picked up an art magazine with imagine3D demo on it. (Oh yeah, those were the days.) My first model was an AT-ST walker from Star Wars, then a madCat, then a Wipeout racer...</p>
<p>I have always been a big fanatic about Manga/Anime (Japanese pictorial novels). Ever since age 15, I have been trying to bring the best of both world of 3D graphics and Manga/Anime. There are advantages to be learnt from both media. I'm pretty much into character works and every time I play a Squaresoft game I mumble to myself about their characters, "God damn, they have already done it."</p>
<p>Today, I work as a freelance 3D artist.</p>
<p><br />
Favorite aspects of Chrono Trigger:</p>
<p>The character designs were awesome, flawlessly drawn with pixel art. You have to admit people at Squaresoft always knew how to use their hardware, even if it's only few pixels wide.</p>
<p>The story was out of this world for me, I was hooked until the end. The story of my party members was really cool too, and a lot of characters in game had a great and unique background story to them, and I somehow cared about it.</p>
<p>The battle and magic was something unique and actually more fun to play with as you deeper into the game, it's not so confusing and mind boggling like a chess game. It's simple and yet adds depth with simplicity. I remember talking to a friend about it after school how he came up with cool triple techs... and then we just talk about it all day in school.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Name: Mathew Valente</p>
<p>Role: Musician, Sound Designer</p>
<p><br />
Biography: I've been a Street Fighter fan all of my gaming life. That's all I ever played... But then I found a game called Final Fantasy 2 (FF IV) on the SNES. I can remember playing it back when I was in... oh, it must be 8th grade, and I enjoyed every second of it. The music brought me so into it, and I can remember hearing things from the game in my head that I wanted to try to jot down. When I came across a few module files made by Andy Church, I said to myself, "Wow, that's cool. I want to try that. I think I want to become a game musician." Ever since then, I've been remaking music close to 8 or 9 years now, as a hobby.</p>
<p>I compose original work on the side, but my main love is remaking something that really captured my musical attention. There's nothing more satisfying to me than to hear that I completely remade an amazingly beautiful song, and kept all the emotion in the remake in the process.</p>
<p><br />
Favorite aspects of Chrono Trigger: The graphics, the story, the music, the idea of screwing with time.&#160;;)</p>
<p>I wasn't too much of a fan of the whole Chrono Trigger idea at first. I only really got into it once I tried to figure out what happened to Marle when she got transported back to the past. The music drew me in; Yasunori Mitsuda did one fantastic job for his first outing as a game musician. I can remember when I saw the graphics that I grumbled because I wasn't a fan of Akira Toriyama's style. I thought Dragon Ball was one of the dumbest things I'd ever seen. Eventually, his unique drawing style grew on me. When I saw the first concept drawings of Crono in this project, it lacked a Toriyama-feel to the character. Can you believe that was one of the first things I pointed out?</p>
<p>Yasunori Mitsuda's music was fantastic. I thought Nobuo Uematsu also did a great job on some of the songs he did for the game. Remaking these songs was nothing more than a joy. Except that Boss Battle 2 song. That song was nothing short of a nightmare.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
Name: Michael Demirel</p>
<p>Role: Enemy/Boss/User Interface/Effect Animator</p>
<p><br />
Biography: Being a video game junky from an early age, Chrono Trigger was in my top ten favourites from the day I've played it, and still holds its place.</p>
<p>I started animation back in High School at the age of 17. The school had some 3D software and a crappy 2D program that I would create some short clips on to entertain the class. It usually ended with the computer struggling to play the full animation and would eventually crash. I then signed up to study animation at an institute, and worked several years freelancing as a graphic artist and animator. No way was I going to turn down this offer to animate the characters for CT:R!</p>
<p><br />
Favorite aspects of Chrono Trigger: Excellent replay value, a dozen different endings depending on decisions you make in the game and at what time you defeat the end boss. With the option to start a new game over with all your stats and equipment. CT also has a memorable cast of unique characters, and Magus is the kewlest anti-hero out there. The art by Akira Toriyama suits the game well and it's good eye candy.&#160;:) This game has soo much more to it, it is well worthy of being called one of the best RPG's ever.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Name: Michel Cadieux</p>
<p>Role: Main Character/Boss Animator</p>
<p>Biography: Initially, I wanted to do some special FX for movies but I didn't imagine that the game and, mostly, the animation would be so awesome. Anyway, I was playing way too much already. =) Since 17, I used my little knowledge to make anything looking as alive as it could be.</p>
<p>Well, now that I'm working in the gaming industry for a few years already. I needed a challenge -- something more personal. And now, I couldn't ask more than have the privilege to draw that rainbow sword and do what I want with it. =)</p>
<p><br />
Favorite aspects of Chrono Trigger: Ahhh, where to start! We'll, I must admit that the music is intense, the battle system is unique and the best ever storyline. That game is just simply the one of the best RPG's ever. Characters charisma, replay value, and a drinking contest!</p>
<p>I wish more gaming companies would for stop two seconds and look what is happening to the new "genre" of games. I wish they could take the "epoch" and take a look of what it was like to work on a masterpiece. =)</p>
<p>Heres some of the aspects of the proeject</p>
<hr />
<p>Technology</p>
<p>All of the technology was custom-written for Chrono Trigger: Resurrection. This includes: a cross-platform renderer, which runs on GameCube, Xbox, and PC; Converter and preview tools, such as the texture converter, 3ds max exporter, sound player, etc.; And, of course, the game core, which contains all of the logic to run the game.</p>
<p>Currently, the entirety of the game and engine is being programmed by Nathan.</p>
<p><br />
Art</p>
<p>An average scene in Chrono Trigger: Resurrection ranges anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000 triangles. Instead of opting for a low-polygon scene with lightmaps, we've decided to strategically tesselate the scene geometry so that static vertex ligthing could be used -- with similar quality results. This allows the lighting to have a more artistic feel than a normal light-mapped scene because all lighting is hand done and nothing is mathematically calculated. It is also less expensive, performance-wise, and more compatible with other platforms, due to its more simplistic technical roots. <a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Http://www.opcoder.com/projects/chrono/Crono0.jpg">Image:Http://www.opcoder.com/projects/chrono/Crono0.jpg</a></p>
<p>A typical main character mesh is composed of 10,000 - 12,000 triangles and has an average of 150 bones for animation. Each mesh has went through a rigorous approval process. For our lead 3D artist, David Ying, it is a testament to his patience and ability as multiple fixes were requested and then fixed. <a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Http://www.opcoder.com/projects/chrono/MagusLair2.jpg">Image:Http://www.opcoder.com/projects/chrono/MagusLair2.jpg</a></p>
<p>When Luis Martins joined the Chrono Trigger: Resurrection team in August 2003, the artistic direction of the project changed significantly. All of the previous character concepts and meshes were replaced in favor of a more consistent style and look -- more like Akira Toriyama's style that was used in the original Chrono Trigger. Luis made sure to overlook all the aspects of the quality in the graphics department so that everything could be as consistent as possible. It is a fair assumption to say that, without him, Chrono Trigger: Resurrection would not look as good as it does now. <a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Http://www.opcoder.com/projects/chrono/FrogConcept.jpg">Image:Http://www.opcoder.com/projects/chrono/FrogConcept.jpg</a></p>
<p><br />
Audio</p>
<p>The soundtrack for Chrono Trigger: Resurrection has been re-mastered with higher quality instruments and a higher sampling rate by our musician, Mat Valente. He has been very dedicated and worked hundreds of hours to retain the original feelings of the songs while adding more feeling to them, in the process. We think his hard work would even make Mitsuda-san proud.</p>
<p>Mat is also responsible for the sound effects in the game. In combination with the re-mastered music, we hope the audience will be pleasantly surprised with the level of audio quality in the demo.</p>
<hr />
<p>doing so well the project was reconized by many of the fans and others discovering more and more upon each day the project was becoming a big talk enough to end up on the 2004 August edition of the Swedish gaming magazine, SuperPLAY. with a short artical and a scan of Magus a character on Chrono trigger that was playable. On September 6th, 2004 Square Enix Co., Ltd issued a Cease and Desist which made many Chrono trigger fans suffer the widely known Chrono Trigger project came down to a bitter end with Square being mailed daily from when it ended til now Square has not said much about it and afterwords the team had this to say of whats left of the project</p>
<hr />
<p>It is with our deepest regret that we have to announce the closure of the Chrono Resurrection project. Square Enix Co., Ltd issued a Cease and Desist letter which means the project is publicly closed indefinitely.</p>
<p>We have devoted enormous amounts of energy in creating our vision of Chrono Trigger. We hope everyone enjoyed this experience as much as we did. As a goodbye gift to fans, a teaser trailer and screenshots of the last part of development of Chrono Resurrection are available for download.</p>

<p>In addition to a simple player editor, there are six gameplay modes all in all. One or two players can compete in the Match Play mode while up to four can compete for the best score in the 18-hole Stroke Player mode. The game also features a Grand Opening Mode (compete with the world's best Japan Pro-Golfers), a Career Mode, Qualifying Tournament (you create your own player and start with a handicap of 0) and Network Opening which lets you connect to Randnet and compete on-line in an All-Japan tournament. But it doesn't stop there, unlike the one-course Waialae wonder published in the US by Nintendo, Japan Pro-Golf packs 10 officially licensed courses from all across Japan. Basically, the best Golf game on the Nintendo 64, beautiful graphics and animations.</p>

<li><b>Declined</b>, sorry. There seems to be some confusion with the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_Orthodox_Church_of_Antioch_7056.html" title="Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch">Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch</a> which also calls itself the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antiochian_Orthodox_Church_fdef.html" title="Antiochian Orthodox Church">Antiochian Orthodox Church</a> - my first idea was to leave a message on that talk page to have an expert offer advice, but upon further review it looks like most of your article suggestion was directly copied from <a href="http://www.antiochian.org/about" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.antiochian.org/about" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>; so I'm forced to remove the text.

<p>Former student of a school in New Bombay, Utsav Chakraborty has come a long way from imitating school teachers and being the class clown. Although, he might seem, at the first glance, as someone profound and/or funny. His jest is usually not in foul taste and shows great hope as a stand-up comic in the future, eventhough he wants to pursue a career in Advertising. His antics in school, gave him popularity, briefly, for which he had to pay a price. For every man who is successful in whichever field it maybe, there are people who are afraid and stupefied by glory, no matter how insignificant it might seem. He had a lot to worry about, along with his steady academic downfall, he invited a lot of trouble after revolting againt what he thought was unjust, be that his college or the teachers it housed. He soon became a ray of hope for the quality education deprived students at the educational institution where he studied. An ardent comic book collector with his residence housing over 1,000 comic books. An arty guy, able to define crud from a masterpiece. Has a strong dislike for the 'regular' masses and believes himself to be a superior being, eventhough endowed with average human qualities. Is tall, presently slim and is myopic. Believes in the possibility of Time-Travel and the power of the human subconscious(hypnosis, premonitions etc.). Is a great hit among his friends and sucks at sports.

The Mendi Bible is a Bible presented to former US President and then-current Congressman <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Quincy_Adams_2c9a.html" title="John Quincy Adams">John Quincy Adams</a> in 1841 by a group of freed African slaves who had mutinied on the schooner <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Amistad_65a6.html" title="La Amistad">La Amistad</a>.

The freed slaves were <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mende_people.html" title="Mende people">Mende people</a>; the bible derives its name from their tribal name.</p>
<p>The Mendi Bible was presented to Quincy Adams, along with a letter of thanks which read in part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are about to go home to Africa. We go to Sierra Leone first, and then we reach Mendi very quick. When we get to Mendi we will tell the people of your great kindness. Good missionary will go with us. We shall take the Bible with us. It has been a precious book in prison, and we love to read it now we are free! Mr. Adams, we want to make you a present of a beautiful Bible! Will you please to accept it, and when you look at it or read it, remember your poor and grateful clients?... For the Mendi people. CINQUE, KINNA, KALE. Boston, Nov. 6, 1841.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Mendi Bible is currently curated at the Adams National Historic Park in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>The book was discovered stolen from the Adams site in November of 1996 and subsequently recovered by the FBI in Portsmouth, New Hampshire in January of 1997.</p>
