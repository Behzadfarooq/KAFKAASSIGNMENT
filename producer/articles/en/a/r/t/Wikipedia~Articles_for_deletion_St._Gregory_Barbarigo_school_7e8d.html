<ul>
<li>Doing a quick web search, there appear to be several reasonable candidates for sources. The article is certainly verifi<i>able</i>. It wouldn't be a big deal for someone to add the sources to the article; maybe I'll do that tomorrow. Having said that, AfD is not cleanup. Giving an article a five-day deadline to become top-quality isn't always fair to the people who are interested in the article; some things take time. Oh, and <b>keep</b> (although a merge is okay with me too if anyone wants to propose one). <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 02:27, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In the event that sources are found and added, we're back to the same old school debate. I have to disagree about cleanup versus AfD. When there are no sources cited in the article at all and the article has been around for over 2 months, peril of deletion only seems appropriate. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErechtheus_2543.html" title="User:Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a> 02:31, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Why would you use Wikipedia to find out about schools? Any useful information other than location and the colour of the school mascot would likely be POV. Parents who move to the neighbourhood would find more useful school guides than wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatchpole_52c3.html" title="User:Catchpole">Catchpole</a> 10:03, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think there's anything inherently POV about explaining the history and makeup of the school and any notable events connected with it. Wikipedia is more accessible than a school guide which is only available in the neighbourhood. Frankly I have almost no interest in US schools, but I would like to be able to read about schools in various other countries without having to actually visit the location (or speak the language). <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 20:24, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Three comments:
<ol>
<li>WP:CORP isn't an applicable notability standard, even for private schools. Schools are not important because of the amount of money they make, but because hundreds of people spend huge amounts of time at them at a pivotal time of their lives.</li>
<li>Almost all schools meet WP:CORP anyway. Even ignoring the references already in the article, I'm sure that this place, like almost every other school, has had significant local media coverage.</li>
<li>Lack of notability isn't a reason for deletion except in narrowly defined circumstances. It can be a reason for merging though, which I'd personally be okay with.</li>

<dd>Why isn't <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> applicable?

Traditionally, it's on the author of an article to assert that their article on a <i>private business</i> serves some encyclopedic purpose and that it can be expanded into an encyclopedic article, and isn't vanity or advertisement or just an unexpandable demographic stub.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - --and allow the school to expand as suggested above. It is a new entry and can improve. Just because it is a small school should not be a reason to keep it out. Small schools can be notable. When you say the "inmates" wrote it, you must mean the students. That is looking down on the students who are trying to work on their page because they don't have all the technical people public schools have. When the School Project wants a school to be kept, then they fix up a stub to keep it from being deleted. Is it only public schools that they will work on so they can be notable?

<li><b>Comment</b>: It's 4 AM where I am, so I don't trust myself to insert information into the article at present. However, here are two third-party articles about the school: <a href="http://nylottery.org/ny/nyStore/cgi-bin/WinnerNewsDetail_Cat_353_NavRoot_304_ProdID_334145.htm" class="external text" title="http://nylottery.org/ny/nyStore/cgi-bin/WinnerNewsDetail_Cat_353_NavRoot_304_ProdID_334145.htm" rel="nofollow">New York Lottery News</a> <a href="http://www.thejournalnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051122/NEWS03/511220355/1024/NEWS08" class="external text" title="http://www.thejournalnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051122/NEWS03/511220355/1024/NEWS08" rel="nofollow">Rockland Journal-News</a> These would appear to meet the definition of non-trivial coverage in <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_f507.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools">Wikipedia:Schools</a> and also the general description of <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a>. Although these must both have been written on slow news days, they do seem to meet the letter of the guidelines.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The first link isn't about the school itself. The second one doesn't distinguish this school from any other, really (lots of schools do that). This is a primary school, which needs to do a lot more than just exist to be included. There are no policies that require the inclusion of all schools, and arguments cannot be cited as policy, as precedents are not binding here. --<b><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">Core</a><font color="green">des</font><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoredesat_5b9a.html" title="User:Coredesat">at</a></b> <small><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECoredesat_227a.html" title="User talk:Coredesat">talk. ^_^</a></small> 00:10, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>How is this at all useful? Wikipedia is not a directory of schools. The information can be found out by anyone who is interested enough about the school to ring it up, and any parent wishing to enroll their child in a school will most certainly do so. Similarly they are hardly going to turn to wikipedia to find what schools are in thier local area. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 08:12, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Why wouldn't someone turn to wikipedia to find out what schools are in a given area? We actually have a pretty great set of encyclopedia articles on schools. I look for info about schools on Wikipedia all the time. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 08:18, 2 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia is not a phone directory. We also cannot guarantee that every school in a specific area has an article, and judging by the state of many of the school articles, that the information contained within is accurate or up to date. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 08:20, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
