<p>I was tempted to speedy this, but decided not to, since it doesn't technically meet the requirements.

<li><b>Redirect</b>: I knew what they meant when I saw it because in French it's "races des chiens" or something similar.

And then I thought, no, maybe they *are* talking about famous dog races (if there are any like the kentucky derby), but noooo.

<li><s><b>Redirect</b></s> to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_dog_breeds.html" title="List of dog breeds">List of dog breeds</a>. "Race" is equivalent to "breed" in this case even if it's rarely used, and somewhat confusing. If a list of dog races is created then it should link to the list of breeds. I too initially thought of races as meaning breeds. This is because Swedish is my first language and that it being a list of breeds would make more sense. It's not that unlikly that I would search for race before remembering that the proper word is breed. - <a href="../../../j/e/l/User%7EJeltz_23d5.html" title="User:Jeltz">Jeltz</a> <a href="../../../j/e/l/User_talk%7EJeltz_3bb8.html" title="User talk:Jeltz"><small>talk</small></a> 15:25, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm sorry, but a religion has to be much more established than that to merit an article.

<li>And as a sidenote, I'm Greek and I can tell you that your usage of Greek is flawed. Brother and sister are "Adelfos" and "Adelfi", not "Aldefos" and "Aldefi". Also the names of your months have a mixed usage of cardinal and ordinal numerals (i.e. "pente" means "five" and "endeka" means "eleven", but "proto" means "first" and "ekto" means "sixth"). <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAris_Katsaris_46a9.html" title="User:Aris Katsaris">Aris Katsaris</a> 04:20, Apr 26, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do not delete</b>, this is a a real religion. It has 5,000 adherents many of whom reside in the New England region. It is not known in wider circles, even most neo-Pagans are not aware of its existence.

I wrote the "dic-def" that Georgia Guy was wiki-ing about, and I thought that it explained the basic idea of "penguinizing" something.

<li>I would like to refute what Johntex said. I know many people, not just my close-knit friends, who use the word "penguinize" in normal conversation. These people range (Geographically) from Birtish Columbia, Canada, to Virginia, USA. It may be a "made up word", but thats how a language Evloves. the word "digital" was unheard of in the early 1900's, but is now commonplace. I don't claim that the word "penguinize" will become as popular is digital, nor do I claim to have "made up" the word. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimXugle_3a48.html" title="User:JimXugle">JimXugle</a> 20:26GMT, 26 APR 2005

<li>(Please sign your comments by putting a ~~~~ at the end.) In Wikipedialand, "neologism" means "The word or phrase used is not well-established enough to merit a Wikipedia article." (See <a href="../../../g/v/f/WP%7EGVFD_9ddb.html" title="WP:GVFD">WP:GVFD</a>.) In the ordinary sense of the word, sure, there are lots of articles whose names are neologisms.

<li>The criteria for deletion generally point to the question of whether an article on the topic in question is <i>inherently</i> unencyclopedic, irrespective of content. A vanity page, for example, may never be encyclopedic even if the author manages to include 20 page of information about every detail of his life. A one-line article on a federal appellate judge (of which we have had a few), on the other hand, should clearly be kept because the topic is notable, and there is indeed potential for expansion. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> July 2, 2005 20:30 (UTC)</li>

<li>Now that the page has grown, I see that yes, people like writing songs which fixate on body parts. However, the lack of clear criteria for exclusion was leading to an open-ended list. I've clarified those criteria and removed some songs that failed to pass. If the list remains ill-defined, then it doesn't belong here, but if it can solidify into a clear list, then I maintain my position. —<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenFrantzDale_c7e5.html" title="User:BenFrantzDale">BenFrantzDale</a> 03:54, Apr 27, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>What, no Jim Stafford's "16 Little Red Noses and a Horse That Sweats?" Of course, the nature of this topic, as noted, is very plastic. You might as well do a comprehensive list of songs with cuss words in them, cross-referenced by severity of the swear. But then, when <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Dylan_8d40.html" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a> said "goddamn" in 1964, it was a lot more scandalous that Ludicris dropping f-bombs every other word in 2005.

<p>Patent nonsense. Not only is it an article about fringe original research, but at least one of its anonymous proponants has been using it as a platform to insert Time Cube nonsense into other sensible and useful articles like <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenwich_Mean_Time_c038.html" title="Greenwich Mean Time">Greenwich Mean Time</a>. Consider this image caption: "<i>The unique harmonicity of the 4-corner quadrant division proves the supremacy of the number four.</i>" <b>This is <i>not</i> encyclopaedic.</b> <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvertype_f1b1.html" title="User:Evertype">Evertype</a> 10:51, 2005 Apr 26 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> There have been many votes to keep with a clean up to better reflect Time Cube as an internet phenomenon and remove the "original research" in line with Wikipedia. I have attempted such a clean up which has significantly slimmed the article. Could anyone seeking a clean up of the article please review my version and edit or expand on it as necessary.

<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>Cleanup</b> I know many here simply want the page to be cleaned up, but I suggest those people read the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Talk%7ETime_Cube_Archive_4148.html" title="Talk:Time Cube/Archive">archived discussion</a>. There is someone who apparently has vast amounts of time on there hands, who will fight any attempted cleanup at all turns. This page has been edited away from a page about Gene Ray's Time Cube website into a troll for parody sites like CubicAO, and it will stay that way without considerable devoted attention from someone. I suggest that unless you personally are willing to cleanup and maintain the cleaned up page, that you vote for the practical choice under the circumstances. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheradenine_c92d.html" title="User:Cheradenine">Cheradenine</a> 16:11, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>The practical choice is to allow the article's NPOV to remain, and not make baseless accusations of auxiliary sites being parodies and other such prejudiced remarks. Maybe you're talking about the choice that is practical for censoring Truth and forcing Academian beliefs upon readers.<br />

<li>Reminds me of <a href="../../../s/o/l/Sollog.html" title="Sollog">Sollog</a>. We have no article for his "Temple of Hayah," but that is not nearly as discussed as this "time-cube" seems to be. As long as it's a fair article and not a fanboy piece or a hatchet job, <b>keep</b>.

<li>If you look at the (long) edit histories of this article and of <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_Ray_871d.html" title="Gene Ray">Gene Ray</a>, and the comments on the talk pages, you'll find that several editors share the suspicion that 211.28.*.* is the dynamically-assigned IP address range that Gene Ray himself uses. For the months prior to this article coming up for VFD (for the third time), many edits to these two articles have followed a pattern: Gene would edit the article from a 211.28.*.* IP address, and another editor would then either neutralize or revert the added content. Interestingly, it was Gene himself who removed the first VFD notice on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>-<a href="../../../f/e/b/February_1.html" title="February 1">02-01</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 23:55, 2005 Apr 27 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Uncle G, why is it that you are engaging in unfounded "ad hominem" attacks instead of addressing the actual content of the articles? As I have pointed out many times, I am not Gene Ray; and it seems to me that contrary to the conduct that should be adopted by a useful and productive Wikipedia user, you are intent on taking sides and fighting against users whom you dislike. This results in the quality of the actual content being overlooked and compromised. Again, you need to focus less on conspiracy theories against users such as myself, and more on the actual content of Wikipedia articles. 211.28.24.43 08:42, 2005 Apr 28 (according to history <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:33, 2005 Apr 28 (UTC))</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> as far as I can tell (reading he archived discussions etc.) 211.28.*.* is <b>not</b> Gene Ray, but rather the author of the parody/troll site <a href="http://www.cubicao.tk" class="external text" title="http://www.cubicao.tk" rel="nofollow">CubicAO</a>. Read any of the interviews with Gene Ray and this ought to be clear. Effectively this Wikipedia page has been overtaken by trolls who are using it to promote their own parody/troll site for their own amusement. Anyone who cares to read the discussion page and use the Wayback machine can trace the development of this particular trolling effort. I've attempted to clean up the article. Please edit or extend, or at the least drop a word of support for the edits into the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Talk%7ETime_Cube_3824.html" title="Talk:Time Cube">discussion page</a>.

<li>"started"? It has been going on for over a year.

Xe has, after all, been doing this (adding text which has to be neutralized, reverting other editors' changes to xyr own version with edit comments claiming it to be the "NPOV" one, accusing a wide range of other editors of "POV" and "ad hominem attacks" on talk pages) since at least January 2004 (where 211.28.*.* was even then commented upon in the VFD discussion).

<p>What is described here is some right wing ideology, which no doubt existed in Germany before 1945, but to do this under the title "Kultur" is utter nonsense. "Kultur" is simply German for "culture". This page should therefore be deleted.

<li><b>Move</b> to Kulturpolitik and öffentliches Kulturwesen in the age of nationalism in Germany. A small number of non-nazi era articles contained a link to this article. Two of them said "this is a German term meaning something between culture and civilization". However, this is not true. German has two distinct words, "Kultur" and "Zivilisation", just like English. Of course, different countries had different ideals of what "culture" should mean, but e.g. during the Weimar republic, Germany's understanding was not outside of the range of meanings in different English speaking countries at different times. <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebastianHelm_63db.html" title="User:SebastianHelm">Sebastian</a> <a href="../../../s/e/b/User_talk%7ESebastianHelm_c25a.html" title="User talk:SebastianHelm">(talk)</a> 23:39, 2005 Apr 26 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, maybe. I've found alot of lengthy essays by him on the web, but they all seem to be the same mess of anarchist buzzwords produced by millions of anarchists worldwide. Typical examples (loose translation)&#160;: (on dialectal materialism) 'As grave as this problem is, with a little reflection, anyone can see how many anarchist campaigns end up strongly influenced by marxist theory in the decisions taken by the writers of law.' or 'The Crisis or Capitalism' or 'This idea can be desguised as <i>Collaborationist Ideology</i>, but cannot infact disappear entirely.' For such creative free-thinkers, anarchists sure are devoid of original material.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway. It looks like he had a few books published in the early 70s and late 80s, but from what I can tell none of them are in print. I couldn't find a biography or anything. It is worth noting that some of his stuff seems to have been translated into French, German and English.</p>
<p>He sounds like one of a million anarchist pamphlet writers. I'll change my vote if anyone can find anything else notable about him. He did publish after all. But otherwise delete for being a non-notablist vanitarian unencyclopedicism. Kyle543 02:04, Apr 27, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think you were more lazy than you should be. The article didn't describe his notability, so questioning it with a significance-tag in february and a vfd now was very apropriate. I don't think it should be expected to do extensive research on the subject of an article to list it. If that were the case, at least I would be too lazy, and maybe even afraid for risking harse comments, to list almost anything.

<dd>Leiden is probably one of the best known universities in Europe, and a couple of hundred years before MIT was founded, Leiden was the place everyone traveled to learn the new things in science and medicine. (And no, I'm not a Leiden alumnus...). Anyway, this VfD is another sign we need better criteria for judging the notability of academics. We can't expect every scientist bio-stub to exhaustively explain that person's research, because then only experts would be able to even start such a biography. To some extent we have to put our trust in the internal notability criteria of academia itself, just as we do for sports or pop music. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 14:53, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Hardly. Please refrain from putting words in my mouth.

<li>Well, I'm missing something here - you accept citations are important, he was already in the top 300 most cited physicists when he was 37, he's published a number of papers with over 100 citations, yet you still say he's not above average? This seems blatantly obvious to me, and I genuinely want to know where the communication problem is. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 08:07, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is an encyclopedia, not a citations database. An encyclopedia article explains why the subject of the article is important and the work that they do, it doesn't merely throw statistics at the reader. If I wanted citation information I'd go to the ISI Web of Science. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 08:08, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But if you want statistics for a cricketer you can go to cricinfo, so should we should delete all cricketer's articles that don't explain the rules of cricket? This article needs attention, not deletion. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 09:25, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>For a cricketer, or any other sportsman, I can follow a link for their position that describes what that position does. But any article here that has nothing but statistics for a player I'd vote delete on too. What would be the equivalent in science for a <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shortstop.html" title="Shortstop">shortstop</a> or <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quarterback.html" title="Quarterback">quarterback</a>? There is no equivalent in science. Scientists aren't important because they play lead particle accelerator for the Leiden Leptons, they are important because of the specific research that they do. If we wish to assert that that Beenakker is more notable than the majority of his colleagues, then the article must provide a reason why, and that reason is what he is researching and what he has played a role in discovering or learning. In this article there is no mention of that at all. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 18:11, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, per <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a>. According to the article: <i>"In a 1997 study by the Institute for Scientific Information, Beenakker (at the time aged 37) rated in the top 300 most cited physicists of the previous 16 years."</i> And that was eight years ago. His <a href="http://www.ilorentz.org/beenakker/cv/cvengels/cvengels.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ilorentz.org/beenakker/cv/cvengels/cvengels.html" rel="nofollow">CV</a> with publications.

<li>He has probably advanced in the relative status by now, in case you didn't get that part, but if somebody bothers to write those 299 other biographies I see little harm in it (we may actually have quite a few of those already), or in articles on the 300 most cited researchers in other major disciplines. There is no reason why scientists should be Nobel laureates to be considered notable, while it is enough to have been payed by someone to publicly kick a ball around a lawn to qualify for a Wikipedia article. - <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 00:17, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<p>- Note: Could it be POSSIBLE that not all the SITH are covered in the COMICS? Where was Ajunta Pall? Where was Tuluk Hord? I've NEVER seen a mention of them in anything other than KOTOR I. How about Darth Sion, or Revan? Revan apparently defeated Mandalore. Mandalore is a well known character in the star wars universe, noted in comics, books, etc. He even started a new cult called Mandalorians, of which Boba Fett and Jango Fett's characters have taken ideas off. And yet, some how this Revan person comes along and destroys him just like that. Revan is ONLY a character in KOTOR.</p>
<p>I have also done a google search and nothing pointed to wikipedia when I looked up Konar Siosk-Baas. Why does the fact that one character exists that was not yet known by you affect you so? Searches never seem to pick up the name and it appears that one would have to be intentionally LOOKING for the specific Konar Siosk-Baas name to pick it up on wikipedia.</p>
<p>By point concluded; I do not think the requests are valid enough to warrent deleation of the page.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Note: Could it be POSSIBLE that not all the SITH are covered in the COMICS?"
<dl>
<dd>Of course. It just so happens that Konar Sios-Baask isn't covered anywhere. Because he doesn't exist.&#160;:)</dd>

<dd>"Revan apparently defeated Mandalore. Mandalore is a well known character in the star wars universe, noted in comics, books, etc. He even started a new cult called Mandalorians, of which Boba Fett and Jango Fett's characters have taken ideas off."
<dl>
<dd>Mandalore is the title given to the leader of the Mandalorians. There have been several throughout history. The particular one Revan killed was called Mandalore the Ultimate. There have also been Mandalores the First, Indomitable, and Resurrector, among others. Mandalore the Resurrector was the one who restarted the Mandalorian tradition after it was destroyed by the Jedi. This was the group to which Boba Fett belonged; Jango belonged to the aforementioned destroyed incarnation of the Mandalorians, which had existed since before the formation of the Old Republic.</dd>

</dd>
<dd>"And yet, some how this Revan person comes along and destroys him just like that. Revan is ONLY a character in KOTOR."
<dl>
<dd>Revan was one of the greatest military commanders and warriors in the history of the Jedi Order and one of the most powerful, feared, and intelligent Dark Lords of the Sith of all time. What is your point, and what has it to do with the nonexistent Konar Siosk-Baas?</dd>

</dd>
<dd>"Why does the fact that one character exists that was not yet known by you affect you so?"
<dl>
<dd>You are obviously unfamiliar with Star Wars. Not only does Konar Siosk-Baas not appear in any existing sources, his history as presented in his fraudulent article is completely and utterly impossible; only three named Sith Lords have appeared since the Battle of Endor, and he is not one of them.</dd>

<dd>"By point concluded; I do not think the requests are valid enough to warrent deleation of the page."

<dd>Sure they are, as he doesn't exist. Not in the comics, not in the video games, not in the books, not in the movies. Not anywhere. He's not a real Star Wars character. At all.&#160;:)

<p>- Sorry George Lucas (by this I imply you because you seem to know so much about Star Wars you clearly must be uncle George), but if you happen to know so much about Star Wars, (a) what is the point in looking it up on a Google search directory? (b) why is there a limit to the future of the Star Wars universe? (clearly time has no end, so just like time, Star Wars doesn't end after the war between the Alliance and the Yuuzhan Vong) (c) what's to say the Siosk-Baas family ended after the death of Vodo? Surely Vodo had parents. - Perhaps they had another child. (d) Jedi's are not one off's. Just like the Adam/Eve Theory, the jedi started, had babies and produced more jedi. Surely some surnames would have been kept (they don't just wipe their surnames because they've been used by their parents), so what's to say Konar isn't one of the descendants? (e) Why not wipe out the Aborigines because they're just as usless to you as the character Konar Siosk-Baas and you want to wipe him out?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Terribly sorry to disappoint, but I'm not really George Lucas. I tend to get that a lot, though. Must be the flannel. In any case, you seem to be confused about a few things (I'd never <i>dream</i> that you're the person who wrote that article, naturally), so I'll do my best to try and set you straight.</dd>
<dd>(a) I didn't need to check Google, as I already knew Konar doesn't exist.</dd>
<dd>(b) There is no limit to the future of Star Wars. There is a limit to the number of stories set in Star Wars. None of them currently involve a Konar Siosk-Baas. Sorry.</dd>
<dd>(c) Well, that's the thing, isn't it. You'll note that the article claims that Konar's species is half-human and half-Twi'lek. Now, not only are these two different species genetically incompatible, but I fail to see how a line known to consist only of Krevaaki could produce such an improbable half-breed.</dd>
<dd>(d) First of all, as I just said, neither of two species that Konar reputedly belongs to are the same species as Vodo and Bodo. Secondly, you seem to be forgetting a little thing called the "Jedi Purge." In case you're not familiar with it, that was when Darth Vader and his minions drove the Jedi to virtual extinction. Only a handful are known to have survived, and none of them were named Baas.</dd>
<dd>(e) What are you talking about?</dd>
<dd>In any case, your logic is deeply flawed, my friend. Konar Siosk-Baas does not currently exist anywhere in any Star Wars universe. You seem to be arguing that his article should be kept because one day he might. Sadly, not only can his history as it is given in the article never come to be because of a hilarious amount of continuity errors and ridiculously obvious fanfiction, neither can he, as LFL writers are forbidden to use fan creations in their works because of possible copyright infringement. In short: Luke Skywalker isn't dead. There are no stories set 88 ABY. The only Dark Lords of the Sith who rose to power after the Battle of Endor were Lady Lumiya, Lord Flint, and Carnor Jax. Krevaaki, humans, and Twi'leks are not genetically compatible. Konar Siosk-Baas doesn't exist. Sorry.&#160;:)

<p>"Luke Skywalker isn't dead." Ah. So I get it. Luke is an uber Jedi. He can't die because he is immortal. Damn! Why didn't they underline that in any of the scripts? We assume that Luke is human (natually because he not only looks human but they say that he is human), and all humans are mortal. So naturally, eventually Luke must die. And Konar's life is set after the death of Luke Skywalker. Yes, I know the dates are wrong and don't coincide with the fact, but they will be fixed in due course.</p>
<p>"Krevaaki, humans, and Twi'leks are not genetically compatible" Where was this stated? I have never read that they are not genetically compatible anywhere. Please provide a link or a story which states this and I will endeavour to read it.</p>
<p>"In any case, your logic is deeply flawed, my friend" No, you are not the emperor. So please desist in trying to sound like him.</p>
<p>"I didn't need to check Google, as I already knew Konar doesn't exist" Oh. So you've read every single starwars comic, book, played every video game, made a collection of all the action figures and wrote your own book about starwars because clearly you know so much about it. - How did you manage to pass school if you spent all the time it'd take to learn starwars off by heart while you were supposed to be attending classes?</p>
<p>"Only a handful are known to have survived, and none of them were named Baas" Again you are making assumptions. If so few survived, the Jedi probably died out soon after the purge.- Going by the logic of your logic</p>
<p>"I fail to see how a line known to consist only of Krevaaki could produce such an improbable half-breed." You ever heard of a thing called sex? People have it from time to time, and if appropriate procautions are not taken a baby is born. Say you had a great grand father who was completely black. He marries a white woman and has a child with her. The child [when old enough] marries a white man and has a child with him. And so on and so forth. Eventually the descendant has no visible black in him. In the case with Konar Siosk-Baas, the crustaceous Vodo's parents had another son, who married and had another child. That child married a Twi'lek, who had a child with a human, and so on a so forth. Eventually the descendant is no longer crustacean, but is a cross-between Twi-lek and Human. Also note that the descendant has had many thousands of years to change in form, as Vodo Siosk-Baas is evidently much much older that his descendant, Konar.</p>
<p>- To conclude, I'm still missing the proof that this is fan fiction, and I don't accept your 'so called' knowledge of the Star Wars universe as proof. If I thought you were right, I would obviously support you. But as it is, you still haven't properly backed up your arguments, other than convinced me that the dates are chronologically wrong which I am already aware of. They will be fixed in due course, but until the real proof comes (and I mean, not what your opinion on the matter is), this character will remain.</p>

<dd>Hey 203.61.240.131/203.61.243.164 while you are at it mind explaining why you added a bunch of fan fiction (Brotherhood of Dark Jedi, Sons of Sadow) to the Sith Article at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sith&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=12835518" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sith&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=12835518" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sith&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=12835518</a> that someone had the unfortunate task of cleaning up and reverting?

<dl>
<dd>"Ah. So I get it. Luke is an uber Jedi."
<dl>
<dd>Yup.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"He can't die because he is immortal."
<dl>
<dd>Nope. Don't be silly.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"We assume that Luke is human (natually because he not only looks human but they say that he is human), and all humans are mortal. So naturally, eventually Luke must die."
<dl>
<dd>Now you're getting it. Key word: <i>eventually</i>. As of now—AKA this moment—AKA April 30, 2005—Luke Skywalker hasn't died in any canonical Star Wars story.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"I have never read that they are not genetically compatible anywhere."
<dl>
<dd>Use some common sense. They're entirely different species.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"Please provide a link or a story which states this and I will endeavour to read it."
<dl>
<dd>Now there's an idea. Please provide a link or a story which states that Konar Siosk-Baas exists and I'll concede. If you are unable to provide said link or story, I wholly expect the concession to be yours.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"No, you are not the emperor. So please desist in trying to sound like him."
<dl>
<dd>Aw, shucks, I can't have any fun.&#160;:(</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"Oh. So you've read every single starwars comic, book, played every video game, made a collection of all the action figures and wrote your own book about starwars because clearly you know so much about it."
<dl>
<dd>I'm moderately certain I never made such a claim, but if you believe it, why don't you concede?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"How did you manage to pass school if you spent all the time it'd take to learn starwars off by heart while you were supposed to be attending classes?"
<dl>
<dd>I didn't inhale.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"Again you are making assumptions. If so few survived, the Jedi probably died out soon after the purge.- Going by the logic of your logic"
<dl>
<dd>Once again, you prove your lack of familiarity with the Star Wars Universe, my friend. Luke Skywalker founded a new Jedi Order after the final death of the Emperor. It seems like you're trying to say the Jedi who survived the Purge rebuilt their order. That is not so; it was all Luke. "When I am gone, the last of the Jedi will you be." Not quite, but, for all intents and purposes, correct.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"You ever heard of a thing called sex? People have it from time to time, and if appropriate procautions are not taken a baby is born."
<dl>
<dd>Gee, now you're just making stuff up.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"Say you had a great grand father who was completely black. He marries a white woman and has a child with her. The child [when old enough] marries a white man and has a child with him. And so on and so forth. Eventually the descendant has no visible black in him."
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, except, oh, gee, look at that: <i>they're all the same species</i>. Tell me what would happen if that black great-grandfather mated with a dolphin and you may have something.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"In the case with Konar Siosk-Baas, the crustaceous Vodo's parents had another son, who married and had another child. That child married a Twi'lek, who had a child with a human, and so on a so forth. Eventually the descendant is no longer crustacean, but is a cross-between Twi-lek and Human."
<dl>
<dd>Please at least pretend to prove it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"To conclude, I'm still missing the proof that this is fan fiction…"
<dl>
<dd>To conclude, I'm still missing the proof that this isn't fanfiction.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>"…and I don't accept your 'so called' knowledge of the Star Wars universe as proof."</p>
<dl>

<dl>

<dd>"If I thought you were right, I would obviously support you."

<dd>Obviously.&#160;:)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"But as it is, you still haven't properly backed up your arguments, other than convinced me that the dates are chronologically wrong which I am already aware of."
<dl>
<dd>I can't present a nonpresence. Give me ONE canonical source that states Konar Siosk-Baas exists in the Star Wars Universe as the character presented in the article, and I will concede. Prove me wrong. <i>Please.</i>&#160;:)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"They will be fixed in due course, but until the real proof comes (and I mean, not what your opinion on the matter is), this character will remain."
<dl>
<dd>You can't prove it, can you? I mean, I know you can't, because he doesn't exist, but <i>you</i> do know you can't, right?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Look, I have nothing against fanfiction (good fanfiction, at least), but it's not a part of Star Wars canon, and, as such, doesn't belong here. Prove Konar is canon, or concede.

<li>Cool. Iranian = Modern Persian. That article already contains an entry for Persian. That entry contains the same numbers as this list, with very slight differences - Transliteration error or regional/temporal variation? The big list <a href="http://www.zompist.com/euro.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.zompist.com/euro.htm" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> contains several closely related dialect variations, including Farsi and Tati. Farsi is described in sources as "the Official language of Iran", and another name for Persian. Actually, I think Farsi is the official and self-identified name for Farsi/Persian/Iranian - I believe that, if you asked someone from Iran, they would tell you that they spoke Farsi.... Yes, the wiki entry for <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_language.html" title="Persian language">Persian language</a> confirms this.</li>
<li>So... these Iranian numbers are a dialect of Persian/Farsi - a meaningfully different dialect or simply a transliteration error? Without a source for the info, we have no way of knowing. So I say <b>delete</b> this info as redundant and unsourced and <b>redirect</b> the link to <a href="../../../n/u/m/Numbers_in_various_languages.html" title="Numbers in various languages">Numbers in various languages</a> so future efforts/searches are coordinated with that list. No harm is done by deleting this unsourced info, as "Numbers in various languages" already contains an entry for Persian. - <a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPioneer-12_bc3d.html" title="User:Pioneer-12">Pioneer-12</a> 15:00, 1 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I'm am a left-wing activist in Portugal and I've never heard about such things ... The photo doesn's seem to had been taken in the 1940's. Google reports only 3 results for "Samuele de Gaunt" and are all related to this article. This seems like a vanity page with a big background story. Samuele de Gaunt is not an hero to the portuguese left-wing, no one has heard about Samuele de Gaunt! Actually that is not a Portuguese name. If you try to read the story you will find it way too silly.</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Note- Living in Sale, I have viewed a commemorative plaque to de Gaunt in the town hall, which I am sure the above posters have not witnessed. Samuele de Gaunt was not as famous as mentioned in the article, which accounts for his relatively low to zero documentation on the internet. However, he did exist nonethelss and was both a folk guitarist and left-wing political activist.</li>

<p>My fellow posters. As a U.S student of Archaeology at Coimbra University I have recently come across this article and assumed that it was utterly fictional. However on a visit to the Municipal Graveyard or the túmulo do país on Ladeira das Alpenduradas I found the graves mentioned in the article. They seem in first class condition and I suspect they are well cared for. Whether this means the entire story is authentic is another matter.</p>

<p>Having been informed of this page by several surprised Wikipedia users, I have to confirm that Samuele de Gaunt was indeed a Portuguese folk singer; I was unaware of many (if any) left-wing acitivities on his part, but his talents as a bard were formidable and not to be trifled with. To delete this page (despite any posible inaccuracies therein) is a travesty and one which I consider an unforgivable breach of Wikipedia's mission. My own experiences of de Gaunt during his all-too-brief period in Sale were quite a revelation, and it will be a sad loss if others are deprived of the chance to grasp at some small sample of his beauteous musical talents.</p>

<p>Why on earth would anyone want to write a 'vanity' article, as Dr. White so rightly says, about a dead, little known Portuguese left wing political activist? Surely we should be encouraging this article? It recognises the integrity and bravery of someone who was, undoubtedly, a very fine man. Do we want to lose this small piece of Samuele de Gaunt? It is our only link to him now, apart from his remaining poetry. He is clearly a hero, and one who deserves to be remembered in any way that we can. Also, as a Sale resident, I can confirm the existence of the plaque to de Gaunt's memory. I suggest that anyone who doubts the truth of this statement comes to Sale. Or do they not wish to be proven wrong? Especially as phots seem to copy so badly onto this page "<b>The photo doesn's seem to had been taken in the 1940's</b>" (again, the first poster). As to his name not being portuguese, could not his parents have been immigrants, or maybe even only one parent? We are not considering all of the possibilities here. Thank you. User:81.155.199.53</p>

<dd>This is where, once again, we want you to do this: <b>PROVE IT.</b> Show us articles, show us books, show us poetry, show us stuff that will try to convince us. It is not our job to do YOUR research. You claim to know all of these facts, but nothing to show proof to back those claims up. Plus, as mentioned earlier, if he was a great man that was valued by the Portugese people, he will be on the Portugese version of Wikipedia, but he is not. That, to me, brings me a clear sign that he is probably not notable. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(talk)</a> 21:50, 5 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Lucky,</b> how can we have any idea whether or not the "genuine portuguese leftist" is, in fact, a genuine portuguese leftist? You seem to take their word for it with less evidence than you do for the supporters of Samuele de Gaunt. This, to me, suggests that you are not impartial.

<li>I think the page expounding his theories is not encyclopaedic. It is patent nonsense, pseudo-scientific babble, and the entire article is so POV I think it irredeemable. I said nothing about Gene Ray's own page. With regard to the difference between having a feature article in the <i>Times</i> and being mentioned in it, well, I guess what you're telling us is that you're a begrudger.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Non-notable <b>self-advertising</b>. Come on people, he wrote an encyclopedia article about himself and is the only major contributor. This is the definition of vanity that wikipedia so likes to get rid of. Wikipedia should not be used as a place that you show to your prospective employers how important you are.

<li><b>Keep</b> -- he's done a lot more of note in the real world than most Wikipedians. Sure, he created the article himself, but readily admits to his lack of good judgement at the time.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Everson is a very large figure in the Unicode world, and deserves an encyclopaedic entry; that its content may need to be made less self-promotional is a different issue altogether.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article needs some editing IMHO, it has too many links (maybe Wikipedia needs some kind of "autolink" mechanism to be triggered at the discretion of readers), but this is far from a vanity page. Michael Everson's accomplishments are real, and valuable, and his place in Wikipedia is well-deserved. -- Non-registered user Javier Candeira, <a href="http://barrapunto.com/" class="external free" title="http://barrapunto.com/" rel="nofollow">http://barrapunto.com/</a></li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The vanity disgusts me. I thought wikipedia was around not for vanity but for information. The information present in this entry is of negligible value. His aforementioned "accomplishments" are little more than what one might simply call a "job".-- thelark</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I agree with thelark. It sounds roughly like a job. Nothing outstanding enough for your own page in a respectable encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../j/o/b/User%7EJobeus_1c9a.html" title="User:Jobeus">jobeus</a></li>
<li>I don't think that it is a vanity page. I'm not all that vain. I didn't put the link to me in the Wikipedia; another Wikipedian did. Months later I added in text from the short bio I keep on my website. I was unaware of Wikipedia's policy at that time, but invited people to make sure that it was verifiable and neutral. I believe that it is. I provided some text for an article which has since been edited by others and judged by them to be useful and appropriate. The "parody" you mention is base and offensive, and written by someone who has a lot of hate and a lot of problems, it would appear. All I try to do is make sure that Unicode has all the writing systems of the world in it, so people can use their writing systems on computers. This year I had a wonderful experience, meeting gentle and intelligent people in Bali who helped me to encode their script. That was a pleasure, and I am glad that I was able to help the Balinese people. I am proud of my contributions. I don't think that is "vanity". <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEvertype_f1b1.html" title="User:Evertype">Evertype</a> 16:27, 2005 Apr 27 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't know anything about the field to judge what makes someone notable within it, though a NY Times article lends some weight to that judgment. I do want to echo the concerns voiced above regarding Wikipedians creating or editing pages about them. I would like to see an absolute ban on such a practice, as it not only necessarily constitutes original research (you don't exactly learn about yourself from other sources) but strikes me as heavily contrary to the objective spirit of this project.

<li>First of all, you're misinterpreting what I said. I didn't say anything about having <u>authority</u>. Secondly, I didn't say that the English VfD should be used to "interfere" in other language versions. What I mean is that it makes perfect sense to redirect the page in other languages <i><u>if</u></i> we redirect it in the English version, because the rules of the different language versions have to be consistent with each other. What's the purpose of redirecting the page on the English version if you don't do the same on other languages? The Wikipedia rules should be the same for all languages. Then I didn't say anything about <u>necessarily</u> deleting the page. I voted for redirecting it. And then, why should a Wikipedia user go through the deletion policy if there is no VfD and if you don't want to delete it anyway? If you make a redirect that makes sense, why should anyone put a VfD template on the page? That's ridiculous. I said <u>redirect</u>, not delete. And I said <u>if</u>, and only if.

<li><b>Keep</b> Everson's vanity is well known, nevertheless he is worthy of an entry --Peterkirk 00:02, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete vanity</b> Who is this Everson? A guy that works on ISO committees? So? How many anonymous contributors to ISO standards are there? How many other people are on his committee? And he believes he is entitled to write his own hagiography? Who says his contributions are so great? I understand he writes a lot but how original is it? So he got his 5 minutes celebrity in a few articles and a prize... Where are the Wikipedia of the other recipients of this award? Remove his vanity page. Leave the many links he has already put on Wikipedia to his own site since there seems to me valuable info there. Wikipedia must be objective and absolutely refrain from being a way to exhibit and advertise one's oversize ego.</li>
<li><b>Keep (reluctantly)</b>. I find Everson's vanity very unseemly, but his work is borderline notable. The article is too long for his relatively modest achievements, and really should be paired down. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> 05:38, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I find no evidence that this is vanity, and anyway, Wikipedia isn't paper, after all. It is slightly notable. Unless you provide me more evidence it is vanity, I will vote to keep. -- <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a> 05:46, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. "I find no evidence that this is vanity repeats <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatalinasmpf_1971.html" title="User:Natalinasmpf">Natalinasmpf</a>", let him consider the definition of vanity: " An inflation of mind upon slight grounds; empty pride inspired by an overweening conceit of one's personal attainments or decorations; an excessive desire for notice or approval; pride; ostentation; conceit." Everson entry is clearl vanity, an excessive conceit of one's own importance. Let him have a user page (he of course already has) and links to his site in the appropriate pages, but he clearly does not merit his own entry on its own written by him (whether objective or not, although I don't see anything in his autohagiographic entry that analyzes his successes and foibles).</li>
<li>I agree with the "How many anonymous contributors to ISO standards are there?" question. Michael Everson is not the only important member of a standardization group out there. There are a lot of members, employees or workers of the Unicode Consortium or International Standardization Organization, "important" or not, who don't have a main-<a href="../../../n/a/m/Namespace.html" title="Namespace">namespace</a> article on Wikipedia. 2004-12-29T22:45Z 17:38, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: this is a simple type of chocolate-coloured candy or pastry sold in Sweden that has commonly been called <i>negerboll</i>, very literally "negro ball" ("ball" as in something round, nothing else). This has been the object of some public controversy, involving the Ombudsman against Discrimination, and a café in southern Sweden was recently actually sued over offering <i>negerbollar</i> and forced to change the name. People who find it particularly important to demonstrate their political <i>in</i>correctness make a point of ordering "negro balls" with their coffee, but for the most part the transition to the new terminology, <i>chokladboll</i> ("chocolate ball"), has been smooth and painless. I can't really think of a good way to make an encyclopedia article out of this. In any case, the controversy, which may be mildly interesting in some way, is over the word, not the thing in itself, and it is over the N-word, not the Ch-word, so like with <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigger.html" title="Nigger">N****r</a>, any article about <i>that</i> issue should probably be under that title. Seen purely as a part of Swedish cuisine, it seems doubtful if it is interesting enough for an article of its own, but could possibly be mentioned in an article on Swedish pastry or candy, if one were to be written. -- <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 01:35, 27 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Neologism? It is neither meaningless as it is referenced all over Google. It also has been a term that's been in use since at least 2001 well before many other Wikipedia entries (e.g. podcasting ). Yes it does seem to revolve around usage at the Inquirer, but so what? Even if you do 'hate the Inquirer' that should not preclude it from being a valid entry. I think entries are valid if the usage of the word is widespread enough ( search Google and see ) and it does not exist in Wikipedia. The sceanario was that an Inquirer article came up on Google News where i read it and then couldn't find ANY kind of explanation ( even if it was to say that there was NO definitive an explanation ). One of the first places I tried was wikipedia. Currently if someone else conducts this same search they will come across this entry and at least had <b>some knowledge</b> of what the word mean't and the possible reasons( When i first read the article I didn't even know that Vole=Microsoft! ). If this entry is deleted then someone will either give up or waste a lot of time trying to find out ( as I did ). Even if a term is disparaging the term itself should be included if it's in use ( e.g. fairy a male homosexual ( <a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=fairy&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" class="external free" title="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=fairy&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=fairy&amp;x=0&amp;y=0</a> )). The article is not POV in the sense that it is reporting a usage and not condoning it or promoting it. Note that the explanation of the term was in quotes and was said to be from a Message Board so it is not speaking with 'The Authority of Wikipedia'. Also if this is a nonce term then why has it been used since 2001 that's getting on for four years! Additionally it's all very well to say that the word is used on special occasions ( yes i went to M-W to figure out what nonce mean't! )but it is everywhere on Google and even if a lot of the links are to Inquirer a lot are NOT - the word seems to have been picked up by other writers. Also who cares if it is a special occasion surely that should not preclude it from an entry. I guess i feel quite strongly about this because there i was, a user on the Internet - i came across a term and i COULDN'T find out what it mean't. My entry into wikipedia was to increase everybody's knowledge ( and not to Bash Microsoft ). As for 'copyvio' on talk page - i could instead paraphrase or get permissions - it is not a show stopper - however i do think it would be nice for people to get some discussion on etymology.&#160;:-&gt;

<li>Let's put it this way: Assume somebody described someone with a long neck and called her "giraffe". Now assume you didn't know what it meant. You go to the Wikipedia article about <a href="../../../g/i/r/Giraffe.html" title="Giraffe">giraffe</a> and read "Giraffes are famous for their long necks." Voilà! Same with <a href="../../../v/o/l/Vole.html" title="Vole">vole</a>. The article already says "Unlike most rodents, voles' teeth grow continuously." If you feel this is not enough, just expand this statement so it sufficiently explains why people use "vole" in the meaning you quote. — <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebastianHelm_63db.html" title="User:SebastianHelm">Sebastian</a> <a href="../../../s/e/b/User_talk%7ESebastianHelm_c25a.html" title="User talk:SebastianHelm">(talk)</a> 02:46, 2005 Apr 28 (UTC) (PS: Please don't go ahead and create an article [[giraffe (insult)]] now.) &#160;;-)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>OK I take it that the article is no longer being considered for deletion? I hope so! We have two outstanding issues of contention if the article is kept then.</li>
</ul>
<p>1.) The quote that shows why the term was used.</p>
<p>(oh bugger - just read <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebastianHelm_63db.html" title="User:SebastianHelm">Sebastian</a> said to go ahead and explain why people use vole - BEFORE i wrote all this&#160;!!! Sorry. I will leave it in anyway since it is a clarification of my view even if it may be redundant now! Although having said that i think that it's not the Vole article that needs to be updated it should be this article since we are highlighting this key feature of the Vole as it relates to the nickname (see below))</p>
<dl>
<dd>I understand that we are trying to reach a point where the article is still illuminating but is not gratuitously negative to Microsoft since wikipedia needs to protect it's neutral nature and not be seen as being hijaked by Anti-Microsoft 'crusaders'. You are trying to protect wikipedia's integrity and that is the right thing to do. I think that the use of the giraffe to illustrate the point is fair as far as *that* animal and *that* explanation goes and also the *key point* that the girl is described with a long neck to start with. However i wasn't looking into the nickname of Vole thinking to myself that "...this is being used to describe a voracious corporation that devours everything continuously now let's look up what vole means". I guess if i was thinking that then i would may have understood the possible reason for vole as nickname without it needing to be illustrated. Also I'm not sure that voles are famous for having teeth that continuously grow and if they are famous for it I certainly had no idea and neither does *everyone* else. So now it's a matter of what we leave out without assuming knowledge on the part of the person reading ( assumption of knowledge especially where that assumption is not declared is extremley frustrating for people seeking knowledge ). I think that the issue revolves around highlighting the nature of teeth and the <b>key to the metaphor</b>: the requirement to eat continously ( whether that is true or not ). That is the key i think: the need to eat continously. So i think perhaps the bone of contention that is left that maybe considered gratuitous ( even though it is in quotes! ) is: "...Microsoft can only survive by acquiring/stifling the competition." I have no objection to removing this and merely paraphrasing the quote and removing the quotation marks.</dd>

<li>Response:</li>
</ul>
<p>Please can someone explain the meaning of unverifiable here. If it relates to what is the truth behind the REASON for the application of the term then I would agree that is not verfiable. What is verifiable, however, is that the term IS used to reference Microsoft. It is verifiable that the term did turn up in what i consider to be a mainstream news outlet ( google news ) and i can verify (;-&gt;) that i was completley clueless for quite a while as to what the term was even referring to. I think even on that point alone the term deserves inclusion in wikipedia, whose purpose is, I believe, to provide non biased ( as far as possible ) knowledge. I did not coin the phrase I came across it - i had no knowledge - i went to wikipedia to seek knowledge - it was not there and that was when i decided to pin down this term as far as possible, create a wikipedia article and help others like myself. As for the reason the term was applied, I feel that to level verifiability at etymology would be unfair as a reasoned speculation can be more helpful than none at all. Where would we be without the idea of putting forward a theory? There are lots of facts in this world that are without a verifiable explanation but there are theories to explain these facts and these theories are usually included when discussing the facts.</p>
<p>As for neologism please see my previous comments ( above ) regarding the application of neologism to this article.</p>
<p>As for unenyclopedic can someone explain which definition we are using. I just went to www.m-w.com and looked up encyclopedia. It says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>encyclopedia: "...a work that contains information on all branches of knowledge or treats comprehensively a particular branch of knowledge usually in articles arranged alphabetically often by subject." - ok well under this definition I cannot see that this entry qualifies as unenyclopedic any more than many other 'approved' wikipedia articles.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I am trying to address each point as they are put forward - i can see that another one was editorial. Again i will have to use www.m-w.com to discover the definition ( rather than just the vauge idea that i have&#160;;-&gt; ).</p>
<dl>
<dd>editorial:"a newspaper or magazine article that gives the opinions of the editors or publishers." I think this has been an issue since the term seems to have originated with The Inquirer. I think the key point here is *opinion*. It is not The Inquirer's opinion that Microsoft is 'The Vole' it is simply a fact that they nicknamed them that. If i say I am going to call IBM 'Diggy Diggy Dog' that is not really my opinion it is a fact. If I say that IBM ARE Diggy Diggy Dogs that is my ( nonsensical ) opinion. I don't think we can really say that the Inquirer is of the opinion that Microsoft is a vole, it is merely their nickname for them and as such it is a fact. So although it may seem editorial at first glance I don't think that applying editorial to the entry is applicable here.</dd>

<li>Why not mention this nickname somewhere near the bottom of the Microsoft article in some sort of errata section?

<p>In <a href="../../../a/r/c/Architecture.html" title="Architecture">architecture</a>, this term is simply the plural of the German translation of "new building" and is therefore non-encyclopedic (for en.Wikipedia). In English, the term is only of interest in connection with the band <a href="../../../e/i/n/Einst%C3%BCrzende_Neubauten_afa7.html" title="Einstürzende Neubauten">Einstürzende Neubauten</a>, which understands this term in a specific way, based on one historic incident of a collapsing new building. It may make sense to change this article to a redirect to the band since the statement that it is an architectural term is reiterated by some of their fan websites and blogs.</p>
<p>The term is briefly mentioned in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_German_expressions_in_English_f9de.html" title="List of German expressions in English">List of German expressions in English</a>. For more details and sources see <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_German_expressions_in_English_dff4.html" title="Talk:List of German expressions in English">Talk:List of German expressions in English</a>. See also <a href="../../../../de/n/e/u/Neubau.html" class="extiw" title="de:Neubau">de:Neubau</a>.</p>
<p>Having "Neubauten" as the title is particularly non-encyclopedic, since this is the plural of the word. (Moreover, this clashes with the text, which describes it as singular.)</p>
<p>The page creator has tried to partially address my concerns by including some of my text from his talk page, but the article still contains the claim "Colloquially it has been used in particular to denote functionalist buildings" which is not backed up by any reliable source or the German Wikipedia article. — <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebastianHelm_63db.html" title="User:SebastianHelm">Sebastian</a> <a href="../../../s/e/b/User_talk%7ESebastianHelm_c25a.html" title="User talk:SebastianHelm">(talk)</a> 22:43, 2005 Apr 26 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The perception amongst English speaking fans of the band is that the term is used as described by the band.

<li>I'm not entirely familiar with the workings of Wiktionary, but the main page says: <i>This is the English Wiktionary: it aims to describe all words of all languages, with definitions and descriptions in English only.</i> And I am unable to find <i>Neubau</i> or <i>Neubauten</i> in either the English or the German Wiktionary. In any case, I don't think Neubauten should be described on the <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neubau.html" title="Neubau">Neubau</a> page, as it is merely a dicdef. <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neubau.html" title="Neubau">Neubau</a> should probably disambiguate to other locations of that name. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartg76_fbde.html" title="User:Martg76">Martg76</a> 08:32, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>Ooops, you're right, it's the German Wikipedia where i found it. You're also right about "all languages". So it could be moved there. I would only like to weigh in that it may not be a <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lexeme.html" title="Lexeme">lexeme</a>. Would you write "new building" in a dictionary? German only superficially appears to have more lexemes because of a different spelling convention. (It's a mostly arbitrary decision if you spell <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compound_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Compound (linguistics)">compounds</a> with space (like "science fiction"), hyphen, or together (like "database").) German just happens to favour spelling compounds together. There is no limit for such compounds. Trying to keep all German compounds in Wiktionary would be like drying the ocean with a bucket. Wiktionary needs to draw a line somewhere. I don't work on Wiktionary, either, so i don't know their standards. The decision if "Neubau" makes the bar should be made by German contributors to Wiktionary. — <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebastianHelm_63db.html" title="User:SebastianHelm">Sebastian</a> <a href="../../../s/e/b/User_talk%7ESebastianHelm_c25a.html" title="User talk:SebastianHelm">(talk)</a> 07:19, 2005 Apr 29 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>The article does not say Jesus rose from the dead. It says "According to Christian belief, and the New Testament, Jesus was raised from the dead on the third day after his crucifixion..." It is easy to verify that the New Testament does say this, in Matthew 28:6-7, Mark 16:9, Luke 24:6, and John 20:18 to name four, and it is easy to verify that it is a tenet of Christian belief; the <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicene_Creed_e8a2.html" title="Nicene Creed">Nicene Creed</a> says "and he rose on the third day according to the Scriptures." It is article IV of the XXXIX Articles of Faith of the Church of England: "Christ did truly arise from death." So what the article says is easily verifiable. The same is true of the virgin birth. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 11:26, 1 May 2005 (UTC)
