<h2><span class="mw-headline">Gaming Improvement Drive</span></h2>
<p>I've tried out with a Gaming Improvement Drive (which I really think should be renamed... although I've renamed it way too many times I think o.o;). Basically, it's for non-stub gaming articles, to give them a better chance at improving to an FA status. -- <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> 07:17, August 8, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I also like the chronological order. It's also easier to maintain the expiring dates when all the nominations of the same day are close to each other.

<dd>The participation on Lhasa was miserable, and there was not much to be done on the Napoleonic Wars. The main collaboration has just had an experiment with two collaborations which failed. There are numerous smaller collaborations which need support badly, and lots of themes which need a collaboration (anniversaries, countries, social sciences, Europe...). I am against two collaborations.--<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 21:02, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I agree with <a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> here, given that most of the voting appears to be based on the idea that the vote is saying "I agree that someone else should do something about this article." <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallocks_48fe.html" title="User:Mallocks">Mallocks</a> 21:46, 14 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm probably guilty of a few "I agree that someone else should do something about this article" votes. In my case—but I bet this generalizes—they are a product of someone (Fenice, I believe, but apologize in advance if I've mis-remembered) hitting other project pages and actively soliciting people to vote here. So I come and vote; that doesn't mean I have any particular interest in participating in this project. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 21:35, August 15, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I believe that no matter where the votes come from, only a certain percentage of voters really participates during the project week. And some may have a look, even research some but can't find anything they want to contribute. I don't think there is anything wrong with people voting and not contributing. This will happen no matter what we do. You cannot force people to contribute. People just may have other plans during the project week that they knew nothing about when they signed up. We also have many newbies who just leave again or are no longer interested in this project once they get more involved in Wikipedia. (They may remember the COTWs once they have had their first edit war.) The important votes are those of the regulars around here who contribute to several different COTWs and in addition to that, especially the IDRIVE needs to attract experts on the subject, because we are working on a different level than the main COTW. Getting help from experts is the main reason why I post messgaes on places where I believe I might reach experts. Also, I have spread some infos on project-pages saying "vote if you want this article to be improved" which seems to provoke exactly the misunderstanding Jmabel is talking about. I won't use that wording any more. All in all, a higher number of voters will on average probably result in a higher number o participants. --<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 22:26, 15 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Location of templates</span></h2>
<p>Hi, based on the discussion at <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_locations_0e4c.html" title="Wikipedia:Template locations">Wikipedia:Template locations</a> it seems clear that the community generally prefers that templates related to internal efforts such as this one, which are "meta" information and not meaningful to readers, be placed on the talk page of the article instead of the article itself. In particular, this view prevailed with respect to the <a href="../../../c/o/t/Template%7ECOTW_e39a.html" title="Template:COTW">Template:COTW</a> associated with a parallel project. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 20:12, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>I have restored this discussion, which was prematurely archived minutes after I posted, and copied the comment below from my talk page.</i> --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 20:36, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That is all very nice, but our templates are not talk-page templates, they have a special design. The templates belong on the article page of the nomination and should be removed when the nomination fails. Your wording the <i>community generally prefers...</i> is false. The community consists of thousands of editors who obviously were not interested enough in these <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullying.html" title="Bullying">bullying</a> attempts to even voice an opinion on the page you set up.--<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 20:16, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Having a special design does not exempt this template from the general principle that meta-templates belong on talk pages. I did not set up the page in question, nor do I think it constituted "bullying", certainly not any more so than the attempt at suppressing discussion here. I believe that the community does generally prefer this, and that the comments are a representative sample of those editors who would take an interest in this particular issue. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 20:36, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Michael, this is not a meta template. The page you cite is a text-book example of bullying: a small group is trying to force nonsensical rules upon others in order to annoy them. Maybe you believe the community believes this and that, the problem is the community does not care what you believe. It clearly has not stated an opinion on your ideas.--<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 20:40, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Why is it not a meta-template? It refers to an internal Wikipedia project, rather than providing encyclopedic information about the topic of the article. In fact, unlike some templates used in case of content disputes, the template has zero bearing on the content of the article. That's a classic example of a meta-template. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 20:55, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is ridiculous. I can see precisely no reason why these templates should go on the article page. Why should this be an exception to the rules of the rest of the encyclopedia? The only reason you have presented is that they have a special design. I fail entirely to grasp this concept. Could you lay out exactly why you think these templates are special? <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmoddy_2381.html" title="User:Smoddy">[[smoddy]]</a> 20:58, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I have explained that numerous times. Now, Smoddy, why exactly are you so keen on having a bullying rant here. That is the question that is really interesting and would get us further. Do you not have anything else to do? Why on earth would you want to go out and annoy other users for no particular benefit whatsoever. Aren't you embarrassed?--<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 21:06, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I don't see the numerous times. All I can see is you accusing users who are making good-faith comments of bullying. I am not trying to annoy you. I am merely following up on Michael's request for other people to have a look. Incidentally, this seems to me to be an excellent place for this discussion, contrary to your comment on my talk: it prevents fragmentation. I repeat my request, please tell me why the templates should be on the main pages. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmoddy_2381.html" title="User:Smoddy">[[smoddy]]</a> 21:15, 16 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, are you planning to limit your edit-warring to "good-faith" comments on talk-pages then? Hm? Were you planning that? Hm? No. You have seen Michaels advertisement for an edit-war on the village pump and went straight for it and joined in. You probably do this every night to bully some user or destroy some project that has nothing to do with your template-craze whatsoever. You are probably going to go way beyond so called good-faith comments. I have taken your message, and I will leave. We have been through this crap before. However, as I recommended to Michael: the aggression level you are showing is not normal and you should get counselling. Bullying should not be the problem of the victim. I can leave. Your problem will last if you do not get it treated. Also, please have the decency of taking over my work here, it is roughly 50 to a 100 edits a day, which Michael and you can share. --<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 21:26, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is quite clearly the same as the COTW template and should appear on the talk page. COTW received 29 votes that it should appear on the talk page and only 11 for appearing in the article (one of which, I note, was Fenice). Surely that shows a community-favoured position? <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 21:20, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Violetriga, decency is an alternative. Just to inform you, not that I think you'd consider that. Read the talk page before you respond. It has been said before that the community consists of thousands of people who have not supported your bullying attempts. No this page is not a policy or anything that you could seriously base your pack attack on me. Are you never embarrassed of behaving like scum?--<a href="../../../f/e/n/User%7EFenice_a2a5.html" title="User:Fenice">Fenice</a> 21:26, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Given the arguments against having meta-templates on article pages, that offer is more a concession than a compromise.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The New Article Improvement Drive</span></h2>
<p>Since I'm in charge again, I'd like to change the name of this project back to the Article Improvement Drive. I would keep all the nomination system changes from Maurreen and Fenice in place - I just want to change the name back. AID always seemed more accurate and succinct than This Weeks Improvement Drive, which I always called the TWID. If anyone has a reasonable objection to me doing this, please tell me. If no good reasons are raised, this becomes the New Article Improvement Drive (AID) as of Sunday. -<a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELitefantastic_94c2.html" title="User:Litefantastic">Litefantastic</a> 16:42, 17 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I updated the expiring date on <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johann_Gutenberg_5481.html" title="Johann Gutenberg">Johann Gutenberg</a>, but didn't realize that the nomination had already expired.

<p>I changed the color scheme to reflect the rollover back to the AID name, and while I'd actually like to thank whoever changed the background color to purple because the powder blue was too painful to look at, I am seriously frustrated with the person/people who just reverted back to the last template versions before I changed things. It isn't so much a blatant disregard for my work - because even though it took an hour, I respect that not everyone will like it - but the fact the some of these still said "This weeks improvement drive"! You didn't <i>change anything</i>! You just reverted back!

<p>The list includes many failed noms, past winners, and some that as near as I can tell, though tagged, never made it to the project page (or were not archived), such as my hometown: <a href="../../../t/a/c/Tacoma%2C_Washington_361e.html" title="Tacoma, Washington">Tacoma, Washington</a>.

<dd>Editors here vote on articles as part of a process to select an article they feel needs improvement. The article with the most support votes at the end of the week are selected as the "winner". Collaborators and other editors are then encouraged to work together on the "winning" article in order to bring it up to a higher standard. People might vote for a topic because they feel it is an important subject for the encyclopedia to cover, or because the selected article is in particularly poor shape, or because it's close to featured status and just needs a little more work, or any number of other reasons. <b>— <a href="../../../m/c/_/User%7EMC_MasterChef_eb58.html" title="User:MC MasterChef">MC MasterChef</a></b> <b>::</b> Leave a <b><a href="../../../m/c/_/User_talk%7EMC_MasterChef_684b.html" title="User talk:MC MasterChef">tip</a> —</b> <small>03:11, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>

<p>How nice of you to remove me,I see "the encyclopedia for everyone" should be taken with a grain of salt.Too bad that people not registered don't get a chance to voice their opinion on what they really want to see in the encyclopedia.The same goes for the front page redesign,again desided over by a minority.I guess a poll is something new arround these parts.--<a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETechnosphere83_69f8.html" title="User:Technosphere83">Technosphere83</a> 12:13, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, Wikipedia's mottoes are "The Free Encyclopedia" and "The encyclopedia anyone can edit". Nobody said anyone willing to make an account gets equal privileges right off the bat.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But that's beside the point. The important things are that 1) allowing people with just a few edits leaves the door wide open to voting fraud, and 2) the AID is run by a single person, not Wikipedia as a whole, and is subject to whatever rules that person wants to impose. If you don't like it, you can start your own alternative AID. Today's Featured Article you have a slightly better case for (any user can suggest changes to the other parts of the page and expect a good chance of some friendly admin taking them up if their suggestion has merit). —<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimetrical_0dc0.html" title="User:Simetrical">Simetrical</a> (<a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimetrical_7ff0.html" title="User talk:Simetrical">talk</a>) 02:41, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
