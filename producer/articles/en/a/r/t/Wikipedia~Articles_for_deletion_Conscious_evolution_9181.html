<li>Dear Wikitroopers, I apologize to those who were personally offended by my remarks regarding the serious problem of jewish bias on wikipedia on issues involving or regarding jews and judaism, I just wish more attention where brought to that fact and that people would stop pretending it doesn't exist or looking the other way. I genuinely and sincerely want wikipedia to be fair, balanced, neutral and possess a wide range of valid points of view.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyhow, Hey guys, think of conscious evolution as a very rough work in progress, with absolutely enormous potential like the rest of wikipedia&#160;;) Conscious evolution is the wave of the future, and the last stage of our human evolution, so please reconsider your vote to keep it rather than delete it! Think of it this way, each one of you is like a brain cell in the mind of the coming god consciousness and the internet is the network that connects all these brain cells together. With that knowledge you discover that wikipedia is the memory of gods brain and our communication its consciousness. So lets consider keeping it guys!!&#160;;)</p>
<p>Also where is jpgordons vote to delete? I am disappointed that he didn't vote delete within 1 hr of the topics creation. &lt;g&gt;</p>
<p>with over 20,000 mentions for "conscious evolution", I think we should keep it and work towards creating a conscious evolution article with all points of view!</p>

You people are discrediting Wikipedia with your un-democratic mindset. In the past hour I have come upon this VfD'ed article AND an entry in the deletion log detailing how an article about Wikipedia's Pro-Jewish Bias was deleting <b>WITHOUT VfD</b>-ing. Now back to the article, unlike the rest of you sheep, I actually read the article and although it is not well written, it is quite valid both in its content and its context in the wider world. It should be expanded and fleshed out true, but kept and not deleted. I urge all voters to vote to keep. -<a href="../../../c/u/n/User%7ECunningLinguist_5ed1.html" title="User:CunningLinguist">CunningLinguist</a> 08:54, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>What do you mean by calling it <i>valid</i>? It makes little sense, being just an attempt at pretentious twaddle that doesn't even succeed in being pretentious. The arrogance with which you assume that no-one but you has read the article, however, together with your insults to those who disagree with you, suggests that you're either a sock-puppet of Dnagit (or <i>vice versa</i>), or merely a <s>maggot-skinned</s> white-supremacist fellow traveller. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis (<font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 19:51, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>While my claim that no-one read it was poorly thought out, I still stand by my previous points. Although it is poorly written, I still beleive that the article should be kept because of the fact that "Conscious Evolution" has established its presence on the internet (do a Google-search), the article was far from a "personal essay" as someone claimed, in fact these ideas have been put out in one form or another by various thinkers over time, and I see no white-supremacist propaganda on the page. My comment that no-one read it seems to become more valid the more you read this page. Someone compared the page to <a href="../../../z/y/k/Zyklon_B_44ff.html" title="Zyklon B">Zyklon B</a>...Ummm, excuse me?? are we reading the same page here?? It seems like many of the voters on this page are coming here, quickly seeing accusations of white supremacy by others and voting Delete without actually taking in the article. Your accusation that I am either DNAGod's sock puppet or a White Supermacist is: 1. A cheap attempt to slander me and therefore make any comment I have made on here invalid 2. Patently invalid because: A. A quick look at the edit histories by me and DNAGod or even a look at our User pages shows that we are not related in anyway, in fact if DNAGod is actually a White Supremacist like you claim, I doubt he would wish to relate in any way with me since: B. For your information I am not White. -<a href="../../../c/u/n/User%7ECunningLinguist_5ed1.html" title="User:CunningLinguist">CunningLinguist</a> 05:08, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You misunderstand me. I don't think that the article contained white-supremacist material (in fact I think it had very little if any genuine content, hence my confusion over your description of it as <i>valid</i>). Rather, claiming that no-one but you had read the article, and calling other voters <i>sheep</i> was strongly reminiscent of the style of comments made by Dnagit and his friends at, for example the VfU for <i>Jewish ethnocentrism</i>. In fact it was those comments of yours, in my view, that would make few people take your interjection seriously, not my response to them.<br />
I did in fact check your edit history, and it was immediately obvious that there was no actual connection between you and Dnagit; I therefore didn't claim that there was. Rather, I said that the tenor of your remarks <i>suggested</i> that there was. I could (and should) have made myself clearer. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis (<font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 09:25, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>If you believe you can write a NPOV article about whatever subject this article is about, then do so—make a subpage of your user page and take a crack at it, and then we'll review it. The article is so incoherent that I can't even fathom what he's talking about from an outsider's perspective, so I'm curious to see what an objective description of this...whatever it is...would even look like. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 05:32, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

The article is so muddled that I can't figure out whether the term 'conscious evolution' has any encyclopedic potential either as the topic of a separate article or subsumed under some more general topic.

<li>I'm mixed. This article is crap. Pure POV drivel. However, the notion of "consious evolution" is (or at least was) pretty commonplace in New Age thinking not so long ago. It's unfortunate to see that the term and concept is being co-opted by such societal detritus as the neo-nazis. There *could* be an article on the topic, but this is probably a worse starting point than a blank page. I've no inclination to re-write this crap, so for the article in its current state my vote is <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a><font color="blue"><b>≠</b></font><a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 15:15, Feb 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>there is such an enormous wealth of material on conscious evolution, that it would be an utter shame and waste for such a topic to be merged with other topics. eugenics and conscious evolution are not the same. Eugenics is about selective breeding, where as conscious evolution encompasses all strategies, philosophies and tactics to enable upward evolution. There is also a very spiritual element to conscious evolution, that does not exist in transhumanism. Merging conscious evolution with transhumanism wont work either, as transhumanism which was hijacked and rejects eugenics - even though the founder of transhumanism was an avid supporter of eugenics. Conscious evolution deserves its own category, and has thousands of unique articles and perspectives on it make it worthy. I ask that you give me a couple of months to develop this topic and I will include all perspectives, pro, con, neutral, etc.. etc..

<li>Eugenics is a subset of conscious evolution, they are not one and the same. Transhumanism is a subset of conscious evolution, because the hijacked (huxley was a eugenicist) version of transhumanism rejects conscious evolution. Conscious evolution does not discriminate, it embodies all philosophies, all view points, all strategies of real tangible transformation towards Godhood! Why would anyone want to delete the most fascinating, creative, imaginative, stimulating and interesting topic that has ever come to wikipedia or the human race for that matter? We are talking about the last revolution where man takes control of his own conscious evolution to attain the ultimate dream of immortality and godhood. Sure the thing needs work, so does the rest of wikipedia, but why would we want to delete something which represents the true essence of wikipedia? If we deleted something because it wasn't finished or could be improved regarding its POV, wouldnt we have to delete all of wikipedia? Boulder Dash!&#160;;) Is not wikipedia Conscious Evolution and conscious evolution wikipedia? Are we not taking control of our own evolution here by building all the knowledge in the universe? Is that not clearly defined in conscious evolution as one of the traits of godhood? Imagine genetically modifying ourselves where we could hold the whole wikipedia (year 2100 version) in its completed form in our minds. Don't you see what this is? We are creating God here, this is mans ultimate dream to be immortal and attain oneness with god. Why would you want to delete this opportunity? Conscious Evolution is the great convergence of everything, all the knowledge in the universe and understood in our post human minds with perfection! Imagine a state of consciousness where consciousness permeates the whole of the universe and knowledge, and even the past and future. This is earth shattering stuff here folks. Please, let this thing stay, it needs a lot of time to nurture, to fertilize - no pun intended - and developed into something profound and wonderful. Give Conscious Evolution a CHANCE! As a reward you will all be given godhood.&#160;;)&#160;;) In all seriousness PLEASE give this a chance folks, please. <a href="../../../d/n/a/User%7EDnagod_c0a5.html" title="User:Dnagod">Dnagod</a> 02:11, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well this is why some would argue democracy is a scam, because there seems to be more ignorant people in the world than intelligent (not meant as a personal attack). Based on the number of people voting to delete, I don't see any reason to try to make this section NPOV, as well as include a wide variety of legit POV on the issue. The votes will mean the outcome of deletion is the same (true or false)? You may have proved that wikipedia is simply and mostly a numbers game (encouraging sock puppets and proxy servers). And of course proved I was right in regards to my statements regarding an organized biased jewish cabal, even worse are their lackeys. I think my bringing this fact of jewish biast to the forefront, will never allow for me to make long term legit contributions to wikipedia without the weenies (you know who you are), censoring, deleting or reverting.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I won't waste time developing and expanding this section (unless it is preserved), as it will get purged anyway, so what would be the point? I also think that most people are probably not ready for this kind of truth, it causes too much pain to the masses to realize that for thousands of years their silly revealed religions (especially judaism &amp; christianity in the west) were perpetuated myth-scams and that reality is Man is actually God in the making - you can pretend if you want that we are an end unto ourselves or simply that it isn't true, but deep down you know it is true and you hate the truth. You can't handle the truth!&#160;;)</p>
<p>So please make the deletion final. On a tangent, I think the real problem is that I exposed the absolute fact that every section regarding or even remotely involving jews, judaism, israel, zionism and holocaust denial have a cabal of jewish ethnocentrists, jewish supremacists and (neurotic?) jews, even worse lackeys of jews, who refuse to allow these areas to be fair, balanced, npov, and include legit links and sources. Even worse is that these sections will rarely if ever have the truth regarding the extent of alternative points of view which largely exist and are not pro or neutral concerning jews. By exposing this as a fact regarding wikis jew bias and jew infestation, I have brought the wrath of the jews and their lackeys, thus not ever being able to make legit contributions to wikipedia without those legit contributions being purged, deleted or reverted. Not an insult, not a personal attack, just follow the cabal and you will see I am right.</p>
<p>Would it make more sense that I no longer use this account to contribute? I will still use it to browse though, or would a fresh start be in order under a new name and proxy? In other words, would it make sense I set up new accounts, by instead using one of the thousands of proxy servers I have access to? Does one need to use subtle stealth to achieve positive results of neutrality? Not concerning the jew bias problem.</p>
<p>Wikipedia works for the most part, but your jewish bias from your jew cabal (which includes lackeys of the jews as well) and the inability for the great majority of people to see there is a serious jew problem here will definitely hurt the long term legitimacy and credibility of wikipedia regarding issues involving or even remotely involving Judaism – FACT!</p>
<p>I am glad I was able to bring attention to this fact, even though it’s futile with most people sticking their heads in the sand. However, I enjoy wikipedia and I have faith that history will repeat itself.</p>

<dd>Modemac, you are exactly correct. I have looked at these "jew biased" sections in question with great detail and they are free of insensitive ideas, free of right wing agendas and carefully sanitized, which means they are politically proper and socially correct. There is absolutely no bias, censorship or questionable POV involving what this user describes as "topics even remotely involving jews and judaism." Censorship of additions, contributions and links which point to politically incorrect, insensitive, alternative and critical ideas should not be allowed on wikipedia. If you allow alternative view points which are racist, politically incorrect, insensitive, hurtful and alternative, you will destroy the credibility of wikipedia. I am glad there are a large number of people keeping a close eye on these "jewish biased" topics ensuring they stay in the same voice they are now. Dariodario 14:05, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
