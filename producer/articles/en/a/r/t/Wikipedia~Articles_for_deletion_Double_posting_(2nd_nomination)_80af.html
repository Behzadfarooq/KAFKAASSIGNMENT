<li><b>Delete</b>. Couldn't find reliable sources via Google, not to mention this article is basically a mishmash of original research and compilations of forum rules. I'll admit it's very difficult to search this without just getting assorted forum threads/rules, so if anyone else can find sources, I'd reconsider. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 02:55, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>At least merge</b>: I don't really care if the article itself gets deleted, but I would like for the information to be merged (and not simply deleted with a redirect without moving the information) somewhere. Granted, it is a damn hard topic to get reliable sources for, due to the sheer casualness of the subject, but I doubt anyone would seriously want to delete <a href="../../../h/i/d/Hide_and_seek.html" title="Hide and seek">hide and seek</a> just because <i>it</i> doesn't have any "reliable sources".

<li>Doing a search in children's books on amazon.com shows over 2000 hits for "hide and seek", including a number of books on games for children, there are plenty of sources on hide and seek if someone wants to bother finding them. --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 13:44, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I'm sure that there's probably <i>something</i> published out there thats talk about double posting as well. My point is that the <i>potentional</i> for reliable sources isn't being taken into account. The whole "there aren't reliable sources <i>right now</i> so we should delete it" stance doesn't really seem fair. <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a> aims to force articles of dubious nature to be deleted unless they can prove themselves otherwise.

<li><b>Merge</b> and <b>redirect</b>. I think we should throw out the regular rules for this and invoke <i>common sense</i>. "Double post" is an extremely common forum phrase; I had the same problem as <a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a>, though, in that it's so prevalent I can't easily find anything that isn't a forum itself. <s>It's like doing a search for "roflmao"</s>. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrangerer_d331.html" title="User:Strangerer">Strangerer</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStrangerer_0525.html" title="User talk:Strangerer">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Strangerer_42fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Strangerer">Contribs</a>)</small> 08:35, 4 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your argument is fallacious. <a href="../../../l/o/l/LOL_%28Internet_slang%29_6e70.html#References" title="LOL (Internet slang)">LOL (Internet slang)#References</a> shows by example exactly how "lol", "rotfl", and others <i>can</i> be sourced. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:59, 4 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I wasn't comparing it to roflmao specifically. I just came up with something I thought would be very common in a search to help give perspective - don't take the "roflmao" comparison literally. In fact, I'll strike through it to show you're not supposed to draw a direct comparison. I was pointing out that "double posting" is difficult to pin down sources because it is so widespread in a search. But you understand my meaning - do a search for it and you have to wade through pages and pages of forums while attempting to hunt something down. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrangerer_d331.html" title="User:Strangerer">Strangerer</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStrangerer_0525.html" title="User talk:Strangerer">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Strangerer_42fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Strangerer">Contribs</a>)</small> 17:45, 4 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I've said already, your argument is fallacious. That you erroneously think that a Google Web search of the article title is the only way to find sources is one root of the fallacy. Once again, look at the example of <a href="../../../l/o/l/LOL_%28Internet_slang%29_6e70.html#References" title="LOL (Internet slang)">LOL (Internet slang)#References</a>. You have examples of what kinds of sources will discuss double posting, if such sources exist. If you want to make an argument for keeping this content that will hold water, find such sources and cite them. You have yet to do so. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:57, 5 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Fine then. Since I'm not personally interested in the topic and have little desire to spend my time researching it, delete it. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrangerer_d331.html" title="User:Strangerer">Strangerer</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStrangerer_0525.html" title="User talk:Strangerer">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Strangerer_42fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Strangerer">Contribs</a>)</small> 21:07, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Correct. And <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_mcmurray_93f4.html" title="User:A mcmurray">A mcmurray</a>'s argument is, as xe says, based upon the premise that this is the former, not the latter.

<li><b>Merge</b> with an article about Internet forums... see <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_forum.html" title="Internet forum">Internet forum</a>, or another internet related article. There aren't many sources on "Double posting", except for forum rules and threads, but this is a term that exists in nearly any online forum community. <a href="../../../k/o/p/User%7EKopf1988_0e1d.html" title="User:Kopf1988">Kopf1988</a> 16:38, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. If there is a merger, the only verified material we could really merge is "double-posting is when a user makes two consecutive posts," which is kind of a useless addition. If anything, bring it up on the talk page of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_forum.html" title="Internet forum">Internet forum</a> and try to source material there, and <i>then</i> make additions to the article. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 16:49, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yeah basically. But that doesn't mean the info doesn't belong somewhere. I don't care if it doesn't get its own article. Policies aren't set in stone anyway, btw. Additionally, the forums would essentially be primary sources in this instance, which are allowable if they are used only to verify the fact that the term exists per <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a>. Which means the article is either kept as a stub or a sentence or two is thrown into the internet forum article. Wikipedia policy can be bent a bit if it helps the wiki or an article or whatever. Anyway merge essentially means delete but.<a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_mcmurray_93f4.html" title="User:A mcmurray">A mcmurray</a> (<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_mcmurray_aaf1.html" title="User talk:A mcmurray">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_mcmurray_ce89.html" title="Special:Contributions/A mcmurray">contribs</a>) 13:34, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I don't see how it's any worse that most of the other articles in <a href="../../../i/n/t/Category%7EInternet_forum_terminology_01c4.html" title="Category:Internet forum terminology">Category:Internet forum terminology</a> which makes the suggestions here to merge it with <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_forum.html" title="Internet forum">internet forum</a> problematic since that would imply the whole category should be merged there, making that page too long so people would then want to spin that out into separate articles again. I've saved a copy at <a href="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/c:forums:double_posting" class="extiw" title="wikiasite:forums:double_posting">wikiasite:forums:double posting</a> in case it is deleted from here though. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngela_f429.html" title="User talk:Angela">.</a> 15:09, 5 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, in looking at that category, there are a number of other articles which will likely need to go. And they can't all be merged into <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_forum.html" title="Internet forum">Internet forum</a>, you are correct. Perhaps a 1 line definition of the terms, if they don't already exist in Internet forum, could be added there. --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 01:11, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Is there not a better article than <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_forum.html" title="Internet forum">internet forum</a> to merge to? Maybe we need to just make a new something to merge everything into. Internet forum culture maybe? That's sure to get damn crufty though...--<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 06:50, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps Internet forum terminology, of course verifiability would be key. But I still think my statement about the forums as primary sources holds water, provided there were enough of them to be considered verification. And sure these things can change, but there are very few articles on Wikipedia which involve active events, people etc that are static. Anyway, I don't want to discard fundamental policy but remember, the rules and guidelines are meant to be followed in spirit not to the letter.<a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_mcmurray_93f4.html" title="User:A mcmurray">A mcmurray</a> (<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_mcmurray_aaf1.html" title="User talk:A mcmurray">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_mcmurray_ce89.html" title="Special:Contributions/A mcmurray">contribs</a>) 06:58, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think in all that could eliminate the category and make managing the garbage that does get through much easier as these things will either be merged or deleted as it may be.<a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_mcmurray_93f4.html" title="User:A mcmurray">A mcmurray</a> (<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_mcmurray_aaf1.html" title="User talk:A mcmurray">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_mcmurray_ce89.html" title="Special:Contributions/A mcmurray">contribs</a>) 07:00, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
