<li><b>keep</b> There is documentation (now linked) showing it's use beyond the class. It has been used on blogs across Canada and the United States [http:del.icio.us/tags/depletist]. Although the class had a a goal to alter peoples attitudes towards the environment, the word itself is simply filling a gap in the language. As various people and institutions are forming policies around their environmental practices, it is a useful word to describe actions, and to form policy around (it would be difficult to form laws around racism or sexism if those words did not exist).<small>â€”The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Chrisbraden (talk â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chrisbraden_c278.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chrisbraden">contribs</a>).</small> <small>â€” Chrisbraden (talk â€¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chrisbraden_c278.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chrisbraden">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> It is not about being "hugging a tree" it is about getting people to care about the environment even if just a little, it is about sustainability, it is about stop messing with our planet because it's already in a deep mess that MAYBE we can do something about. It's a wake up call that being a depletist is NOT okay. Just as we have neologistic words such as "bling"--a slang, they've proven themselves to stick around. Even "racism" and "sexist" are nelogistic words as they were only created in the 20th century. Like Aisha285 and Chrisbraden have noted above, this word is a state of mind, it describes actions. It's an education for others. It's history in the making. For your proof that this word is spreading rapidly, you just have to google to see. What started as 0 hits has no become 498 hits in a matter of a <i>few</i> months. Please, it's absolutely essential that this word is kept. Please consider keeping it.

<li><b>Delete</b> Neologism, admitted to be as such in the article.

The "racist"/"sexist" argument also doesn't fly with me, because those words don't have opposites, and any word created to fill that gap in our language would be a neologism as well. --<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDachannien_f06e.html" title="User:Dachannien"><b><font color="black">Dachannien</font></b></a><sup><a href="../../../d/a/c/User_talk%7EDachannien_c4c3.html" title="User talk:Dachannien"><font color="blue"><i>Talk</i></font></a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dachannien_c2da.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dachannien"><font color="green"><i>Contrib</i></font></a></sub> 18:38, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> Shouldn't then by all the Neologism complaints, articles such as Truthiness, invented by Steven Colbert Earlier on this year be deleted as well? When exactly do you define a word has spread? Shall it be weeks? Months? Years? By subjective standpoints, there is no â€˜afterâ€™ to any sort of spreading. The article does not push for any particular viewpoint, thus the arguments that it is a trying to turn wikipedia into a soapbox doesn't apply, it is simply a documentation of a word and it's emergement usage. The fact that it has been quoted on activist blogs <b>is not sufficient evidence</b> to determine it's neutrality.

<li><b>KEEP</b> Now, now, everybody. Lets look at the facts. This word is becoming the object of a healthy debate, and the Deletists do have a point, but to understand the positive ramifications of this word being recognized by a notable online encyclopedia that we all use will speak volumes when this word becomes common usage. All this KEEP and DELETE is interesting, but the raw facts are that this word seems to be being used by people, it seems it is spreading fast, it was created in part by a notable author and university professor. Really, so what if a bunch of university students contributed in the creation of a word? This word <i>should</i> carry the same weight as the word <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racist.html" title="Racist">Racist</a>. What is really being said by deleting this entry is that <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borat.html" title="Borat">Borat</a> holds more weight than a legitimate word that is a step in the right direction to creating a sustainable future. Delete if you must, but I would then question the motives of those who delete these entries.

<dd><b>Comment</b> You will note that, on wikipedia, the word "Racist" actually redirects to the entry on "Racism", a much broader concept. As to Borat, as long as more people have heard of him than have heard of "depletist", he will - in terms of notability, which is a primary grounds for determining what does and does not belong on wikipedia - carry more weight.

<li><b>Keep</b> as per all of the above. From doing a Google search there are some 495 returns, say 40 of those are unique?

<p>Sock puppetry</p>
<p>Aisha285, please be aware that sock puppetry - that is, creating and using multiple accounts in order to influence the result of a vote - violates Wikipedia policy. <b>There is ample circumstantial evidence in the AfD vote located at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Depletist (second nomination) to suggest that you are creating multiple accounts to influence the result of that vote</b>. If you have, in fact, done this, please revisit the AfD page to indicate which comments are your own posted under those multiple accounts. Thank you. --DachannienTalkContrib 18:15, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>All I have to say about this, is that, I AM NOW BEING FALSELY ACCUSED. Please read this carefully:</p>
<p>I only put this page up to help people, not to create problems. People are also using Wikipedian terms against me such as "SPANK THIS AUTHOR" or "SALT" or "EXPUNGE." I am a new author, and my intentions have only been good. If you read the article about "Depletist" you would realize that the intentions are good ones. Hopefully this would make you realize that a person who has good interests like this, would not take steps to violate any Wikipedia rules. Creating multiple accounts is an obvious violation. Also, I should point out that I cannot sit here all day, I do have to make a living to survive daily. Anyhow, I would rather be out creating a better awareness of this word and movement, because this page shows that many people are not educated in this matter, (while of course, thankfully, some people are).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there have been many rude remarks made that I do believe to be quite unfair. I did not come to wikipedia to create hatred. I came here high spirited, and have been let down. Fortunately, I realize through this, that not everyone knows this word yet. Please help humanity in this positive movement forward. I am positive that one day "depletists and depletism" and the great events that have happened around it will be recognized by everyone and prevented. Even if this article is deleted, I still thank you Wikipedia. You have only given me more incentive to keep working hard in this endeavour. Cheers. <a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAisha285_e8e8.html" title="User:Aisha285">Aisha Sheikh</a> 02:11, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Salting is not <i>necessarily</i> a reflection on you, merely a shorthand for "delete and protect".
