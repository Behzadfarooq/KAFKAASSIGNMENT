	    <p>This deletion decision was nominated for <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">review</a> on 14 Dec 2005. The review discussion is appended below. As I sought to close out the deletion review, I discovered a number of factors which had not been addressed either in the original AFD nor in the Deletion Review. First, the original "shpants" article was used as source material for the article now at <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_quarter_pants.html" title="Three quarter pants">Three quarter pants</a>. The existence of "three quarter pants" was substantiated during the original deletion discussion. It's appropriateness for inclusion has never been challenged. Since the contents of the article (at whatever name) were used to create an article that we apparently are keeping, we must preserve the attribution history in order to preserve GFDL. Second, since the deletion, this page has been re-created as a redirect to <a href="../../../s/h/p/Shpant.html" title="Shpant">Shpant</a> - a dictionary definition of a Yiddish word (an article which itself was created since this discussion began). On my own authority as an ordinary editor, I am <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/transwiki" class="extiw" title="m:transwiki">transwiki</a>-ing the Yiddish dicdef to Wiktionary and replacing it with a soft-redirect.</p>
<p>Having cleared up the <a href="../../../s/h/p/Shpant.html" title="Shpant">shpant</a> page, I return to the shpants page. While there are several complicated and error-prone ways to preserve attribution history without preserving the history of the original article, I find no burning reason to go to all that extra work. Redirects and disambiguation pages often serve as nothing more than mechanical pages to support our GFDL requirements. The article history contains nothing patently offensive or even untrue except the assertion that the word "shpants" is associated with this product. Accordingly, I am going to exercise my discretion and override the majority opinion of both the original AFD and of the Deletion Review discussions. While the majority opinion was clearly in favor of deletion, I can not reconcile that decision with our requirement to preserve attribution history. I am going to restore the history of the shpants article and remake it into a disambiguation page with links to both <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/shpant" class="extiw" title="wikt:shpant">wikt:shpant</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_quarter_pants.html" title="Three quarter pants">three quarter pants</a>. I will include a specific explanation of the reasons for doing so.</p>
<p>If someone really wants go through the alternative steps to perserve attribution history, then I will not object if the history of shpants is again deleted. I also will not object to the re-deletion if <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_quarter_pants.html" title="Three quarter pants">three quarter pants</a> is deleted. Until then, however, this seems to be the cleanest solution. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 07:33, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Apologies if I am putting this in the wrong place. The page as originally created was a nonsense article about an invented neologism. During the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Shpants_74ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Shpants">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Shpants</a>, the article was improved to refer to <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_quarter_pants.html" title="Three quarter pants">Three quarter pants</a>, an article which previously did not exist. <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">User:Peyna</a> and myself argued successfully that both Shants and Shpants should redirect to <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_quarter_pants.html" title="Three quarter pants">Three quarter pants</a> as less popular variations of Three quarter pants, as they are not the same thing as <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capri_pants.html" title="Capri pants">Capri pants</a>. The votes in the deletion were 5 deletions and 3 keeps/renames. However, all 3 of the keeps suggested an alternate to redirect to 3/4 pants, as did 1 of the deletions. The first 3 deletions were made prior to the article rewrite, and were based on the original nonsense page. Thus in effect we had a consensus to redirect to <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_quarter_pants.html" title="Three quarter pants">Three quarter pants</a>. I was bold and simply put in a REDIRECT <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_quarter_pants.html" title="Three quarter pants">Three quarter pants</a>, but this was wrongly speedy deleted by the only user who thought that the article should be deleted outright. I propose quite simply for the article to have a REDIRECT <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_quarter_pants.html" title="Three quarter pants">Three quarter pants</a> in there. It is clearly an alternate name for 3/4 pants that is in use in that fashion. I suggest that the closer perhaps didn't note the alternates that were given, and may have thought that it was a consensus to delete, when it was actually a consensus to redirect. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 11:44, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I was the original nominator for deletion of the for the Shpants article. The article that I nominated had last been edited on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_17.html" title="October 17">October 17</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> (10:53). I am responding to this note only because of some inaccuracies directed at me and in the comment above. The note above says it was "wrongly speedy deleted by the only user who thought the article should be deleted outright". I take exception to the fact the it was "wrongly speedy deleted".</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Concerning speedy delete: I take exception to the adverb "wrongly". I did not do the deletion, just the nomination; and according to the Criteria for Speedy Deletion, G4 ("Recreation of deleted material.") it was a proper <b>nomination</b> as the material went through an AFD vote. An administrator looked at the speedy delete nomination and did the deletion.
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree. Speedy deletion only applies when the contents are the same. The contents were not the same, hence it should not have been speedy deleted. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 14:10, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>AFD deletion: The administrator viewed the vote as a delete. The re-written article was created in <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_quarter_pants.html" title="Three quarter pants">Three quarter pants</a>. Some discussion comments centered on the term "shpants" as a neologism. Though some delete votes were made before the re-write, the "neologism" comments for the term provide the reason for the vote and as such are valid delete votes. Not all of the keep/rewrites supported redirection. Some comments (including my own) indicated that a redirect for a neologism not really merited.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree. Other than your comment, the remaining deletion comments focussed on the original nonsense content of the article, not on the name. You were the only person concerned about the name, hence effectively making it 4:1 in favour of redirection. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 14:10, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>So, this current deletion discussion, in my opinion, centers on the merits of including a "neologism" as a redirect. (BTW, my deletion vote does not apply to the newly re-written article, under its current name, just to having an article called "Shpants" for this topic). I do think this <u>is</u> the proper forum for Zordrac's to bring a discussion on the merits of the deletion/redirection. <a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> 13:18, 14 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I honestly don't see the harm. There has been agreement to make Shants in to a redirect to <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_quarter_pants.html" title="Three quarter pants">Three quarter pants</a>, and Shpants logically means "Short pants" just like "Shants" means "Short pants", which is what Three quarter pants are. It is perfectly reasonable to suggest that someone might think of it as Shpants. There was agreement that the nonsense article claiming that 3/4 pants was made up in 2005 by some 13 year old was not encyclopaedic. However, there was also agreement that the term was a valid alternative to 3/4 pants. Everyone bar yourself agreed on that. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 14:10, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Question re: <i>this current deletion discussion, in my opinion, centers on the merits of including a "neologism" as a redirect</i></b> Maybe I'm missing something, but isn't a redirect simply a way of pointing a different reference (word, phrase, term for) to a single article, so that two or more articles aren't being written on the same topic? If something "merits" a redirect, then wouldn't it also merit an article if there wasn't another article to redirect it to? Or are there different criteria for redirects, like, a redirect is less important than an article? --<a href="../../../t/s/a/User%7ETsavage_7e01.html" title="User:Tsavage">Tsavage</a> 01:08, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Amazingly, Shpants generates 8000 Ghits. Wow. I don't know anything about fashion, but I'd tend to think that merits a redirect, if all those hits refer to the same object. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 13:42, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>In this case, I'm not sure that the speedy of the redirect was valid, unlike in a recent example. I'm not sure whether this is a neologism or not, but I did know that I hadn't come across the word. The reason for this is that it gets about <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=shpants&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=shpants&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">11000 Google.com</a> hits but only <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=shpants&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=cr%3DcountryUK%7CcountryGB" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=shpants&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=cr%3DcountryUK%7CcountryGB" rel="nofollow">54 Google.co.uk</a> hits. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 14:14, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Undelete</b> the redirect; invalid speedy even if the AFD was legit, which is questionable. Would prefer undeleting rest of history as well. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 14:48, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>(I speedied the redirect so of course I'm going to say) <b>keep deleted</b>. Afd consensus was clearly not to have an article <i>or</i> redirect at this title. Furthermore, those google hits are, so far as I can see, all from ephemeral sources, largely blog and forum posts. A search of Google Print finds <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=shpants" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=shpants" rel="nofollow">zero permanent sources</a>; this wouldn't even qualify for a dictdef in Wiktionary. Compare <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=skort" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=skort" rel="nofollow">569 for skort</a>. If someone creates a legitimate article for <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slotted_spoon.html" title="Slotted spoon">slotted spoons</a> at zxyyklskizz, we don't leave the made-up redirect behind when we move it. —<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryptic_b72b.html" title="User:Cryptic">Cryptic</a> <a href="../../../c/r/y/User_talk%7ECryptic_d8a7.html" title="User talk:Cryptic">(talk)</a> 16:32, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Having looked at the discussion closely, only two people are clearly against redirecting (ERcheck and Satori, who both describe the term as a neologism), one person is clearly for it, one person specifically notes that they aren't opposed to it, and the other four have no clear opinion on the issue. How you interpret this as a "consensus" to delete the redirect is confusing, perhaps you could elaborate. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 21:31, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

Procedurally, I see a new redirect as fairly irrelevant and not recreation of deleted material. On the other hand, the article itself was an absolute bust and absolutely fit for deletion. It was a neologism, and a silly one, but I don't see why there is any discussion of a redirect going on here, as no one is advocating recreation or undeletion of the article, so far as I can tell. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:45, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I think it would establish a bad precedent to allow Wikipedia to be used as a method for the cultivation and dissemination of non-verifiable, unestablished neologisms. As you yourself have said, notability should bring articles to Wikipedia. Not the other way around. → <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtreme_Unction_1dfd.html" title="User:Extreme Unction"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>Ξxtreme</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Unction</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../e/x/t/User_talk%7EExtreme_Unction_3e82.html" title="User talk:Extreme Unction">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Extreme_Unction_b4bc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Extreme Unction">blah</a></sub></font>} 18:20, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>You should simply to a search engine search and read a few dozen entries to see whether this word "exists" beyond some tiny affiliation of shpants fetishists (or whomever those who imagine the word doesn't <i>really</i> exist think is then using it). It's obviously a "word", and Wikipedia, being so open and immediate and all, is a good place to find the...latest in the English language! --<a href="../../../t/s/a/User%7ETsavage_7e01.html" title="User:Tsavage">Tsavage</a> 22:31, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>LOL this is funny. I suppose you're going to say that all the hits for "Shpants", all saying it means Three Quarter Pants, are irrelevant? LOL. Just ludicruous. And now, what, I'm being called a vandal for quoting sourced claims? This just shows the idiocy of the "deletion review", which just seems to be a forum for admins to come in and pat each other on the back and say "well done" to each other. This is perhaps the silliest thing that has ever happened. Just a REDIRECT! No reason for anyone to get their knickers in a knot over it. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 23:31, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Relist</b> (I take it this means, put it back on AfD or wherever this got started, so that this can be discussed again (properly).) There should be no administrative sanctions against <i>shpants</i>, as in "somewhat short pants". Specifically, there should be a redirect now, and it should be possible to create a separate article if developed into a separate topic. This is OBVIOUSLY a term that refers to something specific. If we can have the tired "<a href="../../../r/e/g/Regifting.html" title="Regifting">regifting</a>", we can have shpants. Even if you discount search engine hits that point to at least hundreds of instances of usage in this sartorial sense (as opposed to Yiddish), consider the simple fact that there is at least one citable case where the term <b><a href="http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:1fzGY12g0_8J:www.inform.umd.edu/News/Diamondback/archives/2002/09/26/commentary3.html+shpants&amp;hl=en" class="external text" title="http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:1fzGY12g0_8J:www.inform.umd.edu/News/Diamondback/archives/2002/09/26/commentary3.html+shpants&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow"><i>shpants</i> has been the subject of an article, published in print, in a US university student newspaper (in 2002)</a></b>.
