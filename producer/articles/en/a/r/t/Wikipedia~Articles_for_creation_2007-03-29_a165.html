<p>David Henry Hagan was born April 15, 1988 in Napa, California. Hagan gained fame through the 2006 internet viral video, "Hella Hagan's Dance Party".</p>
<a name="Nicknames" id="Nicknames"></a>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-03-29_a165.html" title="Edit section: Nicknames">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Nicknames</span></h2>
<p>Hagan has developed many nicknames since reaching fame. Some nicknames include Hella, Nasty Napa, Chimp, E.T., Amy, and Jewblack.</p>
<a name="Controversy" id="Controversy"></a>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-03-29_a165.html" title="Edit section: Controversy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Controversy</span></h2>
<p>The true ethnic identity of Hagan is still questionable. David states that he is white and half Jewish. Many researchers however believe him to be a mix of African-American and Jewish. Still others maintain that he is actually a high level Chimpanzee known as a Jewpanzee, much like the Jewpanzee Amy in the feature film, Congo. It circulated on the internet in January 2007 that Hagan is actually a decendent of the beloved alien, E.T.</p>
<p>While the ethnic identity of Hagan remains up in the air, it is confirmed that despite heavy rumors he is in fact kind of straight.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-03-29_a165.html" title="Edit section: Tha Goodfellas (Radio Hosts)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Tha Goodfellas (Radio Hosts)</span></h2>
<p>Tha Goodfellas are radio hosts currently heard on Los Angeles first hip hop station KDAY (KDAY 93.5) every weekday between 6 pm and 10 pm.</p>
<p>Romeo Mastin and Dejai Jeffries were born in St. Louis, MO in 1976. Their first encounter with entertainment is when Tha Goodfellas worked at Blockbuster growing up, "I still have the uniform in my closet as if I have to go to work tomorrow," insists DeJai, one half of Tha Goodfellas. And if that doesn’t help them stay humble, "Call home," advises Romeo, also a former Blockbuster employee.</p>
<p>Tha Goodfellas got their radio start when a chance meeting with a Los Angeles radio jock led to an audition on KPWR Power 106 in Los Angeles, which landed Romeo &amp; DeJai a part-time gig on the station. It was the duo’s first experience with working in radio and they have embraced it ever since. With show ratings skyrocketing, Tha Goodfellas got their chance to shine and earned the coveted afternoon drive position on Power alongside Tito. They became, Tha Goodfellas with Romeo, Dejai, &amp; Tito from 3-7PM. The years of perfecting their chemistry finally paid off and The Goodfellas have been #1 in afternoons for the past 5 years!</p>
<p>Today, popular radio personalities, Tha Goodfellas have gained nationwide acclaim and are consistently making a name for themselves. Known for their down to earth humor and high energy show they have a way of making even the most famous and private celebrities feel comfortable. Tha Goodfellas have interviewed countless A-listers, from Jay-Z, Jermaine Dupre, P.Diddy, Russell Simmons, Nick Cannon, Will Smith, the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>In addition to being On-Air Personalities, Tha Goodfellas are Philanthropist and just gave away a scholarship from “Tha Goodfellas Scholarship Foundation” to a lucky college student at California State University Northridge during an Apollo night contest. Not only are they called upon to DJ the hottest celebrity parties, they have made movie and television appearances in the hit movie, "You Got Served" with Omarion and Marques Houston and on "The Parkers" with funny comedian Mo`Nique. Tha Goodfellas also host “Tha Drop”, a nationwide television show on SiTV and are preparing for their own ringtone!</p>
<p>Described as a "rulers of the airwaves" by former Vibe Magazine Editor-In-Chief Emil Wilbekin, Tha Goodfellas continues to surprise audiences with their uncanny ability to connect musically to everyone within their reach.</p>

It has a simple but reliable construction: a grand-bascinet helm, box-shaped cuirass, firm gauntlets, and long skirt. Unfortunately only one of such armours has survived till today, and this armour now could be seen in Museum of Vienna. However, this armour is widely represented by paints and statues of the first half 15c.</p>

But does being the first Indian space tourist make you notable? I'm kinda iffy.

<p>Kootam defines birth from a single male ancestor. Kootam is transferred patrilineally i.e., via the father of a person. Hence people belonging to the same kootam are considered brothers and sisters. So marriage between a male and female belonging to the same kootam is prohibited however distantly they may be related.</p>
<p>Historically there were 72 kootams in kaikolar. Each kootam had a leader. The head leader in Kanchipuram was the head for all these leaders. This was used to manage disputes within the community.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the kootams have merged into one another and there is no well defined leader for each kootam. It is used only for setting up marriage alliances.</p>

<pre>
Avippali, Thannai, Verttal, Vallan pakkam, Pun Kilithu Mudiyum Maram and Marakkanchi: 
</pre>
<p>the forms of martial suicide and suicidal battle of the warrior as the ultimate expression of his loyalty to his commander. These six forms of martial suicide are defined as described by the works referred to above.</p>
<p>Pulla Vazhkai Vallan Pakkam – the martial attitude of the warrior who goes forth into suicidal battle is mentioned by Tholkappiyam. The other works refer to it as Thannai Verttal. Duarte Barbosa describes the practice among the Nayar (of the Chera kingdom). It was later noticed by British officials as well. It was also prevalent among the Maravar (of the Pandya kingdom) from whom the suicidal Aapathuthavi bodyguard was selected. Thannai Verttal also refers to the suicide of a warrior on hearing that his king or commander has died (Purapporul Venpa Malai). Punkilithu Mudiym Maram is the martial act of a warrior who commits suicide by tearing apart his battle wound.</p>
<p>Another form of martial suicide mentioned by all the works except Veera soliyam, is Avippali. Tamil inscriptions speak of it as Navakandam. Inscriptions found in many parts of Tamilnadu provide greater information on the practice. Navakandam is the act of a warrior who slices his own neck to fulfil the vow made to korravai – the Tamil goddess of war – for his commanders’ victory in battle. The Kalingathu Parani(10) – a work which celebrates the victory of the Chola king Kulotunga and his general Thondaman in the battle for Kalinga, describes the practice in detail. “The temple of korravai is decorated with lotus flowers which bloomed when the warriors sliced their own necks”(106); “they slice the base of their necks; the severed heads are given to the goddess”(111); “when the neck is sliced and the head is severed, the headless body jumps with joy for having fulfilled the vow”(113).</p>
<p>The epics of Chilapadikaram (5: 79-86) and Manimekalai (6: 50-51) mention the practice. To ensure the complete severing of the head, the warrior tied his hair to a bamboo bent taut before he cut his neck. Hero stones depicting this practice are found all over Tamil Nadu, and are called Saavan Kallu by locals. The warriors who thus committed suicide were not only deified in hero stones (saavan kallu) and worshipped but their relatives were given lands which were exempted from tax(11).</p>
<p><b>An area handbook (Tharamangalam) of the Tamilnadu archeology department notes that “the Nava Kandam sculpture which is found widely all over Kongu Nadu (Coimbatore, Salem) is to be seen at the Tharamangalam Kailasanathar kovil also. The people call it Saavan Kallu. “The practice of Nava Kandam existed in Kongu Nadu till the early part of this [i.e., 20th] century.”(12)</b></p>
<p><b>A Saavan Kallu at Thenkarai Moolanatha sami Kovil in Madurai, depicting the act of a warrior holding his hair with his left hand and slicing his neck with his right – 14th century – is said to be annually worshipped by the Conjeevaram Mudaliyars.(13) The Conjeevaram Mudaliyars are Kaikola marava perumpadai or Sengunthar, a presentday weaving caste which was militarized under the Chola empire and was made into a special military body; there are indications that Kaikolar warriors practiced Nava Kandam(14).</b></p>
<p>Apart from these codified forms of martial suicide, a method called Vadakkiruththal is mentioned in Tamil heroic poetry. It is the act of a warrior king fasting to death, if some dire dishonour were to come upon him(15). The Tamil teacher, and the Dravidian propagandist, turned the song of the legendary Chera king Irumborai who committed suicide when he was taken captive by his enemies into a compelling theme in Tamil renaissance.</p>
<p>The Avippali form of martial suicide as the ultimate expression of loyalty to one’s commander, is deeply embedded in the Tamil psyche. Senchorru-kadan (the debt of red rice) is a phrase that is widely used today by Tamils as an expression of loyalty. One frequently hears of it in a popular Tamil song. The phrase sands for the ritual of partaking of rice by which Maravar and other Tamil military caste warriors bound themselves to their king or commander to die in suicidal battle for him, or to commit suicide on the day he was slain. Of Avippali, the Puraporul Venba Malai ([verse] 92) says, “thinking of nothing but the red (blood) rice the Maravar give their life as offering in battle.”</p>
<p>The ritual of red or blood rice was described by two Muslim travellers who had visited the Tamil country in the 9th century. “A quantity of cooked rice was spread before the king, and some three or four hundred persons came of their own accord and received each a small quantity of rice from the king’s own hands, after he himself had eaten some. By eating of this rice, they all engage themselvesto burn themselves on the day the king dies or is slain; and they punctually fulfill their promise.”(16) In modern times it has been observed that “when a Maravar takes food in the house of a stranger, he will take a pinch of earth and put it on the food before he commences his meal.”(17) This act freed him from the debt of blood rice.<a href="http://www.tamilnation.org/forum/sivaram/920601lg.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tamilnation.org/forum/sivaram/920601lg.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>

<p>Coin dispensers are primarily used in Europe by the Bus and Taxi industry and should be distinguished from electronic coin sorters which often used in a retail environment. Coin dispensers in contrast are manually operated and have the purpose of securely storing and swiftly distributing change to its operator (bus/taxi driver, coin dispensers are not operated by the public).Used since the 1960's most types of dispensers consist of a bank of individual coin tubes of different denominations with a funnel at the top to allow the coin to be stacked in the tube. Coins are ejected at the base of the unit by the operation of a lever mechanism on the front of the machine. Most units have a rear mounting which allow the dispenser to be fitted to the cab.</p>
<p>The coin dispenser which dominates the British Bus industry is the UK made Quick change unit. The other popular unit is the Cambist unit which is made in Sweden. Collectors often neglect this important part of the fare collection industry in favor of focusing on both ticket machines and more notably tickets themselves. However, coin dispensers have and continue to play an important part in transport fare collection with many major bus campaniles in Britain and Europe using them.</p>

<p>Wendy is the face of ITV Anglia Weather. Her first job was as the editor of the Filby Journal (actually, she was also the writer, photographer, financer, printer and distributor), which lead to a job as reporter for the Great Yarmouth and Waveney Advertiser. At the same time she became ‘Wicked Wendy’ for Norwich's Broadland 102 and was sent on special missions for the Rob and Chrissie Breakfast Show. All this a few months after leaving a Media and Communications course at Goldsmiths College in London.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Singing in the rain</b></p>
<p>Her Grandmother and Mother passed on a singing talent, her Grandfather played clarinet in a jazz band and her Father played rock and roll across Europe. Wendy’s own musical debut came at the age of 4 as the all singing, all dancing ‘Back Legs of the Panto Horse’. In 2006 she revisited those humble beginnings, appearing as 'Fairy Beansprout' in Jack and the Beanstalk at the Gorleston Pavillion in Norfolk for OhYesItIz Productions. She continues to front soul and funk band, Night<i>train</i> and is trying to teach herself guitar.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Other interests</b></p>
<p>She's a keen traveller and has begun to learn some Spanish. She also supports local charity, Young Urbanites and has abseiled buildings in their support more times than most people have changed their socks.</p>

<p><b>Sylph Online is a free 2D MMORPG.</b> <i>The whole game idea started December 21, 2006.</i></p>
<p><b>Here is the main story and theme of Sylph Online. ( it also explains the importance of the sylph.</b></p>
<p>In Game You do not have to choose to join a faction, but it is important to our roleplay experience. When you create a guild you can choose to register it with a certain faction or to leave it as independtant. we eventually plan on having war events and official battles to go along with the story. Probably GM:s will roleplay as leaders of each faction.</p>
<p>1000 years ago the Sylph aided the creator in forming A Perfect world.</p>
<p>Noras, the High Sylph of Light created the sylph gaurdians of dawn to watch over the</p>
<p>daylight.</p>
<p>Iptus, the High Sylph of Darkness created the sylph gaurdians of dusk to watch over the</p>
<p>Night.</p>
<p>Milara, the High Sylph of Balance created the sylph gaurdians of twilight to protect the</p>
<p>delicate balance of power between day and night.</p>
<p>Afterwards :</p>
<p>The planet was filled with life, this life was protected by the guardians from evil.</p>
<p>However, The night began to grow jealous of the day and began a plot against him. He would</p>
<p>bring about a pandemonium and secure the world under eternal darkness.</p>
<p>Noras heard of this plan and immediately prepared for battle. He wished to irradicate the</p>
<p>night-secring daylight's reign over the land.</p>
<p>Milara, got wind of the plan and fearing a war sealed cast a spell on the land. The spell</p>
<p>would seal the powers of each sylph in eternal slumber thus preventing a major war.</p>
<p>The spell gave power to the world and allowed beings to utilize the power of the sylph.</p>
<p><br />
The beings of earth continued to flourish and grow, using magic and machine to advance their society. while the sylph slept...</p>
<p>Until recently, the Sylph have slept in a peacful slumber, and the people have worked</p>
<p>together as one.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, power hungry members of society plan touse the power of the ancient sylph to control the world.</p>
<p>Thus, 3 factions have divided Liras.</p>
<p><br />
Sylph Online is a unique fantasy story about the beginnings war on the continent of Liras Between the 3 Factions of Dawn, Twilight, and Dusk. The Dusk and Dawn Factions have specific</p>
<p>goals related to the advent of the pandemonium.</p>
<p>The Dawn:</p>
<pre>
 The Faction Of Light is centered in the western lands of lira. They wish to create a world 
</pre>
<p>of perpetual Day in hopes of preventing the pandemonium.This faction is full of radicals who wish to erradicate the dusk who betrayed the world. They follow the teaching of Noras, the</p>
<p>High Sylph of dawn.</p>
<p><br />
The Dusk:</p>
<pre>
 The Faction of darkness is centered in the eastern Lands of Lira. These Men And women hope 
</pre>
<p>to create a world of eternal night in order to bring about the pandemonium. They wish to</p>
<p>take over the world by harnessing the power of demons. They follow the teachings of the High</p>
<p>Sylph Iptus.</p>
<p><br />
The Twilight:</p>
<pre>
These Men and women wish to restore the balance between night and day. Powered by the 
</pre>
<p>twilight Sylph of High Sylph Milara, they wish to bring the world back into its former</p>
<p>glory. They do not wih for the coming of pandemonium but have tsken a more neutral approach. They only wish for peace.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-03-29_a165.html" title="Edit section: Welsh Archers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Welsh Archers</span></h2>
<p>welsh archers</p>
<p><br />
Very little is known about the longbow men of medieval Wales. This is odd as they were all renown for their legendary skills as archers. Hailing primarily from southern Wales, Longbow men trained from early childhood to master the use of the bow. Mostly used for hunting at this age, their skills eventually developed into that of a hardened warrior. So strict was their training that the ability to fire ten well-aimed shots a minute was considered status quo. Welsh archers were considered the most powerful archers in all Great Britain. They were mostly from southern Wales whose elite hailed from Gwent. Northern Wales was more accustomed to the use of spears, particularly those of Merionethshire and Cynan. This did not mean that either half of the country was lacking forms of troops. While the archers were capable of very great ranges, they often chose to use their bows at close range during ambushes. This would have inevitably proved fatal for anyone caught in the attack. So great was the power of welsh bows that one archer was recorded to have fired a shot which struck a horseman in his leg, penetrated the entire leg and saddle, pinning him to his steed and killing the horse in the process. This was not the only display of power. During fighting at Abergavenny Castle, Arrows striking the castle’s solid oak gate penetrated so deeply some men claimed to have seen the arrowheads on the other side. It is confirmed however, that one of the arrows penetrated as much as 4” into the door. In honor of this massive display, the lord of the castle decreed that the arrows should not be removed, but should remain as a testament to the prowess of the welsh archers. The Welsh, having limited military might, were best suited to hit-and-run tactics. As such their armor reflected this agile nature. Most Warriors wore a linen shirt and drawers which were usually red. Over they chose a woolen cloak which hung to the knees. This cloak was occasionally described as being thin. As for their feet, it is suggested by various manuscripts that the Welsh wore only one shoe in battle. This was most likely due to the fact that bare feet could achieve a better grip on the hilly and rough terrain which surrounded them. As for their hair, it was usually kept short supposedly because it was easier to care for. Similarly Beards were not considered popular although a good number wore moustaches. Using the more powerful longbow as opposed to the traditional short bow, they were capable of greater ranges and bower than most average bowmen. Their bows were usually around six feet tall; sometimes larger than the archer itself. The welsh chose to make their bows out of elm wood which was different from any other method of the time. It was sturdier than other bows and could reach even greater ranges. It seems almost paradoxical that it was used primarily as an ambush weapon. Still the Welsh did see their bows used in open combat as witnessed by the defenders of Abergavenny Castle. As well the archers were occasionally employed by the English. They were used by Edward the Long shanks during his campaign against Scotland. However, morale would be terrible for these archers who often quarreled with the French Gascons. Actual fighting would occasionally break out between the two, and against the English themselves.</p>

<p>Urban Myth (UM) is an independent, artist-run recording collective founded in 1996 by Toronto songwriters <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Bryk_7c5d.html" title="Dan Bryk">Dan Bryk</a> and Chris Warren. Other recording artists who have released recordings through UM include Brooklyn's Lee Feldman, Los Angeles native Corey Landis, Torontonian Chris Staig, and Luke Jackson (of London, England).</p>
<p>According to UM's web site, "At times Urban Myth pretends to be a co-operative record label, and sometimes operates as a casual if exclusive club of misunderstood singer/songwriter-types that defy easy categorization."</p>
<p>Urban Myth recordings are financed by the artists, who retain ownership of their copyrights and master recordings. UM's primary roles are to facilitate physical and digital distribution, arrange and administer synchronization rights, and assist in marketing and promotion.</p>

<p>Several years ago, the Manhattan-born, Miami-bred, Joseph Quevedo as known as “Joseph Quevedo, Q” exploded in the world of music as an unknown musician. Although it would be any casual observer's inclination to be both distracted and mesmerized by his youth, Joseph Quevedo quickly became a fixture on the MASN charts, gracing the pages of magazines and winning a multitude of awards and polls.</p>
<p>Though he's still in his 20's, Joseph Quevedo shows virtuosity the moment he picks up a pair of drumsticks. Quevedo’s musical talents go well beyond his years, and his skills have long exceeded anyone's expectations of a young musician. He plays with emotion, depth, and the self-assuredness of a more seasoned pro. With his recent touring and recording experience, a more polished, accomplished and sophisticated artist has emerged. The young man with the big dream is no longer dreaming.</p>
<p>Joseph Quevedo, also seems as ready as ever to tackle the challenges of artistry as ministry, and the confines of an increasingly public personal life that accompanies celebrity. He draws strength from his unshakable faith. Today, Joseph Quevedo, receives letters from young fans and their parents, who admire his ability to shine as a bright role model, even under the unforgiving glare of the national spotlight.</p>
<p>Even though he has played at Madison Square Garden, at Carnegie Hall and many other ventures throughout the country, Joseph Quevedo, considers his greatest moment as an artist in a performance he gave at the University of Miami Theater. "I love helping people," he explains. "I may not know them, but just thinking that a few moments or simple words can be part of a person's memories and for me to know that I was part of it - I treasure that." Asked what his wildest dream is, as if it isn't already becoming true, he smiles enthusiastically, "My desire to someday take my gifts into the field of pastorship and psychology." Joseph Quevedo, is now doing international touring and recording.</p>
<p>Joseph Quevedo, has won the 2003 People &amp; Times Award for Best International Drummer of the Year. He was also nominated for two other awards including: Rock/Pop Session Recording of the Year and Best Innovative Musician in New York's World-Wide Music Ambassador Awards in 2004. Joseph Quevedo, and his inspirational concerts landed him the prestigious Golden Drum Award for the Most Inspirational Drummer of 2005.</p>
<p>Also coming soon, Joseph Quevedo, teamed up with Producers Mel Morley and Levan Trujillo to record a CD entitled “Boiling Point”, which will be released in April 2007. Strong City Records is even thinking about creating an instructional drum video called Drum Basics with Joseph Quevedo. It will feature all of his insight on music simplicity with evolution plus exclusive interviews with the artist. More details still to come…</p>

<p>DBA Certification The "Big Three" Databases</p>
<p>The market value of any DBA certification is directly tied to the market share of its DBMS. The late 1990s saw the database market consolidate around the "big three" vendors: Oracle, IBM and Microsoft. From this standpoint, it makes little sense to certify for any database other than those from these vendors.</p>
<p><br />
Figure 1: Database Market Share</p>
<p>Figure 1 shows that Oracle and IBM are roughly tied in overall database market share, at one-third of the market each, while Microsoft trails at one-sixth of the market. No other vendors come close. Look at the breakdown among the Big Three by platform. Oracle predominates under UNIX and ties Microsoft for leadership on Windows Server. IBM DB2 owns the mainframe and AS/400 platforms with decent UNIX presence as well. Microsoft's SQL Server ties for Windows Server leadership, but does not run on any other platform. Database market share on the rapidly growing Linux platform is yet to be determined. Getting Certified</p>
<p>Beyond the role of the database management system (DBMS) products in the industry, look at what each vendor's DBA certification entails. All vendors offer a variety of database-related certifications - here we focus on DBA certification.</p>
<p>Every vendor controls certification for its products. In working toward a DBA certification, you accept that you are comfortable with that company's certification program. Log into the company's Web site, read the latest information and terms for certification and make sure it fits your needs before spending the time and money to certify. Figure 2 lists the vendor Web sites and certification home pages.</p>
<p><br />
Figure 2: Three DBA Certifications Compared</p>
<p>For any DBA certification, one takes a series of tests. Sign up for the tests through either of two testing organizations on their Web sites: Prometric (www.vue.com) or by calling numbers they provide on their Web sites. Both companies have testing centers throughout the country. You show up at the agreed-upon time, show picture ID and are assigned an on- site PC where you take the multiple-choice test(s) for which you signed up.</p>
<p>Since each vendor develops its own tests, how long and hard they are will vary. Typically, you answer between 40 and 80 questions over 60 to 90 minutes. All tests are multiple choice, in which a correct guess counts as a correct answer. (Microsoft is moving towards what it calls "adaptive testing," where the number and difficulty of questions varies according to your responses). After you pass all tests required for DBA certification, you'll receive a vendor packet in the mail, typically containing a congratulatory letter, ID card, lapel pin and frameable certificate. The DBA Certifications</p>
<p>Here are the specifics of DBA certification with each vendor. Vendor Web sites give further details.</p>
<p>To become an Oracle- certified DBA (OCP- DBA), you must pass five tests. Take them in any order. The tests are:</p>
<pre>
   * Introduction to Oracle: SQL and PL/SQL
   * Architecture and Administration
   * Performance and Tuning
   * Backup and Recovery
   * Network Administration
</pre>
<p>Simply by the number of tests required, Oracle's DBA certification is the most stringent of the Big Three vendors. The benefit is that it is clearly the most marketable as well. Online and print job ads often refer to the OCP-DBA (DB2 and SQL Server ads rarely refer to DBA certification).</p>
<p>As do the other vendors, Oracle offers a variety of database-related certifications. For Oracle these include those for Database Operator, Application Developer and Java Developer.</p>
<p><br />
Figure 3: IBM DB2 Certification Road Map</p>
<p>In contrast to Oracle's monolithic approach, IBM's program is modular. Figure 3 diagrams how to attain the various DB2 certifications. First pass the test, "DB2 Family Fundamentals," which certifies you as a "Certified DB2 User." Then, choose to pass any of four different tests: each certifies you as an "IBM Certified Solutions Expert" in one particular area. For example, to become a certified DB2 DBA for OS/390, you next pass the test "DB2 UDB for OS/390 Database Administration." Or, to become a certified DBA for the UNIX and Windows platforms, pass the test "DB2 UDB for UNIX, Windows and OS/2 Database Administration." All tests are independent of one another, so that after passing the "DB2 Family Fundamentals" exam, you can pick and choose whichever certification(s) you think appropriate.</p>
<p>There are also tests that certify you as an "Advanced Technical Expert" in any one of three areas: DB2 Clusters, DB2 DRDA and DB2 Data Replication. Pick and choose among these three independent tests in the same manner you do with the four basic "Solutions Expert" certifications.</p>
<p>IBM's modular approach offers candidates the greatest flexibility in terms of how many tests they take, which they take and what certifications they achieve. But IBM's program is the newest: whether its DBA certification attains the marketability of Oracle's remains to be seen.</p>
<p><br />
Figure 4: Microsoft SQL Server Certification Road Map</p>
<p>Microsoft presently requires candidates to pass four tests for its DBA certification (MCDBA). You become a Microsoft Certified Professional (MCP) by virtue of passing any one of the four tests and attain the MCDBA after passing the other three.</p>
<p>Figure 4 shows the road map to MCDBA certification. You pass two core tests on SQL Server itself as well as one test on Windows Server. You must also pass one elective test, which you select from a generous list.</p>
<p>If you already hold other current Microsoft certification(s), you could apply relevant test(s) towards the MCDBA as well. For example, if you are an MCSE, your Windows Server test could apply to the MCDBA as well.</p>
<p>Sybase certifies database administrator's at two levels: associate and professional. You take one test to certify as an associate administrator and then one more to certify as a professional. As do the other vendors, Sybase offers study guidelines and sample tests at their Web site, www.sybase.com. They also sell sample test CDs through their Web site for between $59 and $99 each. Sybase tests contain 60 to 70 questions, and you must answer about 75 percent correctly to pass.</p>
<p>Teradata offers six certifications: three "Baseline Certifications" and three "Job Role Certifications."</p>
<p>Passing one test, "Teradata Basics," awards you the first Baseline Certification. Advance to "Teradata Certified Implementation Specialist" by passing one more test on "Physical Implementation." Or, take the test on "SQL" to become a "Teradata Certified SQL Specialist."</p>
<p>Each of the more advanced Job Role Certifications builds on the Baseline Certifications. To become a "Teradata Certified Administrator," add the "Administration" test to your "Teradata Certified Implementation Specialist" certification.</p>
<p>Similarly, the "Teradata Certified Design Specialist" adds the "Design" test to the same baseline certification. Finally, the "Teradata Certified Application Developer" requires one test beyond the "Teradata Certified SQL Specialist" baseline certification, on "Application Development."</p>
<p>Get full details on the Teradata program from their certification homepage at <a href="http://global.ncreducation.com/" class="external free" title="http://global.ncreducation.com/" rel="nofollow">http://global.ncreducation.com/</a> t eradata/. The site includes an online exam guide and offers free practice tests. Teradata exams cost from $100 to $300 each and are taken at Prometric testing centers. Keeping Current</p>
<p>One hidden cost to all DBA certifications is the need to keep current as the vendors release new versions of their products. For the OCP-DBA, for example, you take one upgrade test every time a new version of Oracle comes out. If you certified with Oracle7, you would have taken the "Oracle8: New Features for Administrators" upgrade test to certify with Oracle8. There are equivalent upgrade tests for Oracle 8i and 9i.</p>
<p>How frequently you must take upgrade tests depends on how frequently new DBMS releases come out.</p>
<p>Keeping the MCDBA current is most difficult of any of the DBA certifications because its depends on releases of both SQL Server and Windows Server. Thus you must pass upgrade tests when either Windows Server or SQL Server releases change. Furthermore, Microsoft is the only major DBMS company to require you to pass upgrade tests on their timetable, or else they take away your certification. Perhaps this gives Microsoft leverage in forcing product upgrades on customers, but it is a bad deal for certification candidates. IBM and Oracle prompt you to take upgrade tests but do not take away any certification you have already earned if you do not keep current. Instead, they let the market handle it - the value of your certification declines over time as customers upgrade to new software if you don't upgrade your DBA certification. The Secrets to Success</p>
<p>With all three DBA certifications, there are unwritten secrets to passing. First, schedule only a single test initially and get a feel for what they're like before scheduling any others. Then you can better judge your strategy for further tests.</p>
<p>You'll need hands-on product experience to pass. If you don't get it at work, you can install any of the databases on your home PC. All three vendors offer free trial versions of their products. You can download them from the vendor Web sites or simply purchase a book with the DBMS product on the enclosed CD. Dozens of books contain the databases. Oracle gives you a full Enterprise Edition license for a limited number of users to run under Windows, Linux or UNIX. (You might also learn via Oracle's new DBA Simulators, available via the Web site address given in Figure 2.) IBM gives you a 90-trial version of DB2, while Microsoft offers a 120-day trial version of their Enterprise Edition. With any of the trial products, don't worry if the trial period runs out: you can always reinstall the product. The vendors are only trying to prevent customer sites from running real databases without paying for it.</p>
<p>It is very important to take sample tests prior to going into an exam. All three vendors offer brief assessment tests on their Web sites. Many Oracle candidates buy sample tests from Self Test Software at www.selftestsoftware.com. For Microsoft, the tests from Transcender at www.transcender.com are golden. In either case, you purchase one CD per DBA certification test, at prices ranging from $100 to $150 each. The bill adds up, but many candidates for the Oracle and Microsoft tests feel that these sample tests are the key to passing. Sometimes companies shoulder this cost for their employees by buying in-house copies (if your company has not done so, you might suggest they do). Contractor firms almost always provide these CDs to their contractors to encourage certification.</p>
<p>DB2 does not yet enjoy an add-on market of independent sample tests. But whereas Oracle and Microsoft have dozens of competing certification books, there is a clearly identified set of certification guides for the IBM DB2 tests. All are published by Prentice Hall PTR at</p>
<p>www.phptr.com. Studying these guides is key to passing the IBM tests. They also include what sample tests are available (beyond those on IBM's Web site). Another key to the DB2 tests is the free, downloadable course IBM offers at their web site: www- 4.ibm.com/software/data/db2/selfstudy/. This is an excellent resource.</p>
<p>To choose certification books for Oracle or Microsoft tests, simply check out the shelves at Borders Bookstores or Barnes and Noble, and you can leaf through them and see which you like. You can also read reviews from certification candidates at www.amazon.com and www.fatbrain.com. Order the books from any of these sources. For IBM, use the official certification guides previously mentioned. In all cases, you should study from at least two books, rather than just relying on a single source. No single source covers everything you need to know to pass the DBA tests.</p>
<p>Experienced DBAs sometimes ask: "Can I pass the tests without studying?" Nope. All three vendors have designed their tests such that studying specifically for the tests is necessary to pass. An experienced DBA can, however, pass without attending for the various courses vendors recommend. A new or less-experienced person might require such courses from the vendor or a third-party education source.</p>
<p>At the cost of several hundred dollars per day, such classes are the single biggest cost in your certification effort, if you must take them.</p>
<p>Finally, there is an entire universe of certification secrets and actual test questions posted on various Web sites. The quality of these sources varies, and what they offer is not guaranteed accurate. Find them by searching for "DBA certification" via your search engine or simply ask about them in the online discussion groups for your database. The Costs</p>
<p>Ultimately, whether you judge a DBA certification to be worthwhile means weighing the costs versus the benefits. The major costs are:</p>
<pre>
   * Testing fees
   * Books
   * Sample test CDs
   * Courses (if any)
   * Your time and effort
</pre>
<p>Figure 2 lists the testing fees for DBA certifications. They range from $240 for DB2 to $625 for Oracle. But as the chart mentions, it is possible to test for free (IBM) or at reduced rates for beta tests (Oracle and Microsoft).</p>
<p>Books cost a bit, but the sample test CDs so useful to passing the Oracle and Microsoft tests are a more significant cost. At $100 each, you would pay about $500 for CDs from Self Test Software to cover all the Oracle exams. Transcender disks for the Microsoft tests vary from</p>
<p>$100 to $150 each. (See current pricing for both at their Web sites www.selftestsoftware.com and www.transcender.com).</p>
<p>Classes are the biggest single certification cost. Experienced professionals won't need them, but for others, the key is convincing your company to pay for them. Many companies will pay when they know certification is the end result, because this quantifies the value they reap from their investment in employee development.</p>
<p>Time is the final cost to consider. Time for reading, studying, taking sample tests, and hands-on experience with the databases. As with classes, if your company supports you, your effort is reduced. For others, you'll have to consider whether the certification is worth your free time.</p>
<p>Lastly, there is a hidden cost most certification articles never mention. The time, effort and cost to certify is such that few professionals can afford to certify on more than one product. So</p>
<p>certification, to some degree, ties your career to the fate of the product you've chosen. If the product prospers, so does your career. Likewise, if it falters. A DBA certification deepens your knowledge but also narrows your field of expertise. It renders your career more product-dependent, even as it enforces specialization. These concepts are worth some deep thought prior to committing. The Benefits</p>
<p>An entire industry is devoted to convincing you that certification is worthwhile. Vendors and the educational sector make a lot of money from certification tests, books, CDs, courses, online training and all the rest. We'll try to be more objective.</p>
<p>Those with marginal credentials benefit most. For example, if you are new to the product, certification enhances your knowledge and provides a trump card proving your commitment to learning it. Someone switching fields (from programmer to DBA, for example) can use certification to show credentials. A student entering IT, or a parent who took a few years off to raise children, can employ certification to successfully spring into the labor force.</p>
<p>How about the experienced individual? Many want to certify for the challenge, for the fun or to deepen their product knowledge. Others use it to keep up on new releases. But it's quite true that for many of those with years of experience, certification is just another credential competing for your time. If certification gains ascendancy in your field, you might suddenly have to have this new credential to remain part of the club of respected professionals. Oracle's DBA certification has, arguably, gained this status; IBM's and Microsoft's have not. Many experienced professionals are dismayed at the prospect of having to attain "yet another credential" when they are already highly productive in their jobs.</p>
<p>Lastly, contractors benefit from certification because they sell narrow skill sets and must claim to be immediately productive. Someone with several years experience and a current DBA certification looks like a good bet for many contractor positions. Is DBA Certification Worth It?</p>
<p>Whether you certify as a DBA is a highly personal decision, because the costs and benefits vary by the individual. Take a sheet of paper and list what you see as the costs and benefits in your own case. Prioritize each as "major" or "minor." Then use the information in this article as your springboard to further investigation before making a decision. ...............................................................................</p>

<pre>
The Lime Green Royals is a street gang located in St.George, Utah where it began in 2003. The group mainly consist of Tongans and Hispanics. It is said that they got their name from two gangs stemming from Compton, California (Lime Hood Piru, aka "Fruit Town") and the other from Chicago, Illinois (Simon City Royals). 
</pre>
<p>Since the town of St.George was known for it's strong involement with the LDS, Catholic, Methodist, and Baptist chuch the gang first started up with the name "Saint City Royals", then changed it not long after to "Lime Green Royals". They gang members chose the color lime green because they thought it was a nuetral color. That soon changed when a member of the Lime Hood Piru came into town to visit a relative who had been a resident in St.George at the time. This relative lived in Green Valley, a neighborhood that was territory to local Samoan street gang called Meadow Veiw Piru aka MVP. When the member of the Lime Hood Piru came into Green Valley he was shot at by members of MVP by mistake. He was hit twice, once in the leg and once in the back, but he survived. The news spread quickly amongst the LG Royals that MVP wanted to take them out. Members of both gangs decided to meet at the Arizona Strip (an abonded highway locted in St.George) for a simple meeting. When the members of MVP got there they did not see any member from the LG Royals. They went back into town thinking that LG had backed down but when they got to Green Valley some of the members houses were burnt down and the walls in the neighborhood were tagged with the words LG Royals in lime green spray paint.</p>
