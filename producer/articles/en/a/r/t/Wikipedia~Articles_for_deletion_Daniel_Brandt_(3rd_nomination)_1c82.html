<li>So just an observation: This comment has survived multiple edits by administrators that ostensibly were to "remove personal attacks." How is it that the people who saw Brandt's comments as "personal attacks" didn't see this one? Is "Batshit Insanity" now an appropriate way to refer to people? It seems to be a classic "hive mind" demonstration. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 16:11, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Dude, it may be that you feel Wikipedia is <i>very important</i> and the doings of its community are exciting, but the world largely ignores the latter and doesn't pay much mind to how the former gets made. Daniel Brandt is "notable" to people active in the project space but not to the outside world. Why not give the guy what he wants? Other articles have been censored on less ground. We can't even have one about Brian Peppers and Brandt is less noted than Peppers.<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 00:17, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>But they <i>don't</i> permanently lock anything; those office-action locks are temporary, and the "controversial info" might also only be temporarily deleted; it can usually return if it's meticulously sourced. Partisans against the article's subject usually still don't like it, since much of their critical info has to stay out because it doesn't have a reliable source (blogs and Usenet generally don't count), but it doesn't end up deleted altogether, locked permanently, or a total whitewash in favor of the article's subject either. <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 04:59, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>The question was whether he has the power and the answer is yes. Front Office locks are the power. How they choose to use it to protect Wikimedia Foundation is up to them. It is a smart thing to do because societies laws are different than the rules on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 05:10, 6 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The laws are indeed different but as wikipedia clearly isn't breaking the laws of the United States it would be really silly to pretend otherwise. I don't believe Jimbo has the power to permanently lock this article without bringing wikipedia into such a state of uncredibility that the project would rapidly collapse as that isn't how wikipedia works and to imagine Jimbo is some super-dictator with the power to go against consensu is misplaced, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 05:16, 6 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It wouldn't be against consensus. Certainly, and this goes to the group dynamics of Wikipedia, if Jimbo put a vote up for delete, he would get enough support. Also, Wikipedia is not a democracy. The warning at the top clearly states that this really isn't a vote. Daniel Brandt's user page was deleted outright because he cited the new Florida law and editors assessed that as a violation of internal wikipedia policy. Rather than just remove the threat and leave his requests, his page was completely deleted. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 16:03, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> How easy do you guys forget that Daniel Brandt saved all of Wikipedia's necks by identifying <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Chase_c5c1.html" title="Brian Chase">Brian Chase</a> as the hoaxer? If it had not been for Brandt, Wikipedia would have been in worse conditions and its credibility would have been destroyed forever, not that it isn't already seriously damaged, due to the Seigenthaler controversy. Wikipedia has a debt to owe to Brandt, whether they like it or not, and thus Wikipedia must fulfil the terms of Quid Pro Quo. Brandt saves Wikipedia from further embarassment in the Seigenthaler scandal, and Wikipedia therefore deletes his article <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathan_777_9412.html" title="User:Jonathan 777">Jonathan 777</a> 10:01, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>How did invading the privacy of a prankster whose false edit had already been reverted and deleted from the history save anybody's necks? And since when is Wikipedia edited on the basis of "Quid Pro Quo" or personal debts? How is the site's credibility changed, one way or the other, by finding out who was responsible for the prank? Anyway, Wikipedia's popularity (e.g., as measured by Alexa) went up through the roof when the scandal, and its resulting publicity, hit, so it hardly seems to have been harmful to it (not that I favor intentionally starting hoaxes like that to promote this site, no sirree!) <a href="../../../d/t/o/User%7EDtobias_c99c.html" title="User:Dtobias">*Dan T.*</a> 11:56, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Not true, Chase being uncovered didn't help wikipedia at all, the problem was identifying his vandalism not identifying him, arguably his identification didn't do wikipedia a favour though Dan is 100% right that wikipedia's popularity went through the roof due to that incident, eg becoming mainstream in the UK press for the first time ever, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 14:39, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Wow. Both of those posts are amazing. Brandt is not the bad guy for identifying the libelous editor. Libel is the enemy of wikipedia. Anonymity should not survive libel.

<li>You are certainly entitled to your interpretataion as well. Certainly he was frustrated with the law. I think his use of an attorney with Bell South and his obvious research into the law meant he was preparing to challenge it. He may still be lobbying for changes to the law based on his experience. I think his contact with Chase (made possible by Brandt) smoothed a lot of ruffled feathers.

What Brandt is NOT notable for however is, for example, to quote: "Brandt was born in China to missionary parents." nor is he notable for having his "student deferment classification was withdrawn by the local Selective Service System in December 1968 due to his public non-cooperation with his draft board, Brandt was convicted of failure to report for a pre-induction physical exam and refusal to submit to induction. Brandt appealed and his convictions were reversed on the grounds that he was entitled to student status as an undergraduate at USC (see U.S. v. Brandt, 435 F.2d 324 (9th Cir. 1970))." No, the consumers are interested in only 5 things about Brandt: Google Watch, Wikipedia Watch, NameBase, Yahoo Watch, and Wikipedia Review. That's it.

<li>Under what moral authority does wikipedia decide who is notable and who is not? For newspapers, I know who to hold accountable for errors, slander, etc. If I don't want my name in the phonebook anymore, I know where to go even if it was once in the phonebook. But Wikipedia is a vast anonymous, permanent archive of information about, in this case, people. Long after the links have died and the newspapers been destroyed, the claims and words (right or wrong) of wikipedia will live on. Wikipedia has no inherent right to be "gap free" in it's information. It has Great Goals, but that has to be juxtaposed against it's potential for Great Harm. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 21:48, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Morality doesn't (or at least, shouldn't) enter into the consideration.

<dd>It certainly does come into play. If I found your name in www.whitepages.com along with your address, Wikipedia would not let me use it's space to publish it.

<li>Moral tiebreakers don't enter into the equation for the example you cite, because it's already disqualified on other grounds before the question even arises. If you found my name in www.whitepages.com, you wouldn't be permitted to add it to Wikipedia because www.whitepages.com is not a legitimate source, as defined by policies and guidelines. The only circumstances under which my address would appear in a legitimate source would involve some sort of noteworthy event happening at my home, and thus receiving coverage in mainstream media sources. Situations of this type have already been successfully resolved on numerous occasions, such as the removal of the alleged "real names" of several porn stars (which were not adequately sourced).</li>
<li>The doctrine of notability, while not formally defined within policy, is a reasonable and logical extension of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>/<a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> (in that things which are not notable are not covered by legitimate sources), as well as <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> (in that things which are not notable are only known to those who are directly involved with them, who are strongly discouraged from creating articles on those topics). Thus, the encyclopedia's resistance to articles about non-notable subjects is eminently reasonable, rooted within policies and guidelines. -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 06:26, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think you misunderstand. I could get plenty of evidence from government documents alone that would not be allowed to be posted on wikipedia because of it's privacy policies. The title on your home is a public document. Brandt, on his own Website, lists public domain information about Wikipedia editors. Even outside of Wikipedia, wikipedians apply internal website rules and he was banned under <i><a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia policy: No personal attacks</a></i> for this external behavior. And to counter this, there are other Notability requirements beyond being in the newspaper that are applied (somewhat haphazardly). Case in point: <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Doyle_2de1.html" title="Brian Doyle">Brian Doyle</a> and Lori Weiner. Both worked in politics. Both committed crimes (or one is accused and one has plead guilty). One crime was related to their political job and one crime was done outside the scope of their job. One is a serious felony one is misdemeanor. All of these come in to play when determining notability for an encyclopedia. Both of those people are WAY more notable than Daniel Brandt. But one will likely be deleted and one will likely be kept. There is no reason or standard to choose one over the other but the community will. There is no oversight to remove or check systematic biases in the community. Systematic biases don't harm science or dead people. They DO have the potential to harm living people by invading privacy, libelling them real time and putting them in harms way. I find it ironic that Wikipedia has a policy about revealing personal information about editors (public domain or not) but a "no holds barred" attitude on whatever "notability" standard it creates. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 21:47, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Tbeatty suggests that there is information in the public domain that would not be allowed on Wikipedia solely in view of our privacy policies; this is, to my knowledge and in view of my interpretations of Wikipedia policies, plainly incorrect. The revelant concerns we would confront in deciding whether "public domain" knowledge should be included in a Wikipedia article would be whether the information, if entered, would represent original research (where we would, I think, apply that appellative--the nebulous quality of which I readily recognize--to mean that information one posts on Wikipedia otherwise unpublished from a city's property tax record site would be original research, whilst information featured in a newspaper article about a given person's property tax records would not be original research; upon the latter determination, and in view of the publication of information elsewhere, a link could then be given to the primary source [i.e., here, the city's property tax record site]) and whether the information would be relevant to the article and of sufficient notability to be encyclopedic (as the privacy policy explains, even accurate phone numbers, e-mail addresses, etc., are not considered encyclopedic; I don't believe the policy is framed as it is exclusively in view of privacy concerns, but also in view of notability/encyclopedic quality concerns). Notwithstanding Tbeatty's reasoned points apropos of the difficulties of creating a notability calculus by which to judge articles categorically, it is plainly wrong to say that there is public domain information that Wikipedia would not post out of privacy concerns; never would privacy concerns exclusively militate sufficiently against the inclusion of information to lead to the outcome of our removing/not adding information (of course, some users may feel different morally--I surely do not--but their views do not seem represented in the policies or guidelines of Wikipedia; in any case, there is surely no legal claim one can essay against another's posting publicly-available information about the former, so on those narrow grounds--which aren't exactly "on all fours" with the Brandt case but are with the hypos of which Tbeatty and I write--there can be made no legitimate objection to the inclusion of public information). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 22:24, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>What I saying there is a <i>notability standard</i> that is arbitrary. The standard isn't whether there is public domain documents about a person. The standard isn't that the person was in the newspaper. The person who commented above me seemed to be saying that notability means there is a public record and therefore all people who have a public record could be notable. Certainly if we found original conviction documents of a notable person, that original document would be referenced. But what is a notable person? It is extremely arbitrary. I would argue Lauren B. Weiner is way more notable than Daniel Brandt. But Brandt pissed off a lot of Wikipedians so he is more notable to Wikipedians. That's an interesting standard but not exactly encyclopedic. It seems to me that it is a community vanity of sorts. As for privacy, if I posted information about "jaheigel" schooling, city of residence, POB, parental heritage, etc on my user page, it's a privacy violation and I would get banned. But if I create an article based on some dubious clame of notability, all that information would be up for a vote and editing. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 22:56, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>FWIW, I do provide all of that information on request and divulge most of it on my disorganized userpage. Irrespective of that, though, I have conceded that the "notability standards" are arbitrary, but I think it should be said that "notability", as I understand it, doesn't mean "popular notability", but, rather, "encyclopedic notability". Even as Lauren Weiner is better known to the public writ large at this time, Daniel Brandt is better known to &lt;elitism&gt; well-educated people &lt;/elitism&gt; and to the public writ large in general (that is, he surely will be, over time, a more prominent personnage). I certainly don't think that notability stems from one's having publicly-accessible records, but I do think one's having 72,000 Ghits (cf., my having 173, of which more than half are about others who share my name) creates a presumption of notability, especially when the several on the first three pages are articles about the Brandt that feature interviews or quotes. Fundamentally, the question to be resolved, I think, is whether, absent Brandt's dealings with Wikipedia, anyone would still be suggesting that he's notable. I am sure that some who find him notable now do so largely or only in view of his involvement with Wikipedia (which isn't altogether wrong; I simply think that our project is still esoteric enough that his involvement with us isn't encylcopedic [as against, for example, his involvement with Google]), but I think the majority of us would find him notable irrespective of his Wikipedia involvement, toward which proposition I adduce the many failed AfD nominations for articles the subjects of which are surely "less notable" than Brandt my any standard, even one that he might create. Were you to create a page about me giving my city of residence, schooling, parentage, and POB, you almost surely would not be banned; we regularly have users create pages about individuals whom they think to be notable, and those users, where they are not acting in bad faith or attempting to damage the encyclopedia, are not banned. It is true that there is no singular standard by which to adjudge notability, such that not every Wikipedian would have the same reasons for thinking Brandt to be notable and me not to be notable, but, of course, there's some beauty in that; each Wikipedian has somewhat different views, the conflation of which becomes policy, with the idea that "the more voices, the better". <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 23:24, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Having looked up Ms. Weiner, I think your comparison is something of a stretch. Mr. Doyle's job arguably made him notable even before his arrest, while Ms. Weiner's almost certainly didn't, and Mr. Doyle committed a much more serious crime (and as a result received substantially more media coverage). I'm not upset that we have an article on Ms. Weiner, but I wouldn't be upset if her article got deleted or merged back to the scandal, either. It's pretty borderline, in my opinion. Once the community arrives at an "arbitrary" consensus, we'll go forward with that. Arbitrary doesn't always equal bad, y'know; pretty much every organized system is made up of a succession of arbitrary decisions, once you look at a certain level of granularity. If it really bothers you that much in this case, though, you could always start a centralized discussion on notability standards for activists, cranks and media gadflies, to apply to people like Mr. Brandt in the future (serving a function analagous to <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> for musicians). As to what you're saying about Mr. Brandt himself, we're just going to have to agree to disagree. I think that if he'd received the same amount of media coverage for criticizing something else (Flickr, say), he'd still have an article. The article is probably more highly developed now than it'd be if he'd criticized something with which the user base was less familiar, but that doesn't really matter, since on a long enough time frame the improvement by successive approximations will essentially even out. -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 23:36, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> due to inability to maintain any sense of neutrality with the article. Its existed for a long time now, and its never been even vaguely neutral. Whilst its true that he might be vaguely notable, he wouldn't exist in any paper encyclopaedia, and hence he's not so notable to be an automatic inclusion. This article is meta. It talks about Wikipedia Watch, a criticism of when Brandt used Wikipedia, and it talks about Wikipedia's responses. How can you have such an article when the people writing it all come from such an obviously biased place? At best, someone else should write this, and then we should copy that over to Wikipedia. But seriously, why do we include an article that the subject does not want, when what we are saying is wholly negative? The article itself must be verging on a personal attack and possibly even constitute libel. It is wrong on so many levels to even consider this article. <a href="../../../5/9/2E/User%7E59.167.131.8.html" title="User:59.167.131.8">59.167.131.8</a> 06:42, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per above. Mr. Brandt is cited in the Register (14 March) and other publications in the last few weeks, which demonstrates his increasing notability. <a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJokestress_f864.html" title="User:Jokestress">Jokestress</a> 07:19, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: You know something's wrong with the world when you have six nested lists. Also, what I meant is that by a prior concensus which led to an implementation of a policy, there is no obligation placed upon any individual user to censor or Bowdlerize an article, and that the only obligation that the Wikipedia organization has as a whole is to the State of Florida (and even that is theoretical, as there is no legislation that directly affects Wikipedia that I know of, and we have never been taken to court!). - <strong><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorbinSimpson_55db.html" title="User:CorbinSimpson"><font color="#003399">Corbin</font></a></strong><em><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECorbinSimpson_68d4.html" title="User talk:CorbinSimpson"><font color="#009933">Simpson</font></a></em> 07:42, 9 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: So why did wikipedia admins censor the user page? There was no obligation. There is a written policy on no censorship. The fact is they did it for their own self interest.
