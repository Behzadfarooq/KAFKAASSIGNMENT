<dd>There is no conflict of interest here. I am the one who wrote this entry, not Ulmer, and I did it for the same reason. When preparing to teach a workshop to high school teachers about new media technologies, I turned to Wikipedia for a concise definition of the term and, when I didn't find one, I created the entry myself. This is supposed to be the purpose of the wiki form--collaborative encyclopedia composition. Shortly after creating the entry, I delivered a conference presentation <a href="http://www.masscue.org/conference/2006/6.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.masscue.org/conference/2006/6.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> with reference to the term and to the wikipedia entry. And I have recently had an essay accepted for publication in the organization's journal, on Cue <a href="http://www.masscue.org/publications/oncue.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.masscue.org/publications/oncue.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, in its Winter 2007 issue (forthcoming), in which I reference the term and the wikipedia article as well. A google search on the term yields 22,000+ hits, yet there is no one place to get a concise definition of the term. That was my purpose in writing this entry. <a href="../../../r/s/m/User%7ERsmyth_8789.html" title="User:Rsmyth">Rsmyth</a> 20:30, 6 January 2007 (EST)</dd>

<li>The article disagrees with you. You say "It is not a neologism," but the first words of the article are "Electracy is a neologism...." I suggest that this apparent failure to read the article you're expressing an opinion on invalidates that opinion. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Epopt_6905.html" title="User:The Epopt">➥the Epopt</a> 15:46, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>With respect The Epopt, WP does not exclude neologisms. NEO clearly states that they can be included if they conform to the two policies of: <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">OR</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">verifiable</a>. I personally have seen hundreds, if not thousands of neologisms in WP, it is impractical to say that any neologism should not be in WP. Finicky 02:02, 7 January 2007 (UTC) (newcomer, not a sockpuppet, if that is what you thought)</li>
<li>I want to add too, in case you didn't get my meaning The Epopt. I said the article was not a 'neologism' as per the qualities set out in the POL. Of course I read the article. Finicky 10:13, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep IF Edited</b>: I don't understand why the fact that it is a "neologism" is such a problem. "Blog" is a neologism but doesn't say that it is a neologism in the article. Should we remove "Blog" because it is a neologism? The article can easily be edited to remove the term neologism if that is the problem. Finicky's comment is not invalidated because she makes the point that it is not <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> and it is <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">verifiable</a>. Citations can be added to show that the term has been used by writers other than the author. The entry itself cites a source published by a reliable publisher as well as other scholarly work mentioning the term. For this reason, it is also "verifiable."

If an article is deleted according to certain conditions set out here, what is the process of getting the article submitted again, with changes made? In other words, the way an article is worded in the initial version does not necessarily mean the content is inadmissable. Should the article be changed whilst it is being debated or after?

<li><b>Keep</b>: I agree that perhaps the article requires some editing or alteration, but I feel that the term is an important one as there is no other term that carries the same connotations as this. I have come to use it in my own work and the arguments against it's status as a neologism are moot, in my opinion, considering that all words were at one time neologisms until they became widely used. That someone has not come across this word in the past 25 years is a ludicrous argument considering that 25 years ago, the word "blog" did not exist either, but no one questions its validity.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Not just "blog" - "wiki" didn't exist either. This discussion about neologisms is really putting me off using wikipedia and recommending it to my students. I want an up-to-date encyclopedia, not one which is embedded in old-fashioned thinking. Who makes these decisions about neologisms? How well read are they? Which disciplines do they come from? The first time I heard the term electracy was 1999. It is commonly used in the digital humanities. I will watch this discussion with interest because if electracy goes, so, probably, will I. <a href="../../../s/u/n/User%7ESunlight40_3580.html" title="User:Sunlight40">Sunlight40</a> 08:41, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
