<dd>Location Located on the vibrant street of Ford Road in the midst of a heavily saturated Arab and Muslim population, Fordson High School presents the epitome of immigration assimilation in America. Whether its G-Unit apparrel being worn in the newly constructed cafetria or a white Bentley with 22 inch chrome wheels, the stigma of modernization has truly spread across the students of this school. Thus, identity crisis has persisted due to lack of understanding of who they really are. Academics Fordson offers a dual semester program, with classes ranging from How to Cut a Knife with Purcell or Literatue/Philosophy with Misiakian (which offers nothing except nothing!)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - this vote is precisely why you deletionists are losing vote after vote after vote. Your criteria is simply ridiculous, and this childish delete vote comment demonstrates the problem. Many inclusionists believe that schools are inherently notable. While that is a debatable hypothesis, the obverse is simply not true. I can obviously hold that a school should be included because it is a school on the basis that schools are inherently notable, but it is ridiculously absurd to suggest that any given school should not be included on the basis of it being a school. <b>Some</b> schools are notable and encyclopaedic by even the most restrictive standards.

<li>For about a year now, some of the school-inclusionists have been putting in some serious work bringing school articles up to reasonable standards of quality. That is very helpful and a Good Thing. Factionalizing the debate and repeating stale old assertions over and over again is not helpful. Making general remarks about how all schools in general should be handled is not helpful.
