<li><b>Merge'</b> with <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gotomypc.html" title="Gotomypc">Gotomypc</a> and propose renaming to correct capitalization on the talk page.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Sorry, kind of bungled what I was getting at with the "mainstream popularity" thing. The MP3.com charts didn't really reflect <i>actual</i> popularity, as bands often found ways to bump their standings (especially given that there was a chart for every conceiveable subgenre). Honestly, that's probably minimal compared to the fact that the MP3.com charts no longer exist and are impossible to verify now (unlike, say, <i>Billboard</i>) and the source of the 100,000 downloads statement is the band's own <a href="http://www.jacksbrokenheart.com/touch/index2.html" class="external text" title="http://www.jacksbrokenheart.com/touch/index2.html" rel="nofollow">bio from their website</a>. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisB_39d0.html" title="User:ChrisB">ChrisB</a> 03:03, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Not to bog this down, but an AMG entry does not designate notability. My friend's band has an AMG entry (and they'll freely admit that they're not notable), as do countless no-name bands. Not to mention the fact that this band's entry <i>has no releases on it</i>. Additionally, it appears the band may not have actually undertaken said US tour - the statement in the Wiki article is verbatim from the band's bio on their website.

<b>Comment</b> - Just to clarify what the claims are here:</p>
<dl>
<dd>1) <i>Releasing a major label album is notable.</i> Seriously? You guys better sharpen up your article writing skills, cause that means Wiki is lacking about 15,000 bands that released major label albums.</dd>
<dd>2) <i>Being reviewed on AllMusic is notable.</i> Really? Again, better sharpen up your article writing skils, cause AllMusic is chock full of reviews of non-notable bands. My friend's band has both an AMG profile and a review - and they'll freely admit that they're not notable enough to have a Wiki article. (It just happened that an AMG reviewer liked their album and wrote a review. And any new album that gets a review gets a profile.) And I feel like letting AMG be the determiner is like letting IMDB be the determiner for actors and films.</dd>
<dd>3) What exactly defines a "web presence and fanbase"? This band has 30,000 hits on spam lyrics sites. The only fansite is dead. 21 mentions on USENET.</dd>
<dd>4) <i>Articles that have no content are notable.</i> This is the one that's getting me. There's nothing here. The band is defunct, there will never be anything else here.</dd>
<dd>I genuinely have nothing against this band - I had never heard of them before AfD'ing the article. I just thought the standard was more obvious than this, especially with an article that has one sentence and an album tracklisting. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisB_39d0.html" title="User:ChrisB">ChrisB</a> 23:19, 7 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Re: 1), I think you have that backwards - the notability criteria don't say what we <i>must</i> have, it says what we <i>mustn't</i> have. The notability criteria don't say "you must write article about every notable band", it just says "this band is not notable enough for inclusion." There's a not-so-subtle distinction.</dd>
<dd>Also, the notability criteria is fuzzy for a reason. Last I checked there weren't any exact numbers anywhere to go by. Having <i>exact</i> numbers and <i>exact</i> criteria kind of leads to wikilawyering and gaming the system, while AfD is all about reasoning and debate whether or not the criteria are satisfied <i>in that particular case's specific requirements.</i> It's good to have some footing, but bad to have footing that everyone knows how to yank from under you. Ultimately, WP's notability criteria are based on well-founded gut feelings. And as surprising as it may seem, it works.</dd>
<dd>I agree the article is not really that good. But regarding 4), I disagree that the article can't be expanded - even a little bit. I predict it won't get <i>much</i> better if kept though, as there's not that much history to document, but it can be done... --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 15:13, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mostly <a href="../../../s/o/i/Soiling.html" title="Soiling">Soiling</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encopresis.html" title="Encopresis">Encopresis</a> are used synonymosly. Some experts however distinguish Soiling from encopresis: Soiling is due to constipation and stool withholding with psychological and behavioral consequences, encopresis is associated with oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder and less common. <a href="../../../f/e/c/Fecal_incontinence.html" title="Fecal incontinence">fecal incontinence</a> being the most generalised term.</dd>
<dd>If it has to be merged, than strictly <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encopresis.html" title="Encopresis">encopresis</a> and <a href="../../../f/e/c/Fecal_incontinence.html" title="Fecal incontinence">fecal incontinence</a> would need to me merged too. The 3 all mean pretty much the same with minor differences mainly depending on the context.</dd>
<dd>This article is purely about soiling due to constipation with concrete guidelines on management.</dd>

<dd>If you read the article on <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encopresis.html" title="Encopresis">Encopresis</a>, you'll see it talks about involuntary soiling, due to both constipation and psychological reasons. Either way, though, Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> a how-to guide, and so perhaps these concrete guidelines don't belong here... <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7ECondem_139c.html" title="User:Condem"><font color="#FF0080">Con</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7ECondem_139c.html" title="User:Condem"><font color="#008B8B"><b>Dem</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7ECondem_4705.html" title="User talk:Condem">Talk</a></sup> 05:51, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This content should probably be on the Encopresis page. Encopresis and Soiling are essentially the same. Seems like this page was written by a medical provider so it's pretty specific. The pictures are very good. This is a very difficult issue and parents will benefit from having any/all information on the site. [ac] --155.41.112.1 13:39, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I would like to do a "cleanup", meaning I could translate the article in lay-terms that are easier to understand and adding references and evidence. But I will only do it once the threat that the article will disappear shortly is being lifted, because I don't want to do the work just for somebody else to delete it. I think I have a very good article on this subject valuable for all who are affected by this problem, and I understand it needs cleanup. But I also understand Mr.Condem who thins that a Guide on Management doesn't belong to an Encyclopedia. Please make up your mind whether I should carry on with cleaning or not. I would not be happy to alter the Encopresis- or Fecal soiling- pages, because these articles are both very good as they are, and I don't want to mess them up. Aberpete 19:20, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This concept serves an analogous role in Lacanian theory to the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collective_unconscious.html" title="Collective unconscious">collective unconscious</a> in Jungian theory. If we have collective unconscious (and we do) we should keep this. I can understand a demand for re-naming, since the title is admittedly awkward, but then again we do have <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cogito_ergo_sum.html" title="Cogito ergo sum">cogito ergo sum</a> and <a href="../../../j/u/s/Just_Say_No_fe40.html" title="Just Say No">Just Say No</a>. <i>The unconscious is structured like a language</i> is simply the operative buzz-phrase in Lacanian theory.

<p>I may possibly be wrong, considering all the wacky religious groups that are out there, but I believe this is a hoax. The article claims to be about a modern group, the "Christian Essenes", but all references are works on the ancient Jewish <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essenes.html" title="Essenes">Essenes</a>. Requests for better references have been ignored. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 09:47, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: This article has had an {{unreferenced}} tag since January 23, and the author was asked for specific references supporting the content on January 24, but has not responded. If this is kept, I suggest removing the stuff on the ancient <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essenes.html" title="Essenes">Essenes</a>, as that belongs elsewhere, and blanking the rest of the article, as there seems to be no verification for anything about the specific group the page claims to be about. If somebody wants to actually find useful references and write about various Christian fringe groups believing themselves to be Essenes, that's fine with me. But without that I don't see how keeping the page as it is is in keeping with the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> policy. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 18:04, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> The group referenced by <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_McE_a4a1.html" title="User:Kevin McE">Kevin McE</a> appears to bear little resemblance to the people described in the article, beyond the name. It looks like there are a number of groups out there using the name "Essene", but I can't find any indication that any of them are notable, or even much commonality among them. If someone can produce some citations about this particular group to establish some notability, I could be convinced to change my mind, but from what I can find, they're awfully fringy. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 14:55, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

All the info here about anceint Essenes would be unrecognisable by any Schollar of ancient Judaism - it is POV at best, and just wrong at worst. 'I think I've heard of this' isn't verification. 'Shunt information here', but we have no verifiable infomation to shunt. Sure it is possible that something will be verified later, well then at that point we can consider undeleting - but it has had months with no verification, so delete it for now. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><small><sup>ask?</sup></small></a> 12:54, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am disgusted at the prospect of this entry even being considered for deletion. It is a fair, first hand account of the thoughts of many students at the school. If this entry did not exist, we would have no direct voice to the outside world. Its information is reletive to the people who want to look back and remember the good old days. --<s><a href="../../../w/i/l/Will.html" title="Will">Will</a></s> 20:05, 7 April 2006 (UTC) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 81.129.237.223 (<a href="../../../8/1/2E/User_talk%7E81.129.237.223.html" title="User talk:81.129.237.223">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.129.237.223_f342.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.129.237.223">contribs</a>) .</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> By keeping this, do we then set the precedent for any school to have an article? Either it's only notable (famous) schools or all schools, imo. <i><font color="green"><a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames.kendall_09a4.html" title="User:James.kendall">James</a></font> <font color="purple"><a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames.kendall_09a4.html" title="User:James.kendall">Kendall</a></font></i> <a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJames.kendall_5f20.html" title="User talk:James.kendall">[talk]</a> 19:59, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I think the precedent to keep high schools is more or less established; Middle and lower schools must have some claim to fame to be included, which is why <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Blue_Hills_Elementary_School_b7b4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Blue Hills Elementary School">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Blue Hills Elementary School</a> was made.

But per <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_schoolwatch_Votes_for_deletion_archive_a12e.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Votes for deletion archive">this</a>, I think precedent has more or less been established. -- Jjjsixsix <sup>(t)</sup>/<sub>(<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jjjsixsix_2e5e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jjjsixsix">c</a>)</sub> <small>@</small> 21:36, 7 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - makes sense. So if I add my old school as an article (it's a secondary school) it is encyclopaedic? Or would it be classed as NN? I'm kind of turning this into a debate about what makes a school worthy of inclusion which is silly in some respects, but important in others. Should every secondary school be in Wikipedia? <i><font color="green"><a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames.kendall_09a4.html" title="User:James.kendall">James</a></font> <font color="purple"><a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames.kendall_09a4.html" title="User:James.kendall">Kendall</a></font></i> <a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJames.kendall_5f20.html" title="User talk:James.kendall">[talk]</a> 22:01, 7 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Theoretically, we are going down the road where every secondary school is going to be in Wikipedia; if you do indeed add your school, it most likely won't be chastised as nn, and won't be deleted unless it's an attack on the school. Even if it is taken to AFD, the result would be similar to this one, and a prod would likely be taken off. At least, that's my understanding. -- Jjjsixsix <sup>(t)</sup>/<sub>(<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jjjsixsix_2e5e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jjjsixsix">c</a>)</sub> <small>@</small> 22:30, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've done most of those except removing the history and trivia section, the reason being:
<ol>
<li>The 'plot' mentioned is a minor subplot, not a rehash of the games' actual plots.</li>
<li>The trivia section is included not because of the rumour from the forum, but because the production team actually responded on it.</li>

<dd>Why remove the in-game specs? Please do not confuse a Real-Time-Strategy game which relies on the overall effectiveness of specialized units and a flying/simulation game where individual plane statistics alter the very nature of how to approach flying that plane successfully in a mission. While individual HPS and damages of each of the little units in say, StarCraft, matter little in the overall strategies of playing the game, a difference of what loudouts a plane has or how maneuverable it is within the game's architecture are incredibly important to the simulation aspect of the game. Had Ace Combat been a RTS utilyzing aircraft, then I could possibly see not having a description regarding their statistics, but this is clearly not the case. The statistics of each aircraft in this type of game specifically control what can be done with that aircraft and how it will perform against a set of enemies. I would consider this an omission of published, verifiable information. <a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdoAlphaOmega_dd09.html" title="User:IdoAlphaOmega">IdoAlphaOmega</a> 05:35, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"furrowed brow" So the HPS of unit doesn't approach how i use it in an RTS? When it comes down to it, wiki is not a place to expound on game mechanics. Please, take a page from the Trek geeks, who've moved all their tech specs off to their independent wiki. Somebody should start a wiki rival to gamefaqs. --<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 05:49, 11 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Is the HP an integral part of your RTS that sets apart one unit from another? Is there a grunt in StarCraft with 10HP more than the regular grunt? If it is, please argue so and have it included where it is necessary. No game mechanics are being expounded upon here, merely statistics - similar to the statistics or real aircraft by the way - which even many Star Trek spacecraft have. There's even a Star Trek Template Project to unify how tech specs regarding the various vessels are presented. Sorry, but the GameFAQs analgy is only an attempt to attach negative connotation to the article in question, and I will not tolerate it. Wikipedia's own <a href="../../../f/a/q/FAQ_1fe9.html" title="FAQ">FAQs</a> states that GameFAQs articles <i>are often instead rather detailed descriptions of gameplay, including tips, secrets, and beginning-to-end guidance</i>, and, thus far, nobody has shown how the X-02 article has been any of those things. <a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdoAlphaOmega_dd09.html" title="User:IdoAlphaOmega">IdoAlphaOmega</a> 06:34, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Expand</b>. Although a fictional aircraft, there are quite a few articles on Wikipedia regarding fictional characters, places, events, which span barely three lines. The X-02 spans three different games, is a unique creation with <i>published, certifiable statistics</i> (games are published too, you know as well as information in several published player's guides), and appears as both flyable and enemy-controlled aircraft. Granted, it does need some work, but the majority revolves around updating the article and adding information and statistics from <a href="../../../a/c/e/Ace_Combat_5_a1cd.html" title="Ace Combat 5">Ace Combat 5</a> and <a href="../../../a/c/e/Ace_Combat_Zero_c50a.html" title="Ace Combat Zero">Ace Combat Zero</a>. It should be noted that the originator of this AFD has targetted several Ace Combat articles for deletion - many with detailed, succinct, and varied information all while giving the reason "Gamecruft" and no further explanation. <a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdoAlphaOmega_dd09.html" title="User:IdoAlphaOmega">IdoAlphaOmega</a> 03:52, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Upon review, it appears that I was incorrect in making such an accusation. I retract my statement and apologize. However, my statements regarding the X-02 article still stand, and there was an attempt to AFD the ADF-01, ADFX-01, Ustio, Belka, and Yuktobania articles related to Ace Combat 5 by the same person which led me such an erroneous conclusion. Just as an addition, the article differs from GameFAQ articles in a few significant ways A) it does not provide step-by-step (aka a guide) information on obatining the craft B) it does not give advice on how or when to use the craft, and C) does not comment about the plane's abilities except to mention that it, as many of the fictional super-fighters in previous AC games were, is a marginally and/or significantly better than its real-world digital counterparts. <a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdoAlphaOmega_dd09.html" title="User:IdoAlphaOmega">IdoAlphaOmega</a> 04:28, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I do not see how anything on the X-02 page can be related to gamefaq... During several years, Namco has created a whole universe with the ace combat series. That universe fly far away the ace combat games, as the background is deeply described in official sites (who keep being updated even after the releases of the games) and game books. So I think there is enought facts about X-02 to keep his page, as any Star wars fighter... Hirose 11:31, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Keep</b> or <b>Expand</b> "Gamecruft?" Honestly, if one starts to get irritated on topics such as this, the Wiki better go after everything. I know from doing a whole report on it that there is enough specs on it to make a convincing arguement that it could fly (simulations in X-Plane--yes, I know its a sim, and still only a game--have shown that it really could fly). Not only that, but unless similar articles on other games are put up for deletion, I find this unessecarry to even consider this. It's not cluttering anything as the only way to find it is when one researches Ace Combat, and if that's the case, why not keep it for those people actually searching for it? Kinda a no-brainer to me. (AceCombatSkies.com Admin "F22_Fan" posted 10:08 AM, 11 April 2006 GMT)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Why remove it? It may be a fictional aircraft, yes, but in that case everything fictional should be deleted from Wikipedia. The article itself is not bad. Keep, or at least make a big article about Ace Combat fictional aircraft. YF-23 17:02, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Although the article needs improvment, that is no reason to delete it. Concerning the X-02 being fictional: If that is a reason to delete the article, then why do the articles for such fictional craft as the F-302, X-Wing, F/A-37, and Starfury remain unchallenged? Tempest2</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> with one of the other Lost pages (such as Dharma). Every excuse the nom gave for this articles deletion is <b>highly</b> incorrect. According to a verifiable source (lost podcast) Carlton said himself that this is notable. He also said that widmore would appear in Fire+Water. Also, the name DOES appear on the pregnancy test, it was in plain sight (no freeze frame or speculation required, unless you consider looking with our eyes 'original research'). I support its merge simply because there isn't that much on the subject, it has two or three lines of fact, and it doesnt look like its going to play a major role anytime soon. <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgentiumOutlaw_e661.html" title="User:ArgentiumOutlaw">ArgentiumOutlaw</a> 11:03, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, unfortunately you just basically said 'ignore citable references, what <b>i'm</b> saying is....etc'.

<dd>Okay - if you review this history of this article, you can see that it started out as a generic and short description of the game, which I consider to be acceptible among other articles about "informal" games such as tag, etc. I added considerably to it to make it an April Fool's page, and tagged it as such. Then it disappeared before I had a chance to fix it after April 1st. Then it reappeared, and someone chopped it down to one badly-written sentence. The article is useless right now, I but I would be willing to restore it to a good list of the game's rules, written in a formal tone. However, I don't want to waste my time if it's just going to get deleted. Aguerriero 14:34, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I added a published reference to the article. I disagree that this constitutes "something made up in school one day". While it probably was at one point, you can find people all over the world who played this game. It is written about in books. I consider it on par with other playground games that have articles, as well as phenomina like <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calling_shotgun.html" title="Calling shotgun">Calling shotgun</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> I just don't see a reason why not too keep it, especially now that there's a published reference about it posted. I feel like some people here may be mistaking the absurdity of the game for absurdity of the article. There's a lot of references to it not being encyclopaedic, but I'm not really sure what that means? If it's simply a matter of language or style, that can easily be fixed, and shouldn't be a reason to delete. <b><a href="../../../b/m/e/User_talk%7EBmearns_89f8.html" title="User talk:Bmearns"><span style="color:green">B.</span></a><a href="../../../b/m/e/User%7EBmearns_0c69.html" title="User:Bmearns"><span style="color:navy">Mearns</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bmearns_15b3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bmearns"><sup style="color:red">*</sup></a></b>, <tt style="color:pink">KSC</tt> 16:38, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Something like this has been around for at least 50 years, although I don't remember anything about doorknobs, and I don't remember it from Boy Scouts. Calling 'safeties' was something junior high boys did while standing around shooting the breeze. I wouldn't have called it a game then, and I won't now.

<li><b>Comment</b> This definitely fits into not for things, the only reference listed on the page isn't a study or report on childhood games as the example on the NFTs page (freak dancing) is. I think wikipedia policy is pretty clear on this issue hence the three times over speedy deletion. <b><a href="../../../j/2E/r/User%7EJ.reed_7e4e.html" title="User:J.reed"><font color="green">J.reed</font></a></b><a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_States.svg_d767.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_States.svg_d767.html" /></a> 19:28, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The NFT argument is absurd because it fails every test on the NFT. This is not just a dictionary article; it explains the entire game. This is not for "someone's own purpose"; it is to document a well-known and much-played game. This is verifiable, both by the reference cited and by the number of people from all over the country who have commented here who recognize the game. And finally, this definitely isn't original research. So, do tell: on what ground do you claim the NFT argument, other than that its your personal opinion? The fact that you or others consider the game "childish" or "sophmoric" doesn't mean anything, nor is it a reason to remove something from Wikipedia. There are people out there who would want to read the article either to learn about the game or as a nostalgic reference. <font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">ţ</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aguerriero_3586.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aguerriero">ć</a>) (<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Aguerriero_1e4f.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Aguerriero">ë</a>)</font> 19:44, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> It claims to only be an article about a custom map and not a mod. That 20-some mostly anonymous editors made changes does not prevent it from being OR. Is this information published anywhere else? Or did these 23 editors add the information simply from their first-hand knowledge of the game?

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Sadly, I've never played a custom map on WCIII. I liked the first two, but never got into WCIII - played for a few days and lost interest. I assumed that since they didn't call them mods, there were no changes to the game mechanics for most of these maps. Having read the information on DotA and DotA:Allstars, I got the impression that some custom maps were just different maps, but others incomparated far different game play (the DotA's and such). There are dozens of custom maps listed and most of them have terrible articles and don't seem any different from the original game. Additionally, the problem of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> comes up. Also, what is this mods claim to notability? How many people play it? Is there something unique about it that we'd want it in an encyclopedia instead of a Warcraft III wiki? --<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabap_8f9b.html" title="User:Habap">Habap</a> 21:22, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep</b> - This is one of the most popular source of free mmorpgs ever. It was even mentioned in an issue of PC Gamer. Why would you even conidier deleting it? The staff are almost active, the star/honourary members are much respected. This fourm is worthy of a page on Wikipedia. Witchunter.</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> - People are not trying to delete this for any bad reason, most of them are from Onrpg, they just want a more informative wiki page. I think the page was fine but the staff here at wiki decided to be as immature about the situation as the members at the place and this is very dissapointing. I thought the origonal information was fine and could have made better but that's an easy edit. Now it makes the site look bad and it truely isn't, it decides to attack Moderators that are actually quite responsive to forum problems but we feel our members have freedom to a point and we should not lock them up in to specific topics or yelling at them when they do one simple thing.</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> - A large community resides in OnRPG, numbers of visitors that range from 400 to 1500 visit OnRPG everyday. Being the one of the best free mmorpg directory on internet, no doubt it's going to be 'notable' in the near future. As a web database for all information, why don't, you Wikipedia people, keep this article and propell OnRPG to a even more greater fame? I also like to emphasize this, in my opinion, the forum is 'notable' but the site itself is even more 'notable'. It has also several sites under its name specialising in CG, Anime and more. Contents that concerned the development of free MMORPGs and major incoming MMORPGs are added into OnRPG frequently, no doubt it's a paradise for gamers.</p>
<p><b>Delete</b> - I don't see any real assertion of notability. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 17:08, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The OnRPG website currently doesn't have a page, and it sounds like the site may be notable enough, though not the site's forums on their own.

<li><b>Keep</b> - OnRPG has been mentioned in magizenes such as PC Gamer, and has a great community. But it's sole purpose is to provide information on all the MMOs out there, and it succedes,being one of the most informative on the web. The forums are just in place for general coversation and (mainly) for people with questions on a praticular game.The moderators are frequently active and people will generally get a reply within a few minutes.</li>
<li>The entry itself is named 'OnRPG forums',which is wrong and should just be called OnRPG or OnRPG-online MMO directory. The entry just needs some work really, and it does not need to be deleted.Give it time.</li>
<li>Please ignore the idiots who posted here with dumb responces and flames. This has been posted in our forums to make people aware of it and they are just trying to defend our website.

Guess what this forum is notable it made runs though Gamespot and other websites after an April Fools joke about Mircosft was going to buy them out. Plus a lot of forums have mention how it strives to be an unbiaed forum with its heavey modding done by deleting any unproven fanboyism remarks. For those who think it should be deleted because it is an unofficial PS3 forum guess what only Sony has the official making every forum outside of that unofficial. <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. --Gamerman 13:49, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Gamerman, your only arguement about it being "official" is that Gamespot mentioned it in an April Fools joke, and a statement that your site is unofficial. Unfortunately, those really aren't great reasons why it should be kept. It being in an April Fools joke means nothing. That proves nothing about it being a good and official PS3 forum. I understand that the site is un-biased, but it's still an unofficial forum. Therefore, while many other forums are unofficial, your Wikipedia article will be and is considered advertisement of a forum. It doesn't come from and benefit Sony or the PS3, but is only a place for gamers who will buy the PS3 to talk. No helpful history and no real important data. That's why it fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.

<li><small><b>Comment</b> So far the whole agruement from you deleters is that it is a fan-made unofficial site but yet one quick check of the Category:Internet forums you can find two fan-made sites. Half-Life Fallout a fan made site with no relationship with Valve, why isn't that up for deletion? Or maybe GTA-SanAndreas.com another fan made site with <b>NO</b> relationship with Rockstar Games and/or Take-Two. The only reason this stands out is because it is a PS3 website. Darknut I never said it was official and I also had put "and other website" but looks like you forgot that I said that other forums have talked about its modding. Again any gaming forum not made by a console, developer, or publisher is an unofficial site.Also trying to discount votes to pass something is a terrible pactice to do Thrope.<b>Disagree</b> Gamerman 02:12, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><small><b>Comment</b> The site is 'notable' - just look at the 11 thousand <b>pre-launch</b> members the site has. It is already (<b>pre-launch</b>) the <i>largest</i> independent PS3 Forum on the net. This page is also in no way promotional it was created purely to act as encyclopedic entry to be informative for people who want to find out about the forum. Many other sites have Wikipedia pages from large sites like IGN<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> to tiny by comparison sites like Game Freaks 365<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Freaks_365" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Freaks_365" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>. The fact that personally I have only contributed to this page is not true and also irrelevant. I'm not a Wikipedia admin and am only interested in helping provide information to its users.

<li><small><b>Comment</b> No matter how popular it is the site I think doesn't really need a place on Wikipedia. I am trying to say it still isn't going to be notable to a lot of people even if you are in Google results. There are probably thousands of other unofficial sites in a top 10 keyword result of Google. Does that mean they all got to be put in here? No, just like PS3Forums it isn't notable to a lot of people. The site was most likely put on Wikipedia just to gain even more popularity because they know many Wikipedia pages come near the top of search results. Some of you who voted "Keep" have never even contributed here before and your interests are just contributing to that article and this deletion page.

<li><small><b>Comment</b> No I don't see your point because people have to make an account to vote on this stuff. Plus they are joining because they disagree with you. Yeah a lot of them are joining just to tell you that you shouldn't delete this page because it is notable but you just want to ignore them for no reason. Maybe you should listen to what they have to say and do some research before you make judgement on anything. Only because you don't like what the website is about doesn't mean that it should be up to deletion, try pushing your bias side. Another we thing this site doesn't need or use advertising to grow, since its parent sites are the first to sites you find by typing in "playstation 3" or "PS3" beating out the wikipedia page on the PS3 and playstation.com. Yeah the site Sony made to talk about the own products gets beat out by this. Gamerman 11:50, 10 April 2006 (GMT)</small></li>

<li><small><b>Comment</b> ...to those supporting the PS3Forums (which I agree with Thorpe about them solely being from the PS3Forums), the site's quality to its users and the number of users does not mean it's suffiient enough to beome a Wikipedia page. I can understand that it's unofficial, and there's over 1,000 peple registered. The truth is, no one really cares about that when people search for useful infomation. Wikipedia isn't a site where forum members can post information about their forums for their people. It needs to benefit the community as a whole. The article does not fufil this. Doesn't matter if it's official or unofficial. It's uninformational. And...if it's not for its registered users, it would then be considered advertisement. In this, it fails miserably.

I will not deny the fact that I am from PS3 Forums, in fact, I am a Moderator there, and I definitely would not approve of our members doing this on our website, or any other websites for that matter.

They want me down. Guess I won't be welcomed if I join (even though I like PS3). I am doing what is possibly right here. Being an admin at age 16 is allowed and there are younger administrators here at Wikipedia too. Whoever said people were not voting here from PS3 Forums is wrong because I see plenty of discussion in the thread. <a href="http://www.ps3forums.com/viewtopic.php?t=19215&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;highlight=wikipedia&amp;start=60" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ps3forums.com/viewtopic.php?t=19215&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;highlight=wikipedia&amp;start=60" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>. So, there's plenty more as well in the topic. One member in the thread even states that everyone sign up to Wikipedia and vote to keep it. My point exactly from earlier. I would like to state that I did not put this page up for deletion because I was banned from PS3 Forums. I have never even joined or come across it. The only forums I participate in mainly are GTAForums, GameSpot, Gamesradar and YourPSP. There is also no such thing as "winning" (as described in the thread). Remember, new users or people just contributing to PS3 Forums who have voted here will not count. They are still welcome to comment (as explained at the top of this page). Even if the page is deleted it will still be on Wikipedia (only viewable by admins). So, you could (if deleted) request a copy of the page from an admin. Oh, I am not an Xbox fanboy. I do not own a Xbox or Xbox 360. I own PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and Nintendo consoles just to let you know.

<li><small><b>Comment</b> Before I say anything - no I'm not a member, and no I'm not an administrator. However, I <i>am</i> a long-standing supporter of Wikipedia and level-headed individual, so I feel justified in asserting my views. There are two main criteria at play here: 1) Whether PS3Forums is a 'notable' site; 2) Whether PS3Forums provides a sufficient source of information. I feel that the forums meets <b>both</b> these tests.</small></li>
</ul>
<p><small>First off, notability: PS3Forums is the largest and oldest independant PlayStation 3 forums on the Internet - with over 11,000 members. There are many much smaller and less significant websites which have been allowed a page here at Wikipedia. During events such as E3/CES, the forum has literally hundreds of gamers viewing and using the site at the same time (800 during E3 2005). With over <b>320,000</b> articles on the site, it is the home of tends of thousands of gamers - and there is a very strong sense of community. I'm sure, Thorpe, that if you joined the site you would certainly have a very warm welcome as a fellow gaming enthusiast. Owing to the extreme significance this community has on the lives of of so many people, I feel it meets the notability criteria.</small></p>
<p><small>Secondly, informational value. This test, especially, I feel the forums meet without question. As a buzzing hub of gamers, the very latest news is constantly being discusssed - and we frequently have new pieces of information way before larger sites such as IGN and Gamespot. Top journalists at sites such as Joystiq, Gamespot, IGN, Gamesindustry.biz are readers of the site, and indeed the staff at the forum have spoken with many of them. Furthermore, many reprensatives from gaming houses such as Capcom and Eidos are frequent readers of the site. If all of these prominent organisations read our forums for information - how can it be argued we don't provide informational value? It's clear that anyone seeking the latest information, such as our fellow Wikipedians, would be well-placed seeing this page and checking out the forums. Furthermore, due to our zero-tolerance policy on fanboyism and blind console loyalty, all information presented on the site is balanced and education. We are not a place to aid the proliferation of biased propoganda - we encourage intelectual debate and comment. Surely we warrant one page on Wikipedia informing your users of how the site functions, whats involved, etcetera.</small></p>
<p><small>Moving forward, I agree that in it's current form the page posseses little value. We need to work together to create a PS3Forums entry which adds purpose, and enriches Wikipedia as a whole. We are asking you to, based on what has been said, reconsider the deletion of this page - and work with us to create a page which benefits everyone. Thank you for reading this. --- Kieran O'Neill (A concerned wikipedian and forum member) 16:24, 11 April 2006 (GMT) (comments left by 86.17.63.244)</small></p>

<li><small><b>Comment</b> I believe Kieran O'Neill is going in the right diretion. As I have personally seen the PS3Forums, I can agree that the actual site is informational and popular. However, while agreeing to this, I still cannot support its keep or a clean-up. I cannot see anyone adding more to the atual article than there already is, which is not much at all. There is no clear history of the forums, minus the first introdutory paragraph. There is unorganization in the board list, and no clear definitions to any of the important boards. There is no actual useful information about the forums either. Now, I do agree this <b>could</b> be a very informational page about the PS3Forums, but it needs a lot of work. I still put mine as a <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarknut_Slayer_415d.html" title="User:Darknut Slayer">Darknut Slayer</a> 18:20, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><small><b>Delete</b>. I am fairly neutral about this article, but as it stands I don't think it makes it. I have copyedited it to remove some of the dreadful POV and vanity - and I did this objectively whilst still being completely neutral towards this discussion (honest). I could have further removed the detailed description of the layout of the site - something you shouldn't find in any other article. I edited it so I could see what was left after it had been made suitable for an encyclopaedia, and after some consideration I'm afraid to say I don't see much in it. It's just <i>Yet Another Forum</i> and we delete these things all the time around here - rightly I think. Show me some notability; some recognition by others; some recognition that this site constitutes part of knowledge, and I will change my mind. As for the vanity, it seems clear to me that many of those who either wrote the article or supported it do not understand what Wikipedia is.

<li><small><b>Comment</b> In all honesty, I believe all unofficial pages should be deleted. But since that will not happen, to delete this one and this one alone would be unfair. As said by others, the site itself is a large site, larger than other sites that have articles written about them. I also doubt that the site needs the advertisement, as it already had more than 10,000 users before the article was even created. I also agree, though, that the article itself contains little information on the site. However, there are plenty of articles on Wikipedia that contain even less information than this. I think it would be wrong to delete this when all this article needs is a little more information.Psa- 21:47, 12 April 2006</small></li>
</ul>
<p><small><b>Comment</b> Psa I have to agree with you that the page has very little information on it for now. Really all it needs is time for the members of PS3Forums (since they are the ones with the information at the moment) to add it to the page. Gamerman 9:09, 12 April 2006</small></p>

<li><b>Keep</b> You don't need to be a member of Wikipedia to know this whole thing is BS. It's appauling just how hypocritical you are being towards websites and advertising. Joystiq, Engadget, Slashdot, and some site called "hack a day" all have wiki pages that aren't getting deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p>The community is not small and in some cases offers more information on a quicker basis then those sites listed above. What, just because we have PS3 in the title of our websites means we are advertising or are extremely biased? This is ridiculous and I feel PS3Portal and PS3Forums are just being uneccessarily descriminated against.<br />

<li><b>Keep</b> This site is just as up to date as IGN and 1up, it is user specific and only deals with the PS3 thus it's not cluttered with news about the other two systems.

<li><b>Comment</b> That is the policy: <i>The deletion process is designed to determine the consensus of opinion of Wikipedia editors; for this reason comments from users whose histories do not show experience with or contributions to Wikipedia are traditionally given less weight and may be discounted entirely.</i> You can't argue that with me. --<span style="font-variant:small-caps"><b><a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorpe_c638.html" title="User:Thorpe">Thorpe</a></b> | <a href="../../../t/h/o/User_talk%7EThorpe_3a14.html" title="User talk:Thorpe">talk</a></span> 21:59, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I challenge the assertion of potential quality. Can either editor give any specific example of <i>any</i> related trait that is shared by a viviparous mammal and a viviparous plant <i>besides</i> the mere fact? Or to rephrase: Can you identify any specific quality of the subject (<b>"Vivipary"</b>), anything of note, beyond the dictionary definition and a list of organisms that possess the trait?</p>

<p>I am Dr.James Baldwin, professor of great detectives not known throughout the world. I have done extensive research on many detectives like Iggens, in fact, I have seen many of the files that Iggens himself has written, and I must say, that it is disgracefull that just because people have not heard of Iggens as much as they have of other great detectives,that it should be deleted. Iggens is one of the great masters in detectivry and it is very sad that this many people think he is a blubbering fool out of someone's imagination. It is a disgrace to him, and all unknown detectives, and to myself too. Wonderfull biography to whoever wrote it. -Dr. James Baldwin</p>

<p>Battle Magica may not be "notable" to you but at one time it was quite popular and beloved by many. I played it when I was a kid and I wanted to make a Wiki about it. Is that so wrong? It isn't an advertisement. It is a history and an overview. If it is favorable, it is because I enjoyed playing it so much as a kid.</p>
<p>Also it should be noted that I spent a lot of time researching things before making the entry. I think you people need to chill out, it isn't like I was posting referral links or anything like that. Wikipedia should contain knowledge about this game and I filled that need.</p>
<p>Also, the relevance of using a current Alexa rank is laughable considering the website has been featured in the media and at one time had a much better ranking.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.89.7.46 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.89.7.46_970f.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.89.7.46">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<ul>
<li>Do you have a citation for where it was featured in the media? Or was it just some blog or another website? I disagree with the anon's claim that the ranking is irrelevant, and it is currently at 1,648,282.

<p>There was also a front page, center section, and back section article by Michael Brothers also of the News Leader:</p>
<hr />
<p>As well as a feature in a magazine that I can't seem to locate at the moment. (It was back in 2001. Memory is fuzzy, I will try to contact the people involved with the game now and see if they know.)</p>
<p>I am sorry, I am new to Wikipedia but this game was huge in my area of the country and I thought it was notable.

<dd>No offense taken, certainly. However, we must follow policy in determining if something is notable enough for inclusion. The policy <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> says:
<dl>
<dd>"The content itself has been the subject of <i>multiple</i> [my emphasis, Sandstein] non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself. This criterion excludes: ...

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>It appears that the article you cited, while a start, isn't yet sufficient to establish notability under <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.

<dd>The only reason people care about "T14" is because the top 14 law schools (unlike, say 25) have been remarkably stable in the past decade or so, leading to the conception among some that there are 14 schools that are, far and away, better than the rest. Of course, the actual difference between 14 and 15 is pretty small. One of the reasons Leiter opposes T14 is because he is a prof at #15 UTexas. <a href="../../../c/z/a/User%7ECzar_Dragon_0a69.html" title="User:Czar Dragon">Czar Dragon</a> 00:27, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep.</b> This is actually a valid, rather useful term. There are an easily discernible 14 "national" law schools, and in the legal industry, "top 14" (or T14) is helpful shorthand.

<li><b>Keep.</b> As a student applying to law school, I've encountered the term "top 14" in discussions with prelaw advisors, on various internet message boards, speaking with current law students, and listening to admissions officials. Thus, it is quite a common phrase. But more than just a phrase, it is an actual group of schools characterized by 20 years of consistent rankings in published news sources which is in turn derived from the opinions of judges, lawyers, and meaningful statistics (selectivity, job placement, etc.). Note that a law school professor (Brian Leiter) linked in the web resources section of the article rails against the prevalence of this term. This should suffice to show it is in fact pervasive. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 63.229.201.180 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_63.229.201.180_87bc.html" title="Special:Contributions/63.229.201.180">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>::: Respectfully, I question the grounds on which it is being called a neologism. It’s not new. This term emerged in early 1990’s and has very strong empirical backing. Year in and year out U.S. News, along with major law school admissions commentators, have given it implicit or direct credence. The article documents this.</dd>

<p>Moreover, it appears that Wikipedia is increasingly being hijacked by a group of overly dedicated editors. These individuals, rather than providing commentary in areas which they are actually informed, attempt to monitor the whole institution at large. While their actions warrant merit with respect to cleaning up vandalism or removing the posting of images not under copyright, they are often poor judges of the internal merits of pages.</p>
<p>Indeed, the claim is here that there has been a coordinated effort to preserve the page, by references to its deletion entry on xoxohth.com and lawschoolnumbers.com. While I can find no references by a search of said sites, I will say that if there was one, so be it. Such a posting only brings many individuals from the legal world to the page, who can subsequently weigh in on its accuracy. If such a term was indeed bunk, there would likely be many more votes for deletion than their currently are from actual members of the law profession, as opposed to registered wikipedians. Moreover, where the term appears in specific law school Wikipedia entries (see gulc, the term has not been removed (and they, indeed, are also monitored by a large number of students, faculty, lawyers, so on). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 140.247.125.148 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_140.247.125.148_852e.html" title="Special:Contributions/140.247.125.148">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>You do not have an account on wikipedia, and from that I surmise that you aren't experienced in the way it works. I don't mean this to be offensive, but rather just to note that others here may understand the process more clearly due to their experience. <i>Wiki</i> here implies collective consensus in both writing but also in managing the encyclopedia. The processes evolve over time, but have arrived at where they are today after a long long road involving the consensus of thousands of people. The process may not be perfect, but it is working OK. I understand that you feel the term under discussion here has widespread usage and is therefore encyclopedic. You see many lawyers using the term, feel it is established, and therefore feel that wikipedia should have a page about it. You have pulled together many facts about this term, and feel that as you have an understanding of it you are sure that it fits with Wikipedia. You need to remember that here at wikipedia we have a policy that we do not do <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> and the understanding that I've attributed to you <i>is</i> original research. Wikipedia is a tertiary source, and must cite secondary sources only in determining whether to keep an article. The arguments described above are all arguments based on primary research, namely going out to find blogs and books that use the term. I see no references to books <i>about</i> the term, or papers that <i>treat</i> the usage of the term. Accordingly the term is <i>not ready yet</i> for wikipedia. It may be in time, but not now. The term does not need to be in Wikipedia in order to be a "true" term. You seem quite skilled in writing, may I suggest creating a wikipedia account and working on a few other pages for a while. IMHO I think we must let this one go. -- <a href="../../../c/m/h/User%7ECmh_f246.html" title="User:Cmh">cmh</a> 22:22, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is not original research. Please familizarize yourself with the term before you use it. If someone were trying to <i>create</i> the idea of a "top 14" by simply citing the USNews rankings and making some kind of an argument, that would be original research. Simply reporting on the existence and widespread-usage of the term while citing numerous examples of such usage is not.160.39.31.71 23:25, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually you are wrong. Research based on primary sources (such as those you cited) is original research.

<dd>Here's a helpful quote for you guys from the Wikipedia policy: "Original research that creates primary sources is not allowed. However, research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is, of course, strongly encouraged. All articles on Wikipedia should be based on information collected from published primary and secondary sources. This is not 'original research'; it is 'source-based research', and it is fundamental to writing an encyclopedia." This article is not inventing a term. It is not presenting any original analysis or criticism of the term or its use. This is a non-issue. The desperation to delete an article despite an obvious consensus among informed individuals and overwhelming evidence supporting its inclusion really helps illustrate the overzealous editor problem cited above.160.39.31.71 01:37, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why would anyone want to delete this term? T14 refers to schools that have NEVER been ranked out of the top 14 since the inception of the US News and World Report Rankings began.</p>
<p>Keep! Not to get philosophical but obviously if there is such a debate about this term than it is in fact an existing "term"; "phrase"; "expression"; "idiom" or whatever you want to call it. Who cares if its "original research"? Some people (like me) use Wikipedia to look up definitions of words they haven't heard of and this site helps people figure out the definitions of terms that they dont already know. (Plus, as other posters have already indicated T14 is commonly used) This is precisely what encyclopedias are supposed to do: give you the the definition and relevant information of a term,</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, that is not what encyclopedias are supposed to do; that is what dictionaries are supposed to do. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterestingstuffadder_aaa3.html" title="User:Interestingstuffadder">Interestingstuffadder</a> 05:58, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> If the word Fauvism came up for review with Wikipedia in 1888, it would get nuked in a heartbeat. It was radical and unfounded...plus certainly would not show up in Google. Wonder if St. Patrick, the patron saint of excluded people according to Wikipedia, would not have showed up on Google either but he turned out to be one of the greatest saints. So, in America we don't start our prayers with "In the name of the Google, and the Son and Holy Spirit..... Amen&#160;! Many computer tekkies, engineers and accountants cannot see images on canvases because they come by it naturally....that side of their brain simply doesn't compute while other artsy folks can appreciate it. So, whether you nuke it or not, the sun will rise and art will continue. When computer gurus like Gates and Jobs come up with cool computer terms, the world accepts it without question but when an artist comes up with a new term, it is frown upon.

<li><b>Comment</b> are we being hasty here? Its obvious to us, is that cultural bias? Is there any way to make something of this article? There are psychological implications, surely - pillows are exceedingly harmless weapons. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 00:59, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - it does need some work; in particular, the reference to the Beatles is kind of silly. But it's definitely real, and deserves some coverage. Just because it's a children's game doesn't mean it doesn't matter for adults. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 01:01, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The article just needs a little improvement. Manufracture 02:25, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Good references, like the Beatles pillow fight (which I didn't know about) and a very notable game. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmasterka_6922.html" title="User:Grandmasterka"><font color="red">Grand</font></a><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrandmasterka_5f38.html" title="User talk:Grandmasterka"><font color="blue">master</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Grandmasterka_b497.html" title="Special:Contributions/Grandmasterka"><font color="green">ka</font></a> 03:30, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. With all due respect to the original nom, since when does something being a "completely obvious concept" justify deletion? We have articles on things that any idiot would know, but we don't delete them because of it. No doubt the article needs work, but that can be requested through the appropriate process. <a href="../../../y/e/l/User%7EYellowPigNowNow_a5b5.html" title="User:YellowPigNowNow">YellowPigNowNow</a> 05:11, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I would not call a pillow fight a "completely obvious concept". Prominent and singular place in American(/Western) culture. <a href="../../../i/27/m/User%7EI%27m_a_Lover%2C_Not_a_Fighter_0253.html" title="User:I'm a Lover, Not a Fighter">I'm a Lover, Not a Fighter</a> 16:33, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> -- a completely self-explanatory phrase that does not require an encyclopedia entry. It's not an organized competitive activity or game, it doesn't have a notable history, and there's nothing else really to say about it. Honestly. Pillow fight = fighting with pillows, and that's basically the whole of it. The article goes into excruciatingly tedious detail ad nauseum in defiance of that barrier, which lends support to my delete vote. Also while it gets mentioned in pop culture once in a while and the Beatles appear to have had one, neither of those makes this topic encyclopedic. <a href="../../../g/t/_/User%7EGT_d0ac.html" title="User:GT">GT</a> 07:22, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> - could lead to something interesting. <a href="../../../c/e/d/User%7ECedars_695e.html" title="User:Cedars">Cedars</a> 16:40, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If an article on a high school that conducts no valuable academic research, is not the location of any significant event, has had no notable impact on culture and is not relevant to 99.99% of people on this planet can be kept than something that is an occassional form of recreational play can be kept (by the way consider merging your squirt gun battle article with the <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water_pistol.html" title="Water pistol">water pistol</a> article). <a href="../../../c/e/d/User%7ECedars_695e.html" title="User:Cedars">Cedars</a> 02:25, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So your first point is a non sequitur that has nothing to do with this topic being self-explanatory and obvious (a high school might be unencyclopedic but not for those reasons) and then you provide exactly the solution that should be done with this article (merge <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pillow_fight.html" title="Pillow fight">Pillow fight</a> into <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pillow.html" title="Pillow">Pillow</a>). Mind boggling. <a href="../../../g/t/_/User%7EGT_d0ac.html" title="User:GT">GT</a> 01:23, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
