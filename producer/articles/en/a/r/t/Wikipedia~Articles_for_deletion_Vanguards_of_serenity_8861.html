<p>I quote: <i>"Vanguards of Serenity is a Community/Clan started by *VaS*Buffy in the Game Star Wars: Jedi Outcast 2 and has moved on to Star Wars: Jedi Academy 3(www.lucasarts.com). The previous name of this community was Vampire Slayers."</i> In other words, vanity/advertising; there may be some gaming clans or communities notable enough for inclusion in Wikipedia, but this, I'm afraid, is not one of them. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 12:16, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>How is it vanity/advertising? I removed all links towards it. Also why would some gaming clans or communities be notable and others not? How do you rate that?</p>
<p>I was simply giving out information about this community I don't see the issue with it.</p>
<p>*VaS*Buffy</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, I hate to say this, but most gaming clans or communities are not notable. (That is to say, right off the bat I can't think of a single one, but I'm willing to entertain the possibility that some might be for one reason or another -- if, for example, a certain clan or community were to put their heads together and form a company that creates a hit game, that would probably make them notable enough. However, a bunch of people who like to hang out together and play games just aren't anywhere near notable enough. And mind you, I'm not saying that they aren't important to the people involved in them, but they just aren't significant to the rest of the world and thus not suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia. To quote the official Wikipedia policy at <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">What Wikipedia is not</a>: <i>"Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information. That something is 100% true does not mean it is suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia."</i> -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 12:29, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I just don't get how things like feces is important yet a pretty succesfull community isn't? That is very how would you call it... discriminating? I removed all advertising and all that its plane information about a community now. If you don't agree then edit it until you think it is.</p>
<p>*VaS*Buffy</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh, but it <i>is</i> discriminating, absolutely. That's the whole point. I repeat: <i>"Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information."</i> Unless you guys have done something notable, I don't think your group deserves an article... and for the record, I'm not putting you down, because I don't deserve an article either. Most of us don't. It's not what Wikipedia is here for. So, no, I don't agree; that's why it's now up for deletion. And it's not my decision, mind you; there'll be a vote on it here. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 12:46, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Agreed. I vote for deletion. In answer to the question on what would make a guild important enough for Wikipedia, I would say:
<ul>
<li>Signifigance in the real world (e.g. the example above of creating a new game)</li>
<li>Widely influential in the gaming community (e.g. the first guild to codify a set of rules or by-laws that were adopted widely)</li>
<li>Significantly influential over a major title (e.g. the guild that was banned en-masse from EverQuest for cheating, resulting in a PR-overhaul to the SOE customer support procedures and policies)</li>
<li>Does it pass the "will we care in 20 years" test?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Just wait and see over 20 years when i started my own company for the community. I'm already making 60 dollar a month with it.</p>
<p>Beside an Encyclopedia like this should contain all information of the planet not the onces you think is important to you.</p>
<p>but like i said you just wait and see. *VaS*Buffy</p>
<ul>
<li>Uhh... yeah, sixty dollars a month's a good start. If I were you, I wouldn't give up my day job just yet, but we all gotta start somewhere. I appreciate your position regarding what an encyclopedia like this should contain, but as it happens, that's not compatible with official Wikipedia policy. If you want to change that policy, well, join the debate in the appropriate place. However, for the time being, we'll follow the established policy. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 12:56, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

I dont think it harms anyone... and if its not, why should we delete it? some people might find this useful... u find it insulting? i dont think so.... if somebody will search for it here - it means this info WAS useful (and that is what WP is all about, right?), and if its not useful - nobody will see it anyway, because they wont be interested in this... so just pass on it</p>
<p>Maurox</p>
<p><br />
Vanguards of Serenity" has a great influence in the Jedi Academy 3 community, I believe this is valid information - not just for the people playing this game, this shows that it is possible to actually earn money by running a game clan, and who knows, maybe in a year or more she'll be able to make a living from those money.</p>

Ok this should stay on Wikipedia cause the information is not harming anyone in any shape or form. I have seen the website and have have noted that this is a growing community. Does anyone gain from deleting this...no. Wikipedia gets more clicks, thats more people coming to this site and possibly giving you guys a donation. You wont be doing yourselves any favours by deleting this. This information is relevant. Your site 'Wikipedia' is all about the gaining of infomation, if you delete this, like I said you wont be helping anyone. The course of information and data has changed regularly and decisivly over the years. Even in this site! this is a quote from Captain Disdain 12:16, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC) "In other words, vanity/advertising; there may be some gaming clans or communities notable enough for inclusion in Wikipedia, but this, I'm afraid, is not one of them." This is not vanity my friend, nor advertising. This gaming clan is a 'standalone' in the JK:A community. Nearly everyone who has played the game has heard about *VaS*. Ive spoken to random people in the Jedi Academy community and 95% have heard about *VaS*. This is an outstanding accomplishment by *VaS*Buffy&#160;; to be well known in only two years, to get to a point in the gaming community that is highly respected and accomplished. So all up im voting for this to STAY! --Luke 05:48, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
