<li>To begin with, I would hardly call the attendees of The 18 Cup a group of friends. Hardly anyone likes anyone. Secondly, if ours is a vanity page as you seem to think, I believe this is just another example of someone with power flaunting it. How could this be anything but a vanity page for KJPurscell to say that HIS game is the greatest in the world. To finish with, there are visitors to the page in question who do not participate in the tournament, though who want to know who in fact holds the Cup. It is an important contribution to the Wikipedia as a whole in the view of the dozens of people who view it to gain valuable information from it.

<li>I have just read the things you point to and I think they are deplorable. What I have said (and I believe you have misread)is that people have accused all contributors and supporters of this page of being vandals. Clearly neither Tex Mex or myself are, we have kept things civil and tried to keep within the wiki guidelines throughout this ordeal. This whole process is most disappointing and does not reflect well on many people who have come in provocitably asking for the page to be "nuked". If you must vote to delete this humble page then do so with the same sense of civility that Tex Mex and Myself have defended our newbie page. But I guess that Wiki policy on not biting the newbies doesn't apply when there is a wave of hysteria. Tmothyh 21:50, 18 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Maybe you should have read <a href="../../../y/f/a/WP%7EYFA_410f.html" title="WP:YFA">your first article</a>. There is a prominent link to it when you are creating a page. Also, I don't consider this a wave of hysteria, not by a long shot. Does it look like we're biting you? If it does, we apologize. A good idea is not to participate in Wikipedia's affairs (basically, Wikipedia namespace) until you have 50-100 edits. By this time, you have a good feel for the project, and you usually don't get caught up in things like this. <a href="../../../s/f/g/User%7ESFGiants_f4f5.html" title="User:SFGiants">ςפקι</a><a href="../../../s/f/g/User%7ESFGiants_Esperanza_5f28.html" title="User:SFGiants/Esperanza"><font color="green">Д</font></a><a href="../../../s/f/g/User%7ESFGiants_f4f5.html" title="User:SFGiants">Иτς</a> <a href="../../../s/f/g/User_talk%7ESFGiants_c3b8.html" title="User talk:SFGiants">☺</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions%7ESFGiants_1766.html" title="Special:Contributions:SFGiants">☻</a> 17:20, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am in support of my colleague here. The fact that it has already been mentioned that a wide variety of people do in fact view this page as a source of information seems to be the reason why a few vandals have come out of the works. And the fact that because this has garnered some heat over the recent days is hardly reason enough to have a load of people support the deletion of this fine article because a friend was vandalised, or there is controversy associated with the entry. There is no reason to suggest a strong delete because you were not vandalised. All I see this page being used for is personal enjoyment of people challenging vandals to attack them, inciting a "Wiki-war" in the hopes that, and I believe this to be true, someone tracks the people down and makes troubles for them. This nomination for deletion is nothing more than another opportunity for a person with some power or nothing to do to nit-pick and start a fight with people who don't know better. Rather than challenging the reckless minority and making our simple article look bad and worthy of deleting, take the high road, as two of us have done and either help in fine-tuning of the article, or giving advice, as the respectable Elkman did (and I thank you for your advice pertaining to My Space, as it seems almost certain that our poor article will be deleted now), or sit back and don't meddle in problems that don't concern you. If you believe the article should be deleted, fine, leave your vote and reason, but do not turn this into a barbaric flame war. <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETex_Mex_f752.html" title="User:Tex Mex">Tex Mex</a> 05:31, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also, if anyone is knowledgeable in the My Space processes, please, we request your help to transfer our information over to a new page and set it up so that it can act as a 'community-page' <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETex_Mex_f752.html" title="User:Tex Mex">Tex Mex</a> 05:34, 18 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>You may think that. Personally, I don't have anything against the article, it just isn't notable enough. Really, you should put it on <a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Space_1ad7.html" title="My Space">My Space</a> or <a href="../../../e/v/e/Everything2.html" title="Everything2">Everything2</a> (in my opinion, Everything2 would be more appropriate). I don't think anybody is trying to turn this into a flame war, either. Remember, <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>. Also, you should tell your friends who also support this article to stop vandalizing user pages. Sorry if this is stereotyping all supporters of this page as vandals, but most of them are. This just happens too much in debates like this. We are making this article look worthy of deleting, because <b>it is</b>. Not everything belongs on Wikipedia, and this clearly falls under <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">WP:VANITY</a>. If you read this policy with an open mind, I think you will agree. On a final note, I don't think anybody reads this page for "information".

<li>I have indeed read the vanity guidelines, and this is where the controversy, for myself, begins. For example, I know it's not compulsory, but for me, in my own shoes, to "assume good faith", I would be much more ready to do this if, for example, this had happened: "Suggestion: before beginning any deletion procedures on a vanity article, it is sometimes found that by simply politely informing the creator of the article that this appears to be a vanity article, and by pointing him or her to this page first, that the author him or her self will sometimes easily agree to the deletion him or herself, thus saving much waste of time and energy on the parts of all concerned parties." Also, there have not been many edits because the information contained within the page will only change per the winner each week. The article is not there to further the 'popularity' or 'fame' of The 18 Cup, it merely exists to inform those that want to know about the past week's winner and current champion. Because this is an non-advertised Tournament, please do not rule this a vanity article because two of the competitors are writing it, as, on the vanity guidelines, this is not reason enough because the "subjects" are writing the article. There have been no vanity edits, such as links that promote the event or the individuals, no photographic material, and the article is quite clear and straight forward. We have salient and verifiable facts in here, and, because the tournament is not advertised, there are, of course, only a few select places where these facts can be corroborated, such as participant's blogs. Finally, I see no real information that should be on a user page that cannot co-exist with this article. My vote, do not delete because some people don't know how to contain themselves. <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETex_Mex_f752.html" title="User:Tex Mex">Tex Mex</a> 09:45, 18 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>People may want to know about it, but they won't want to know it on an encyclopedia. Encyclopedias are for things like the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Molasses_Disaster_6326.html" title="Boston Molasses Disaster">Boston Molasses Disaster</a>. If they want to know about the past week's winner, they should do it somewhere else.If it was advertised, and a large number of people knew about it, then <i>maybe</i> it would be acceptable. What do you mean by "some people don't know how to contain themselves"? You have just said yourself that the participants have blogs.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Non-notable. <a href="../../../c/n/w/User%7ECnwb_9e49.html" title="User:Cnwb">Cnwb</a> 04:23, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The problem we have here is that eight of the votes are due to vanity or other reasons other than notability, such as the persons who are voting just to incite vandals. If these people feel the need to continue for a vote which has less backing of all the reasons, then, of course, they are free to. But, in reference to these people that feel the need to vote for a delete on NN, as per Wikipedia "curtesy rules" as I have read them, please explain your vote for us. As the Notability page says, not all notable subjects are famous or important. It is well understood by us that this article is not of a 100% neutral point of view, however, as ςפקSFGiants has put forward, to really have a complete grasp of the method and nature of a Wikipedia Article, an author would need 50-100 edits and the like. We don't have that amount of edits, nor did we when we started the aricle, however, we are working on trying to get our heads around this, and will continue to in the future, in the hopes to improve this article, as well as the greater Wikipedia. Also, this article doesn't fit under any of the eight entries under the "What Wikipedia is not" entry: "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information", nor does it have anything to do with the future, or predictions. Even the Notablity article says that the definition of notability is subject to some conjecture, and that some editors may instead mean: original research, which this is clearly not, unverifiable, which this is, or a vanity page, which some people are now realising it is not this kind either. The article, by the Wikipedian definition of importance, is relevent to a reasonable number of people as well. Lack-of assumption seems to be key to the notability of an article, do not assume that something isn't notable because you havn't heard of it. There are people within our community that have heard of this tournament, and a substainial amount of these people read this article for the information it contains, such as winners, any new participants, etc. Also, I am not sure about this specifically, but if the first vote is how this article was put up for nomination for deletion, I believe that this nomination should be taken down because of the lack-of-backing for a nomination for vanity, as it is quite clear this is not a vanity article. I also raise the question as to how this page was "discovered", was it searched for, in which case it is somewhat notable, or was it a chance for someone else to just raise thier level of "activity" on thier own user page, and to appear more like an editor. Finally, please, tell us why this article should be taken down on terms of notability, not for one or two, but for the case of all the votes, so that you can pay us the curtesy and help us keep non-notable articles off this project. <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETex_Mex_f752.html" title="User:Tex Mex">Tex Mex</a> 04:54, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>By way of backing up my non-notable vote, as per the request by Tex Mex - the article does not establish <i>why</i> this poker tournament is notable. None of the players are notable, the venue isn't listed, the pot is a mere $2 per player, it has only been running since last year, and it does not receive media attention. It therefore appears to me to be a non-notable subject. <a href="../../../c/n/w/User%7ECnwb_9e49.html" title="User:Cnwb">Cnwb</a> 06:06, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Remember, <a href="../../../d/i/a/WP%7EDIAR_7049.html" title="WP:DIAR">interpret all rules</a>.
