<li><b>Keep</b>. The topic is a valid one and one on which there appear to be sufficient sources to write a good article. However, the article as written has serious POV issues.

<li>I initially intended to remain neutral on the issue, but I just noticed that the article <b>does not have a talk page</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a valid topic, though the current article is badly flawed. The article itself is already tagged for verification and NPOV checking.

<p>Notability? This article was most likely created by sock of banned user <a href="../../../i/s/r/User%7EIsraelbeach_1341.html" title="User:Israelbeach">Israelbeach</a>, aka Joel Leyden, though checkuser proved inconclusive. Article links to Joel Leyden's personal website, the "Israel News Agency", as a source. Note that though linked to Hebrew wiki, there is in fact no article on the Hebrew wikipedia about Arnon Katz. A Google search for ארנון כץ in Hebrew seems to confirm that the gist of the article is more or less true; in fact, I would support an article about this person on the Hebrew wikipedia, if properly verified. But I'm not sure it belongs on the English wikipedia. I am uncomfortable with the fact that this reads like PR copy, and is not linked to from any other Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">woggly</a> 17:00, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> 1. It is transparent that this article for deletion comes not from what is fact and noble, but has its origins in Wikipolitics. Woggly, as she states in her own words, associates this entry with user:Israelbeach and as such targets this article and anything associated with Joel Leyden or the Israel News Agency as sockpuppets or meatpuppets. Personal vendettas have no place on Wikipedia. 2. Woggly states that this article should be included in the Hebrew version of Wikipedia and I agree. But what Woggly misses here is that Arnon Katz resides in London and his mulit-million dollars ventures are international in nature. 3. <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empire_Online_7237.html" title="Empire Online">Empire Online</a> links to Arnon Katz, so if we are to delete Arnon Katz, who founded Empire, we should also delete Empire Online. 4. Arnon Katz co-created the first commercial Website in Israel and then went on to develop online gaming on the Internet. That speaks of nobility, not politics. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../i/s/r/User%7EIsraelgeeks_082b.html" title="User:Israelgeeks">Israelgeeks</a> (<a href="../../../i/s/r/User_talk%7EIsraelgeeks_ca20.html" title="User talk:Israelgeeks">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Israelgeeks_c503.html" title="Special:Contributions/Israelgeeks">contribs</a>) 12:00, 8 March 2007 (UTC).</small> <small>This is Israelgeek's 5th edit to Wikipedia.-<a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">woggly</a> 17:46, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</small></li>

My work focuses in particular on the legacy of three important Chishti-Sabiri spiritual masters (shaykhs) whose lives paralleled the birth and development of Pakistan itself: Muhammad Dhawqi Shah (d. 1951), and his two principal successors, Shahidullah Faridi (d. 1978) and Wahid Bakhsh Rabbani (d. 1995).</i></dd>

<p>This page provides little or no context. It attempts to cover a subject already covered throughout Wikipedia, but instead results in an article that can be summed up by the title, like "The community of editors in Wikipedia." Wikipedia doesn't need an article about its own community, plus, it might be a conflict of interest, as it is edited by the community. <a href="../../../v/o/x/User%7EVox_Rationis_5531.html" title="User:Vox Rationis">Vox Rationis</a> (<a href="../../../v/o/x/User_talk%7EVox_Rationis_fcd6.html" title="User talk:Vox Rationis">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vox_Rationis_1a05.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vox Rationis">contribs</a>)</p>

<dd>Professor Katz is a linguist by training, a Classicist by profession, and a comparative philologist at heart. He is particularly interested in etymology, which he views as part of the history of ideas. In addition to his wide-ranging Harvard dissertation, Topics in Indo-European Personal Pronouns, he is the author of numerous articles on literary, linguistic, and cultural subjects, ranging from Hesiod to Catullus, from Tocharian phonology to Hittite morphology, and from Greek badgers to Roman testicles.

<dd>No one is disputing that there are scholars researching etymology and Sanskrit (although I didn't realize Katz was one of them, so thanks for pointing me to the link). But that doesn't really <i>mean</i> anything, because this article we're discussin is on, as far as I can tell, Sanskrit and Tamil being related in some way (though it's hard to tell <i>what</i> the article is saying). This is not an accepted view among specialists and linguists; if you wanted to include it in Wikipedia, you'd have to back it up with sources--sourced that <i>directly relate to the specific topic</i> of Sanskrit's relation to Tamil. You'd also need to cite sources for the examples given in the article to illustrate or defend that point. Right now the article reads like pure original research--like the article is the forum where someone is writing a paper to defend a view they've come to on their own. There's nothing wrong with conducting original research, of course, but Wikipedia is not the place for it, and unless you can show that the article is not original research, it doesn't belong here. --<a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskwito_68c1.html" title="User:Miskwito">Miskwito</a> 20:26, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are so many books and authors who support the view that Sanskrit is related to Tamil and some that suggest that it emanates from Tamil or its Proto-X language.If Wiki is suggesting that the thesis needs to be accepted by wiki recognised panelist then well it is another matter.Even the fact that Sanskrit is Indo-european is questioned by some authors leave alone its linking with Tamil.I have also given a link here which is suggestive of contradictory views in the area.The debate at the national and international arena is on.My work here is only carrying the opinion held in a logical manner and furthering such original works and opinions.<b>I still strongly feel wiki should retain the article if needed with appropriate Tag suggesting that it is view of the author or the like</b></p>

<dd>Then <b>cite some</b>. From <b>reliable, published sources</b>, cite evidence to (1) back up the specific claims of the theory being made in the article and (2) demonstrate that this is a view held by more than a handful of fringe theorists. For every one example of a scholar who believes Sanskrit is not Indo-European, but instead Dravidian and related to Tamil--and has written this in a reliable, published work--I'll give you fifty who would say that view is lunatic, and who could back their claims up with centuries of accumulated historical linguistic evidence. I doubt many of them would even be aware that this theory you're pushing even existed. So provide actual citations from reliable published sources to back up the claims made in the article, and, furthermore, to demonstrate the <i>notability</i> of the theory. The fact that some people believe it isn't enough to establish its notability, there needs to be evidence that a large number of people are <i>aware</i> that the theory even exists. I'm not sure why I'm still arguing, though. This clearly qualifies for speedy deletion... --<a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskwito_68c1.html" title="User:Miskwito">Miskwito</a> 05:12, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Oh, I think I see what you're saying...you're comparing the enthusiasm the professor inspires in his students with his novel approach to the enthusiasm this article will doubtless inspire in laymen reading Wikipedia with its novel approach...a novel approach consisting of original research, unsubstantiated/unreferenced claims, dense linguistic terminology, and incomprehensible broken English, all poorly-formated? I don't mean to be insulting here, but if no one is even able to read the article, it won't do much good at educating them. Even if that weren't the case, of course, it's still original research, and thus inappropriate for Wikipedia, whether it's true or not. --<a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskwito_68c1.html" title="User:Miskwito">Miskwito</a> 04:10, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Below is an extract though out of context here it would be better readers know prima-facie on what we are discussing .The Only Living Classical language of the world.</p>
<p>This is How Professor George Hart(Professor of Tamil at the University of California, Berkeley, since 1975 currently holder of the Tamil Chair at that institution. ) had to lament " It seems strange to me that I should have to write an essay such as this claiming that Tamil is a classical literature -- it is akin to claiming that India is a great country or Hinduism is one of the world's great religions. The status of Tamil as one of the great classical languages of the world is something that is patently obvious to anyone who knows the subject. To deny that Tamil is a classical language is to deny a vital and central part of the greatness and richness of Indian culture. " On a request from a Tamil Counter part to write an impression on Tamil.Albiet Now Tamil is Declared as a Classical language by the Indian Government.</p>

<p>All of these articles are virtually identicle, and none of them seems to have any real notability. Wikipedia is not an FCC database of broadcast towers (one exists on FCC.gov) It's hard to imagine that these articles will ever get past stub stage, and there is a broad consensus to delete such articles on masts. Note that these are already listed on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_masts.html" title="List of masts">List of masts</a>, so no further merging must be done. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDescendall_348e.html" title="User:Descendall">Descendall</a> 01:10, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is indiscriminate because anyone who happens to use the term "Doomsday" is the criteria for inclusion in the article. It's just a random list of people who say Doomsday. Meanwhile people who don't call it Doomsday are not included because they never use the term. Thus the article has no focus or meaning. Conceptually, the concept is already covered elsewhere on Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 19:25, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - this actually brings up a pretty complicated issue. The subject matter that this article touches on seems to be strewn about and duplicated across a number of articles, most of which don't really link to each other. To say that this is 'bad form' is a bit of an understatement. The way I understand it, the various "End of the World" scenarios can be lumped into two main categories. Those that deal with a more religious, philisophical or othewise nonscientific approach covered in <a href="../../../e/s/c/Eschatology.html" title="Eschatology">Eschatology</a> and then the topic of physical and material threats to the Earth as described in scientific literature. The ones brought up thus far in this discussion are <a href="../../../e/x/i/Existential_risk.html" title="Existential risk">Existential risk</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_extinction.html" title="Human extinction">human extinction</a> and <a href="../../../r/i/s/Risks_to_civilization%2C_humans_and_planet_Earth_178e.html" title="Risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth">Risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth</a>. There appear to exist other articles that touch on the subject, as well. What we've got looks like a web of forks, and it's a mess. What really needs done is to have this set of articles overhauled as a whole, merging and redirecting where appropriate, to eliminate redundancy and duplicate information as well as present the associated topics in a more logical manner. For the time being I would propose to <b>merge</b> this article with <a href="../../../r/i/s/Risks_to_civilization%2C_humans_and_planet_Earth_178e.html" title="Risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth">Risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth</a> but the real solution to this problem involves a lot more work. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 15:46, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Well, as I said, perhaps you should have proposed a merger instead. Not sure if I agree, as I don't know that this article has to be a duplicate, and honestly, I like this title better than that one. But it's not really a deletion concern. However, I do think it might be worth setting up a Wikiproject or discussion on it over all. I put up <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28miscellaneous%29_ea61.html#End_of_the_World" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (miscellaneous)">Wikipedia:Village pump (miscellaneous)#End of the World</a> as a start, though I don't know that it's the best place, and it'll probably end up elsewhere.

<li>Thanks. The problem is there is no commonly accepted name for these events, so we "make one up" on Wikipedia. But every time someone makes up a name: <a href="../../../d/o/o/Doomsday_event.html" title="Doomsday event">Doomsday event</a>, TEOTWAWKI, <a href="../../../e/n/d/End_of_civilization.html" title="End of civilization">End of civilization</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/d/End_of_humanity.html" title="End of humanity">End of humanity</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/d/End_of_the_world.html" title="End of the world">End of the world</a> -- someone else comes along and says it is original research and/or the articles doesn't encompass what the title says and/or the title is poor and a new one is needed etc.. it's been an endless cycle of discussions for years, in AfD's, Rename requests and Merge requests. At this point I think <a href="../../../e/x/i/Existential_risk.html" title="Existential risk">existential risk</a> might be the best place. -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 17:59, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, I'd say the problem is not that there is no commonly accepted names, but that there are several commonly accepted terms (Besides Doomsday, Apocalypse, Armageddon, Cataclysm, Holocaust, even World War III and Ragnarok might well be considered generic terms in some lights), each of which may have a slightly different meaning, and the articles themselves do have some differences in them, but the problem is not in the existence of the articles themselves, but the lack of a cohesive group consensus on how to cover this subject. As I think more about it, I would suggest trying to establish some kind of Wikiproject so you can bring people together on this subject. I would also recommend not going the AfD route, that's rarely conducive to getting people to work together, as it comes across as a slap in the face. And no, I don't recommend <a href="../../../e/x/i/Existential_risk.html" title="Existential risk">existential risk</a> for the article title, as it is an obscure term, and not in common usage. I would prefer something closer to the vernacular. Feel free to title the Wikiproject with that name though, should you wish to go that route. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 19:49, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You are probably right, the problem is large and complex enough to warrant a Project. It surpasses talk page discussions and AfDs. It involves probably a dozen articles or more and will require some serious work to figure out all the pieces, the best way to assemble them, and establishing consensus. I'm not even sure I want to take it on, it's like herding cats. This AfD shows how wide and disparate the views are, and how strongly people feel about it. -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 04:14, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The doomsday event article is basically a list of other WP articles that share this common attribute: I think of it like a standard list article, an highly useful annotated roadmap to other articles that share this common attribute. <a href="../../../d/o/o/Doomsday_event.html" title="Doomsday event">Doomsday event</a> could certainly be improved: the references section is terrible, and it would benefit from citing references to the use of the term, but it does not need to be deleted. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUnitedStatesian_fd29.html" title="User:UnitedStatesian">UnitedStatesian</a> 19:45, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The article used to be called <a href="../../../e/n/d/End_of_civilization.html" title="End of civilization">End of civilization</a>, but then we got caught up in what does "end" really mean and what does "civilization" really mean. It really is a very difficult problem, "Doomsday event" has the same problems, even worse really. "Doomsday" is purely subjective and not a neutral descriptor. We all "think" we know what we mean when we say "Doomsday", but it only makes sense in the context of its usage, it doesn't work as a standalone objective statement of fact.-- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 17:59, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

"Doomsday event" is an umbrella term describing a class of events of a certain kind, and it has at least 2 decades of history. As such it warrants an encyclopedia entry, especially an entry in the most comprehensive and up-to-date encyclopedia in the world. As for the proposed merge, I do not believe that "doomsday event" is equivalent to "existential risk." A risk and an event are two different things. I think the article can be improved, but I do not see it as mostly original research. It is simply a descriptive list of specific sorts of events which fall under the umbrella term "doomsday event," and it links back to many of the detailed articles on those specific sorts of events. -- <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiPedant_c1b0.html" title="User:WikiPedant">WikiPedant</a> 02:27, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not really sure which way to vote. As for "authorization from the school that it represents" - except for the logo they don't have to authorize it.

<li><b>Reply To Comment</b> I never was authorized to make it, I only made an original one in my spare time and served as a "moderator" as others expanded it. However it has been seen by the administration and supposedly people out of the school who contacted the administration as true. As the person who has admitted to being the "moderator" for the page, I do not want to held accountable for any inaccuracies that I make accidentally, or any that anyone else makes that I cannot prove or disprove. The school has requested that it be removed and though it has gone beyond my direct power at this point, I am still being indirectly held responsible for it. Sciencepark 02:15, 7 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia pages don't have moderators. I hope the school can understand that you have no control over, or responsibility for, the page. While all pages here should aim for accuracy, the wise reader will be cautious about how far s/he trusts them, especially if sources aren't given. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicki_Rosenzweig_719b.html" title="User:Vicki Rosenzweig">Vicki Rosenzweig</a> 02:20, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I couldn't care less what your school administrators think. They have absolutely no authority over Wikipedia. WE decide whether to keep or junk the article. I see nothing wrong with the article, so I don't want to delete it. If there is a copyright problem with anything, and you know about it, please change it -- that is, <b>exact</b> wording that may have been taken from the school Web site or some school document. If the pictures in the article belong to the school itself, please take those off. If you know of anything inaccurate, please change it. If the school administration knows of anything inaccurate, someone on the staff should change it. Otherwise, with all due respect and trying to be as civil as possible, your school administration may go to hell.

<li><b>Keep</b> for now. I have to agree with Norton that your school administration has no authority to demand that an article on them be deleted. If <b>anything</b> whatsoever in the article is untrue or inaccurate, they of course have the right to remove or change it, but aside from that (and copyright issues), they have no say in the matter as far as Wikipedia is concerned. Would they really punish you just for creating the article? That would be absolutely ridiculous of them. --<a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskwito_68c1.html" title="User:Miskwito">Miskwito</a> 03:33, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong keep</b>: What a joke. Wikipedia now needs "authorization" to create articles? And you all of a sudden jump in with a "request" from the school to remove the article? I laughed when I read that. As it stands, the article contains a wealth of information that asserts its notability and has some damn nice images to accompany it. It needs sources, however, but that should not be hard to find for such a prominent school. <a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeicer_9e78.html" title="User:Seicer"><b><span style="color: #B33C1A; font: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 10px;">Seicer</span></b></a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/e/i/User_talk%7ESeicer_8d2f.html" title="User talk:Seicer">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Seicer_6c61.html" title="Special:Contributions/Seicer">contribs</a>)</small> 03:35, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> While I am in 100% agreement with the above editors who assert that this school's administrators have no authority over Wikipedia, I do have hesitations over how this article is sourced and if this school is notable enough to warrant an article. As it stands now most of info is unsourced, while the article looks ok and seems to be pretty NPOV it remains a problem. Still this is no reason to summarily delete a decent article. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J. Leivick">Daniel J.

<li><b>Keep</b> Your school has no ability to determine what articles Wikipedia has, and as High Schools in general are found to be notable, so there is no reason to delete it, since it is a real school. <a href="http://www.nps.k12.nj.us/science/index2.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nps.k12.nj.us/science/index2.htm" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>. The content of the page is borderline, as I do think there's plenty of unsourced material that needs cleanup, but inherently, there's nothing wrong with it. Now as regards the school administration's actions, I assume you are a student there? Well, I do think your user name might be worth changing, but I don't see that many edits to the page from you. Did you edit under a different name? Doesn't matter anyway, if your school administration is pressuring you, your best bet is to see an attorney or your local ACLU. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 03:51, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The article will greatly benefit from a thorough cleanup. No one owns this article, and I will certainly volunteer my efforts to improving it and ensuring that no one is "blamed" for its content. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 03:57, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>The School is not necessarily punishing me or pressuring but when the content was discovered, I was asked and I explained how I created the page and occasionally made edits. Therefore, being the only in school source so far of the page, I was asked to just delete it all for the time being. In terms of username, this was created today due to the fact that the NPS IP address is blocked at my school from edits so I have edits from various IP's from wherever I worked on it at that moment. I will suggest that someone of authority in the school revise it such as a teacher or administrator however my instruction was to have it deleted. If this is rejected by you to be deleted I don't think that I am at fault because I did what was asked, but I must follow through with my order to avoid any problems.

<li><b>Keep but cleanup immediately</b>. Marginally notable high school. Sciencepark is probably under attack by dim-witted school administrators that don't understand what Wikipedia is and think they're being H4X0R3D...that is if high school administrations and their comprehension of technology hasn't changed any since I was in high school. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThunderbunny_ebbf.html" title="User:Thunderbunny">Thunderbunny</a> 04:18, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy keep and close</b>. The article seems okay to me. For the nominator- Wikipedia is independent of other organizations. Unless the article in question is a <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_project.html" title="Black project">black project</a>, it cannot be simply told what to do. Also, factuality is not an adeqaute argument when nominating an article. Flaws can always be removed- that's why we use a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">wiki</a>! Possible bad-faith nom. I concur with the elaborate argument placed by Noroton as well. <b><a href="../../../s/r/1/User%7ESr13_af5f.html" title="User:Sr13">Sr13</a></b> <b>(<a href="../../../s/r/1/User_talk%7ESr13_4dc1.html" title="User talk:Sr13">T</a></b>|<b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sr13_98de.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sr13">C</a></b>) 04:21, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and cleanup including sourcing. A good chunk of the article is unencyclopedic "insider" detail that can be discarded, which removes most of the <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> challenges. The basic information about the school should be easily verified.

Not sure if they think this is like a MySpace group or what, but we don't need their permission to write about them. -- <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 04:52, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Note</b> Since it seems that this will not be deleted, I did as said by Dhartung and cleared anything I believe to be insider information. I am hoping that this will not be considered as clearing the page since the majority has been removed, however I will suggest that someone with more knowledge of the school post to make a newer article if this does not delete (which seems to be the likely scenario here).

<dd>Article looks much better now.

<li>So, why are you saying that this article should be deleted exactly? Sourcing this article is a trivial matter, and in any case, not a reason to delete it. The content is not significantly objectionable in any way that I can see. Also, I think you'll find that the vast majority of high schools are kept, without regard to any actions by the administration. I do think that's a boneheaded thing to do, but it's got nothing to do with this subject. Finally, I think you should be advised, AfD is not a vote, it is a discussion. Numbers don't matter.

<li><b>Neutral</b>: While I'm a strong opponent on the notability of secondary schools, I must chime in with the rest in defense of the principle that the subjects of articles get veto power neither over the content nor the existence of related articles. I have no doubt that the high school's administration would have collective apoplexy over the notion that their social studies or English textbooks were subject to censorship by anyone named therein. Heck, if I was feeling bloodyminded enough, I'd forward a link to this AfD to the Newark media and see what they had to say over it. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 19:08, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> A lot of people here seem to be reacting to the circumstances of this nomination, specifically the suggestion that someone other than Wikipedia might have authority over what articles can be written. I understand where this sentiment comes from but there are cases where AFD does not have the final say—a salient example is <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a>. If an organization makes a request to have an article removed because they believe it to be defamatory, we ought to take that request seriously (for both legal and perceptual reasons); we need to either source any potentially defamatory material carefully or remove the material (perhaps reducing the article to a substub in the process). However, in this case it's hard to see how this article could be construed as defamatory at this point. I think we should <b>keep it</b> and tag it as unreferenced, or at the worst reduce it to a stub. <span style="font-size: 10px">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 19:47, 7 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, as far as it goes, if the High School had some concerns about the content of the article, I would support their bringing them up on the talk page, or if it's non-controversial, editing it themselves. I don't imagine anybody else would feel different. But as you say, there's nothing in this article that seems defamatory to me. Of course, we don't know what the school administration really said either, so it's a non-issue as far as I'm concerned. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 20:18, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Naturally! I think the main thing I'm saying is that we shouldn't expect outsiders to understand the proper Wikipedia way to accomplish certain things, and shouldn't knee-jerk just because something isn't done the Wikipedia way. Some things (like protecting Wikipedia from lawsuits or very bad publicity) are in fact more important than our customs. <span style="font-size: 10px">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 21:21, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>If an initial impressionof our school comes from an article on a site which appears to be a blog for anyone wishing to discuss the school then it can in our view be harmful to our students . There are other forums on the Internet for this and students may say what they choose there . Ihave read enough of the commentary to know that this isnot about what may be good for our school but hype about rights and censure and anything else one wants to say about our motivation . What is good for Wikipedia is an issue here and quite frankly the responsibility to act responsibly for this school is not yours.</p>

<li>In my honest opinion, what the students think about the school (besides the immature "Thiz skool suks" comments) should be a concern for the administration and interested parents. If I were a parent, looking for a school for my child, I would rather hear honest student opinions than what the school or school board says. This is similar to buying a product. The reviews of actual buyers are much more helpful and relevant to whether I, as the consumer, should buy the product than what the manufacturer says. I can't imagine the school posting controversies and problems with the school on the school website, but parents need to know those kinds of things. This is just an example, I'm not implying anything about the school being discussed: If a school has a problem with violence, parents need to know. Are they going to read zbout that on a school website though? Not likely. <a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr.Z-man_cef0.html" title="User:Mr.Z-man"><font color="maroon">Mr.Z-man</font></a><b><small><a href="../../../m/r/2E/User_talk%7EMr.Z-man_a62d.html" title="User talk:Mr.Z-man">talk</a></small><i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mr.Z-man_8ed1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mr.Z-man"><font color="navy" face="cursive">¢</font></a></i></b><small><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Mr.Z-man_c2f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Mr.Z-man">Review!</a></small> 21:07, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> For my part, were I a parent in that district, I'd be deeply concerned (although not in the least degree surprised) about a so-called educator with such a mediocre command of grammar, spelling and punctuation. I'd be <i>extraordinarily</i> concerned about any such so-called "administrator" who believes the Bill of Rights to be "hype." If the school was genuinely concerned about acting responsibly (provided this is really an administrator speaking), they would bust this yahoo back to janitor and take a good, hard look at the quality of their teaching. That aside, he's right in one thing and one thing only: our motivation is sure not about what's good for his school. <i>Nor should it be.</i> <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 21:19, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>I am the student who suggested this for deletion</b> And I do not understand what reasoning you have to not delete it. I, unlike my administrators, am a supporter of the wikipedia project and I often spend time on the site learning about various things going link to link and having faith that hat I read is true. But after meeting with my administrator today for them to post the statement, I agree with reasoning that she expressed with me today; anyone can change the page with little moderation (someone in this forum said that there are no moderators), and the only changes that seem to be looked at are the deletion of mass information. For some time, there was a line in there that I did not read that attempted to compare Science to technology by boasting Technology HS's networking class against our computer training. There was one edit that I never even saw until looking back today that says "Pro's of Science High: None this school is a!!" that had lasted for a while. I do understand that what I submitted 2 years ago becomes your property, however I do not feel it is right for you to hold on to it if no one wants it. I am offended myself because with my simple request to ask you to delete it as per my administrator, you have twisted everything into a battle against free speech and the rights of Wikipedia. Someone before said that this could be related to a living person, and I agree. This is a school in existence that is having untrue, and inappropriate statements written about it (see history) and that is nothing suitable to publish by a public site. I am sure that someone monitors the "Wikipedia" entry here regularly and could afford to clean it up when someone tries to put anything bad on it, but I, as a senior, do not have the time anymore to deal with this as more people are becoming attracted to the page recently, and neither does anyone else in the school. So since we must be technical, I shall bring up the deletion policy issues with the article
<ul>
<li>Conflict of Interest: I started this article with an organization I am involved with and it has been edited by those involved with it and in competition with it in inappropriate ways.</li>
<li>Vandalism: This article is subject of constant vandalism with untrue information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Notability: Schools in general are not notable. This one does have some significance, however there is no accurate history yet of the school on the page that explains the notability so there is no reason to keep it. The only thing on the page now is that it was in an old building and got a new one. There is more to it and until someone provides a history showing this, it should be removed because I am not the one who will write it. KMB Sciencepark 03:12, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>And in addition</b>, I found it horribly wrong when I looked later in the day and saw that you referred to my administrator as a Yahoo because she was typing fast because I was becoming late to class meeting with her and helping to post it. The school does value education and what is being said on this page is "hype" about freedom of speech because you certainly would not want someone writing something malicious for the public to see regarding Wikipedia. KB Sciencepark 03:16, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Many editors in this debate seem to have allowed their indignation at the perceived hubris of these school administrators to overcome their reasoned, rational, natural <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civility</a>. On behalf of all the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedians.html" title="Wikipedians">Wikipedians</a> who may not have time to return to this discussion and reconsider their <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">hasty</a> remarks, I apologize to the school administrators and anyone else who may have been offended by the remarks of these editors. However, I must point out that all contributions to Wikipedia are licensed under the <a href="../../../g/d/f/GDFL_cdb5.html" title="GDFL">GDFL</a> and are therefore no longer the property of the contributors, and that the nature of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">wiki</a> is such that vandalism occurs, but over a statistically-significant period, the actions of <a href="../../../t/r/o/WP%7ETROLL_3085.html" title="WP:TROLL">trolls</a> are usually corrected by the <a href="../../../g/n/o/WP%7EGNOME_d0c8.html" title="WP:GNOME">gnomes</a> or vandalism patrollers.

<li><b>Reply to comment</b>: Well if that service is available and suggest that you either have that protection available to the page or do as requested by me and remove it. I will talk to my administrator tomorrow because the major issue is that students or maybe not even students but someone is posting things that even I know is not true. We have had incidents but ... well just read the history, the things that have been written on the page are not nearly a representation of the issues here. I'd think that there were people carrying guns around the school perimeter waiting on corners for people and trying to target students. I will not sit here on a regular basis with my mind just wondering "What is on that page" because in general you need more safeguards in the wikipedia. When I started using it, I do not think there were many users particularly in my community. Now there are alot more and not all of them have good intentions when using this site and I predict that you will sooner or later see that with more people placing opinions this site will become very inaccurate. I strongly advise all people who continue to vote in favor of keeping to review the school history. Me and someone else whom we have not tracked down are consistently fixing the page, and I am done with it after tomorrow. But this is my last day commenting on behalf of the school so I strongly suggest a thorough look at the quality of maintnance and protection on this page as well as others.

<li><b>Delete</b> It's only apparent claim to fame is being in the top 20% of high schools according to one magazine? Not notable.

<li><b>Further comment on my part</b> Well, while certainly referring to someone as a Yahoo or anything else is a question of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civility</a>, the lack of professionalism in trying to hurry and type a reply is itself a problem. If you don't have the time to send a thoughtful, considered response, then the wise thing to do would be to refrain from responding. It's basically an extension of the 10-second rule when you're angry. If your alleged school administrator wanted to convince people, it would behoove them to do a better job of responding effectively. Sure, anybody can make a typo, or forget to zip up their fly, accidents happen, pobody's nerfect, but there's still a responsibility to be professional. As to your claims of a reason to delete this article, they are not convincing. The COI problem in this case is minimal. If you can't make edits to it without bias, that is your problem, not the articles. The same goes with Vandalism. It happens all over Wikipedia, every day in thousands of articles. So far, it hasn't destroyed the world yet, and I doubt it ever will. But it will likely remain an ongoing problem, not just for this subject, though high schools with the typical immaturity of teenagers do attract a lot of problems, but for almost any of them. If your school administration thinks there is a problem with its students though, perhaps it might be worthwhile to consider instructing the students as to the value of integrity, honesty, and not making vandal edits to Wikipedia. This could be a great educational opportunity, teaching responsibility, not just complaining about a problem. Notability is still in discussion, but High schools are generally accepted as being notable. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a>
<ul>
<li>Quite. Vandalism is a pervasive problem, but that's not a Wikipedia problem; it's one of society at large, and there are more sensible, reasoned responses than forbidding people from saying anything because you're afraid that they'll say something you don't like. Following that, given the bent of this school's administration -- provided their stance is, indeed, being accurately reported -- they do seem to define "inaccurate" as meaning "information which makes us look bad." Are they really trying to tell us that an inner-city high school in New Jersey is free of violence? <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 14:21, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I've outlined my concerns on the article's talk page. In brief: contains multiple different types of Spanish words/expressions: those fully integrated into English, those virtually only used by people who speak Spanish, and those used by people who don't speak Spanish, but who recognize the words/phrases as "foreign" and unusual. Subject is almost by definition <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, as it deals with words and expressions supposedly often used in English but <i>that won't be listed in any dictionary</i> because they're not standard English yet.

<dd>Your continued call for the deletion of the article on Rochelle Holt is not only unjustified but even bizarre. Moreover, explaining the proposed deletion because, in addition to her MFA from the University of Iowa, she pursued further studies at Columbia Pacific University (CPU), <a href="http://www.columbia-pacific-university.net" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.columbia-pacific-university.net" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>, <a href="http://circledance.tripod.com/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://circledance.tripod.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>, is part of an orchestrated academic witch hunt. Since when is learning a crime? The defamation of CPU is part of the irresponsible misinformation phenomenon, which is described quite well, for example, in <a href="../../../m/2E/_/M._Scott_Peck_b9f7.html" title="M. Scott Peck">M. Scott Peck</a>'s book, People of the Lie (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-671454927</a>; Dr. Peck is best known for his best seller, The Road Less Traveled).</dd>

<dd>She is listed in the International Who’s Who in Poetry, London: Routledge, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0948875593</a>, and her biography is featured at universities and literary publications. Please see Reference Section in article.</dd>
</dl>
<p>She received numerous professional awards, grants and honours, including nomination for the Pulitzer Prize. She is regarded by her peers as a major poet and a significant science fiction writer. A Reader’s Digest survey ranked her first among American poets. In addition to her numerous and well-received books, she published over 2000 poems in about 300 periodicals and magazines, and gave over 700 public readings at universities, schools, hospitals, libraries, bookstores and other places. She has originated a new literary genre within the category of the poem-novel, recognized by experts as a significant and innovative accomplishment. Her plays have been performed in theatres. As a publisher she has advanced the works of other professional artists. Among other things, she has published important scholarly work about the life and art of Anais Nin, Henry Miller, Lawrence Durrell as well as others and contributed to the development of literary theory.</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Actually, according the the source you provide, NYU has a collection that includes some of your grandfather's personal papers.

<dd><b>Comment</b>."Division" is jargon for the origin market. Think of "small press prose" as comparable to "mid-market periodical", as an example.

<dd>That may be true, though the Pulitzer website does not list anything approaching a prize that fits these categories, nor does it categorize its literary prizes by market type (beyond fiction, nonfiction, and so on). More importantly, Ms. Holt's name is not listed anywhere on the Pulitzer website, even though they list all nominees after 1980 (before the text in question was published). <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkinwalker_9c72.html" title="User:Skinwalker">Skinwalker</a> 00:01, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak delete</b> The sources and claims <i>look</i> good, but the Pulitzer nomination was in the "small press fiction" category (a very minor thing) and I am having a hard time establishing the validity of many other claims, despite such impressive sources as, er, an Angelfire user page. In fact, about half the references were either off-the-page advertising or did not actually support the statement for which they claimed to be references. Looks like the author did a Google search and tried to find a home for every link. I find it really hard to accept this author's contention that a self-published author with with fewer than 200 unique Googles is a titan of the literary world. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 22:32, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The quality of Holt's work is irrelevant to Wikipedia. The important thing is notability determined with reference to external sources. Also authorsden.com is a well-known site used predominently by self-published or vanity-press-published authors to network in order to promote each other's work.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Finally coming to a conclusion on this one, although it took a while. The Pulitzer nomination turns out to be totally unimportant and possibly fabricated. The publications seem to be entirely self published or vanity-press published. Having been an editor for a small press does not confer notability. Regarding the entry in the <i>Internaional Who's Who in Poetry</i>, it should be noted that there are two books of this title. I can't verify her inclusion in either, because both are insanely expensive. One of them is a vanity publication by the <a href="../../../p/o/e/Poetry.com.html" title="Poetry.com">International Library of Poetry</a>. Jonathon vos Post's web site, much as I respect it as a useful resource, is not a reliable source and cannot confer notability. The only thing that suggests notability is that a university has a collection of her work, which honestly doesn't seem like enough to me. We have no idea why they decided to collect this work, and there are no secondary sources discussing in what way the work is considered significant. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 11:20, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Saberwyn, this gallery represents a year and half of very hard work on the part of many dedicated Wikipedians. The original idea (my own, so of course I want to save it) was based on <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gallery_of_sovereign_state_coats_of_arms.html" title="Gallery of sovereign state coats of arms">Gallery of sovereign state coats of arms</a> specifically to show the unity, the uniqueness and the local evolution of a very simple emblem to one that represents so much history and pride. This year is the 100th anniversary of Scouting, and I would be happy to implement any changes to save this article. It is no longer just a gallery, and as you say has the potential to be a useful annotated gallery/encyclopedia article. What can we do to make this something able to be kept?

<li>I'm sorry, but <i>I don't know</i> how to save this article in its current form. The fair use rules for organisation logos (as I understand them) are that the logo should only be used to illustrate an article on the organisation the logo belongs to. Under the rules, using "fair use" images in this way is (to my knowledge) not permissable. I'll say that a sourced, externally verifiable text article about the Scouting logo would be one way to go from here, but unfortunately, I cannot see a way for this not to be deleted. It is a shame; being an ex-Rover it is interesting to see all the logos laid out like that (the only other time I'd seen it done was on a poster sold at the last World Jamboree), but my liking it does not trump copyright law. -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">saberwyn</a> 06:11, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The question here is simply a legal one. Maybe it could be argued that these are illustrating their Scout organisation on a list of all such organisations in the world. Maybe it can not be so argued. There seems to be a feeling that it would be valuable if it was legal.

I think I'm on solid ground when I say that under US copyright law, the doctrine of <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a> makes us perfectly free to have this article. If the law were the only issue, that's a non-issue. If this were Gallery of news media photos, forget it, we would be infringing on their right to exclusively market their product. But a gallery of logos of non-profit organizations should not be a problem UNDER THE LAW. It is, however, a problem on WIKIPEDIA. Our <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAIR_1f27.html" title="WP:FAIR">fair use policy</a> is intentionally more restrictive than what we could get away with. This is because Wikipedia is a free-content encyclopedia. We only use non-free images under a claim of fair use when it is a necessity - we don't have articles that contain no free content. Sometimes, this is inconvenient. Sometimes it's annoying. I am a Scouter and have been involved with Scouting for 20 years. I like this article. I enjoy looking at it. But, for the ultimate goal of being a free-content encyclopedia, we sometimes have to make compromises and one of them is that we don't have articles containing nothing but non-free images. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 17:59, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> unless some references supplied. There are some sources on Indo-Trinidadian music available. Google books has Helen Myers' <i>Music of Hindu Trinidad</i>. The Mohammed brothers mentioned by Guettarda are indexed in Myers' book, but Fazal is not. Nor does he seem to be listed at <a href="http://www.rafimohammed.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.rafimohammed.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rafimohammed.com/</a> as the brothers are. Having said that, Nazir Mohammed (mentioned at rafimohammed.com) is not indexed by Myers either. "Lord Fazal", which appears to raise some eyebrows, is in fact a plausible style (compare "Lord Shaker", "Prince Buster"...). The article seems perfectly plausible and entirely unattributable. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 23:59, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Nice find on the Helen Myers book. Yes, "Lord Fazal" is totally in keeping with the names used by calypsonians; coming from Aranguez, Mohammed would have been more creolised than would someone from Felicity, for example. Also with regards to Myers book - as Muslim devotional music I'm not even sure that they would have been a primary interest in a book on <i>Hindu</i> music. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 21:31, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> (to reiterate <b>strong delete</b>) There's no denying that the figure is legitimate. The question is whether a terribly minor Scottish criminal whose only notoriety is a brief mention in a handful of newspapers meets the notability requirement.

<li>The article is about the original Adam Lyal, the tour company and the political campaign. That is why my original comment included 'delete parts about non notable C18 criminal and non notable tour company'.

<li><b>Delete</b> all three. These people are not notable simply by being eligible to be on the list, and I know a number of people who qualify for each list but are not on it. An incomplete list is not useful. Categories do a better job of "list of xxx people with Wikipedia articles" which is essentially what two of these are. The third is a copy of someone else's list of "notable Presbyterians", but that website neither provides references for the claims that those people are/were Presbyterian, nor for those people being more notable than all other Australian Presbyterians (and it's a personal view, not the UCA's official opinion). I would <i>keep</i> lists of people who are notable <i>because</i> they are/were Anglican/Catholic/Presbyterian (such as list of Australian Catholic archbishops, List of moderators of the Presbyterian Church of Australia). --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 11:50, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The problem with changing this sort of thing to categories is that you can put anyone in the category, and there's no way of verifying if anyone is an Anglican on the category page. I've started to attribute sources to all of the Anglican people, and it at least provides evidence that the persons in question have been or are involved in that particular church or denomination. I agree that the lists are very incomplete, but the way to stop that is to fix them up, not to delete them. <a href="../../../j/r/g/User%7EJRG_cdbe.html" title="User:JRG">JRG</a> 00:49, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Update comment</b> - for the List of Australian Anglicans, the persons' Anglicanism has been attributed in all cases to a source indicating their involvement with the Anglican church or their well-espoused Anglican belief; except for one instance, who was actually a Congregationalist and has been deleted from the list. I'm happy to add more people to this list, as I'm sure there are many more to be put in here. <a href="../../../j/r/g/User%7EJRG_cdbe.html" title="User:JRG">JRG</a> 01:19, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>You have referenced the people in the list that they belong there (well done), and expanded the lead. There are still only 24 of them, so the list is clearly incomplete. The longer lead is still just as open - the correct reference for the list under that introduction would be the payroll for the Anglican Church, plus its membership lists. For example, <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kim_Beazley_97c0.html" title="Kim Beazley">Kim Beazley</a> is not notable/famous/defined by the fact that he is a member of the Anglican church. He's famous because he was a politician. Ask five random Australians what <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Howard_1ea1.html" title="John Howard">John Howard</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kim_Beazley_97c0.html" title="Kim Beazley">Kim Beazley</a> and <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Rudd_578c.html" title="Kevin Rudd">Kevin Rudd</a> have in common, and you're unlikely to find "they're all Anglicans" is the answer. They're all former leaders of the Opposition, and their politics are not defined by their denomination. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 02:03, 9 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If we are to have a distinct categorisation, what do you suggest I change the lead (and/or the title) to? Rudd, for example, is someone who has distinctly called himself an Anglican (Howard and Beazley much less so) and would fit better in some sort of list. I don't want this list deleted, but I'm keen to work for something that is manageable and can be filled out, whereas I agree somewhat that it's a bit indiscriminate at present. <a href="../../../j/r/g/User%7EJRG_cdbe.html" title="User:JRG">JRG</a> 02:52, 9 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You must also add each one of those references into the person's article to source the statement that they are Anglican within the article, and to justify the category that is also probably there (if it isn't referenced already). That's <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> for you! For example <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_Stevens_afe6.html" title="Douglas Stevens">Douglas Stevens</a> currently doesn't have a single source in his article to reference what he is and the entire article content should be blanked if the rules are followed to the letter. --<a href="../../../s/l/f/User%7ESlf67_d959.html" title="User:Slf67">Steve <sub>(Slf67)</sub></a> <a href="../../../s/l/f/User_talk%7ESlf67_bed3.html" title="User talk:Slf67"><sup>talk</sup></a> 04:01, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I'd suggest <a href="../../../a/u/s/Category%7EAustralian_Anglicans_1e84.html" title="Category:Australian Anglicans">Category:Australian Anglicans</a> for members of the church with Wikipedia articles that reference their membership, and List of Anglican bishops in Australia (lower case 'b' - does it need "and archbishops" to be accurate, or are archbishops just a kind of bishop?) renamed and grown from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Anglican_Bishops_and_Archbishops_of_Sydney_6152.html" title="List of Anglican Bishops and Archbishops of Sydney">List of Anglican Bishops and Archbishops of Sydney</a> (incorrect upper case 'B' and 'A') or perhaps a list of lists if there are lots.

<dd>I still maintain that a list is different to a category; this list can be filled out and it will not be arbitrary to keep people (like Kevin Rudd) who have publicly espoused their association with the Anglican church. I think anyone who works for the Anglican church and is notable enough to have a WP article is not an arbitrary inclusion - Gordon Cheng and Tony Payne, for example, are notable Christian authors in the list that have worked in the Anglican Church (in stipendiary and lay capacity respectively) in the past (and still attend and are involved in Anglican Churches). While there are some arbitrary lists of Australians that should go, this one is one we can fix up.

<dd>If you check my recent edit history, I have voted to keep several of these, and kept one or two more from even being nominated. I agree that a list is different from a category, and the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Justices_of_the_High_Court_of_Australia_461b.html" title="List of Justices of the High Court of Australia">List of Justices of the High Court of Australia</a> you recently added to <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_Australians_a5aa.html" title="Lists of Australians">Lists of Australians</a> is appropriate. In my opinion, this one is not suitable as it is an incomplete list of people notable for something else who happen to also be Anglican. The person's articles should reference the Anglican connection, and put them in the category. It appears a number of people agree with me, and a number agree with you. Some poor admin has to make a decision based on this discussion.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> per ScottDavis and others. While a list of people who have worked in the church would be worth having and keeping, this is not that, risks being unbounded over time and becoming an indiscriminate list where the only thing those on it have in common is their faith. As some have raised too, in some cases there may be verification issues. How is one an Anglican or a Presbyterian for example? I was baptised a Methodist, was associated with a word-faith church for many years then left it - would I be a Methodist, an evangelical, or none of the above?

<dd>I suggested List of Anglican bishops in Australia above. I don't think that ordinary clergy are inherently notable, and a category is easier to maintain for clergy and lay people famous for something else who are also Anglican. That title covers both the current <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_Church_of_Australia_9135.html" title="Anglican Church of Australia">Anglican Church of Australia</a> and Anglican bishops from before that separate organisation was formed. There is already a <a href="../../../a/u/s/Category%7EAustralian_Anglicans_1e84.html" title="Category:Australian Anglicans">Category:Australian Anglicans</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/g/Category%7EAnglican_bishops_by_diocese_in_Australia_5ae0.html" title="Category:Anglican bishops by diocese in Australia">Category:Anglican bishops by diocese in Australia</a> which only has 4 subcategories and one list instead of 25. The dioceses are listed in the rather short article <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_Church_of_Australia_9135.html" title="Anglican Church of Australia">Anglican Church of Australia</a>.

<dd>I'm all for a list of bishops; however, we do have some notable clergy who are not bishops and some lay people whose claim to fame is mostly to do with their work in the Anglican Church, and I'm not sure what we do with these people - maybe I'll stick them on the end of the particular diocese page. <a href="../../../j/r/g/User%7EJRG_cdbe.html" title="User:JRG">JRG</a> 06:29, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The diocese is a possibility if they are associated with one in some significant way. The process I have used for biographies is 1) to make sure they are categorised properly and 2) look at the article and see which articles it links to should logically have a link back. Sometimes the logical link is from a subpage. It's usually obvious what made the person famous, and that is where the links to the article usually come from. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 07:28, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

There is a book review of the "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dawkins_Delusion_34c3.html" title="The Dawkins Delusion">The Dawkins Delusion</a>" in the New Scientist from last week that could be cited and possibly the Dawkins Delusion itself contains references that are relevent (I don't know - I've not read it). I agree that several of the sections of this piece need wholesale removal -- like Hitler, Purportedly Religious Terrorism etc. Plus, the article name should be changed for sure. Perhaps a "List of atrocities carried out by Atheist Regimes" or "Atrocities by Supposedly Atheist Regimes" might be better?</s> <a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECoricus_edb3.html" title="User:Coricus">Coricus</a> 06:17, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> As the author of the article, I'd like to make a couple points. If you note the article on <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._State_Department_list_of_Foreign_Terrorist_Organizations_89d0.html" title="U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations">U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations</a>, it points out that communist terrorist organizations are second only to Islamic groups. Communist (Marxist, Stalinist, Maoist, etc.) groups are by definition and self description philosophically atheist. This compilation is not my idea, nor is the concept of atheist terrorist groups novel. It is not original research. It should also be noted that there are articles on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_Terrorism_4797.html" title="Christian Terrorism">Christian Terrorism</a> (despite the fact that there is not a single Christian group on the list) and on <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_Terrorism_b569.html" title="Religious Terrorism">Religious Terrorism</a> (despite the fact that no religious group other than Islamic is represented on the list. Based on the State Department list there's more reason for this article than Narco, Christian, Agro or Eco terrorism articles. The objections above to POV are equally applicable to the other terrorism articles. And, as no doubt most of you know, POV according to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> is not a strong basis for deletion. The article can be edited and rewritten to deal with that. As to the title itself being POV, it is not so any more than the other terrorism articles are. The other articles on classifications of terror groups include their philosophical world view as their motivation. It is no more POV to have an article on atheistic terror groups than it is on Islamic or Eco terrorists. As to sources, they can be provided. There are existing articles, most of them well cited, on each of the groups listed. Finally, I don't think it's the best solution (because the category would be less inclusive leaving out any philosophically atheist groups which are not communist) but the article could be renamed "communist terrorism". <a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMamalujo_db34.html" title="User:Mamalujo">Mamalujo</a> 11:17, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Atheism is not a main philosophical basis for any of these groups. Therefore, labeling them "Atheist-terrorism" is both wrong and misleading. If you want, indeed, start an article about <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_terrorism.html" title="Communist terrorism">communist terrorism</a>, but this time please find acceptable sources. <a href="../../../d/l/x/User%7EDLX_8f1a.html" title="User:DLX">DLX</a> 11:23, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I would have to disagree. Historical materialism (or philosphical materialism - Marx's term) is a keystone of communist doctrine. It rules out any rules out the existence of any supernatural entity. Every communist government has been officially and stridently atheist. It is an essential part of their goals and identity. <a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMamalujo_db34.html" title="User:Mamalujo">Mamalujo</a> 11:47, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

I took a look at that <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_terrorism.html" title="Christian terrorism">christian terrorism</a> article as well and frankly that needs to go for some of the same reasons this one does.

<li><b>Delete</b> The title would seem to be deliberately misleading &amp; biased. If it can be turned into a decent article about communist terrorism, that would be great. If this is done, it should be moved to <i><a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_terrorism.html" title="Communist terrorism">Communist terrorism</a></i> but the resultant redirect should be deleted. The focus of the article is communist terrorist groups so why label them as "atheist"? If you're talking about communists, be bold enough to say so. How is the all-communists-are-atheists argument irrelavant (whether it be true or not)? What if they are? So, be up front about it and move it to <i>Communist terrorism</i> ... if and only if it can be repaired. However, I doubt that it can be. As noted above, there's nothing relating these groups together besides the fact that they happen to share similar political ideas also the article seems to contain original research and bias and seems to lack sources. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimp_bb44.html" title="User:Jimp">J</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jimp_f608.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jimp">i</a><a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJimp_beb8.html" title="User talk:Jimp">m</a><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Jimp" class="extiw" title="wikt:User:Jimp">p</a> 17:45, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article is a sub-stub. I commented on the talk page that "As I understand it, any of a hojillion different mathematical statements could be considered 'corollaries to number theory.' This article seems to be making something insignficant sound as if it were important. 45 + 15 = 60 is a corollary to number theory. I invoke <a href="../../../b/a/l/WP%7EBALLS_8227.html" title="WP:BALLS">WP:BALLS</a>." Considering the lack of content in the article's present statement, the fact that the subject is only 19 years old, and George's law, I doubt that any notable information can be found. I'm always willing to reconsider in the light of new evidence. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeranged_bulbasaur_e29c.html" title="User:Deranged bulbasaur">Deranged bulbasaur</a> 05:31, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>You <i>can</i> submit info to IMDB, which its editors then review and decide whether to pass or not.

<dd>Its true the piece could be written better, i still think that a cahin of 19 restaurants is singificant. If this chain were in Sydney, London or California or somewhere whether we'd be having this argument though. I really like the idea that facts from <i>other</i> places. How less significant is this rather than footballers or 1960s Playboy playmates or monsters in D&amp;D all of which have entries...cheers, <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasliber_bea8.html" title="User:Casliber">Casliber</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/s/User_talk%7ECasliber_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Casliber">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Casliber_4aa0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Casliber">contribs</a> 22:16, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

WP is not a directory of every minor restaurant chain in the US.

<p>If enough reliable and verifiable information exists about the subject to write a full and comprehensive article about it, it may make sense for the subject to have its own article. If some source material is available, but is insufficient for a comprehensive article, it is better to mention the subject under the article for its parent locality. If no source material, or only directory-type information (location, function, name, address) can be provided, the subject may not merit mention yet at all.</p>

<dd>Okay, I updated the page substantially. It could probably still use some editing, since I'm not too sure about the tone, and because I wasn't at all familiar with the chain before updating the content. Since I went to the effort of adding so much content to the page, my answer is changed to <b>Strong keep.</b>&#160;:) --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrangerer_d331.html" title="User:Strangerer">Strangerer</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStrangerer_0525.html" title="User talk:Strangerer">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Strangerer_42fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Strangerer">Contribs</a>)</small> 06:33, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - It's a big enough chain. WP is indeed not a directory. It is an encyclopedia. And no matter how many times folks say "WP is not a directory," not even putting the effort to write out the word Wikipedia, Wikipedia will remain an encyclopedia. Which is essentially a directory of knowledge. Regardless, my reasoning for Keep is that the article is well-sourced, and has been expanded significantly. There's definitely enough there for a decent article. <a href="../../../i/c/o/Image%7EIcons-flag-scotland.png_d97f.html" class="image" title="Image:Icons-flag-scotland.png"><img src="../../../upload/shared/5/58/Icons-flag-scotland.png" alt="Image:Icons-flag-scotland.png" width="16" height="11" longdesc="../../../i/c/o/Image%7EIcons-flag-scotland.png_d97f.html" /></a> <b><span style="background-color: #008000"><a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanaen_d33d.html" title="User:Canaen"><font color="#FFFFFF">Canæn</font></a></span></b> <a href="../../../i/c/o/Image%7EIcons-flag-scotland.png_d97f.html" class="image" title="Image:Icons-flag-scotland.png"><img src="../../../upload/shared/5/58/Icons-flag-scotland.png" alt="Image:Icons-flag-scotland.png" width="16" height="11" longdesc="../../../i/c/o/Image%7EIcons-flag-scotland.png_d97f.html" /></a> 06:53, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, well-written, well-referenced article. Nothing else should matter.

<li><b>Keep</b> The article has been tidied up and greatly improved since yesterday. I agree with those saying that if this chain were in London/New York/Sydney etc there would be no debate here. Arguably they are less notable as they are "only" in Kansas. However Kansas is a location of some significance and there are 19 restaurants, we're not talking one coffee shop in a little village in the Outer Hebredies here. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJules1975_f2fe.html" title="User:Jules1975">Jules</a> 09:37, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I nominated this article because it was often vandalized, had little to no information, and in the year and months since its creation nobody bothered to expand on it or seem to care much about how much it was vandalized until I nominated it for deletion. This cleaned up version is the result of this nomination (check the history if you don't believe me). There was no "geography bias" on my part against Kansas or rural areas and I DON'T appreciate the implication that there was.

<li><b>Comment</b> If people can simply declare that every 1/2 mile long U.S. or state or county road road is "inherently notable" because they "LIKE" them, then why wouldn't power pylons which are probably more expensive, approved by governmental authorities, assigned numbers, and equally useful to society be just as "inherently notable?" And these seem better sourced than some of the articles about roads or persons of minor nobility. I'm not arguing to keep this, but the question does make me stop and think. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 23:55, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>By that token, if several people know all aboutsome area of knowledge, such as "the ash trays used at Howard Johnson restaurants" or "British telephone booths" or "covered wooden bridges" wouldn't they be "more aware of" same and thus the subjects would become "inherently notable?"

<li><b>Delete unless properly sourced</b>: Anime News Network, the sole source cited in the article, appears to be a user-editable website ("You can contribute information to this page, but first you must login or register" <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=5896" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=5896" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>).

<li>The Japanese wikipedia is a secondary source, the link is included on the site. This really is not a sourcing / verification issue: WP:BPL talks about contrevertial information and the like. This article contains mostly bland biographical information that best comes from sites like IMDB, ANN, and other internet seiyu databases which collect data from movie credits and television credits and put them in one easy to use place. This is akin to asking for a source to prove that Robin Williams starred in Mrs. Doubtfire. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 17:12, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia is not supposed to be used as a source for itself either, so the jawiki link does <i>not</i> count as a secondary source. Especially given that the jawiki article has even fewer sources than the enwiki article: zero. And I don't think it's unreasonable to ask for a <i>real</i> <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and not a fan-edited site when posting up information like birthdate (which some people may consider private information as per <a href="../../../n/p/f/WP%7ENPF_2c43.html" title="WP:NPF">WP:NPF</a>; dunno if it applies here to a non-notable actress) or an alleged "real name" (incidentally, not mentioned in the jawiki article). Maybe not by itself a reason to delete, as we could simply remove that information from the article and leave the directory listing of what cartoons she's voice-acted for; but it's another nail in the coffin given that this article meets neither <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> nor <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>. 125.63.153.157 12:33, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> She has voice acted for a bunch of notable anime, as well as Japanese versions of notable Western films (such as Trinity in The Matrix), but it seems there is absolutely nothing else to say about her.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> (without prejudice to recreation) on the grounds of notability, not verification or biographical verification. I can't much that establishes her as a notable voice actor. This biography is a bit small. She's not won any major awards, she works for a theate company (Gekidan Subaru 剧团昴), she has a few major roles, and while the list omits many of the other productions that she's been in.

<p>Contested prod. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> for plot summaries, no matter in which format you present them. This and the other timelines are in-universe only. "Wikipedia articles on works of fiction should contain real-world context and sourced analysis, offering detail on a work's achievements, impact or historical significance, not solely a summary of that work's plot." It is sourced (or at least, sources are given in the main Timeline of Faerûn article, and are published by the company that produces Forgotten Realms, so they are hardly independent sources anyway), but that's not enough to make it an article fit for Wikipedia. Articles are also not really included into the flow of the <i>Forgotten Realms</i> articles, as they are barely linked. Two of the six timelines are linked to by one relevant article, the other four are linked to by none. The lack of links in itself is not a reason for deletion, but shows that the articles hardly serve any purpose here, and coupled with the clear <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> violation, they should be deleted.</p>

<p>The reason that was given for the proposal was</p>
<p>"WP:NOT for plot summaries, no matter in which format you present them. This and the other timelines are in-universe only. "Wikipedia articles on works of fiction should contain real-world context and sourced analysis, offering detail on a work's achievements, impact or historical significance, not solely a summary of that work's plot." It is sourced, but that's not enough to make it an article fit for Wikipedia."</p>
<p>AFAIK, in modern usage "should" is not "must/has to". Therefore, there is no reason to delete this article.</p>
<p>Also, WP:NOT, heading Plot summaries, second sentence: "A plot summary may be appropriate as an aspect of a larger topic."</p>
<p>As far as I can see, the abovementioned timelines *are* aspects of a larger topic. <small>— 62.224.109.237 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_62.224.109.237_ce02.html" title="Special:Contributions/62.224.109.237">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>

<dd>But how can you justify a plot summary of this size? <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMER-C_4926.html" title="User:MER-C">MER-C</a> 09:51, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> One justification is that these plot summaries are just 1-2 sentance summaries of entire books. There just happen to be an amazing number of books. If this could be cleaned up and links added to the books containig this information it could be made into a great guide for the series. Anything with about a hundred books is hard to keep straight without some sort of timeline. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimaspawn_d949.html" title="User:Shimaspawn">Shimaspawn</a> 15:33, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Well... If this got userfied, do you really think that there would be folk up to the daunting task of heavily reformatting this and adding such notations? As per my comment below, it's not that I don't think that it couldn't be done or is necessarily not worth doing, but <i>I'm</i> certainly daunted. <a href="../../../b/i/t/User%7EBitnine_cb95.html" title="User:Bitnine">Bitnine</a> 15:49, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'd be wiling to work on it. I've been looking for a reason to crawl through my old novels, and I have an old copy of the offical timeline (circa ~1990's). <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimaspawn_d949.html" title="User:Shimaspawn">Shimaspawn</a> 16:08, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete all</b> per nom. It doesn't help the articles that you have to search elsewhere to find out what they are about, and being all in-universe (nowhere does the first one make it clear that it is a timeline for a video game) hurts them. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 09:49, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete all</b>. And don't get me wrong, I like Faerûn fine. In fact, the Forgotten Realms setting is interesting and notable as a fictional construct, as it is used as the basis for dozens of video games, a large number of gaming supplements, swarms of novels, and other media as well. If this were just an article - or even a couple - giving information of the setting and showing the placement of the various works in the setting, that would be dandy with me. However, this mammoth in-universe sprawling timeline isn't the way to do that. (I'd say "Merge down and reformat if you have a giant amount of free time and the patience of a saint," but that seems like too much to ask of anyone.) <a href="../../../b/i/t/User%7EBitnine_cb95.html" title="User:Bitnine">Bitnine</a> 15:42, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The truth is, this is the timeline for the largest setting of the largest RPG in the world. It has about a hundred novels and close to fifty rule books pertaining to this. The setting has been around for ~20 years and in that time the offical infromation alone has made for a huge timeline. There are 816,000 ghits for Faerûn [<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Faer%C3%BBn&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Faer%C3%BBn&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>], 543,000 for Faerun [<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Faerun+" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Faerun+" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>] and 3,100,000 for Forgotten Realms (the offical title the setting material is published under) [<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22forgotten+realms%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22forgotten+realms%22" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>]. Also, Amazon lists 843 books under "Forgotten Realms" [<a href="http://amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_b/102-5373707-2781735?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=%22forgotten+realms%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_b/102-5373707-2781735?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=%22forgotten+realms%22" rel="nofollow">[40]</a>]. Cleaning this up won't be easy I admit, but there are a lot of souces that can be used. Short I don't think can be managed though even if we only stick in a sentance or two about a book. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimaspawn_d949.html" title="User:Shimaspawn">Shimaspawn</a> 16:05, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Possible CopyVio</b> I am not concerned with this subject of this article, though I think this is not the best way to do it, but I am concerned that this is a copyright violation.

<li><b>Keep</b> as the winner of a national contest. The real notability of the song is predicated on the fact that it <i>will be</i> performed (NB: "performed" is generally held to be enough where ESC entries are concerned) at the final in Helsinki in May, so even if consensus is that it hasn't reached notability by winning the Spanish pre-selection, it'll be notable in a couple of months. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 01:12, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Redundant article that borders on dictionary definition - while the transitive property of identity <i>is</i> an important one, I am not convinced that it requires its own article, given that we have an article on <a href="../../../i/d/e/Identity_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Identity (philosophy)">Identity (philosophy)</a> which mentions that identity is a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transitive_relation.html" title="Transitive relation">Transitive relation</a>. There is really nothing more to say about the topic, other than to give examples - which already exist on that page for transitive. I really don't see any way this can be expanded from what it is - a one-line mention in another article, padded out by examples that could be covered on a linked page. <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a> 10:32, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> of <i>course</i> people use the phrase in proofs! It's a basic property of identity. That doesn't make it any less redundant. People also use the phrase "symmetry of identity" or "reflexivity of identity" too. That doesn't mean they're in any way capable of producing an article that isn't redundant. --<a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a> 23:52, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>At present a google search of wikipedia doesn't have the phrase anywhere where it is defined. Someone looking what the phrase means wouldn't be able to figure it out without the article.

<dd>I listed this for deletion, and not merging, because there's really nothing there <i>to</i> merge in the first place.

<li>RevRagnarok, good point on lack of participation, and I do suspect this will end in Delete, but I'd like to see some stronger arguments.

<li><b>Delete</b> The only article I found on google that is different from the Wikipedia article is also edited the same way Wikipedia is. No trustworthy sources anywhere, no mention of Stephen Cork, Malus Germicana, or any other related issues. Also, the claim that Stephen Cork found this apple while filming the IMAX movie "Galapagos" are false, as there is no evidence a man named Stephen Cork ever worked on the film. The pictures seem photoshopped, as well. <a href="../../../k/n/t/User%7EKntrabssi_cb78.html" title="User:Kntrabssi">Kntrabssi</a> 03:09, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Homeopathic partisans have been allowed to pursue this sort of cruft on WP for far too long.

<li><s>I'm going with <b>Delete</b> here</s><i>Vote changed, see below</i>. What constitutes "important" is subjective in this case - it's kind of a fine line.

<li>Vote changed to a waffle vote - <b>Weak Keep</b> (the title looks better now, but the article needs to be built up a bit), or barring that, <b>Merge and redirect</b> to <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeopathy.html" title="Homeopathy">Homeopathy</a>. The problem now is whether the article can stand on its own and whether it can be considered notable beyond homeopathy practicioners - and if it can't and doesn't, it's probably better living in the Homeopathy article. A special note to the nom - just because you can possibly spam it is not only a non-criteria for deletion, it is a straw man argument.

<li><b>Comment</b> If you assume that "important" should be changed to "notable" this would become a list of notable homeopaths or simply, a list of homeopaths. Should there be such a list? Personally I'm not sure that homeopth is a notable enough occupation to warrant such a list. If such a list existed as an article I am sceptical as to whether many of the unreferenced homeopaths in this artcle would command a place on such a list. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJules1975_f2fe.html" title="User:Jules1975">Jules</a> 12:36, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s>. "Important" is clearly a subjective and POV adjective. List of notable homeopaths would be an improvement.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I removed the "other homeopaths" section, and renamed the page "List of homeopaths." We're left with homeopaths who have their pages, so they're notable, and the rest have citations. If this page isn't deleted, I'll convert all citations to cite web and remove and hpaths that don't seem to belong. Also, this list has info that a cat can't contain. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrine_Fisher_e4db.html" title="User:Peregrine Fisher">Peregrine Fisher</a> 23:14, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> the current version of the article. The current list describes most of the people on there and has citations and/or articles for all (the two reasons raised in the nomination). The article has been renamed, so the issue of POV regarding "important" is no longer relevant. Finally, this list is not redundant to the category as it contains descriptions of each person (dates of birth/death and contributions), is essentially chronologically organised, provides sources, <i>and</i> aids in the development of new articles (<a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> point 3). -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 01:29, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I suppose it's mostly the list being objected to - for one thing, almost all the articles linked don't mention Homeopathic use anyway. Perhaps we could just cut it? It doesn't leave much of an article, but it might be expandable later. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Cuerden_a555.html" title="User talk:Adam Cuerden">talk</a></sup> 05:03, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't believe in homeopathy and am actually surprised at how widespread it is (if the number of 100,000 practicioners and up to 500 million patients is to be believed) Despite that, the <i>Materia Medica Pura</i> is a major work in the homeopathic field, which I believe should be included per <a href="../../../f/r/i/WP%7EFRINGE_f64f.html" title="WP:FRINGE">WP:FRINGE</a> (am I wrong to label homeopathy a fringe practice?). The list is an essential part of the work (a "compilation of reports") and I believe it is certainly better than classifying all existing articles in <a href="../../../h/o/m/Category%7EHomeopathic_remedies_4ebc.html" title="Category:Homeopathic remedies">Category:Homeopathic remedies</a>. I thought of suggesting a compromise of leaving the list, but not linking to any articles, but that defeats the purpose of wikilinking, which is to aid navigation. Even if the article on "arsenic", for instance, does not mention anything about homeopathy, having it linked would still aid a reader of this article. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 07:19, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure. I think you'd have to either have much more information than the list, or, I don't know, give examples of one or two. Just saying "All these things are mentioned" is cruft. It'd be like giving a list of everything in Linnaeus' taxonomy, only less useful, and probably less interesting. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Cuerden_a555.html" title="User talk:Adam Cuerden">talk</a></sup> 08:10, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Normally I would agree. My reasoning in this case is this: as this is a "collection of reports", listing them doesn't seem to qualify as indiscriminate (I assume that's what you meant by "cruft"). It's like listing every minister in a cabinet or every province in a country. I'm inclined to see it kept as it's a complete list (I don't take incompleteness as a criterion for deletion, but completeness is certainly a plus). A complete accounting of homeopathic "remedies" should exist <i>somewhere</i> and <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeopathy.html" title="Homeopathy">homeopathy</a> is already too long, so... -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 08:26, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But this isn't a complete list. This is a complete list of the remedies <i>in one book</i>. There seem to be quite a lot of other, similar books, though not created by the founder, and no doubt have lots more medicines in them. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Cuerden_a555.html" title="User talk:Adam Cuerden">talk</a></sup> 09:23, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Whatever I may think of homeopathy, per Nuttah68's reasoning a 200-year-old book that is still in print today and has so many ghits is notable. I ran a search for its title on Google scholar, hoping to find some scholarly reviews of the book that could be used to fill out the content of the article (now that the listcruft has been removed) and didn't find any, but I don't find that conclusive: it just means that GS is not the right source for that kind of citation. I did find 157 hits, primarily works about homeopathy that mention MMP, so it is notable academically as well as popularly. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Eppstein_0880.html" title="User:David Eppstein">David Eppstein</a> 19:00, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Clearly notable - on par with the Bible for alternative medicine devotees.

The proposed deletion tag was removed with the edit summary "I don't think this article should be deleted because, IT IS INDIVIDUALLY NOTABLE. This squadron was the first squadron to be formed in Calgary and has a long history of excellence." Note that there are hundreds of <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Canadian_Air_Cadets_bdb3.html" title="Royal Canadian Air Cadets">Royal Canadian Air Cadets</a> squadrons in the country -- hundreds of them were the first to be formed in their community, and all have history of excellence.

Only one squadron has a Wikipedia article, which I haven't nominated because it provides the claim that it is the first squadron in Canada, not just in its community. I didn't make this nomination because the article on the first Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Squadron in Canada was nominated for deletion, but was kept, because it was the first in Canada.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. Yeah, whatever, there are similar cadet groups in high schools across the United States. They're about as notable as any other high school club. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 15:22, 7 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would say they're more notable than a high school club, because they are co-sponsored by the Canadian Department of National defence, supervised by the Canadian Forces, and often do contribute a lot to the community. In small communities, the only Canadian Forces presence is due to the officers supervising the Canadian Cadet Organizations. However, I still think the individual sub-units are usually not notable for an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanchom_ae62.html" title="User:Sanchom">Sancho</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESanchom_4ab1.html" title="User talk:Sanchom">talk</a>) 16:58, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>It is redundant to have the Dallas Green and City and Colour articles separate. City and Colour is Dallas Green, and the Dallas Green page is all about his music. For example, artists like Billy Corgan, or Tom Petty don't have articles solely for their solo projects, again because its redundant. Also, its useless to make a separate page with the same recycled info as the original, except with less actual information that the original and with improperly sources images.</p>
<p><b>City and Colour is just a moniker, one that Dallas didn't even use his latest album anyway..</b></p>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There are already many cases where a solo project with a different name from the musician has its own page. See, for example, <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Wind_da94.html" title="Lord Wind">Lord Wind</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/o/From_Bubblegum_to_Sky_cdba.html" title="From Bubblegum to Sky">From Bubblegum to Sky</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/l/All-Time_Quarterback_3875.html" title="All-Time Quarterback">All-Time Quarterback</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Threshold_HouseBoy%27s_Choir_b634.html" title="The Threshold HouseBoy's Choir">The Threshold HouseBoy's Choir</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/s/Ris_Paul_Ric_3887.html" title="Ris Paul Ric">Ris Paul Ric</a>, and others. Furthermore, the fact that Dallas chooses to use <i>City and Colour</i> on only some of his albums accentuates the distinction. From the comments on <a href="../../../c/i/t/Talk%7ECity_and_Colour_9301.html" title="Talk:City and Colour">Talk:City and Colour</a>, it appears that this complaint is motivated by <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrouse_1daf.html" title="User:Grouse">Grouse</a> 11:25, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. City and Colour is a band, Dallas Green is a person. Both <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas_Green_%28musician%29_6a73.html" title="Dallas Green (musician)">Dallas Green</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_and_Colour_9c6f.html" title="City and Colour">City and Colour</a> simply need more information. The Dallas Green page needs to become more of a biography about Dallas' life such as his early life or other such information. Information regarding biographies is collected over a period of time and the article won't expand overnight. City and Colour will probably continue to grow as a band because of the success up to this time; I don't feel there's a enough reason to delete an article simply because it currently lacks information. Take for example <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_Castles_%28band%29_a12a.html" title="Crystal Castles (band)">Crystal Castles (band)</a>. The page started like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Crystal_Castles_%28band%29&amp;oldid=108702756" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Crystal_Castles_%28band%29&amp;oldid=108702756" rel="nofollow">this</a> and has been expanded a great deal. I would also like to point out that Dallas has made music under his own name of Dallas Green and also of City and colour.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - this topic deals with a niche financial service that should eventually have a similar but shorter page as the entries on "Bank" or "Hedge fund". The original deletion tag was posted because the article was a very short stub (which I posted in the hopes that it would be expanded quickly). It has now been expanded to a comprehensible, valuable source of information that's hard to find elsewhere on the web that should continue to improve. Fang2415 15:28, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That's really bizarre. I typed it in 3x last night just to make sure I got the spelling right and the results correct. Now google's listing 1,430 results. Is this a google thing? And it's worth pointing out that most of the referenced pages are still mentioning the drink in their myspace or in a forum post.

It also passes the first criterion of notability for companies, having been written about as the subject of an independent source's writing: <a href="http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/497100/795188" class="external text" title="http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/497100/795188" rel="nofollow">Television new Zealand</a> and [] <a href="http://www.teara.govt.nz/Places/ManawatuAndHorowhenua/ManawatuAndHorowhenua/9/ENZ-Resources/Standard/4/en" class="external text" title="http://www.teara.govt.nz/Places/ManawatuAndHorowhenua/ManawatuAndHorowhenua/9/ENZ-Resources/Standard/4/en" rel="nofollow">Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand</a>.

<li>Both those references are very shallow. Foxton Fizz barely merited a mention in the New Zealand encyclopedia. I doubt it deserves mention in Wikipedia. So far I haven't seen any sources that make me regard it as notable. The depth of coverage is trivial as layed out in <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>. Just because an organization has been around a long time does not make it notable. <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChevinki_c5c7.html" title="User:Chevinki">Chevinki</a> 08:54, 8 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, the TVNZ reference is not shallow: the text <i>is</i>, but the video is not (click on "Close Up: Foxton Fizz (5:54)"). A 6-minute segment on a national TV network is rather non-trivial. By the way, I missed the video the first time around. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 03:03, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Absolute keep</b> This is nuts. Vithoulkas is without question the most famous living homeopath and he has been notable for at least 30 years. His books are considered required reading in the field of homeopathy. He has published many books, written countless journal articles and he lectures around the world. To suggest that we delete him from WP is ridiculous. Can we at least bother to do a simple Google search before we propose an article for deletion (note that there are 44,000 hits for his full name not 11 as RGTraynor incorrectly claims above. Also note that Vithoulkas is often cited by his last name, so the actual number of hits would be much higher.) <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Vithoulkas&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=Vithoulkas&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">[52]</a> Did you guys even bother to read the article?

<li>Suggesting we use three (or more) names (when he's only known by first and last) in a search is either just strange or patently stupid. Why don't you make the minimal effort to actually browse through the Google results for "George Vithoulkas". With the slightest effort it is painfully and blindingly obvious that he is extremely well-known around the world and very well-regarded. By the way, here's his Right Livelihood Award page from the Swedish parliament <a href="http://www.rightlivelihood.org/recip/vith.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rightlivelihood.org/recip/vith.htm" rel="nofollow">[53]</a> I also would like to note that you have made a concerted effort to delete a number of articles about well-known homeopaths.

<li><b>Keep</b>: he is really a famous person in homeopathy; the Right Livelihood Award is a proof that this is also recognised outside the homeopathy world; he wrote many books; many of them were translated in different language (e.g. German); please no fight against medical schools by deleting articles about their most famous representatives; deleting because of Greek naming conventions seems to be a pretence since his middle name is not known internationally (cf. the writing of his name on his books).

I have to tell you that George Vithoulkas is one of the greatest practitioners of homeopathic medicine in the world. I know little about the technicalities of Wikipedia, but I do know about homeopathy. His textbook, the Science of Homeopathy is a great book and has remained in print in USA, UK and or India since its original publication in Athens in 1978. I am proud to have a signed copy, which he gave to my uncle Dr K Gardikas, then a professor of medicine and dean of the medical school of Athens University. His work in helping people with severe chronic disease is amazing; Francis Treuherz, Edtor of the Homeopath, journal of the Society of Homeopaths, UK. - <small>Unsigned</small></p>

That list was poorly presented but there is no way you can look at that list and tell me that the article "lacked sources" for establishing his notability.

I can assure you that you will find that roughly 98% of them are for George Vithoulkas the homeopath. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 21:25, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>, lets cool this for a moment because the last thing we need is a battle. Articles to be included in Wikipedia need to fulfill certain policies and guidelines, where the adhering to the policies is mandatory and the adherence to guidelines a question of debate. The first policy is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, whereby it has to be proven by second party sources that a subject is notable. The second would be <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a> which says that the content of an article has to be attributable to a second party source. Our problem is that, as is, this article fails at least <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> because we can hardly say that the Society of Homeopaths would be a second party source as Dr. (Mr.) Vithoulkas would be a member of it. We cannot say that a book written by the person is a second party source. What does certainly not work is first party sources, as any of these would fall under <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. I am always happy to be wrong about the notability of a person but I cannot take the word from someone for it, I need sources. <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman"><font face="Amazone BT">Alf</font><font face="Aldine401 BT" size="2"><sup>Photoman</sup></font></a> 19:00, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

I agree, it's not noteworthy every time a garage band namechecks Zappa in a song, but that's an argument for editing and sourcing the article, <i>not</i> for deleting it. <a href="../../../o/b/t/User%7EObtuseAngle_4728.html" title="User:ObtuseAngle">ObtuseAngle</a> 20:14, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Like any artist, his TV/film appearances would go into his filmography, which doesn't exactly belong in <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Zappa_discography_2a74.html" title="Frank Zappa discography">Frank Zappa discography</a> or <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Zappa_4e92.html" title="Frank Zappa">Frank Zappa</a> (length issue). Note that these appearances are not mere cultural references but directly relevant to the man himself, and should be considered separately from this article. If delete, merge it somewhere. All those species and other things named after him are notable; they didn't just name those things after him so the information could be hidden. If delete, merge this last section into <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Zappa_4e92.html" title="Frank Zappa">Frank Zappa</a>. The song references do need explanations and sources, but each reference is important and non-trivial - how easy would it be to confuse a reference to Frank Zappa for some odd coincidence? This list is quite discriminate; it has a clear scope and will not achieve unmaintainable size. If you cut out the supposedly "trivial" references, then it becomes too discriminate in a POV way. –<a href="../../../p/o/m/User_talk%7EPomte_8819.html" title="User talk:Pomte">Pomte</a> 19:36, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Some of the information is useful enough to be worked into the main <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Zappa_4e92.html" title="Frank Zappa">Frank Zappa</a> article; like films he has made cameo appearances in, however, films where his music has merely been in the background do not deserve a mention. Some of the stuff in the comic strip section is notable, but it does need references.

<p>Contested prod with the edit comment of 'notable'. This article is a biography where the only claim to notability is the title, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baronet.html" title="Baronet">Baronet</a>. The title, although 'it is a hereditary honour', it 'is not a peerage and has never entitled the holder to a seat in the House of Lords'. This means that the title has no claim to notability based on heridtary right of input to the British Parliamentary or legal systems. So, whilst the first holder of the title may have (had) a claim to notability through the title, all subsequent holders claim to notability based on the title is that a family member may have been notable. Long established consensus is that 'notability cannot gained from relationship' and 'Wikipedia is not a genealogical database'. As the article offers no other claims to notability the subject fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and as the article offers no sources per <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> it also fails policy. <a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENuttah68_2daa.html" title="User:Nuttah68">Nuttah68</a> 15:43, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: This page is a vanity page. Sir Keith Arbuthnot has no notability bar his hereditary title. It's quite clearly a vanity page. Just because some Baronets are notable doesn't mean this particular chap is. Florence Nightingale, for example, was notable - but that doesn't automatically mean wee Jeanie from the Southern General is notable because she happens to be a nurse also. No offence to nurses, by the way, first example that came to mind. Vanity page, get it off. T.Ball.CFC 00:55 13 March 2007 (GMT)</dd>

I will look at this again in a few days before I&#160;!vote but unless some other form of notability can be proven that does not relate to simply holding one or more honorary titles then I am leaning towards delete. Also adding "strong keep" as two editor have done above on the basis that this person is a Baron is in my opinion showing strong signing of POV rather than basing&#160;!votes on wiki policy.--<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> 17:33, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Whatever you think about the British honours system (and I sense that some contributors to this discussion are against it: I confess I myself find it significantly batty and, on a serious note, potentially corrupting) it is a part of public life in the UK that seems to interest plenty of folks in UK and anglophone places which used to be 'owned' by UK. These guys enjoy disproportionate influence to the irritation of some and the delight (presumably) of others, but wiki is (I hope) concerned with facts much more than with reactions to facts (until of course those reactions become facts in their own right: but that's an extract from another discussion). If those people who buy and consult Burke's and its ilk in libraries and record offices google their interest on-line, it would be nice for wiki to be in the 'market' for their 'e-custom'. So please keep it. But please, someone who knows, expand it. The guy must have done something interesting since leaving uni, and if he was really such a blushing violet he surely would not have let them give him an entry in Who's Who.

<li><b>Comment</b> &gt;1 000 minor British aristocrats automatically notable? Clearly not. The fact that they appear in widely distributed works of reference (Burke's, Who's Who...) suggests that someone somewhere thinks them <i>potentially</i> notable. The fact that those works of reference are provided for consultation in libraries in UK and (especially) those corners of the Anglosphere where for good and bad reasons many people have a warm fuzzy feeling for British tradition (<i>ok, I'm thinking of most of Canada outside of Quebec, but I think it also applies elsewhere</i>) suggests either that the acquisiton policies of those libraries are wrong or else that people are interested. Should they be interested? Is that a question for us to ask? Should all &gt;1 000 baronets get a wiki article? Only if a wiki contributor (who is also, presumably, a more than averagely committed wiki reader) bothers to write one. Several people seem to have bothered to contribute to the article on Arbuthnot, tho I agree that no one seems to have found anything very compelling to write about him. But that's my judgement (and I guess yours). <i>Will</i> all &gt;1 000 baronets get a wiki article? Same answer: seems unlikely. That applies across all categories: there are thousands of academics who deserve a wiki article. Some get them: some don't. Ditto medieval bishops. Ditto very small towns in Ohio. There is a wiki constituency who think Arbuthnot is interesting: we disagree. Maybe we disagree about other much more important issues about which we both feel much more passionately: I hope we are not going to move from that to seek to restrict one another's rights to express our opinion. The web offers huge possibilities for opening up knowledge: it's impossible to know which bits of knowledge will be most valued in five or fifty years time. But the troubling aspect is the way that by commonising our knowledge database, the web is actually being used to try and impose sets of politically convenient values on the rest of us. I think that this does not lie comfortably with the wiki mind-set. Or am I wrong about the wiki mindset? Ah, well...

<li><b>Comment</b>, out of interest I went and looked at a copy of Who's Who 2007 and Debretts just to see what level of depth it goes into on people. Firstly Debrett's - this is 1,797 pages - with approximately 13 entries per page and the Sir Keith Arbutnott entry does not state anything notable about him only when he was born and the names of his family members.</li>

<dd>Who's Who - this is pretty much the same book as far as I can see just with even more people, the UK edition alone is 2,529 pages long this year and it has on average 16 people listings or referral's per page - you do the math on the amount of people in it then. Each page is split into two columns with 100 lines per column so that 200 lines per page (over half a million lines in the book). The entry for this person is 6 lines long in one column - that includes a line for his name and address of where they live - the other four lines include where he went to school and the names of his family members inc. ex. wife. In fact the article is almost word for word what is the article except it has no crest shown and it uses abbreviations for much of the textile. There is no mention of anything notable that he achieved except that he went to university. Both entries in both books are identical as far as I can see - are they connected in some way or compiled in the same way?</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>: like it or not, being a baronet is notable in itself in Great Britain. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is a <i>guideline</i> only, and the template on that page specifically states: "it is not set in stone and should be treated with common sense and the occasional exception." The nominator of this AfD states although "it is a hereditary honour, it 'is not a peerage and has never entitled the holder to a seat in the House of Lords'. This means that the title has no claim to notability based on hereditary right of input to the British Parliamentary or legal systems." He is wrong in this opinion because all hereditary titles in Britain are notable. Today, 2007, no member of the peerage is <i>entitled</i> to a seat in the House of Lords. The Baronetage is always listed along with the Peerage in all publications and apart from the old right of a seat in The House, they are regarded as both noble and part of the titled aristocracy. Today they are on an entirely level playing field with the peerage. No member of the peerage or baronetcies has ever had "a hereditary right of input in the British legal systems", unless it was passing legislation. This baronet appears in <i>Debrett's Distinguished People of Today</i>, the editors of which contend, in an article in <i>The Guardian</i> (6 Feb 89), contains "the most distinguished people in the country - all those listed truly deserve their place".</li>

<p>I would also contend that deleting biography stubs like this goes against the ethos of the Wikipedia Baronetcies project and will upset the lineage.

<li><b>Keep</b> It appears, in the main, that the 'deleters' do not give much importance to titles inherited from the past whereas the 'keepers' wish to perpetuate our British history. An encyclopedia is to colate and impart knowledge and if it is with data on the past it should be encouraged and supported as: it is our past which forges our future.

<li>To the admin closing this AfD, please note a number of editors who have&#160;!voted on this&#160;!vote have been involved in vote canvassing and now what another administrator has called “lock step” voting. Over the past months a number of editors have been accused of&#160;!voting on the basis of what “they like” rather than using the rationale of wiki policies. A number of central users such as <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittybrewster_2ff5.html" title="User:Kittybrewster">Kittybrewster</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECounter-revolutionary_958f.html" title="User:Counter-revolutionary">Counter-revolutionary</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Lauder_8521.html" title="User:David Lauder">David Lauder</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajor_Bonkers_92c3.html" title="User:Major Bonkers">Major Bonkers</a> but at times have also included <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFraslet_47a7.html" title="User:Fraslet">Fraslet</a> and to a lesser extent <a href="../../../w/e/g/User%7EWeggie_3196.html" title="User:Weggie">Weggie</a> and <a href="../../../g/i/b/User%7EGibnews_d9ac.html" title="User:Gibnews">Gibnews</a> and also El chulito and <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInthegloaming_5b21.html" title="User:Inthegloaming">Inthegloaming</a> who I very strongly suspect are/were socks.</li>

<p>Since then there has been what I consider a systematic abuse of the AfD system with a number of a same editors arriving at an AfD on a subject which they either like or dislike and voting to delete or keep on POV rather then wiki policy. The first AfD that occur was –</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_James_McDade_8813.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/James McDade">James McDade AfD</a> Nominated by <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a>. Result – ‘’’Keep’’’ 13 votes to Keep and 1 to Delete – that vote by as <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> – therefore 100% of the delete&#160;!votes from “the group”.</p>
<p>Then [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Gerard_Montgomery|Gerard" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Gerard_Montgomery|Gerard" rel="nofollow">Montgomery</a>] – this AfD was nominated by <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> on the basis of non notability. However <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> ended the AfD because of a source that stated that Montgomery was involved in a murder.</p>
<p>Then <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Antoine_MacGiolla_Bhrighde_2d9f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Antoine MacGiolla Bhrighde">Antoine MacGiolla Bhrighde AfD</a>, this AfD was nominated by <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> on the basis of non notability. Result – <b>no consenus to delete</b>, Keep 7 votes and Delete 7 votes – 5 of those votes from “the group” – therefore 71% of the delete votes to delete from “the group” in an article that was kept.</p>
<p>Then <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Charles_Breslin_62c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Charles Breslin">Charles Breslin AfD</a>, this AfD was nominated by <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> on the basis of non notability. Result – <b>no consenus to delete</b>, Keep 4 votes and Delete 4 votes – 2 of those votes from “the group” – therefore 50% of the delete votes to delete from “the group” in an article that was kept.</p>
<p>Then <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Martin_McGartland_98f9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Martin McGartland">Martin McGartland AfD</a>, this AfD was nominated by <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> on the basis of non notability. Result – <b>Keep</b>, Keep 10 votes and Delete 1 votes – that of Astrotrains</p>
<p>Then <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Diarmuid_O%27Neill_6646.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Diarmuid O'Neill">Diarmuid O’Neill AfD</a>, this AfD was nominated by <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> on the basis of non notability. Result – <b>No consensus</b>, This is where the real vote staking operation started and canvassing came into effect. Keep 20 votes and Delete 10 votes – 5 of those votes from “the group” – therefore 50% of the delete votes to delete from “the group” in an article that was kept. Note the first eight&#160;!votes were to Keep and that is when the canvassing started and since then there has been almost total lock step.</p>
<p>Then <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Charles_Breslin_62c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Charles Breslin">Charles Breslin AfD</a>, this AfD was nominated by <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> on the basis of non notability. Result – <b>no consenus to delete</b>, Keep 4 votes and Delete 4 votes – 2 of those votes from “the group” – therefore 50% of the delete votes to delete from “the group” in an article that was kept.</p>
<p>Then we had a AfD of a biography relating to a member of the “British nobility”. This was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Robert_Murray_Arbuthnot" class="extiw" title="wikipediawikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Robert_Murray_Arbuthnot">Robert_Murray_Arbuthnot AfD</a>, this AfD was nominated by <a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a> on the basis of non notability. Result – <b>Delete</b>, Keep 4 votes and Delete 9 votes – 3 of those votes from “the group” – therefore 75% of the votes to keep from “the group” in an article that was deleted</p>
<p>Again back to an Irish republican and the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Martin_McCaughey_7c96.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Martin McCaughey">Martin_McCaughey AfD</a>, this AfD was nominated by <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> on the basis of non notability. Result – <b>Keep</b>, Keep 16 votes and Delete 12 votes – 7 of those votes from “the group” – therefore 58% of the votes to delete from “the group” in an article that was kept.</p>
<p>Similar behaviour and calls for deletion in an number of AfD’s of members of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provisional_IRA_East_Tyrone_Brigade_1031.html" title="Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade">Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade</a> such as the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Tony_Gormley_6141.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Tony Gormley">Tony Gormley AfD</a> – bios of each of those that were merged not deleted can be seen on the of the bottom of the page that they were merged to.</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: What a scandalous load of rubbish. So every time the same editors appear on an AfD they are all in collusion or have been canvassing?

<li><b>Keep</b>: <i>Who’s Who</i>, published annually since 1849 and the first biographical book of its kind, is among the world’s most recognised and respected works of reference. The UK Who's Who is the mother of all works on notability. The phrase 'Who's Who of' has passed into the English language due to this publication, and all the other biographical works arond the world can trace their ancestry to it. There are thousands of articles on Wikipedia about people who would be instantly rejected for inclusion by the <i>Who's Who</i> selection board. <i>Who's Who</i> is the ultimate reference concerning <b>notability</b>. To say no references concerning notability have been provided is ridiculous. Invariably when you see politicians, artists, writers being interviewed on television in front of their bookcase you see the big red copy of <i>Who's Who</i> sitting there. Concerning inaccurate comments above, a baronetcy is not a species of Knighthood because a baronet outranks all knights except <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knights_of_the_Garter_d5f7.html" title="Knights of the Garter">Knights of the Garter</a>, so not being a species of knighthood is a reflection of the importance of the rank rather than otherwise. Anyone who is in <i>Who's Who</i> has the ultimate reference concerning notability. It trumps all others by an order of magnitude. People may not like it, but thats the way the world is. <a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EAnnabelBuxton_fea4.html" title="User:AnnabelBuxton">AnnabelBuxton</a> 09:23, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I see absolutely no reason why Wikipedia should defer to another publication's decisions on notability, however well-known. If a subject doesn't meet WP notability criteria, there's no way that "being in Who's Who" should be able to save them. Also, Who's Who contains some pretty obscure people. <b><a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliminatorJR_b0b2.html" title="User:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B">Eliminator</font><font color="#FF4500">JR</font></a> <a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EEliminatorJR_a208.html" title="User talk:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B"><sup>Talk</sup></font></a></b> 11:09, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> but WP's primary notability criterion <i>is</i> being mentioned in other reputable publications; this makes your argument essentially meaningless. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 22:52, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Because Wikipedia is about the real world. Not about some imaginary world like second life. Let's take the example of popular music musicians. Everyone with a top 40 hit seems entitled to a page on Wikipedia. How many people is that 30,000 probably, but for the sake of argument let's say 3000. Well about 30 pop stars make it into <i>Who's Who</i>. So for <i>Who's Who</i> the criteria for inclusion are two orders of magnitude tougher. The wikipedia criteria are "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of secondary sources. Such sources must be reliable, independent of the subject and independent of each other. The depth of coverage of the subject by the source must be considered" - thats WHY you should 'defer' to the most widely accepted reference on notability in the UK. <a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EAnnabelBuxton_fea4.html" title="User:AnnabelBuxton">AnnabelBuxton</a> 11:24, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The fact there are only 30 pop artists in Who's Who, but thousands of minor members of the nobility, proves my point, in that Who's Who necessarily has inbuilt POV. It also includes many figures in industry, finance, academia etc. who would also fail Wikipedia notability guidelines. An example: the front page of <a href="http://www.ukwhoswho.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.ukwhoswho.com/" rel="nofollow">Who's Who website</a> gives some people from the publication who have birthdays today. Today's 'notable people'a reporter &amp; internet columnist, the current CEO of <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_Water_a25e.html" title="Scottish Water">Scottish Water</a>, and the General Secretary of <a href="../../../c/h/u/Churches_Together_in_England_38e6.html" title="Churches Together in England">Churches Together in England</a> Notable? Perhaps, perhaps not. Another point - is only Who's Who UK allowed? What about the US version, where you can nominate people for inclusion? Also, you've quoted WP above "...the depth of coverage..." part. A simple "this person exists" entry in Who's Who doesn't qualify for that. <b><a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliminatorJR_b0b2.html" title="User:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B">Eliminator</font><font color="#FF4500">JR</font></a> <a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EEliminatorJR_a208.html" title="User talk:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B"><sup>Talk</sup></font></a></b> 12:59, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The inbuilt POV of Who's Who is that of mainstream UK society. That is why people shell out £125 a copy for it and it is on the bookshelf of almost every politician, judge, journalist, writer, artist etc in the UK. Anyone can be nominated in the UK too. You can even nominate yourself, but nomination is a very different matter to inclusion. If your Worldview/POV is restricted to music and football, then that's fine, trying to impose that worldview on other's isn't fine. There are I think 28,000 people in Who's Who out of a population of sixty million. Save up and buy a copy, or go to your Library. Wikipedia is not a working class revolutionary movement, so reflecting the views of mainstream society is perfectly acceptable. <a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EAnnabelBuxton_fea4.html" title="User:AnnabelBuxton">AnnabelBuxton</a> 13:14, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'm sorry, but the people in Who's Who do not in any way, shape or form represent "mainstream British society". I'm not arguing at all that musicians or footballers are necessarily more or less notable than minor nobility, but the former have their own criteria for inclusion on Wikipedia (see many, many previous AfDs) and so should the latter. Incidentally, your use of the phrase "working class revolutionary movement" indicates that you are trying to impose your own POV on this AfD. <b><a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EEliminatorJR_b0b2.html" title="User:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B">Eliminator</font><font color="#FF4500">JR</font></a> <a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EEliminatorJR_a208.html" title="User talk:EliminatorJR"><font color="#483D8B"><sup>Talk</sup></font></a></b> 13:45, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> They represent the mainstream consensus on notability. Obviously they are not mainstream themselves, otherwise two thirds of the populaton would be in there. I am sorry if I offended you, I was simply trying to point out that your worldview may have been influenced by your environment. You should be very proud of your background, while accepting that it may have given you a perspective not shared by all. Also Baronets are the sixth rung of the Nobiles Majores. They are not minor. We don't really have minor nobility in the UK. Unlike the continent where they do have bucketfuls of aristocrats. <a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EAnnabelBuxton_fea4.html" title="User:AnnabelBuxton">AnnabelBuxton</a> 14:51, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> pending a wider debate on notability as it applies to Baronets. To my mind, notability of people does not just come from their own actions; it also comes from their position in life, which may not have been earned but which is there nonetheless. The fact that a significant number of people consider Baronets to be worthy of record and study is a mark of notability, whether or not others disagree.

<li>Those arguments are worse than weak, they are wrong. Most Barons and other peers do NOT get seats in the upper houses of parliament. Both peers and baronets have to have their claims verified by the UK Government home office, upon being proven their are entered on the Roll Of Peers or Baronets, and take their rank in UK Society according to the order of precedence which is enshrined in law. If the UK were like the Italian Republic where there is no government verification or recognition of titles or their rank then you would have a point, as it is please research your statements. If you are using length of service on Wikipedia as a mark of importance, then you can't exactly deny the British aristocracy their importance in English society can you. As Orwell pointed out in Animal Farm, you can't get rid of elitism, you can only replace one form with another. <a href="../../../a/n/n/User%7EAnnabelBuxton_fea4.html" title="User:AnnabelBuxton">AnnabelBuxton</a> 11:17, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> AnnabelBuxton is not quite right here. Until 1999, Barons in the Peerage of the United Kingdom <i>were</i> automatically eligible for a seat in the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Lords_efb8.html" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a>, subject only to a) "proving" their claim to the title, and b) applying for a "writ of summons" (which is a purely formal step). As Annabel correctly notes, Baronets are also subject to the requirement to prove their claims, and a baronetcy does not make a person eligible for a seat in the House of Lords. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <small><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</small> 18:04, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - God bless all here. Some observations on three fronts. <b>First</b>, Wikipedia itself. It has become voluminous, but its quality does not approach its size. Rather like a cyberspace Wal-Mart. Some of the articles are wrong, and there are limits to the iterative/reiterative process. The beast grows, but it may not be improving. <b>Second</b>, the editing. Nuttah68 gives his game away in his first several words. “Contested prod with the edit comment of ‘notable’.” Is this a frank admission of religious prejudice or what? After that sterling intro, he lapses into a jarring imitation of a Prussian lawyer examining precedents and logic. Come on, Nuttah, you don’t care about rules and practice; you want to bloody a “prod” nose. On that last point, I happen to agree with you. I’d like to start with Rowan Williams. Perhaps we could discuss our shared views in a less public venue. Whatever our shared opinions, neither of us is justified in acting on them and then attempting to hide them behind rules which, however hard one tries, do not come in one size that fits all. Perhaps you and I – and Vintagekits – could work together on a similar censorship campaign, but one that’s all to the public good. (I, too, find I can be self-righteous when my prejudices and actions coincide, in the interest of rightness as I see it.) As I mentioned above, Wikipedia is no source, and at least one university history department has banned its use. It has some articles that are so erroneous as to be hilariously funny. One of these is entitled “Cassiques.” Take a look at it. It contains the names of people that never existed. It also contains a number of Ascendancy prods from the years shortly after the Boyne. The Church of Ireland Arthur family from Limerick. The Church of Ireland Bayly family from Ballinaclough. Honored (<i>allegedly</i>, in the Arthur case: one of the article's many errors) by the English power structure. Let’s get rid of that article. There are excellent, uncontroversial reasons for doing so. And there’s also the frisson of prodding a prod. <b>Third</b>, notability. As for Keith A., I find it notable that he married and then had only three children. One or more of the participating editors may have had acknowledged children out of wedlock, and others may have so many as to make the local pastor look askance. Marriage and a manageable number of legitimate children. That was ho-hum in the 1950s. Surely worth a headline today in <i>News of the World</i>. But most of all, I put great store by what my eyes tell me: he is notable enough to be targeted by targeters who have a long history of targeting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep the article:</p>
<p>1. The move to delete Keith is based both on his rank and and on the rank prejudice of the would-be censor(s). 2. The article, although brief, appears accurate. A special place in the Wikipedia pantheon. 3. There are bigger fish to fry.<br />
For the conspiracy theorists among us. This is my first contribution to the Wiki process under any name. I do not know Keith. But I am an American, and we don’t stand too much on ceremony. At the same time, this country has a long agricultural tradition. Tunnah, I can smell fertilizer an ocean away.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>, after some hesitation. This is a difficult issue: it is clear from the discussions about the proposed <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28royalty%29_f89d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (royalty)">Wikipedia:Notability (royalty)</a> guidelines that there is cuurently no consensus either way about whether hereditary nobility itself confers a presumption of notability.<br />
Some of the arguments in this AFD discussion appear to me to be concerning themselves with whether people approve or disapprove of the system of honours and nobility. That's irrelevant: I'm sure that all of us can pints to huge swathes of Wikipedia which cover things we dislike, disapprove of, or think are over-rated.<br />
Other parts of the discussion appear to be a re-run of the arguments which were (or should have been) made wrt to the rejected guideline. I think it would have been useful to have some guideline, whatever it said, to avoid re-inventing the wheel each time this issue arises; but there isn't one, and there's no point proceeding as if we are devising a guideline on either heredity or nobility. Without a special guideline we have to fall back to assessing <i>this particular article</i> under <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.<br />
It seems to me that the 8th Baronet here is a marginal case wrt to <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a>: numerous entries in works on nobility and a Who's Who entry seem to me to go a long way to meeting <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a>, but without unambiguously getting there. The discussion above includes well-reasoned arguments both for against this baronet meeting <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a>.<br />
As to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, I can't find anything there which suggests that this is a special case.<br />
However, I am persuaded by the arguments above by Charles01: "Whatever you think about the British honours system (... I myself find it significantly batty and, on a serious note, potentially corrupting) it is a part of public life in the UK that seems to interest plenty of folks in UK and anglophone places which used to be 'owned' by UK. These guys enjoy disproportionate influence".<br />
That's what clinches it for me: the fact of being the latest title-holder in a family which includes several notable people and apperas to somewhat influential. However, I don't think that <i>all</i> baronets pass that test: not all families of baronets have anyone notable, and plenty of baronetcies were sold by <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maundy_Gregory_b57d.html" title="Maundy Gregory">Maundy Gregory</a> or awarded to otherwise obscure people who happened to find favour with the government of the day. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> <small><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrownHairedGirl_db63.html" title="User talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BrownHairedGirl_b510.html" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)</small> 20:38, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, provisionally per WP:BIO: "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of secondary sources that are reliable, independent of the subject and independent of each other. The depth of coverage of the subject by the source must be considered. If the depth of coverage is not substantial, then multiple independent sources should be cited to establish notability." At the very, very least, this baronet has received non-substantial coverage from a wide multitude of independent sources, making him notable. That shouldn't be debatable. In the wider view, to address the concerns of folks supporting the deletion of this article, I'd say I support keeping articles like this until policy is seriously considered and clarified with respect to baronets along predictable and rational lines. We shouldn't just toss articles out because there isn't any specific policy that positively establishes their notability right now. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesocialistesq_d715.html" title="User:Thesocialistesq">-- Thesocialistesq/M.Lesocialiste</a> 21:47, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Carole Jordan does not mention any marriage in her article, although her ex-husband, Richard Peckover, does in his."</i> --<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> 11:33, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>, It is patently not - as stated above, I went and looked at a copy of Who's Who 2007 and Debretts just to see what level of depth it goes into on people. Firstly Debrett's - this is 1,797 pages - with approximately 13 entries per page and the Sir Keith Arbutnott entry does not state anything notable about him only when he was born and the names of his family members.</li>

<dd>Who's Who - this is pretty much the same book as far as I can see just with even more people, the UK edition alone is 2,529 pages long this year and it has on average 16 people listings or referral's per page - you do the math on the amount of people in it then. Each page is split into two columns with 100 lines per column so that 200 lines per page (over half a million lines in the book). The entry for this person is 6 lines long in one column - that includes a line for his name and address of where they live - the other four lines include where he went to school and the names of his family members inc. ex. wife. In fact the article is almost word for word what is the article except it has no crest shown and it uses abbreviations for much of the textile. There is no mention of anything notable that he achieved except that he went to university. Both entries in both books are identical as far as I can see - are they connected in some way or compiled in the same way?</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>, I know, you said that but its not especially as each of the 40,000 entrant fills out their own questionaire and effectively writes their own entry - there is no depth of coverage and in this case no claim of notability within the entry and therefore an entry in a book of listing is not enough for pass <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> - why dont we just have an articles on everyone in the phonebook!--<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> 13:45, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b>:It seems to me that the (presumably unconcious) atavistic tribalism in which many of the contributions here are marinated is a much more fascinating, and also a much more serious subject than the issue of whether one fellow's favourite baronet is more or less deserving of an article than another fellow's favourite singer. Many wiki readers have not grown up in the heroic traditions of either Irish Republicanism or of British Imperialism, and would be thoroughly baffled by the passions stirred here. You thought Irish Republicanism and British Imperialism were off topic for this discussion? Take another look. There are plenty of honourable traditions that have from time to time been rendered scurrilous by the atrocities perpetrated in their names. Time may lead to more balance. But how many centuries will pass before an objective viewpoint is widely accepted concerning the crusading movements formally launched outside Clermont in 1095? Wikipedia is about knowledge. Both the honourable bits and the scurrilous bits deserve to be known: you can agree on that even before you will agree over which are which . If the more animated of the protagonists participating here think they will convert each other to one another's cause, then I think that they are doing whatever it is they are doing into the wind. And they must surely know it already. Wiki is trying to build knowledge: where it succeeds in that, it is to be commended. Excluding articles on 'people we don't like' (whether from personal knowledge or simply because we are riled by the curious names by which they wish to be known) reduces the overall bank of knowledge available and thereby renders more suspect that knowledge which remains uncensored. You will not convert your most committed opponents to your cause, least of all by haranguing them and seeking to exclude articles on matters that interest them. But you might at least enhance your own case to the unpersuaded by devoting your undoubted talents to maximising the information (information = facts) available on the causes about which you feel most positively. I guess that is what underlies my own instinct (?prejudice) in favour of retaining and improving articles about ... almost anything that anyone has bothered to write about in cases of stated doubt. So yes, my ‘keep’ vote is to be construed as a vote for knowledge and not as a vote for the British Empire, a subject on which my further views are mercifully out of scope.</p>
<p>There also seems to be a move afoot to encourage selective quoting of statements of wiki policy in support of one's viewpoint in this discussion. I forgot every wiki-policy I ever read so just I took another look. Here are a few quotable bits I found I agreed with after thirty seconds of clicking:</p>
<p><i>“Articles that can be improved should be edited or tagged, not nominated for deletion.”</i></p>
<p><i>“…but ...in some cases, repeated attempts to have an article deleted may even be considered disruptive. <b>If in doubt, don't delete.”</b></i></p>
<p><i>“Treating others with respect is key to collaborating effectively in building an encyclopedia.”</i></p>
<p>I had wondered, as these discussions unfolded, whether I was indeed guilty of having misconstrued the wiki mind-set. It may be so: I certainly don't expect to acquire an intimate knowledge of all the wiki policies any time soon. But it does (still) seem to me that the wiki mind-set prefers wider and deeper knowledge over opinion and censorship. When in doubt, please share the facts with the rest of us and let the facts build your case, especially where you find the facts offensive: you may gather more converts than you'd expected. As for Sir Keith Arbuthnot, I still wish that someone somewhere would find something more interesting to write about him.</p>
<p>For better or worse, I fear I may have alienated anyone else who feels strongly enough about matters thrown up by this article to have participated in the discussion about it. But in the event that you're still there, thank you for reading this.<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles01_1cdb.html" title="User:Charles01">Charles01</a> 14:19, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>, this is not an issue of POV or of keeping knowledge away from people (censorship if you wish) this is an issue of notability. You stated in your keep&#160;!vote "The guy must have done something interesting since leaving uni" or else he wouldnt be in Who's who. There are a few things are wrong with that 1. That is not a strong reason to keep and it not based on wiki policy 2. he hasnt done anything noteworthy since uni (or at least nothing is stated about this is the article) 3. Who's who automatically gives a listing to Peers and Baronets if they reutrn their questionaire, so its not on merit and Wiki does not apply the same critieria 4. Wiki is not a crystal ball, we cannot assume that he must have done something or will do something or note if there is no proof.--<a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVintagekits_cef4.html" title="User:Vintagekits">Vintagekits</a> 14:31, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

Who's Who and Debretts are independent reliable sources.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemical_Abstracts_f527.html" title="Chemical Abstracts">Chemical Abstracts</a> turns up 414 scientific articles for caesium perchlorate.

<li>Very good point. I didn't know about this database. We should make a page that directs editors where likely sources for creating an article would be found for non-standard topics, like chemicals, or ... I don't know what else, but I'm sure there are other topics that would appear non-notable through a simple Google search, but in fact have loads of information available if searched for correctly. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanchom_ae62.html" title="User:Sanchom">Sancho</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESanchom_4ab1.html" title="User talk:Sanchom">talk</a>) 23:23, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, per Edgar181 (note: the {{<a href="../../../i/m/p/Template%7EImportance_b9e2.html" title="Template:Importance">importance</a>}} tag states "This article lacks information on the notability (importance) of the subject matter.", hence has the assumption the article <i>is</i> notable, but does not state why (hence, such articles do not need to be deleted, they lack a very important part of information). If its notability was questionable, it would use {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENotability_8ef7.html" title="Template:Notability">notability</a>}}. The reason they are both in the notability category, is that articles which do not <i>state</i> notability/importance may indeed <i>be</i> not-notable. The importance tag has now been removed, hence the articles do now not state anymore that they do not state importance. Hence, they will remain unnoticed for their lack of importance, and unknowing readers will now not understand why this article is here (but at least they do not get prodded or AfD'd). I am sorry for my cynical tone, but I have been contesting a number of these prods/AfD's/retaggings/detaggings, where I do not understand why this seems to be the solution to clearing a backlog; see also <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Notability_9a9b.html#Importance_per_project" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Notability">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Notability#Importance per project</a>). --<a href="../../../b/e/e/User%7EBeetstra_df14.html" title="User:Beetstra">Dirk Beetstra</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/e/User_talk%7EBeetstra_e243.html" title="User talk:Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">T</span></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Beetstra_043a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Beetstra"><span style="color:#0000FF;">C</span></a></sup> 21:57, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> If this is sourced and expanded, it could be a worthwhile, interesting and encyclopedic article (and sources have now been added). This is <i>not</i> "cruft" (which is one of the worst deletion reasons ever) - nor is it arbitrary. It lists notable people who were born at sea (a fairly rare occurrence, surely) which has all sorts of legal and political ramifications. Hmmm, looks like we need an article on Birth at sea as well... --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 00:25, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Verifiable, "cruft" is just a derisive term, not a valid reason for deletion. This is no more arbitrary than every country list and category for births. The term "cruft" should be banned from discussions, it has no valid context. I would like to see List of people who died at sea --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Arthur_Norton_%281958-_%29_421a.html" title="User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )">Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )</a> 03:54, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Being born at sea is notable but not defining hence a list is appropriate. Presumably the sourcing for the currently listed people can be found in the articles for the people.

<p>Seems like an advertisement. Makes vague claims of notability, but they come down to what I believe are self-published books and having his own medical practice.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> In the field of homeopathy, Sankaran is one of the most widely-quoted and respected living homeopaths in the world (probably second only to Vithoulkas who is much older) and his research is considered ground-breaking, so I'm stunned that the article is proposed for deletion. He appears at sold-out lectures around the world. His software is widely used by homeopaths. His books are prominently featured at homeopathic suppliers. If we're going to have ANY articles about homeopathic practitioners Sankaran should be there. This AFD has been proposed by someone who obviously has zero knowledge or interest in this field. Here's an accurate bio <a href="http://www.mauiacademy.com/rajan_profile.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mauiacademy.com/rajan_profile.shtml" rel="nofollow">[66]</a>. I also note that the article doesn't mention the dozens of articles which Sankaran has published in homeopathic journals. An incomplete list is found here <a href="http://www.minimum.com/p7/engine/auth.asp?n=348" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.minimum.com/p7/engine/auth.asp?n=348" rel="nofollow">[67]</a> Radar, probably the largest and most professional homeopathic software program, relies heavily on Sankaran's work <a href="http://www.archibel.com/support/faq/english/1.32.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.archibel.com/support/faq/english/1.32.shtml" rel="nofollow">[68]</a>. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 15:54, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The issue of self-published books is a complete red-herring. His books are widely distributed and available anywhere that professional literature on homeopathy is sold. They've also been incorporated into the main commercial homeopathic databases and they've been reviewed and discussed in journals in his field. I don't understand why you think being dead makes one a better candidate for notability. I've done some cleanup of this article and added links to more journal reviews. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 12:37, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article purports to describe a stereotype, the name of which is a slang word. Searching for sources I find none at all that document any such type of person, let alone that can be used to confirm any of the contents of the article (such as the clothing preferences of this type of person). This article is documentation, being constructed firsthand directly by Wikipedia editors, for something for which there is no prior documentation outside of Wikipedia; it is original research, <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html#No_original_research" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">which is forbidden here</a>. There's no evidence that this is even an alternative name for the stereotypes that <i>are</i> documented, such as <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chav.html#References" title="Chav">chav</a>, so no support even for a redirect. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:31, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hi, I live in Celbridge and i noticed this word is up for deletion because it does not have sources. Well, the word is widely used in Kildare and Dublin and it has been published in local newspapers, the only problem is that these local papers don't have web pages so they cannot be referenced for this page. I would not be happy for this word and its definition to be deleted as it is a perfectly legitimate entry and is widely used in the areas pointed out. 194.106.155.33 11:49, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>However it does more than a dictionary would do it tells you where it is commonly used and what is commonly associated with them. You wouldn't find that in any dictionary, no matter how big it is. I reckon that it is to full encyclopedic quality. - garethppls 21:14, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I agree with Gareth, the entry defines the word, what type of people it relates to, what they commonly wear, their attitudes and their type of lifestyle and this is much, much more than a simple dictionary definition. Cahillgod 17:00, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Your first cited article says nothing about shambags at all. Your second cited article at least says something about shambags, but is a post to a web discussion forum by an unidentifiable person, and thus is not information can be relied upon to have been through a process of fact checking and peer review, and is not from an author whose reputation for accuracy can be checked.

<p>"The Jedi or Sith employ an attack in rare instances to use the cutting power of their lightsabers for an object at an unreachable location called the saber throw, or a throwing of his or her lightsaber. The lightsaber is thrown; usually the blade tip spins in a circular motion about the hilt; and the saber hits its target, usually to cut it. Skilled practitioners will use the Force to manipulate the trajectory of the lightsaber and then redirect it back to their hand."</p>

Yes, more sources, such as the various roleplaying books (from where some of this information is derived) need to be cited. Yes, "real world" information needs to be added and expanded on - I recall one of the SW "Making Of" films describing how lightsaber combat 'evolved' from the slow double-handed movements of Ep IV to the rapid speed of later films.

<li><b>Burn it!</b>, or just Delete. The article is a good read, but goes far more into depth than should be on Wikipedia. Nothing indicates that these are notable.

The vast majority of SW canon (including <b>all</b> movies and videogames and almost all novels) offer no explanation of lightsaber training or feats of the Force because it's like magic, and magic is self-explanatory. It is only for the intricacies of pen and paper role-playing that applying rules to saber fighting and the Force becomes necessary, and therefore the significance of this information to the Star Wars phenomenon as a whole is strictly limited. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Garrett</a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_0893.html" title="User talk:Master Thief Garrett">Talk</a></sup> 22:00, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Seems to me that you are confusing "External Links" with "References". While the "External Links" are indeed pointing to various wikis and message boards, and while SOME of the references are pointing to those, there are significant references to published works in the Reference section. While some may consider the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_Insider_2bdf.html" title="Star Wars Insider">Star Wars Insider</a> to be a fan-based publication, the plain fact is that the article concerning lightsaber forms has been used and referenced now by computer games, role-playing games, and novels in the Star Wars genre, a number of which are in the "References" section of this article. Declaring the entire article as "original research" and void of valid sources is a fallacy at this point. Otherwise, you might as well ditch the articles on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Force_%28Star_Wars%29_f4bd.html" title="The Force (Star Wars)">The Force (Star Wars)</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/d/Jedi.html" title="Jedi">Jedi</a> and just about everything from <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Star_Wars_2be9.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Star Wars">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Star_Wars</a>, because most of the content of those articles came from similar sources.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Keep in mind that *all* published Star Wars stuff is canon per Lucasfilms... they have some odd tiered system. Lucas himself &gt; films &gt; books/tv shows &gt; games &gt; magazines &gt; comics (or similar order), where all is canon, but anything contradictory higher in the chain supercedes anything else--so hence, no continuity breaks, and all valid in that sense to include in Wikipedia as "not something made up"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_canon#The_Holocron" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_canon#The_Holocron" rel="nofollow">[69]</a>. Star Wars Insider is an OK source, it's official. Only needs some sourcing, but can be sourced to game books, RPGs, mags, starwars.com, video games, etc. We use those sources of that nature for all sorts of stuff so it's fine here. Just needs some clean up/tightening, and why keep going after it to delete? WP:NOT a paper dictionary, so this is a content matter, not a policy violation as demonstrated by past AfDs. Please close as Keep, and just tag for clean up--the sources exist, are known to exist, and exist in abundance. It's the single biggest most popular fictional franchise... ever.

<dd>Declaring something to be non-notable doesn't make it so... Lightsaber combat is a central feature of six of the most popular films of all times. It is central to DOZENS of novels, which also do touch on the forms and so forth mentioned here, and I saw last night that Lucasfilms is actually coming out specifically with a book about the Force in their fictional world this year now, which will additionally cover all this material. I'm not sure I understand your claim of it not being notable. have you watched any star wars film, or read any of the novels? This is all sourceable--I'm simply saying that the article expanded without people actually adding footnotes as often as needed, and more people are saying the exact same thing basically. Whether it's fictional or silly is illerevant. A film series of six movies alone where each film makes roughly $1,000,000,000&gt; from release through to DVD, about a family whose people basically do "<a href="../../../l/i/g/Lightsaber_combat.html" title="Lightsaber combat">Lightsaber combat</a>" makes "lightsaber combat" notable, before you even get into all the monster volumes of side material...</dd>

Somehow, I don't think anyone will argue that Star Wars is a work of fiction. As to whether or not lightsaber combat is considered a major or minor concept within Star Wars...well, the vast majority of SW fiction certainly contains instances of lightsaber combat, particularly the prequel era works and the post-movie works. Within the genre, I would say that it has distinctly established notability. The OR argument has been debunked so many times in this AfD that I suspect people are simply not even trying to look at the references section of the article. Ironically, I feel Moreschi has the best take on this-chunks of the article do need cleaned up, because Wikipedia isn't a how-to guide; the article on <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karate.html" title="Karate">Karate</a> doesn't go into detail on how to perform its art; neither should this article try to do the same.

<dd>Strawman/red herring, I didn't say the wikis were RS. I said they had listings of all the RS, down to detailed breakdowns of which book featured which thing (fighting form, etc.) detailed in THIS article. The sources exist in abundance, and anything officially owned by Lucasfilms is a fine RS for the Star Wars articles. The ONLY question is one of notability, but being as the lightsaber combat features heavily in six of the most successful films of all time, and a hit TV show (Clone Wars) plus other old (80s) animated shows, plus the forthcoming live-action Star Wars shows, plus 30-40+ novels... yeah, notable.

I agree that much of the content of this article appears to be culled from inappropriate sources and hence this article has sigificant <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> problems. However, I also agree that enough sources and content would be left if the unreliable material were culled out to make topic <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> and justifying a reasonable article. AfD covers whether the topic itself is encyclopedic, not whether the current article complies with standards in all respects. The topic supports an encyclopedic article, and that is enough. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 05:48, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Obviously this forum is stronger than most advertised here at Wikipedia. I am not calling this advertising because it isn't. It's a legit article on a legit internet site. Now, if you delete this one, you would, in theory, have to get rid of the NSider article, GTF Outsider, and all of the other 'forums' out there. Since you perceptibaly won't do that, then this needs to stay.</p>
<p>I feel that this page is not advertising... It is a strong forum and has been around for a long time. If you feel that this is advertising, then why not take the other forums down as well? Just because they are bigger does not mean that they are not advertising also... Please consider keeping this page... --Divine Boards 20:35, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>This is the main thrust of my argument- whether the place exisys or not, the article is a farce. The place itself (I live near it) is literally a couple of fields and some houses.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - can I also add that the article refers to govt. sources and not once names Derrytresk, but does name the nearby Washing Bay (which does exist and has a bus service - it also has a nice beach on Lough Neagh).

<li><b>Keep</b> - Real town. Towns, cities, villages are inherently notable regardless of size.

<li>there's a difference here- the LA article isn't garbage; you can find LA on a map; if you drove through LA, you would notice it; 'Los Angeles' is not a local name for a couple of fields.

<li><b>Delete</b> - contents of this page appear to have nothing to do with Derrytresk, but with Washing Bay. Page has been oft-edited from one location- apparently as a joke. Contents are rubbish.

<li><b>Redirect</b> Telewest should be deleted, as it is now Virgin Media. This page once deleted should redirect to Virgin Media as NTL: AND Virgin.net do. Please post you opinions.

<li>Legitimate case of <b>Speedy redirect</b>. Was once a listed London cable franchisee which was caught up in the dot.com bubble. The name will mean something to a lot of Londoners and shareholders. Why does it need to be deleted prior to establishing redirect? <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 08:01, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Article is still historically relevant. We don't merge people's biographies to <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heaven.html" title="Heaven">Heaven</a> when they die. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 08:10, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> Not really the best example IMHO. The equivalent would be that we had two separate articles when someone changed their name<a href="../../../p/i/t/User%7EPit-yacker_4192.html" title="User:Pit-yacker">Pit-yacker</a> 16:33, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Changing their name is more accurate than saying that Telewest "died". AFAICT Telewest took over NTL, changed its name to NTL and then changed its name to Virgin Media. Perhaps on that basis this article should be at NTL? <a href="../../../p/i/t/User%7EPit-yacker_4192.html" title="User:Pit-yacker">Pit-yacker</a> 22:28, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Then why have Ntl and Virgin.net been deleted</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> No reason to delete this article, should be a redirect to Virgin Media at the very least. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatchpole_52c3.html" title="User:Catchpole">Catchpole</a> 10:23, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b>: IMHO the argument for keeping the old articles is flawed. The article as currently stands has more in common with Virgin Media than Telewest as this article had previously changed to reflect the harmonisation of products with NTL that occured long before the rebrand. Secondly, as I have previously said Virgin Media <b>IS</b> NTL and Telewest operating under a different name. As technically Telewest took over NTL (and then renamed itself NTL), Telewest has more claim to be Virgin Media than NTL. My third concern about having separate articles is that of consistency. I maintain that duplication in Wikipedia is a very bad thing. Since editors generally only edit one article, articles very quickly diverge, and inconsistencies appear. With two separate articles there is no way to avoid inconsistencies as the history of Telewest is directly relevant to Virgin Media. The pre-merger "lowest common denominator" of consensus of having a link to Telewest#History in NTL's history section was frankly quite silly. <a href="../../../p/i/t/User%7EPit-yacker_4192.html" title="User:Pit-yacker">Pit-yacker</a> 14:36, 8 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not silly, but a good practice: summary style. The <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin_Media_6a9d.html" title="Virgin Media">Virgin Media</a> article is huge; why shouldn't it have more detailed and authoritative accounts of elements of its history to point to? <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 20:13, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Having separate articles isnt silly. Having a {{main|Telewest#History}} in NTL is though. IMHO it makes for very poor flow with the article branching off into halfway through a separate article and then coming back for the rest of the section. If you want to break up the Virgin Media article, I would reccomend having whole sections eg an article History of Virgin Media. <a href="../../../p/i/t/User%7EPit-yacker_4192.html" title="User:Pit-yacker">Pit-yacker</a> 22:28, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Telewest was a notable cable company. Keep it for historical reasons. <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7EComputerjoe_570e.html" title="User:Computerjoe">Computerjoe</a><a href="../../../c/o/m/User_talk%7EComputerjoe_0094.html" title="User talk:Computerjoe"><span style="color:red">'s talk</span></a> 17:31, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It's a notable company with a very notable position in the history of Telecommunications in the UK. Also I notice that the article on <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compaq.html" title="Compaq">Compaq</a> has not been deleted. Compaq is only a brand name now, nothing else. Compaq has been totally swallowed by HP so surely if Telewest is deleted it will set a precedent for Compaq to get the bullet as well and be merged into HP, which shouldn't happen because Compaq is a dead company with a unique history that needs keeping, just like Telewest. -<a href="../../../x/2/0/User%7EX201_1eb7.html" title="User:X201">X201</a> 22:51, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: My point entirely. Shouldn't all the history be removed from it. Shouldn't the Compaq Article be the equivalent of "Was big, not now. Just a brand name"&#160;? - <a href="../../../x/2/0/User%7EX201_1eb7.html" title="User:X201">X201</a> 12:43, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>: This article is important in that it describes a company that used to exist. <a href="../../../a/e/m/User%7EAEMoreira042281_5c52.html" title="User:AEMoreira042281">AEMoreira042281</a> 06:45, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: this is still a valid historical article about a significant and notable once-independent company, even if it is now merged into a larger entity. Otherwise, by the same logic, we would have to delete <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Post_Office_5dcf.html" title="General Post Office">General Post Office</a>, because it no longer exists and its business is carried on by other entities, <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Steel_db3c.html" title="British Steel">British Steel</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Coal_Board_1869.html" title="National Coal Board">National Coal Board</a> likewise, and so on into absurdity. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 19:13, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> This page should be redirected to Virgin Media then.</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Telewest Limited remains on the register at Companies House and there are 48 other companies incorporating the name Telewest. The fact that Telewest is now a subsidiary of Virgin Media does not prevent it remaining notable. Prior to amalgamations with NTL and then Virgin Media, Telewest was certainly notiable. That amalgamation doe not affect notability. Alternatively, <b>Merge</b> with Virgin Media as a separate section in that article. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeterkingiron_03d3.html" title="User:Peterkingiron">Peterkingiron</a> 23:08, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, I don't see an indication of notability. The age isn't relevant, since that doesn't make it one of the oldest pubs in the country, or otherwise add notability on itself. A suicide happening in the place doesn't confer notability to the establishment; the event might make news, but no one would remember the name of the place after seeing/hearing that news, because it's not relevant. A bridge might become famous as a suicide spot, but in this case, there's no indication that the selection of the place wasn't coincidental. - <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobet_31bb.html" title="User:Bobet">Bobet</a> 12:50, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Non-notable web movie. The article by what appears to be a single-purpose account reads like advertising or promotion, largely consisting of unsubstantiated unverified claims.</p>
<p>I am also nominating the following related page, which is essentially the same article:</p>

<li><b>Do not Delete</b> This is no joke. It is not ludicrous to compare a feature length movie to another. The analogy is that both movies are sequels that are better than originals. (Based on opinion and is inherently a subjective statement that holds validity.) The movie's notability is a mute point because the popularity of the movie has nothing to do with the fact that it was the first feature length movie made specifically for the internet. It is the first feature length movie made specifically for the internet regardless of how much presence it has to mainstream web users. It is an underground movie that has seen success in various circles and the claim of being the first feature length movie made specifically for the internet is substantiated and corroborated by google searches regarding the subject of the claims. There is no legitimate evidence to disprove the claims and the fact that the movie is not very popular for mainstream net surfers does not make the claims illegitimate. The main claim of being the first feature length movie made specifically for the internet is of historical significance therefore this article should not be deleted.</li>

<p>Google results are also stacked against this one for notability.. consisting mainly of self promotion and distribution, there's a few "reviews" (minor conversation) among the results but no mention or review by mainstream sources. If this really was a notable topic one would think that there would be significant propagation beyond 70 unique hits over the past half decade. The claims of pioneering the field of internet movie features are also unsubstantiated to down right false. I'd say delete but I'm not logged in, although I'm sure due process will take it's course. Also, I smell like poo. <a href="../../../7/4/2E/User%7E74.97.109.162.html" title="User:74.97.109.162">74.97.109.162</a></p>
