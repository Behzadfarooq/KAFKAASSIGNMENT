<p><b>Delete</b> OK I've been looking further into the guidelines, policies and various other bits connected to video games.</p>
<p>The Video Games Wiki (yes I know it's not policy but seems to the "considered" viewpoint on what should and should not be done with video game articles) has the following to say: <i>A general rule of thumb to follow if unsure: if the content only has value to people actually playing the game, it's unsuitable.</i> I'd say this article fails that test, I do not see how content such as: <b>Light Arrows are also featured in The Minish Cap as an arrow upgrade. They are the first item ever that can be missed. If Link doesn't save Gregal before officially visiting the Wind Tribe, Gregal dies and Link will not get the Light Arrows ever.</b> is of much interest to someone who is not playing that game.</p>
<p>It also says that other content that might be moved to a gaming wiki includes: <i>Lists of mere statistics, items, or other minutiae. The HP or weight class of a character is not important to the article; neither are all the swords available in the game.</i> I'd say this article seems to fail one as well: <b>Bottles are an essential part to many of Link's quests. These containers are used and often required to carry various things, such as: &lt;list of all the bottles that link encountered</b> <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_laptop_cca9.html" title="User:Larry laptop">Larry laptop</a> 01:09, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>: Clearly against <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>: Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate list and not a game guide. This article is literally a game guide covering the entire <i>Legend of Zelda</i> series and is unhelpful to anyone who hasn't played the games.

<ul>
<li>Commenting on my own stance: in light of points made in this debate, I actually do think that it is possible to cleanup and/or rewrite the article in such a way that it would not appear to be a game guide/indiscriminate list, hence negating the proposed reason for deletion. I too think that the subject is worthy of its article, though it seriously needs credible sources to back up such a claim. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottie_theNerd_0b10.html" title="User:Scottie theNerd">Scottie theNerd</a> 00:50, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You consider this encyclopedic (this is random, I could pick 100s of other examples) - <i>The Mirror Shield is also required in order to solve several puzzles in The Wind Waker. In The Minish Cap, whenever an enemy fired a projectile and you block it with the Mirror Shield, the shield emits a small damaging beam of light (roughly equivalent to half the power of the Four Sword) back to the enemy. Interestingly, this is the first time an item cannot be obtained on the first playthrough. Only when the is finished can the Mirror Shield be obtained. Therefore, it's rather useless in The Minish Cap. It is formed by Biggoron eating the normal shield and spitting it out a few days later.</i> Really?</dd>

<dd>how about <i>Ooccoo is a being who acts like a warp item in Twilight Princess, much like Farore's Wind in Ocarina of Time. She will let you set a warp point in a dungeon by staying there and having her son, Ooccoo Jr., warp you outside and, if used again, back to the original warp point inside the dungeon. Unlike other warp items, she must be found again in each dungeon. She also doesn't appear in the final two dungeons or return with Link to already completed dungeons for storyline reasons.</i></dd>

<dd>and clear this is not a games guide <i>In The Wind Waker, Link can buy All-Purpose Bait at Beedle's Shop Ship and store it in his Bait Bag. It is purchased in groups of three servings. A purchasable group of this bait will occupy one pouch in the Bait Bag, regardless of how many servings are left. Throwing some bait on the ground can cause pigs to dig there; throwing it near a rat hole causes rats to offer various helpful items for purchase. It can also distract Miniblins, and if thrown onto the sea near Fishman, he can fill in Link's Sea Chart and offer advice about the area.</i> and I've seen some wonky "what about article X" views but you think that compares to an article on one of the world's major religious leaders? really? --<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarry_laptop_cca9.html" title="User:Larry laptop">Larry laptop</a> 01:48, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Given that I'm packing at the moment I don't have time to go into my usual depth of argument.

<li><b>Delete</b> No notability asserted, yes, the game itself is notable, but what, specifically, is notable about a specific sword in the game? I consider items and such within games kinda like celebrities' wives, they may warrant a mention in the main article, but they hardly ever warrant seperate articles. There is no encyclopedic reason for a list of items within games, there are game wikis and gamefaqs for that reason. In addition, the definition of "game guide" per WP:NOT suggests that anytime something is useful primarily only to someone actually playing the game, it's not encyclopedic. In all honesty speedy delete criterion for "no context" and "no notability asserted" may well apply to the numerous lists of this kind, descriptions of game items offer us no commentary or context to ascertain why they are important. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 05:48, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm as much a Link boy as the next guy that never in his life owned a Nintendo, but I think that the article in itself should stay, since there is clearly enough material to warrant an article, on a subject that seems reasonably notable. Surely, a thorough clean-up could solve the game-guide issue. It just seems like a such a waste to delete what is clearly hours of well-intended work. The article desperately needs a clean-up, sure enough, to remove game-guide content as well as to make it less sprawling, but deleting seems unjustified.

<dd>In universe description is a nono based on the writing about fiction guidelines not just the wp:not a game guide criteria. Basically, an article must provide context in addition to content in order to fulfill the encyclopedic requirement. Things written from an entirely in-univese perspective about fiction also tend to result in confusion when they don't assert the character is fictional or why they're important in a more general sense. For example writing that a character is "the captain of the 124th lancer division of the galactic empire" could result in confusion, whereas "In sci/fi story Admiral soandso is the leader of the 124th lancer division, the protagonist's unit..." makes it explicitly clear the universe and importance to the story of the character. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 22:34, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That's true, of course, and the article does in fact do that. (Actually, looking over the list it seems that much of it is not in-universe at all.) Being in-universe is not grounds for deletion, anyway, since that can easily be corrected. What I don't understand is <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">User:Friday</a>'s supposed alleged link between <i>in universe</i> and <i>game guide</i>. <span style="font-size: 10px">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 23:07, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think it can be fixed- that's my point.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I could be a chode here and cherry-pick AfDs to counter your claims, but I'd rather give everyone an opportunity to view the entire picture, as it were, on AfDs relating to lists like this one. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Computer_and_video_games_Deletion_Archive_c2cc.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Computer and video games/Deletion Archive">Here is a list of every Computer and Video Game related AfD in the past several months</a>. It's a lot of data to digest, but then again so are all the AfDs you seem to have arbitrarily picked. The one thing that is clear in this list, however, is that <b>the "consensus in community-wide discussions" you talked about doesn't exist</b>. I've not kept clear count, but it seems to be a roughly 60-40 split on the delete/keep results for "list" CVG articles. Even if you ignore the other CVG-related "list" articles that have <i>never</i> been nominated for AfD you cannot possibly shape a 60-40 margin into a "clear consensus". Trying to justify the deletion of this article because some <i>other</i>, <i>somewhat similar</i> articles were deleted is lazy at best, and just doesn't fly in an AfD discussion. Just like <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">inclusion is not an indicator of notability</a>, neither is exclusion. -- <a href="../../../i/k/n/WP%7EIKNOWBEST_f5b0.html" title="WP:IKNOWBEST"><font color="black">Y<b>|</b></font></a><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">yukichigai</a> (<sub><a href="../../../y/u/k/User_talk%7EYukichigai_f252.html" title="User talk:Yukichigai"><font color="blue"><b>ramble</b></font></a></sub> <small><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_Viewpoints_and_Arguments_65e4.html" title="User:Yukichigai/Viewpoints and Arguments"><font color="red"><b>argue</b></font></a></small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yukichigai_f895.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yukichigai"><font color="green"><b>check</b></font></a></sup>) 09:00, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Far from being "somewhat similar" and "arbitrary", the above is an essentially comprehensive list of AfDs in the past year dealing with exactly the same thing: lists of widgets and doohdahs from video games with no notability outside the community that plays the game. Any random chump can "include" an article in WP, which is why <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">WP:INN</a> exists. It requires consensus and at least one concurring admin to delete an article, which is why ignoring precedent on AfD is silly. <span style="white-space:nowrap">— <a href="../../../k/a/u/User_talk%7EKaustuv_9271.html" title="User talk:Kaustuv">Kaustuv Chaudhuri</a></span> 09:31, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>This is not a "comprehensive list", it's a cherry-picked collection. As for <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">WP:INN</a>, read my above comment: just like inclusion is not an indicator of notability, lack of inclusion is not an indicator of non-notability. If we start relying on "precedent" then the entire AfD process becomes moot; there will be no discussion, just people citing previous AfDs. Articles for Deletion discussions are to be done based on the individual merits of each article, not on what has come before. Citing a handpicked collection of previous AfDs as "precedent" is tangential, misleading, and just plain wrong. -- <a href="../../../i/k/n/WP%7EIKNOWBEST_f5b0.html" title="WP:IKNOWBEST"><font color="black">Y<b>|</b></font></a><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">yukichigai</a> (<sub><a href="../../../y/u/k/User_talk%7EYukichigai_f252.html" title="User talk:Yukichigai"><font color="blue"><b>ramble</b></font></a></sub> <small><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_Viewpoints_and_Arguments_65e4.html" title="User:Yukichigai/Viewpoints and Arguments"><font color="red"><b>argue</b></font></a></small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yukichigai_f895.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yukichigai"><font color="green"><b>check</b></font></a></sup>) 18:01, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Minutia from the game. I'm sure a summary within the main article would do the trick. This is far too extensive for a general encyclopaedia.

<li>Good Lord, I didn't realize the version I read was after a major overhaul. The version when the AfD tag was applied is downright scary. Still, while Zelda is notable, weapons of Zelda don't get much in the line of reliable third party coverage and the likes, and the article as it stands still strikes me as mainly trivial. It's much better than it was, but it seems like there ought to be a way to condense it far more. GassyGuy 09:10, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> or at worst relist the AFD. I can see why contributors were up in arms about the previous version, it had eschewed all traces of wanting to be an encyclopedia article and was running wild. <i>However</i>, unlike most (if not all) of the examples given of weapon-pages deleted, LoZ isn't a single game which happens to feature weapons or items, it's one of the longest running still-active game series. Since a great deal of the weapons feature in different games of the series, a page about them seems perfectly reasonable. Master Sword has a seperate article, could it not be merged in? If the article is kept, it certainly needs continued cleanup and referencing, but I think this does justify a stay of execution.<br />
As a side-issue, since RuneScape was mentioned, can I point out that the contributors to <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html" title="RuneScape">RuneScape</a> themselves voted for deletion or merge of many of the articles they themselves worked on. Despite of a lack of familiarity with the policies and guidelines and having to cope with one of the most heavily editted articles on WP with an army of anons who've never editted before bombarding it constantly, the RS contributors are well on the way to getting the article to GA status and have tried to reign-in the sub-articles.

There are many useful things or things people are interested in that we cannot cover (per WP:Not a howto guide, a directory, ect.) In fact WP:Not is entirely about things that, while useful/interesting/important do not belong on Wikipedia. The trimmed article is better, but I still think it asserts no significance. why is that sword *Important* is the key question here, and why is it important beyond the context of the game itself? This is still material primarily of interest only to people actually playing the game. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 16:43, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
