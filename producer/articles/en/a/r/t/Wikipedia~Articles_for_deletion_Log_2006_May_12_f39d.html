<p><b>Delete</b> this webcomic article that makes no claim of any major awards, major publishers, or major media coverage. Only claim to notability seems to be very minor publishing ("the webcomic newspaper Zoinks! Magazine"). Also appears to be vanity in style and the webcomic's creator (Wes Molebash) is quite similar to the article's creator and nearly sole editor (User:Wesley89, whose only edits are to this article). <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a> was removed in a user's first and only edit.

<li><b>Delete</b> The mentioned page was created to attack the forum the page was about. The page was made by a member who was already banned from said forum, obviously out of spite. Now other users who also hate the forum for unexplained reasons are also using it as a way to talk negatively about the forum.

<li><b>Comment</b> From Wikipedia's own Guidlines "lists are useful for Wikipedia development purposes. The lists of related topics give an indication of the state of the 'pedia, the articles that have been written, and the articles that have yet to be written. Like categories, lists can be used for keeping track of changes in the listed pages, using the Related Changes feature. Unlike a category, a list also allows detection of deletion of pages from it, and, more generally, a history of its contents is available."</li>

<dd>umm.. Categories have functioning "related changes" links. It's why they added the living people category to keep track of vandals. Perhaps the guidline is outdated? Also... This list has very few redlinks.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm the person who suggested prod. The reason I did was that the original article consisted of "Skonseng is a suburb just north of Mo i Rana. Population: 750" which has no real context or information. Instead of moving my prod to afd, why did you not just remove the prod and add actual details? From where I come from, a city with a population of 750 is not an actual city, but simply a collection of farms which are bounded by an arbirtary taxing region. With no context, I had no way of knowing whether or not this was a real city, or merely Pokemon fan fiction. Fake User 07:10, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Notability is indeed subjective, as are most things - this is not a reason <i>why</i> notability is subjective, it is an example of possible subjectivity (though note the qualifier in the nomination). We have a policy, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, which includes several subjective definitions of what Wikipedia is and is not. Even though WP is not paper, there is a finite limit to what should be included, and many articles are placed which are blatantly self-promotional and serve no purpose other than to give free advertising. In this case, however, the subjective measure of notability indicates that the product probably is notable, and an editor with a decent history appears to be working on it. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 20:17, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Wow -- I expected to log on today seeing this page speedy deleted, and was really surprised at the amount of keeps and some of the comments making it sound like my nomination was moronic!&#160;:) Anyway, some back story -- This page was originally 99% a copyright violation which appeared quite dubious, in my opinion. The only reason I didn't speedy delete it, which I still feel this qualifies for, is because I couldn't be certain if the table information currently in the article was copyrighted or not. Today, I've found that most of that information is at <a href="http://www.navy.mil/navydata/fact_print.asp?cid=4500&amp;tid=300&amp;ct=4&amp;page=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.navy.mil/navydata/fact_print.asp?cid=4500&amp;tid=300&amp;ct=4&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, so I'm willing to say this article was created as a 100% copyright violation and should have been deleted immediately. I personally feel that once an article is found to have been created as a copyright violation which places Wikipedia at the risk of credibility and lawsuits, the article should be deleted immediately and, if so be, started over. I never said the article was nonnotable, which is why I'm surprised at the comments about how "obvious" this keep is or how this is important because "Tomato Adventure" is important. I feel that the article should have been deleted due to the copyright risk it brought and potentially still brings Wikipedia and it should be started over if an editor was interested in making it. I still feel that way, and still feel this should be deleted and given a fresh start, but of course, I'll respect the results of the vote in here. --<a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtaricodfish_9ff7.html" title="User:Ataricodfish">Ataricodfish</a> 00:55, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Did you paste the wrong link? I do not see where the article copied the stats. One says "Compliment" and the other "crew" and they give different numbers anyway. Sure the ship dimensions are the same but why would they be different? --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarsRover_23ea.html" title="User:MarsRover">MarsRover</a> 04:04, 13 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That was the link, but as one can't copyright dimensions and numbers, you're right, a number's a number. I'll let that issue slide and stand by the fact that 98% of the original article was copyrighted and the other 2% was simply unsourced, if that's somehow better. But my original issue remains -- the article raised credibility and legal issues for Wikipedia. Much of the keep votes stated it should stay for noteability issues, which I never brought up in my objection. I just felt it should be deleted because I'd rather Wikipedia's fundraisers not go toward legal costs defending preventable violations. --<a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtaricodfish_9ff7.html" title="User:Ataricodfish">Ataricodfish</a> 05:46, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Merge and Keep</b> for now - ESPN forums historically were extremely popular in college sports circles. They have been largely supplanted by Scout.com, Rivals.com, and the few independant school-specific message boards, but "back in the day", ESPN forums were the place to go for college sports fans. HOWEVER, the articles most certainly need to be merged into one and the other should be turned into a redirect - there is no need for two articles. I could even live with merging both into <a href="../../../e/s/p/ESPN_7b0e.html" title="ESPN">ESPN</a>. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 02:54, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>An individual user? Wow. -- I actually was surprised to see he was already banned, since he had so few edits, although the vandalism to this page was pretty substancial (messing with all the delete votes, changing people's comments, being vulgar, etc.). What was odd was, it appeared the vandalism to this page, since it wasn't reverted, wasn't the cause of his ban. Oh well, I'm going off topic now.

<li><b>Save</b> Levannah Harris was an important figure in the Scottish art scene from the late forties / early fifties until the early seventies. Her influence seems to have come from the works of Dali and Picasso, but she's influenced in turn a great number of young Scottish artists - particularly in Edinburgh. References for her work can be found in the more comprehensive Scottish art history books. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 130.209.6.40 (<a href="../../../1/3/0/User_talk%7E130.209.6.40.html" title="User talk:130.209.6.40">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_130.209.6.40_2ceb.html" title="Special:Contributions/130.209.6.40">contribs</a>) 11:30, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</small>

<ul>
<li>There can be no doubt that Harris is a national, rather than international, artist. Her work is seldom - if at all - commented on outside of Scottish artistic circles - she is certainly no Matisse. However if Wiki would like to be comprehensive on the subject a small entry on her work would be appropriate. To answer your question of influence, her work appears to have informed a number of younger Scottish artists, including Georgie Young (www.georgieyoung.com), Nancy E. Bushnell (www.eye-of-art.com) and Eona Murray Aitken (I don't think she has a website but she's a member of the Society of Scottish Artists). Her work was widely regarded as important and influential in her day; I believe she is now retired. If wikipedia decided to delete it then it would be a shame as the Thames and Hudon Encyclopedia of British Art has an entry for her.</li>

But the fact that it's 8 years in the future, unfunded, and technically more difficult than anything so far achieved means that it's speculation upon speculation. NASA does have a right to think this far ahead, but it's a fairly obvious step in the progress of space exploration that anyone could have come up with.

<li><b>Comment</b> Well there has not been anything definitive about an ESA/NASA joint mission, just individual missions by either. Thus I recommended it for deletion since it is--as Richardcavell said--"speculation upon speculation." Until NASA or ESA actually announce a joint sample return mission, I don't think we should have an article that definitely states it is one and it is in the works; furthermore, its launch schedule spans two decades... this simply doesn't merit an article in my opinion since there is nothing to work with EXCEPT speculation.

I want it to be merged with <a href="../../../e/x/p/Exploration_of_Mars_59ee.html" title="Exploration of Mars">Exploration of Mars</a> on the future missions section and to clean-up and make the information more acurrate.

<p>This cricket club competes in the third division of the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middlesex.html" title="Middlesex">Middlesex</a> county league, and is thus three levels below first-class cricket.

To be honest, the top non-league football teams are probably equivalent financially and at an organisational level with some first-class cricket teams. There is simply no comparison between cricket and football in the UK (note that I like the cricket and I'm not having a dig at it). <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 02:51, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

Given that a random high school has 1500 students to draw from, how is this more important than a high school cricket team. The claim to professionalism isn't necessarily that great - many sports teams pay $2000 for instance for a "star player" to play with them, but it isn't a full-time job, it's just to get a "relatively good" player. nn<a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen"><span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">ßlηguγΣη</span></a> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">Have your say!!!</a> - <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Blnguyen_21c3.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Blnguyen">review me</a> 05:18, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The argument is grossly misleading. Micklehurst Cricket Club is not in <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saddleworth.html" title="Saddleworth">Saddleworth</a>. To my knowledge it is the only cricket club based in the nearby town of <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mossley.html" title="Mossley">Mossley</a> (population 10,000 - significantly more than the 1500 cited). Also, there are other flaws to the above argument: No team draws from just an allocated number of cricket fans. As well as potentially being relevant to a certain number of local residents, the club is relevant to all with a recent or historic interest in the Saddleworth &amp; District Cricket League, at all age levels, as well as having relevance to all with an interest in the current Huddersfield Cricket League.<br />

It was the most extensive contract ever offered by Tooth &amp; Nail that I am aware of. They were on the Tooth &amp; Nail tour earlier this year, playing the U.S. from coast to coast. Tooth &amp; Nail chose to have Jonezetta play this tour before releasing an album, so by the time their first album is released, they will have a significant fan base. They HAVE recorded their freshman album. It is in post-production right now, as far as I know. It is to be released in August. My informed prediction is that there will be a significant need for this article by late 2006 and early 2007. I don't see the problem with having an article for an 'up-and-coming' band. There are thousands of bands on Wikipedia that I haven't heard of. People aren't concerned about bands they haven't heard of being on Wikipedia. They ARE, however, concerned about their favourite bands not having an article on Wikipedia. Kendrickjohnson

<p>I give up - you are too good for me.</p>
<p>I was the original writer of the article. It was all a hoax. Congratulations to the nerds that live and breathe on Wikipedia who solved the 'crime'; you have done well young padawans. However, there was <i>some</i> truth in the article - very disjointed, warped truth, but truth nonetheless. It took you months to figure it out though it was a shamble though!</p>
<p>I claim responsibility for the false signatures and the citied texts that were just picked at random so that you would have to look them up at a library. I can guarantee that I won't be wasting my time writing bogus articles again. I am constantly using Wikipedia for study so it would be appreciated if my IP wasn't blocked for this harmless joke, and I can quote users who claimed that debunking this was 'fun'.</p>
<p>Top notch work to the fellow who picked up on the Notlob/Bolton comparison.</p>

<p>There is evidence that the claim to having invented jeweled watches may be a hoax, without this claim the man is not notable. Owning a storefront is not notable. Inventing jeweled watches is. However, after a bit of Googling, I'm not sure if this isn't a hoax. There is nothing on Google to suggest that George Harbottle invented jeweled watches except for this Wikipedia article. The man himself <a href="http://www.cayuganet.org/forthill/harbottle/harbottle.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cayuganet.org/forthill/harbottle/harbottle.html" rel="nofollow">appears to be have been real</a>. However, there is no mention on that website of a son, George Jr. Further evidence... after perusing the article history, the claim that George Harbottle invented jeweled watches didn't get added until AFTER Fang Ai Li raised the question of notability. It's very possible that someone added it in order to deflect her challenge.--<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 08:21, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><s>*<b>Keep unless hoax demonstrated</b>;</s> <i>Vote changed to delete below</i> This may or may not be a hoax. There's certainly some specific detail (address etc) in the article, and three sources. It's certainly possible to prove/disprove the validity of the sources, at the least. I don't think this should be deleted without the three sources being checked, and I certainly appreciate <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoanneB_e69b.html" title="User:JoanneB">JoanneB</a>'s efforts in checking one of them (knowing which one may assist other editors). To quote the article:</p>

The article specifically makes the point that his contributions have been passed over and he does not have the general notability he deserves, so it's a bit disingenious to expect Google to be the arbiter of notability. NN not proven to my satisfaction. Of course, if it's a hoax, disregard my ramblings. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_e06e.html" title="User:Col tom">Colon</a><a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_Esperanza_bb00.html" title="User:Col tom/Esperanza"><font color="green">el</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_e06e.html" title="User:Col tom">Tom</a> 11:01, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><del><b>Keep unless hoax demonstrated</b></del>. (<i>Changed vote below</i>) First of all, as Tom says, the number of google hits should always be placed in context. For someone living today, 752 may not be a lot; for a man who died 129 years ago it's prima facie evidence of notability. Secondly, the man certainly was real; there's even a <a href="http://www.btp.police.uk/History%20Society/Publications/History%20Society/Crime%20on%20line/Rogue%20Gallery.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.btp.police.uk/History%20Society/Publications/History%20Society/Crime%20on%20line/Rogue%20Gallery.htm" rel="nofollow">mugshot</a> of his pickpocketing son. So it looks like this is a serious article; we cannot conclude it's a hoax unless all three sources have been checked... David Sneek 13:00, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Some <b>comments</b>:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The 752 (or in my latest search, 768) google hits are a bad indication of this person's notability. They consist of only 173 unique results. Even this would be alright, considering the context indeed, but please don't take that as 'prima fecie evidence': I've checked out the first 100 of those unique hits, and just 3 or so are about this George Harbottle, and the only information (other than the link to his grave) they give is that he once sold <a href="http://www.cyberattic.com/stores/NorthHill/items/488879/item488879cyberattic.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cyberattic.com/stores/NorthHill/items/488879/item488879cyberattic.html" rel="nofollow">this spoon</a>.</li>
<li>The fact that his grave is on the website David Sneek mentioned, proving that he exists, does not make him notable enough in itself: the question is, did he actually do the stuff he did according to the article (and that would make him notable), which we have not been able to establish any proof for so far.</li>
<li>One of the books that is offered as a 'source', <i>A New England? : Peace and War 1886-1918</i> is on Amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/019820714X" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/019820714X" rel="nofollow">here</a> with a 'search inside' function. The name 'Harbottle', however, yields no results. The other books that are listed as references sadly don't offer this.</li>
<li>Take a look at the article's talk page, especially at it's history. The discussion that is going on on the talk page, with several contributions from different people stating how notable he is, are mostly from the same (and one very similar) IP address. --<a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoanneB_e69b.html" title="User:JoanneB">Joann</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../j/o/a/User_talk%7EJoanneB_dae6.html" title="User talk:JoanneB">B</a> 14:09, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The above comment is problematic. (I was going to same something a bit more acerbic but my co-Esperanzan is watching so I guess I had best tone down the rhetoric.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>To illustrate, if I wrote "George Bush was arrested for driving in the nude while high on pot during his senior year at Yale" and provided the source as "Yale Daily News March 17, 1972", would you accept that as a reliable source? Why or why not? Most of us don't have access to the archives of the Yale Daily News although I'd bet there is are Wikipedians who are on the staff of the Yalie Daily. To prove or disprove the statement about George Bush, it's likely one of them would hunt this charge down.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Whose responsibility would it be to prove the credibility of the statement? What if I provided as a source "Notable Alumni of Yale" (assuming such a book existed) but didn't provide a page number?. Whose responsibility would it be to prove or disprove the credibility of my statement?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However, what if the statement was made about George Johnson, Class of 1974? (I made up the name and graduation year.) Then what? How would you prove or disprove the charge without the help of someone who has access to the Yalie Daily?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Getting back to the article in question, I would assert that the level of sourcing is insufficient especially in light of the information that use of jewels in watches predated the birth of the person in question.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now, in truth, this is an inherent problem with Wikipedia. The article in question doesn't cite page number so, even if I had a copy of each of the three sources, it would be an inordinately tedious task to verify that there was not a page somewhere in the three volumes that supported the claims in the article. Moreover, none of the cited sources are the kind that one could find in the typical public library so the bar for debunking the hoax is set unrealistically high. If this article is a hoax, the hoaxsters have framed the hoax in such a way that it is very difficult to debunk. If the hoaxsters are reading all this, they must be having a grand old time laughing at us and the time and effort they have made us waste attempting to debunk the hoax. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 02:27, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I've checked <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195116348/102-3292170-5761763?v=glance&amp;n=283155" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195116348/102-3292170-5761763?v=glance&amp;n=283155" rel="nofollow">the Gotham book</a> and there's no mention of Harbottle.<br /></li>
</ul>
<p><i>The story so far</i>. . . . . The article is created with facts matching a cemetery <a href="http://www.cayuganet.org/forthill/harbottle/harbottle.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cayuganet.org/forthill/harbottle/harbottle.html" rel="nofollow">website</a>, citing two books, one with no apparent ref to any Harbottle. A week later a son is added with a story about his deportation to England and a crime at Notlob. (If <a href="http://www.btp.police.uk/History%20Society/Publications/History%20Society/Crime%20on%20line/Rogue%20Gallery.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.btp.police.uk/History%20Society/Publications/History%20Society/Crime%20on%20line/Rogue%20Gallery.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a> is the man then he would have been 76 at the time.) A few months on and someone questions GH's notability. Notlob is changed to Bolton, and a claim that GH invented jewel gears in watches is added, even though this invention had existed for more than 100 years before his birth. The same editor removes the notability query tag. A week later and the deportation story is changed. Next a claim about George/georging/criminal slang is added (no support in <a href="../../../o/e/d/OED_54e7.html" title="OED">OED</a>). Another <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/019820714X/102-3292170-5761763" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/019820714X/102-3292170-5761763" rel="nofollow">book</a> is added to the references, again with no mention of Harbottle. During this later stage of editing, fake signatures supporting the claim to notability are added to the talk page . . . . . --<a href="../../../h/j/m/User%7EHJMG_daa3.html" title="User:HJMG">HJMG</a> 08:47, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Chuckle... I think we should create a new tag Template:Gift because I now see this article as such. This hoax has been nicely crafted so that the research required to debunk it can be seen as fun in a perverse sort of way. For example, has anybody noticed that "Notlob" is "Bolton" spelled backwards? It's almost as if we had an eccentric uncle laying out a puzzle for us to solve. Do we get a treat when we're done?</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, yes, I know it's really not the sort of thing we want happening in Wikipedia. Not that we can condone or encourage this kind of thing and we must, of course, delete the little beastie now but, at least, the hoaxsters have had their fun and hopefully so have we. Take it in stride, we've been had. Happy editing to you all. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 08:58, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> It's been a fascinating hoax, but I don't think we need to bother checking more sources. As HJMG's links show, Mr. H. did <i>not</i> invent jeweled watches. Apart from that, there is no claim to notability. David Sneek 10:12, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> And I call myself a Monty Python fan (re Bolton/Notlob). I had looked through the page changes, but not thoroughly enough, obviously. My thanks to all concerned for the effort taken in researching this. While I'm not in _complete_ agreement with your comments re onus of proof re verifiability, <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a>, you've given me food for thought. I can see that I've contributed to dragging this hoax out, and for that I apologise. Hopefully, I'll learn from this. And yes, it was fun; I was fooled. If notability can be comprehensively shown in future (which looks beyond probability at the moment), then recreate. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_e06e.html" title="User:Col tom">Colon</a><a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_Esperanza_bb00.html" title="User:Col tom/Esperanza"><font color="green">el</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_e06e.html" title="User:Col tom">Tom</a> 11:30, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The Das Ich article here lists him as a member from 1994-1999, a period that covers their first two studio albums, and the group's AMG entry name-checks him in the very first sentence: "With the Germanic vocals of Stefan Ackermann set to the electronic sounds of Bruno Kramm and Daniel Galda, Das Ich continues to reach out to an ever-growing audience with a diverse range of atmospheric textures." As such, I think it understates his importance to the group to say that he "briefly played keyboards". -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 20:15, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> A main project and its members may be notable, but how notable is a session musician? This article has been brought up not by merit but by grace. Allowing it refuge in Wikipedia would open a floodgate of stub information concerning band members and a deluge of session musicians.

<p>I hope the following comments may assist: Please delete the article asap. As you note the site on-line since 1997-98 is attracting linkspam. A blog has also been set up using the model's title. The matter of a domain name has been addressed. My apologies if this article is a cause of concern. The site was orignally (and remains) a call for research into Hodges' integrative approach. The model is [IMHO] important and deserves publicity, but given the model's status I now appreciate Wikipedia is not an appropriate outlet.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Would Wikipedia be better with or without this article? I'm confident that we're better off without. The article uses a lot of terminology from <a href="../../../d/y/n/Dynamical_system.html" title="Dynamical system">dynamical systems</a>, but in such a way that I, and even more importantly, editors like <a href="../../../x/a/o/User%7EXaosBits_0d97.html" title="User:XaosBits">User:XaosBits</a> whom I consider to be very knowledgeable on this subject, cannot understand them. There has been a lot of discussion about bios theory (see for instance <a href="../../../c/h/a/Talk%7EChaos_theory_5b43.html" title="Talk:Chaos theory">Talk:Chaos theory</a> and its archives), but it has not been possible to come to a clear explanation about what the main concepts (<i>novelty</i> and <i>bios</i>) mean. This makes the whole article unverifiable. I admit that this also makes it hard for me to judge the theory on its merits, and there are some papers published on this theory, but in my opinion these are too few and too new to make the theory notable. The combination of unverifiability (because it is unclear, despite lots of effort) and probably unnotability suffices for me to advocate deletion. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 12:15, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

Most other people just complained without trying to edit Bios theory, and actually tried to disaprove it, which is not the job of wikipedia editors. I don't think that because something is new it should be excluded from Wikipedia. Unclear does not mean unverifiable. Verifiable means that what is in the article can be found in the published papers. I understand that there are mathematicians here who like rigor a lot. However, Bios theory emerged from the social science oriented group, and people there do not use same rigor as do people in mathematics and physics. Bios theory has been published in <i>Nonlinear Dynamics, Psychology and the Life Sciences</i> among other journals. I think that it is arrogant to claim that people publishing in these journals are <i>pseudoscientists</i> just because they have different approach to science than <i>hard science</i> researchers. World is not just what <i>we</i> know. Knowledge is not just what <i>we</i> consider knowledge.<a href="../../../l/a/k/User%7ELakinekaki_88a8.html" title="User:Lakinekaki">Lakinekaki</a> 13:20, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Article is incoherent. Despite lengthly conversations with the page author (<a href="../../../l/a/k/User%7ELakinekaki_88a8.html" title="User:Lakinekaki">Lakinekaki</a>), a meaningful article was never arrived at. To rebut the above commentary: while lack of rigor may be acceptable in the social sciences, this article was making claims about mathematics and about medical science, where rigor is required. What I found particularly disturbing were claims made connecting bios theory to biological sciences, while demonstrating an utter (and willing!) ignorance of prior literature connecting chaos theory and the life sciences. I know damned little about such things, and was displeased to learn I knew more than the author. As to arrogance: this article and its author made the arrogant claim that bios theory was the king and leader of chaos theory, which was all the more galling given the protestations about rigor, clarity and hard science. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 14:20, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> Some users have claimed this to be gobbledegook, however we have at least 7 articles in peer review journals, 1 book published by a respectable publisher (World Scientific). One of the contributors to the theory is L. Kauffman, a notable mathematican who made important contribution to <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knot_polynomial.html" title="Knot polynomial">Knot theory</a> (see Kauffman's CV at <a href="http://www.math.uic.edu/~kauffman/LKVita.ps" class="external free" title="http://www.math.uic.edu/~kauffman/LKVita.ps" rel="nofollow">http://www.math.uic.edu/~kauffman/LKVita.ps</a> to verify that he had indeed contributed to this study). To me this seems like more protoscience than psuedoscience. Sabelli et al are trying to find metrics which can destinguish between the patterns in heart rate and purly chaotic systems. Their concept of novality is one attempt at a metric which does seem to detect some patterns. The article does require a lot of work. --<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalix_alba_9f89.html" title="User:Salix alba">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/l/User_talk%7ESalix_alba_982c.html" title="User talk:Salix alba">talk</a>) 14:36, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. Google hits are not a litmus test of notability. But it looks like this has been through several sorts of cleanup. A theory about brontosauruses or butterflies or ytterbium is one thing, and I might not presume to judge it nonsense because I did not understand it. A <i>theory about <b>"systems"</b></i> is another thing entirely, and when its explanation seems to involve strings of abstract Latinate nouns that never seem to touch the ground, I'm much less inclined to be charitable. I have very little tolerance for this kind of writing in business related articles.

Lazar has had a great deal of time to improve this article but despite long outstanding serious objections has made little improvement, and now he wants to ask for more time since he just discovered an error in the definition of the only bit (as he admits) where "bios theory" can claim some novelty, the so-called "novelty" (and even this is not so novel; I could give much earlier citations of similar notions). Wikipedia users should not write articles on very obscure theories to which they have contributed and then try to "correct" their own paper after other WP users point out serious defects!

<dd>Kindly be advised that a global open content encyclopedia like this must (as things now stand) be taken with a grain of salt. It should be used as a way to get a sense of the subject, and as a resource for other resources. As for deleting this article: There is a process involved with it, which is working. It will take several more days before enough time will have elpased and the admins will rules on this request. This page will then be removed (as there is a consensus to do so). However, each AfD action needs to be ruled on individually, as there have been cases of deletion being requested for individual articles. (Note however that if this page reappears quickly that it can be speedily re-deleted.) --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 19:06, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>; There's an impassioned (and out-of-place) preface to the article stating, if I may summarise, that Folk bands are unique in that their importance cannot be crudely determined by the standards wikipedia requires. Having played in 2 folk bands and with many folk musicians (none of whom are worthy of an article here, obviously including myself), it is my considered opinion that <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> / <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> applies to folk bands just as much as it applies to other forms of music. This notability hasn't been asserted or implied in the article, and Google returns me no hits related to the band that I can see. I certainly wouldn't question the impact the band may have on their dedicated audience, but that impact alone does not make any band worthy of a encyclopedia article. (I love the song of the same name, by the way.) <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_e06e.html" title="User:Col tom">Colon</a><a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_Esperanza_bb00.html" title="User:Col tom/Esperanza"><font color="green">el</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7ECol_tom_e06e.html" title="User:Col tom">Tom</a> 11:27, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>; following Col. Tom's cogent comments, I'm a folkie myself. That being said, the concept of notability embodies notability to the world at large. A practitioner of an art form doesn't automatically become notable just because few people care about the art form.

Rabbi <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berel_Wein_8718.html" title="Berel Wein">Berel Wein</a> is unquestionably one of the world's best known <a href="../../../o/r/t/Category%7EOrthodox_rabbis_e855.html" title="Category:Orthodox rabbis">Orthodox rabbis</a>. The reason there are commercial links attached to his name is that he is an international lecturer and celebrity (doesn't Madonna have commercial links?), he has written many books, and he is sought out by many people for his popular tapes and CDs. He had an important career and history as a noted rabbi and <a href="../../../y/e/s/Yeshiva.html" title="Yeshiva">yeshiva</a> dean not related to his later commercial successes. This vote is uncalled for and the nominator obviously knows less than nothing about the subject of the article and its related content.

<li><b>Keep</b> Obviously Rabbi Wein is a well-known man, and having information on this website is helpful to people who want information on everything. The fact that a Google search would turn up "commercial" results speaks to the fact that Rabbi Wein is <b>contemporary</b>: his writings are just coming out.

<li>(A) First of all, <b>justified afd</b>. I'd like everyone to take a step back and pretend that this Rabbi (who I've never heard of living in Israel) was someone else, perhaps another clergy from another religion. Would the article, written as it is, be acceptable, credible, and justified to pass afd? I've seen other similarly 'famous' people and organizations deleted. (B) <b>If</b> someone is not going to take the time to fix up the article in the very near future, then <b>delete</b>. 1) We have no evidence of 5000 books written, 2) "<i>There, he founded a synagogue, and later, a Yeshiva, which he ran for 20 years</i>" names please?, 3) "VERY notable", "well-known"? Please add external links to non-puff articles written about him to prove this. (C) The unilateral removal of the afd tag is very suspicious of that editor's intentions. You can't have it both ways, this is a world encyclopedia, not some private tribe initiative. If this Rabbi Wein is so famous and well-known, then leaving this article as is and just slapping an 'expand' tag on it for 'someone' else to do the work eventually, does no justice to wikipedia or Rabbi Wein.

<li>Shuki: Rabbi Berel Wein is famous in the English-speaking Orthodox world, he made <a href="../../../a/l/i/Aliyah.html" title="Aliyah">aliyah</a> about ten years ago, and in Israel he spends most of his time writing English Torah books and articles as well as lecturing at the English-speaking baal teshuvah yeshivas, so maybe that is why you have not heard of him (though it's hard to imagine that someone who writes English as well as you do should not have heard of Berel Wein?) Your suggestion, actually more of a THREAT, that: "If someone is not going to take the time to fix up the article in the very near future, then delete" is utterly ridiculous because that is NOT the way we do business on Wikipedia! (See my comments below). No-one said that he had "written" 5,000 books! Read what Jon said above: "having over 5000 book <b>distributed</b>" (don't you read and understand English?) In fact that is a very low figure because I would estimate that probably it's more like 50,000 or 100,000 of Rabbi Wein's -- probably more. He has his own publishing house called <i>Shaar Press</i> as well that works with <a href="../../../a/r/t/ArtScroll_4e91.html" title="ArtScroll">ArtScroll</a>. The name of the yeshivah he founded, which is still ongoing, is Yeshiva Shaarei Torah of Rockland and his synagogue was Congregation Bais Torah of Suffern, New York <a href="http://www.613.org/speakers/wein.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.613.org/speakers/wein.html" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> No-one said the article was perfect, but that alone is NEVER a reason to delete it, and anything similar on Wikipedia, where editors invarioubly come along and improve factually correct articles (hopefully!) <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 10:39, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I now see that it was perhaps an error for me not to check on Amazon first, but not knowing much about Judaism, it seemed highly suspicious to have someone who ran "a Yeshiva" (no name) for 20 years. I can point out a number of figured who will come up with many links but about whom we don't have an article. That being said, it is hardly vandalism to verify whether the contents of an article do indeed merit inclusion on Wikipedia, and what better way to do that than put it on an AfD where people who might know more about the subject might actually see it and comment rather than slapping a {{NPOV}} and {{cleanup}} template on and waiting for someone to <i>perhaos</i> come across it. <a href="../../../p/z/f/User%7EPZFUN_b231.html" title="User:PZFUN"><b><font color="#000000">Páll</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/z/f/User_talk%7EPZFUN_5839.html" title="User talk:PZFUN"><font color="#FF66CC">(<b>Die&#160;pienk&#160;olifant</b>)</font></a></sup> 17:33, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - Err ... what's suspicious about running a yeshiva (which is nothing more offbeat than a religious school) for twenty years? I agree it's hardly vandalism to verify whether the contents of an article merit inclusion -- I do it all the time -- but disagree that advocating the deletion of an article is superior to basic fact checking, and disagree strongly that filing an AfD is a good way to improve articles. For my part, I can't see how an argument like "looks like a vanity project" trumps a lack of proper sourcing. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 18:09, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't think it's suspicious to run a yeshiva, but maybe the problem is that the article failed to identify the yeshiva by name so the fact could be verified.

<li>PZFUN: Apology accepted, but a serious question remains about your methodology concerning the best way to "clean up" poorly written articles. In over three years of editing Wikipedia articles I have <i>never</i> heard <i>your rationale</i> that: "put it on an AfD where people who might know more about the subject might actually see it and comment rather than slapping a {{NPOV}} and {{cleanup}} template on and waiting for someone to <i>perhaos</i> come across it." HUH?! Where did you get such a weird idea from? And you are an admin yet? If you really believe that, then I suggest you stop doin such things right now, <i>before</i> you cause more harm than you may realize. Do you have any idea how Wikipedia started? There were mostly poorly written articles on NOTABLE subjects that were improved over time -- meaning YEARS! Nobody needs you to do "shock therapy" and cause chaos to get other editors' attention. You will only get yourself in more trouble, and complaints filed against you for being a ROGUE ADMIN! Kindly take a few steps back next time, and let this episode be a hard-learned lesson to you. Here's a simple rule for you: When in DOUBT (especially when you know that you know nothing about a subject) please consult other earlier edititors of articles. You could have consulted others who had contributed to the Berel Wein article and this mess could have been avoided.<a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 10:21, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>I've only been on wp for six months, and in that short time, I have NEVER, EVER seen such a public chastisement of a fellow wp contributor, which IMO was totally uncalled for especially following an apology. IZAK, your claim that people shouldn't mess with subjects they don't understand is so lame and poor at the same time, irresponsible too. There is absolutely <b>no reason</b> to prevent other editors from wanting the improve the wp project in general and not just stick to 'goyish' things they know about. I've seen many, many improvements to Jewish articles made by goyim, baruch hashem they don't think like you. I would have liked to place this comment on your page, but after rereading your relentless 13 line undressing of PZFUN, I couldn't let that pass while his blood was spilt. Vandals even get more respect from the community. You had absolutely <b>no right</b> to continue past the third line of that comment in this forum and should have taken it 'offline' with PZFUN on his talk page, for his public kavod, for wp standards of relevance to article talk page, and to this hillul hashem of a dressing down. Who are you to tell others to "take a few steps back"? <i>Rogue admin</i>?! Is this how Rabbi Wein would have reacted? --<a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShuki_ea5a.html" title="User:Shuki">Shuki</a> 21:45, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Shuki: First of all I don't need <i><a href="../../../m/u/s/Mussar.html" title="Mussar">mussar</a></i> from you. <i>You</i> are now the one who is introducing the detestable word "<a href="../../../g/o/y/Goy.html" title="Goy">goyim</a>" (which some regard as a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_ethnic_slurs.html#G" title="List of ethnic slurs">slur</a>) and in your florrid imagination ("I couldn't let that pass while his blood was spilt"???) you are interpreting and attributing words to me that I neither said nor meant, so cool it. I get along well with many editors (as long as they are not obvious <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">anti-Semites</a>). But you fail to address and realize the radical departure from Wikipedia editing policy that User:PZFUN was openly advocating and which I was vehemently objecting to, namely, that he thinks it's ok to tag articles <i>written</i> in a sub-par fashion with VfD tags to get the "attention" of other editors instead of sticking to the accepted conventional and required "article needs improvement" tags. This is something that is dangerous to all of Wikipedia not just Judaic subjects because it would seriously harm the development of articles about important subjects that very often are started in a very amateurish way, but which do improve with time (it sometimes takes years). But what User:PZFUN openly advocates, and he chose to illustrate this with the Berel Wein article (I dunno, maybe he thought no-one was looking...), is to "throw a bomb" at the article and have it voted out, in a rather inept way, as I have already explained. So save your misguided and pathetic "righteous rage" for a better cause because as far as I am concerned, any intelligent editor, especially an admin, should know better. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 12:25, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>It is not clear why Striver created this article, since all the events in it have already been exhaustively covered in <a href="../../../s/a/q/Saqifah.html" title="Saqifah">Saqifah</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/c/Succession_to_Muhammad_f25d.html" title="Succession to Muhammad">Succession to Muhammad</a>. Both those articles pay a great deal of attention to the Shi'a view of things and give many links and quotes. All that is gained by having a "Shi'a view of the meeting at Saqifah" article is the opportunity for one Shi'a to state his views at great length without having to face any criticism.

<li><b>Keep</b> I created this article to detail the Shi'a view of the event. It is in no way covered in this detail and depth, not in the main article, and not in the <a href="../../../s/u/c/Succession_to_Muhammad_f25d.html" title="Succession to Muhammad">Succession to Muhammad</a> article. Neither of those articles desribe how the Shi'a portray where the the people where, what they did, and why they did that, and we all know that Shi'a have a different presentation of this particular event, as well as other event, compared to Sunnis. "Without having to face any criticism" is incorrect, articles describing a patricular viewpoint have always a "criticism" sections to them, see for example <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html#Criticism" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11_conspiracy_theories#Criticism</a>, a spin out article created to present a minority view in detail, and it has a large Criticism section.

<dd>If Striver really wants to know about the aborted expedition of Usama ibn Zayd, I can consult Ibn Ishaq and Tabari and give some references. But he didn't ask for more info, or make any attempt to improve the quality of the two existing articles. He just made the breakout article. IMHO, breakout articles should "bud" off established articles. When a section is getting extremely long and argumentative, and threatens to unbalance the entire article, then you say, "OK, let's make this a breakout article" and everyone says, "Yes, that makes sense" and it is done. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 20:00, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The title isn't really the problem. One could have articles like <i>Catholic views of the <a href="../../../e/u/c/Eucharist.html" title="Eucharist">Eucharist</a></i>, <i>Protestant views of the <a href="../../../e/u/c/Eucharist.html" title="Eucharist">Eucharist</a></i>, <i>Orthodox views of the <a href="../../../e/u/c/Eucharist.html" title="Eucharist">Eucharist</a></i> and so on if the main article on the <a href="../../../e/u/c/Eucharist.html" title="Eucharist">Eucharist</a> had gotten too large and unwieldy to include all the denominations and their interpretation of the rite. Indeed we have such articles. This case here is different, however. Someone split off from an article to present <i>his</i> and <i>his own</i> viewpoint of history. Such behavior makes it impossible to police articles for correctness and impartiality. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zak_7805.html" title="User:Dr Zak">Dr Zak</a> 02:28, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This info was in fact in the main articl, see here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Saqifah&amp;diff=22073925&amp;oldid=22065443" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Saqifah&amp;diff=22073925&amp;oldid=22065443" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>.

<p>Another thing, this event is not some random event, the "George Bush to one about the president of a high school science club", this is the MAIN event that caused the Shi'a-Sunni split, so it fully natural that Shi'a and Sunnis have widely different views of the event. If you look through it, you will se that the article is well sourced from Shi'a sources, and also Sunni sources that Shi'a have drawn other conclusions from. And no Zora, im not talking about Usamas expedition, im talking about the entire event, such as why did abu Bakr not inform anyone, why did Umar inform Abu Bakr in secret, why was a grave digger following them and such. This point of views are some times not even recoqnized as factual by Sunnis. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 18:31, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Again, i strongly reject and feel insulted by Zoras <i>"the opportunity for <b>one</b> Shi'a to state his views at great length"</i>, specialy since i have heavily sourced most, if not all statments in the article. This is NOT only my view, all sources i included show that this is the offical Shi'a view. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 18:34, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Shi'a POV is well-represented in the <a href="../../../s/a/q/Saqifah.html" title="Saqifah">Saqifah</a> article. Including Abu Bakr's failure to tell Ali about the meeting. Striver, if you want Umar telling Abu Bakr secretly, it can go in there, but you're going to have to reference it. That part isn't in Ibn Ishaq and I don't have the relevant volume of Tabari. The bit re "gravedigger" is neither in the main article NOR in Striver's article, so it's bizarre that you're claiming that the omission of this factoid/rumor/whatever is a fault in the main article. As for much of the other material you've included in your version of Saqifah -- it's not covered in the Saqifah article because it's covered elsewhere.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Striver IS creating a parallel Shi'apedia full of badly-written, sub-standard articles. Here are the currently existing articles that start with "Shi'a view of ...":</dd>

<p>In none of these cases were the articles created by an organic budding. They are Striver creations and to a great extent, they remain Striver's private domain.

<dd>Here is the difference:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Main article:
<dl>
<dd><i>It is no accident, the Shi'a claim, that the meeting at the saqifah happened while Ali, Fatima, and Muhammad's immediate kin were preparing his body for burial. Abu Bakr and Umar left without notifying Ali of the meeting. This was a deliberate ploy to cut Ali out of the deliberations.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Shi'a view of article</i>
<dl>
<dd><i>While Umar and Abu Bakr where in Muhammad house, a Ansar called out Umar personaly and informed him of the meeting in the shed of Banu Sa'ida. Umar called out Abu Bakr and informed only him about it. Shia believe this to be another proof of the complicity. Umar and Abu Bakr left for the meeting without mentioned it to the Banu Hashim or anybody else present in Muhammads house, and instead left them to tend for Muhammads body. Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah joined them on the way while they were going to the meeting.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Shia also point out that Umars desicion to abandon the funeral preparations and walking to a political meating does not support the notion that he was emotionaly devatated to the point of derangment a few moments ago [12].</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The main article version is only a summary, it omitts the details of the Shi'a view, that first Umar was called out, then he called out Abu Bakr. it Also does not mention about Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah, the grave digger. It neither comments on the Shi'a view of Umars action, that Shi'a view this as proof of his earlier grief being a charade. The reference is <a href="http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/saqifa/en/chap3.php" class="external text" title="http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/saqifa/en/chap3.php" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The Shi'a have a lot to say about the matter, just see here <a href="http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/saqifa/en/chap1.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/saqifa/en/chap1.php" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> <a href="http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/saqifa/en/chap2.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/saqifa/en/chap2.php" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> <a href="http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/saqifa/en/chap3.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/saqifa/en/chap3.php" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> <a href="http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/saqifa/en/chap4.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/saqifa/en/chap4.php" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> <a href="http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/saqifa/en/chap5.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/saqifa/en/chap5.php" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> <a href="http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/saqifa/en/chap6.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/saqifa/en/chap6.php" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> <a href="http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/saqifa/en/chap7.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/saqifa/en/chap7.php" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>. This kind of information , even one tenth of it, can not fitt into the main article without getting undue weight. Its not only about Umar on that moment, its about all the details that the Shi'a view article has, that is not present in the main article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The articles i have created are celebreated by the other Shi'a editors, they have given me awards for it. That proves that Shi'a view those articles as doing a good job at represening the Shi'a view accuratly. It is only to bad that we dont have more Shi'a editors that can put up articles about the Shi'a view of events. Whenever there are widely different views on the matter, wikipedia dictats that sub articles are to be created to deal with each one in detail, i have already mentioned Jesus, see also <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moses.html" title="Moses">Moses</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musa_%28prophet%29.html" title="Musa (prophet)">Musa (prophet)</a>. There are many articles of the "Shia view of" since Shi'a dissagree with the Sunni view on many aspects, and hence they have their own article to not dominate the main. Just from the answering-ansar links i just gave, it can be easly seen that this article is higly debated. The same is true for the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27a_view_of_Umar_bcd7.html" title="Shi'a view of Umar">Shi'a view of Umar</a>, all that information can not be put into <a href="../../../u/m/a/Umar.html" title="Umar">Umar</a> without giving it undue weight. See <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Islam%7EThe_Shia_Guild_4ca8.html#Shia_views_of..." title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Islam:The Shia Guild">here</a> for Wikipedia policies about that: Im sorry if my english is not perfect, but as my awards show, its better than not having the articles in the first place. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 21:07, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As can be seen, there are "Christian views of" articles for all the controversial subjects. The Sahaba, ie Abu Bakr, Abu Huraira, Ali and such <i><b>are</b></i> very controversial in the Shi'a-Sunni world. So is the Saqifah event. It is true that i am the one writing most of the Shi'a articles, but that is not due to me not geting along with the other Shi'a editors, its due to the simple fact that i am the <b>only</b> active Shi'a editor. And hence, its natural that me, the only active Shi'a editor, created most of the articles. I really wish there where more active Shi'a editors, and i am sorry i dont have a better expertice of the english language. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 21:17, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> Normally in such a case I would agree w/Striver's logic - but this article is so intrinsically linked to the whole Sunni/Shi'a issue that these POV's should both be covered in same article, otherwise it would be a POV Fork.<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBridesmill_4b81.html" title="User:Bridesmill">Bridesmill</a> 00:17, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Im all for having the Shi'a pov in the main article, but as soon as Zora starts deleting info saying its nonsense or it unbalances the article or other such things, ill readd them to the break out. i dont really care where the info is, just that it is there. As i showed, i had it on the main article to start with, but it was deleted for being to long, so it needed a break out article. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 01:12, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Even Zora keeps professing that all POVs should be always covered. And 2 years of experience on WP editing has shown me, striver, <i>and Zora</i>, that it is impossible to keep the Shia, Sunni, and what Zora calls "academic" view of things peacefully under one article. Sooner or later, one version will start forcefully eclipsing the other versions as being "factual", expanding the article out of proportions, and subsequently causing the trimming of the article at the expense of one version or the other. It has happened 150 times on these Shia articles, and Zora is always the party involved. Therefore it is totally reasonable to have seperate articles for each view, and then link them to one another. That way, the peace is kept, and all versions are fully presented. If there are overlaps, all the better. They would only illustrate that the Sunni vs Shia views do share many commonalities. Besides, how would you truly claim to know about Islamic idea, history, and culture if you refuse to acknowledge the views of Sunnis and Shias each. Youll just be missing out on the information, or to put it better: <i>deleting yourself from knowing this information</i>. Or perhaps, the Shia view is merely intended to be silenced? Why else make such efforts to delete information? Ive always said <i>deleting information is always a bad idea. Let the reader judge which view is the correct "factual" view.</i>--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 14:28, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Striver, if you feel the main article is not NPOV, then collaborative editing, not creating your own sub-article, is the solution. Yes, I know just how frustrating that gets, but these kinds of forks, in my opinion, are detrimental to Wikipedia's procedure of acheiving NPOV articles through collaboration. Two POV articles on a subject are worth far less than one NPOV one. In other words - this is information that, to the extent that it's verifiable, should go into the main article. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 02:50, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Bro, you say that both versions are POV. I do not agree that either version is Pov, i did not creat this since the main article is pov. I created this since the main article did not represent the Shi'a view in a detailed enough maner. And it can not do it witout giving it undue weight. I agree that two POV articles is a horrible way to solve something, howver, i do not agree that either article is pov, rather that it reports <i>about</i> different POVs.

<dd>In my opinion, they <i>are</i> POV forks. The information in those articles is largely redundant with <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> and should be merged. If this causes <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> to become overlong, forks should be based on content (e.g. <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chronology_of_Jesus_5961.html" title="Chronology of Jesus">Chronology of Jesus</a>) and not on POV, which simply encourages one-sided editing. Jews should be contributing to editing <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> - they should not abandon that artice in favor of working on <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_view_of_Jesus_e834.html" title="Jewish view of Jesus">Jewish view of Jesus</a>. That would present us with two substandard articles.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. According to Wikipedia precedence, we keep dorm buildings <a href="../../../s/a/u/Saugeen-Maitland_Hall_2602.html#The_Saugeen_Stripper" title="Saugeen-Maitland Hall">if some girl got caught on photo performing a striptease there</a>. In the absence of any releant evidence of that I was about to vote delete. Personally, I'd be willing to keep a dorm if it had an interesting history or some architecture of note, but this one seems to fail on those grounds as well. However, with 3,000 rooms in 30 blocks, this is pretty large - a whole neighbourhood rather than a single building. It would have been kept if it had been a village. And I also think I have seen much less notable American dorms around here, so it gets a few additional keep-points to counter systemic bias. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 21:07, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The existence or nonexistence of air conditioning and private bathrooms in a college dormitory is not encyclopedic material.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is not because I am the one creating this article. PGPR is the largest student residence in NUS, occupying a significant percentage of the total area of 2km<sup>2</sup> of NUS. It can be considered to be a university village, as students can find most of the things they need in PGPR. Furthermore, the wikipedia article on <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_University_of_Singapore_dbde.html" title="National University of Singapore">NUS</a> has links to this article, as well as to articles on other NUS' student residences, which are definitely not as large as PGPR.

<li>Although I think the article needs to be edited and/or re-written i do not think it should be deleted. It comes off too much like a fan article on Madonna but there is some truth to the idea of this style/genre catching on. There is a remix by DJ Eddie Baez for Oakenfold featuring Brittany Murphy "Faster Kill Pussycat" that is titled "Eddie Baez's Future Disco Mix." This may very well be a genre of dance catching on. I don't think the article should be deleted, just edited. MJWMikeinrdgpaMJW</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Yeeesh, that's a bad article. Looks just like a second article for the Madonna album. No one refers to this as a real genre. The "style" is prevelent in the dance music community, but no one calls it "future disco". Sounds like a description Madonna may have used once during an interview if the interviewer happened to ask "so how would you describe the album in one word?" -- <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricorbit_f0c3.html" title="User:Ericorbit">eo</a> 02:22, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>You hit the nail right on the head. Madonna was asked how to describe the sound of her album and she dubbed it "future-disco." If anything there should be an article as a sub-genre of dance called "Nu-Disco." This style of dance has been around since the late 90's and some notable examples are Stardust "Music Sounds Better With You", Modjo "Lady (Hear Me Tonight)" and DJ Spiller "Groove Jet(If this Ain't Love)." Perhaps an article should be done on Nu-Disco with a mention of Future-Disco being another term for the genre. Just an idea. &#160;:-) MJWMikeinrdgpaMJW</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> If you're looking for cites, that's easy. Just do a Google search.

They all cite Badran as the author of the blog following Michael Young, who knows Badran personally. Finally there is a citation by Badran himself in a research article he published in Mideast Monitor in February, available online, where he identifies himself in the byline as the author of the blog. Just by way of example. 15:29, 15 May, 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I have expanded this AfD to include all four of the 8-Bit Theater main characters. The <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_of_8-Bit_Theater_c900.html" title="Characters of 8-Bit Theater">Characters of 8-Bit Theater</a> article has been ballooning for quite some time, and apparently has spilled over into these new articles. That wasn't the proper response. The characters article should have been pared down instead. We're writing encyclopedia articles here, not Cliff's Notes. I can't think of any instance where an individual webconic character merits its own article.

<li><b>Comment</b> I am not entirely opposed to two separate 8-Bit Theater characters articles — one for the light warriors and the other for minor characters — but I'd prefer it if the contributors of the Characters article instead exercise some discipline. Contrary to what you may think, an exhaustive article covering fine details is <i>not</i> ideal. Unless you're already a fan, just reading an article like that is a real slog, let alone trying to keep it proofread, verifiable, and appropriate in tone. If an article can <i>only</i> be managed by dedicated fans, it is not useful.

<p>This was a disputed prod. The editor who removed the prod without comment doesn't seem willing to engage in discussion. I've given my reasons on the talk page in hopes of getting the article to improve, but there's been no response. Anyway, the reason I suggest deleting is that there are no sources and no indication of significance for this website, and the alexa ranking shows no data whatsoever. This seems to fall far short of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, and if no reputable third-party sources are talking about this, we can't do much with it either. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 14:39, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> While I appreciate the NN suggestion, the above suggests to me that an important criterion is that the proposer simply didn't find the comic funny and hence not worth propagating. This is possibly the only difference between the aCaaL comic and other, Wikipedia-featured, web comics. There is a following for the web comic, albeit not a huge one. Also, it is clear that Google does not find all related webpages, as the missing link to <a href="http://www.harpingchipmunk.me.uk/chipmunk-lizard.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.harpingchipmunk.me.uk/chipmunk-lizard.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.harpingchipmunk.me.uk/chipmunk-lizard.shtml</a> exemplifies.

<dd>I commend to you the words "That aside." There are a lot of painfully unfunny comics out there (anyone laughed at Family Circus this decade?) that are notable by way of circulation and verifiability. This one fails; if Google didn't find all the related webpages of one webcomic, it would logically not find those of ones far more notable.

<li><b>Comment</b> Hi, I'm Jonathan, one of the creators of the strip. I understand the grounds cited for deletion (except that the strip isn't <i>always</i> lame). But if it counts for anything, my partner and I have been posting the strip every weekday for four years now, we have a readership, and we are committed to keeping the strip going. If you need to delete it now, I'm hopeful that one day a Wikipedia entry will be warranted (i.e., the strip will be more widely known). When we stumbled upon the entry last night, we just thought it was nice that <a href="../../../w/a/c/User%7EWack%27d_About_Wiki_b3f0.html" title="User:Wack'd About Wiki">Wack'd About Wiki</a> had written up something about the strip. (I see now that some additional notes were added by another attentive reader for us to thank.) (Sorry about the "ballot-stuffing" scare. We thought it was neat that someone put us on Wikipedia and wanted to tell our readers. When we saw there was a little controversy this morning about it, we amended the note to tell them that it might not be here forever.) JTh 20:01, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Jonathan here again. Obviously, we hope the article might be allowed to remain to stay, though we realize this is looking unlikely. Watching this discussion has been a little rough and there are a few things I wanted to get across:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>--I want to make sure it is understood that my partner and I are not the Authors of the Article.</dd>
<dd>--I want also to apologize for having edited the Article, as a related party. I did feel a little funny about it after I saved my changes. (I went in to fix some spellings and clarify the identification of the masks two of the characters wear.)</dd>
<dd>--It was a coincidence that I found the Article in the first place, a few days after it was posted. I was at <a href="../../../a/c/h/Achewood.html" title="Achewood">Achewood</a> for the first time in a while and clicked their link into Wikipedia. While I was in Wikipedia, I thought I'd check to see if anyone had done anything about our humble strip. It was a lot of fun to find out someone had, but in light of what has followed, I might rather it had come and gone without my knowing about it.</dd>
<dd>--Sorry the Author hasn't been back to defend his putting it up; 11-year-olds are pretty busy people, I guess. 8^)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Sorry, Jon, it's not that I'm busy, Wikipedia has been down at my house and as we speak I'm using recess time to defend the article from AfD. This is my favorite strip, it has a following, and I didn't know about Google, try Yahoo and you might find it's more...acurate. I'm find a way to keep the article. Heck, I've already came up with a solution! --<a href="../../../w/a/c/User%7EWack%27d_About_Wiki_b3f0.html" title="User:Wack'd About Wiki">Wack'd About Wiki</a> 15:50, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>--We get the most visitors on our page on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and I would have been curious to see what contributions may have been made to the article if it were still there by then. Maybe none, but it would have been fun to see how a Chipmunk and a Lizard article might have evolved in the community environment of Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>--We don't have the hugest readership, but we do have a following. It's not the worst-looking strip, either, and it's in for the long haul. So it just seemed to us like the kind of cultural artifact that would be included in the world's largest encyclopedia. That's why I feel a little confused and a little chagrined by the discussion. But as I said before, if the Article is dropped now, I'm hopeful its return will be warranted sometime in the future.</dd>
<dd>Anyhow, thanks for reading.. JTh 02:03, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't really understand what reason there could be for deleting this article. It describes a current work of fiction in a clear and straightforward way. The work it describes is an honest and sincere human expression. Neither the article nor the work it describes is self-serving or vainglorious in any way. A wonder of Wikipedia is that it can catalog our culture with unprecedented breadth. The comments about how the work has not yet caught on with a large number of people seem beside the point. What matters is that the article describes a legitimate bit of the world.VtPerry 22:13, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - The reasons are founded in that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia with narrowly defined pertinent entry criteria: verifiability and notability. The clarity of the subject's prose has nothing to do with it, nor does the putative honesty or sincerity of the expression therein, nor the level of (or lack of) vainglory, That the work has not caught on with a large number of people is <i>exactly</i> the point. The most idiotic, meretricious and slovenly artwork imaginable, fit only for subhumans, merits articles as long as enough people care about it. <i>That's</i> what matters here. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 22:56, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>OK, I will delete this article. But any information on this theory will NEVER appear on wikipedia. I am the author of this book, and I was an undercover agent of the Defense Intelligence Agency. I used to design next-generation weapons for them. If anybody will ever try to refer to my theory in Wikipedia, you have given me the mood and the reason to DEMAND deletion of all info concerning this theory and this book. Boys, I am a weapon designer, I know how to be bloodthirsty! No to Wikipedia. --Orchard-garden 19:45, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

Can I start articles here about Tree blogging, Shrub blogging, Plant blogging and Forest blogging (the latter two of which just say "see Tree Blogging")? <b><span style="color: #f33">·<a href="../../../r/o/d/User_talk%7ERodii_6c72.html" title="User talk:Rodii"><span style="color: #669">&#160;rodii&#160;</span></a>·</span></b> 16:43, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - This is not listcruft. Actually, the article can be more than just a list of characters, it can contain info about Women in Dragon Ball, that's a notable subject. More, if we have lists of Namekians and things like that, this one is also valid. At least the content of all that lists could be merged into a main article, but never deleted. Currently, the main article is just a list of links to other lists, therefore, deleting them would be disruptive. Along with that, the nomination doesn't state any good reasons, it seems more like a personal opinion on the subject. I'm not saying that this is the better way to list the characters, I'm just saying that I find no good reason to delete it. <a href="../../../a/f/o/User%7EAfonso_Silva_8531.html" title="User:Afonso Silva">Afonso Silva</a> 00:03, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - how could this or any of the lists be useful? "I'm bored -- I wonder who's a Hindu?"

That said, I <b>abstain</b> from voting on this one as I feel it's an issue that needs to be addressed at the policy level, not AFD.

Hi, maybe I had the wrong wording for this as it does not constitute an original research. I was in the process of finishing the article first so it could be linked to (if you've noticed it was not) ans sources were not mentioned (it is based on RSSSF Brazil statistics). The aim of the article was to propose first the overall placing of clubs in that period (something which is not available anywhere AFAIK, especially by CBF) accordeing to these sources and a ranking sytem largely based on the official cbf rules. There may be minor tweaks but the idea was to propose a consensual solution and not an original research. Please could you recommend how to do this in wikipedia policy. <a href="../../../m/p/b/User%7EMpbb_1631.html" title="User:Mpbb">Mpbb</a> 18:59, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Vast, close to unmaintainable, has the potential to be even vaster - India is, after all, the second most populous nation on Earth, accounting for - what, 15% of the entire population of the world?

It seems unlikely to me that Wikipedia has articles on all the notable Indians that exist or have existed.

<dd>Dresses and skirts are two different garments. Besides, they're Western terms. Wiki is global, and there are more than 70 different terms which specifically describe various countries' MUGs. You gotta admit, the acronym MUG is a lot easier than spelling out "skirt-like garment" or "dress-like garment" when describing fustanella or thobes. And calling a fustanalla a "skirt" is an insult to the Turkish! The acronym MUG was developed in the 90s to accurately describe all unbifurcated garments worn by males, hence, male unbifurcated garment, or as it's commenly used, "MUG.'

<li><b>Response</b> Go to the Fashion Freedom entry and follow the links - you'll see that it's certainly a notable movement. At least 70 Million people worldwide actively participate in pushing fashion trends towards freedom. That's notable. Regardless, those in the fashion freedom movement comprise but a small fraction of men who wear MUGs. Approximately 40% of all men around the world wear "MUGs," and calling them "skirts" when they're not skirts, or "kilts" when they're not kilts is inappropriate. MUGs is an acronym, one that's been in use for <i><b>decades</b></i>. Although the term may not have the exposure of "Hip-Hop," it's been in use longer! <a href="../../../d/r/1/User%7EDr1819_2d7a.html" title="User:Dr1819">Dr1819</a> 19:14, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response'</b> Google counts the number of Internet hits, which for "hip-hop" was about 205 Million. Compare that to the 1.4 Billion men who wear MUGs throughout the world, and the many Millions of Google hits given above for MUGs, which is very significant. Since your Googling skills are obviously rusty, try this: Add an "s" to the end, as in "male unbifurcated garments," you get 8,710 hits. Using "MUG" and "skirt" yields 650,000 hits, with the plural of MUGS and skirt yielding 347,000 hits. And "MUGs" and "kilt" yielded 174,000 hits. So again, what's your point about some "441 Google hits?" My question to you (still unanswered, I see), is "hard did you work to find the right combination that yielded the least amount of hits?" <a href="../../../d/r/1/User%7EDr1819_2d7a.html" title="User:Dr1819">Dr1819</a> 19:14, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> While using the number of Google hits to judge a topic's relevance has some <i>slight</i> value, it's a very poor indicator for one simple reason - it measures the frequency that a particular topic has on the web, not the quality or relevance of that information to human society. For example, "nuclear power" generated just 43.8 Million hits, less than 1/4 that of hip-hop, but if hip-hop died tomorrow, we'd be none the worse for wear. By contrast, if nuclear power died tomorrow, nearly a billion people would be without air conditioning, refridgeration, and the other necessities we need to survive. <a href="../../../d/r/1/User%7EDr1819_2d7a.html" title="User:Dr1819">Dr1819</a> 19:14, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, as a matter of fact, I did. It seems that you, Dr1819, misunderstood my (much briefer) comment, or perhaps read into it some words that were not there. My objection has nothing to do with gender issues, but only (as so many people have said) with the <i>term</i> "male unbifurcated garment." Those millions of men wearing sarongs, lungis, kilts, wraps, whatever, <i>don't call them MUGs</i> and they <i>don't wear them for the same reason you do</i>. They aren't a movement, they're simply wearing "clothing." (Perhaps I should have omitted my parenthetical comment about "Unisex Unbifurcated Garment," as it seems to have confused you. In a culture where everyone wears a sarong (for instance), it is inaccurate to call it a "male" garment.) <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreplySpang_52d7.html" title="User:FreplySpang">FreplySpang</a> <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreplySpang_a627.html" title="User talk:FreplySpang">(talk)</a> 14:35, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b> Tildes included. "What the rest of the world does is irrelevant?" Are you aware that Western civilization comprises just 10% of the population on this planet, and that a mere third of the users of the Internet are of Western origen? What the rest of the world does may be irrelevant to you, but it's certainly relevant to most Wiki readers! Perhaps you didn't notice the fact that Wiki pages are served in many languages, or that translation of English Wiki pages into other languages (and vice versa) is a high priority at Wiki. Besides, no one here is trying to convert Western styles of fashion. Do what you want. Just stop believing that your choice of fashion should dictate what the rest of the world does, including among American men in your own country - they/we should be as free to wear what we want as anyone else on the planet. As for the remainder of your comments, I defer to the more than 1 Million Google hits which clearly indicate it's not "a term most people have never heard" as you wrongly claim. If you're prone to psychological projections, please keep them to yourself and let the evident facts at hand regarding the validity of the term speak for itself. Thank you!

<li><b>Keep</b> MUG is now a very well used term over the net and is gaining prominence even in fashion world for describing men's clothing which do not divide between the legs. It has the backing of many movements such as the bravehearts. One British company which makes MUG (<a href="http://www.midasclothing.com" class="external text" title="http://www.midasclothing.com" rel="nofollow">Midas Clothing</a>) was covered on the BBC the link to which you can easily find on google. I don't know why why there is this sceptism towards the article. It deserves more to be here than many other articles on wiki.</li>

This article does have relevance as we all know but the term MUG is yet to catch up all that much on popularity charts in opinions of many admins on WP. Going a little off context though, when I talked to one of my friends about Man Unbifurcated Garment, his split second reply was "MUG?"</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I will support renaming the article as Male Skirt because I disagree with Dr1819 on that Skirt is still a very narrow term in today's society. What do you call women's sarong in daily conversation? Half the time its a skirt. So I would say there is nothing wrong in the proposal given above by one person towards the top of this page. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUnitedroad_2a0c.html" title="User:Unitedroad">Unitedroad</a> 07:24, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Response</b> While I appreciate your support, you really cannot call it a skirt, for two reasons. First, most males who wear MUGS throughout the world strongly resent it when people refer to their dress as a "skirt," due to it's feminine connotations. They're wearing lunghi, sarongs, fustanellas, kilts - and more than 70 other terms, but most of them will respond with is, "For crying out loud, man! It's a kilt, not a skirt!" Or other words to that effect in their own language and accurately describing their particular term for the MUG they're wearing. The second reason is that the MUG acronym encompasses both lower and full-body unbirfucated garments. Many garments worn by males, predominantly in the Middle East, but also throughout Africa, Siberia, and other climates ranging from incredibly cold to unbearably hot, resemble dresses, not skirts. Thus, using the term "skirt" is like calling a car a "wheel." Or, in the case of those who're offended, calling a Porshe a "VW." It's simply not equivalent. The MUG acronym was developed more than a decade ago to accurately encompass, without either error or offence, all unbifurcated garments worn by males, hence, male unbifurcated garment - MUG. What could be simpler? <a href="../../../d/r/1/User%7EDr1819_2d7a.html" title="User:Dr1819">Dr1819</a> 18:25, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, and the garments aren't called MUGs, they're called lungis or veshtis. Costume historians don't use the term MUG. It is a neologism with little currency outside a few web pages. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 09:36, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article provides information about a man who was in the military that happened to be involved in some sort of pseudoscience. He's a regular guest on a radio program; however, does that make him notable? Looks like he founded some business that sells some sort of kit for hundreds of dollars to learn "remote viewing." He appears to be still doing that [<a href="http://learnrv.com" class="external text" title="http://learnrv.com" rel="nofollow">today</a>]. What idiot would fall for that? Ok, so he made it to Hollywood once...isn't that the dream of every typical American scumbag? It appears that he's not even good at what he claims to be doing nor was he involved in the development of it. This guy just isn't notable at all. Nothing more then another crackpot with a Wikipedia article. -<a href="../../../o/u/b/User%7EOublier_852c.html" title="User:Oublier">Oublier</a> 21:11, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Most uses of "mystic poet" that I've ever come across are analogous to "woman poet", not to "metaphysical poet" – that is to say, the term merely describes people who are both mystics and poets, rather than being a specific term for a recognised school of poetry. As such, there is unlikely to be any widely-accepted definition of the term or definitive list of people considered "mystic poets". As such, it seems unlikely to me that an article with this title could ever pass <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 22:38, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>delete</b> - This is absurd. The lettering on the bottle is not the English letters "TAPXYH". It's in Cyrillic. The transliterated version should be "Tarhun", not in all-caps. The Cyrllic letter "Ρ" is NOT THE SAME as the English letter "P" even if they look the same. And anways, it's an obscure soft drink and shouldn't be here, especially since the article contains zero information about what it is.

<li><b>Speedy Redirect</b>. People make a mistake (which is not notable anyway), because they should not type in "Y" for something which is not "Y" (but indeed something foreign). People do not know it as "Tarhun" but "TAPXYH", because that's the spelling like it looks like. Hence the article creation was in good faith. <a href="../../../y/y/-/User%7EYy-bo_c77b.html" title="User:Yy-bo">Yy-bo</a> 12:56, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy redirect.</b> Redirects are cheap. This is the English Wikipedia. <i>If</i> any native English-speaker saw a bottle of this and were looking for information about it, it is just as likely that they'd type in TAPXYN as anything else. (During the Cold War many people perceived "CCCP" as the English letters C, C, C, P). And it's very unlikely that disambiguation will ever be needed! Furthermore... is the transliteration unique, or is there more than one way to transliterate it? If so, do we have redirects for the others? <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 14:40, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
