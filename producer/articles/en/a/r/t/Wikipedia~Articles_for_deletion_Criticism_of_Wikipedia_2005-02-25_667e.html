<p>What's that? Cannot we even assure NPOV in the article about Wikipedia itself? Partially <b>merge</b> and <b>redirect</b> to the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> article and <i>death to all POV forks</i>, BTW.</p>
<p><i>Note:</i> There was a <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Criticism_of_Wikipedia_4d9f.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Criticism of Wikipedia">previous VfD</a> 2004-Dec-23 but the discussion drifted away to question whether and which criticism of Wikipedia should be allowed, with statements like <i>"Keep. It is POV not to have articles that are critical of Wikipedia"</i>. Ahem, the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> article itself should contain the critical POV. Also some contributors remarked, that <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Wikipedia_b88c.html" title="Criticism of Wikipedia">Criticism of Wikipedia</a> is much too pro-Wikipedia. Anyway, it's easier and suggested by policy, to put all aspects in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> an enhance that one article.</p>

<li>I think this VfD is ill-considered on several counts. For starters, I believe it is completely incorrect to call it a "POV fork" in the first place. If someone said "Hmmm, the article on Wikipedia is getting pretty large, why don't we make <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html#Sister_projects" title="Wikipedia">Sister projects of Wikipedia</a> or <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html#Software_and_hardware" title="Wikipedia">Software and hardware of Wikipedia</a> or <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html#History" title="Wikipedia">History of Wikipedia</a> its own article?" no one would call it a fork; why then is [[Criticism of Wikipedia]] a "POV fork"? As Pjacobi says, it is suggested by policy that all aspects of a subject go into that subject's article, but it is not only suggested by policy that aspects of a subject get spun out if the subject's article gets too large, it's a suggestion that's automatically made by the editing software every time the size of the article approaches 32K! It is definitely <i>not</i> the case that policy is unambiguously calling for a merge and redirect. I am voting for a <b>keep</b> unless some more convincing case than 'this is a POV fork <i>(disputed)</i> and "all POV forks must be killed"' is made. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 01:08, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> There's no reason why there can't be a reasonable analysis of criticisms of something important. Besides, this article is very good.-<a href="../../../l/t/n/User%7ELtNOWIS_fcfd.html" title="User:LtNOWIS">LtNOWIS</a> 03:36, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Seems useful. Should be summarized and linked as a "main article" from within "<a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>". In the unlikely event that others decide this doesn't belong in main space, then it belongs in Wikipedia space. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 06:03, Feb 26, 2005 (UTC)

<li>That appears to be the current situation. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 08:38, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Pjacobi seems to be on a chase of the dubious "POV fork". The vFd on this article is another of his victims, a royal PIA, and a waste of time. --<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappaz_4b7a.html" title="User:Zappaz">Zappaz</a> 06:09, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I thought this <s>fork</s>sub-page was specifically created to allow the main article to have a pro-wikipedia POV. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 08:38, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>While I'm not opposed to this article per se, isn't there something remarkably similar on here already? (arguments against WP, or something). If so, <b>merge</b>. And anyway shouldn't this be in the <i>wikipedia</i> namespace? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 09:42, Feb 26, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There are other articles like [Wikipedia:Why Wikipedia is not so great]] and <a href="../../../r/e/p/Wikipedia%7EReplies_to_common_objections_644f.html" title="Wikipedia:Replies to common objections">Wikipedia:Replies to common objections</a>. I think the difference is that this page is supposed to be NPOV and not original research. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 10:44, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> is already too heavy, and doesn't need extra baggage. Very healthy for wikipedia to criticise itself. --<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 17:19, Feb 26, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> user PJacobi has misguided ideas about POV forks. If you vote to keep this one then also please vote to keep <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Criticism_of_Prem_Rawat_1a8f.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Criticism of Prem Rawat">Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Criticism_of_Prem_Rawat</a> The subject is more obscure but it has been listen on VfD for exactly the same reasons. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 18:46, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Looks too much like <a href="../../../r/e/p/Wikipedia%7EReplies_to_common_objections_644f.html" title="Wikipedia:Replies to common objections">replies to common objections</a> to me. <b>Move</b> to wikipedia namespace, and possible merge back into <a href="../../../r/e/p/Wikipedia%7EReplies_to_common_objections_644f.html" title="Wikipedia:Replies to common objections">Wikipedia:Replies to common objections</a>. <a href="../../../c/e/s/User%7ECesarB_5f7f.html" title="User:CesarB">cesarb</a> 23:39, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The article needs improvement perhaps, but the questions over content raised seem to be ones that can be fixed by editing the article. The different points of view can be discussed and should be attributed. (The Wikipedia namespace articles don't have to have such an attribution as they are from the voice of the Wikipedia organization itself.) If someone with these concerns wants to do a major rewrite, I'd encourage it. The topic has at least been newsworthy enough to be mentioned. "Article needs improvement", "Article is biased or has lots of POV", and "Dispute over article content" are all listed as <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Problems that don't require deletion</a>. The reasons given so far seem to fall under those cases IMO. --<a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESketchee_ce7e.html" title="User:Sketchee">Sketchee</a> 02:32, Feb 27, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep, but</b> To what extent an article should speak about and quote current WP editors (in their capacity as WP editors) is a question that, I think, not nearly enough weight has been alloted to. The problem is the inter-Wikipedia nature of notability. We are likely looking at a host of problems here which should be noted in this seemingly concluded (to keep) VfD. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 02:50, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> If there's an NPOV problem, fix it. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEric119_9f87.html" title="User:Eric119">Eric119</a> 04:24, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Uh, this is obvious navalgazing. <b>This article properly belongs on meta</b>. Move it there. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 07:33, Feb 27, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Not that I approve of terms like "navalgazing", but Raul is right. That said, meta (unfortunately) receives practically no use, and I don't think this article should be deleted... so... move or keep.

<li><b>Keep</b>; there's a respectable precedent of Article <b>X</b> coexisting with a parallel <b>Criticisms of X</b>. Moving to meta is also acceptable, and the subject is already well-covered in the Wiki namespace, but I think keeping this version in the main namespace is OK. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntandrus_5ef3.html" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> 19:23, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Aren't we allowed to state our own case? Or should we expect critics to <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strawman_argument.html" title="Strawman argument">infer our defence</a> from reading between the lines of our articles? -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 03:28, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Keep. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Recycling_Troll_5389.html" title="User:The Recycling Troll">The Recycling Troll</a> 09:54, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and Clean Up</b> Seems to pretty much fit in with my experience of Wikipedia. If anything it is too pro-Wiki to be truly NPOV, although it's <a href="../../../c/l/o/Close_enough_for_government_work.html" title="Close enough for government work">close enough for government work</a>. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephenboothuk_a500.html" title="User:Stephenboothuk">Stephenboothuk</a> 12:54, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
