<p>This is a very long vanity page on a 20-yr-old film student with no directing experience yet, and no accomplishments. Includes phrases like: <i>Always intent on directing film, it was in 1997, when Mr. Liang first saw American independent filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson's "Boogie Nights" that he became enamored with the idea of writing his own scripts. At this time, Mr. Liang wrote several rudimentary screenplays that have since been lost.</i> Translation: after watching a movie, he wrote some scripts, but he then lost them. Negative notability, and blatant self-promotion. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarro5_c654.html" title="User:Harro5">Harro5</a> 00:05, Jun 5, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Vanity. Furthermore, the original author, User:207.237.6.27 (presumably Mr. Liang himself), has first removed the VfD notice and then blanked the page entirely.

<li>If you have a basis for these allegations, you should pursue sanctions against the user.

<li>That may be your interpretation of "assume good faith" but it is certainly not everyone's. Many people interpret it as "assume good faith <i>until</i> an editor betrays that faith; after that, the burden of proof is upon them to demonstrate that their edits are sincerely meant and worthwhile."

<p><s>Contents is "Suisei (æ°´æ) is a figure of Japanese mythology and is the messenger god. This is also the Japanese name for the planet Mercury." I believe the "figure of Japanese mythology" part is incorrect, coming from Mercury being a messenger god in Greek mythology. "Suisei" means water star, Japanese planets mostly take their name from "elements" like water, wood, fire etc, not from mythical beings. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 00:54, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</s></p>

<li><b>Delete</b> --- No, you can't save the article by removing controversial facts. That leaves you with "Suisei is the Japanese name for the planet Mercury" and I don't see an article in that. Â¶ Incidentally, this myth-myth is also on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_geological_features_on_Mercury_86e4.html" title="List of geological features on Mercury">List of geological features on Mercury</a>. Makes you wonder if there isn't some general misunderstanding. It does so happen that the Japanese name for Wednesday is Suiyobi (water day). The Japanese didn't start using a 7-day week until they opened up to the West in the 1870s. So this might be a nod to the fact that Wednesday is Dies Mercurii in Latin. Perhaps Suisei is the Japanese name for a <i>western</i> god? ----<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac R</a> 03:42, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

But 'The National', along with smaller festivals like Canalway Cavalcade in London, is an important part of the UK canal scene and has a long history.

<dl>
<dd>It is likely that many future articles will want to reference the National without including a block of material relating to it in their body.

<dd>Material relating to UK canals is only just creeping into Wikipedia, despite a significant online presence. As far as I know there is only one person (not myself) adding significant content.

<li>It's too hard to tell. What's there now looks like a genealogical database entry or a theatre register, rather than an article of any sort. I agree with Aecis that if the rewrite takes the POV of the relation, then this should just be a <b>redirect</b> to William "the Bard" Shatner, but if it's an actor bio, then it can be kept.

<li><b>Comment</b>. We need to stop using VfDs to deal with every cleanup issue. Now we're even getting VfD nominations from people who <i>don't want a deletion</i>! That wastes everybody's time. Here's some cleanup processes that you can start with much less fuss:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Research and rewrite yourself.</li>
<li>Start a discussion on the article's talk page. Previous editors will see this (if they still have the page on their watch lists) and maybe respond.</li>
<li>Slap on an appropriate <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_Disputes_539f.html" title="Wikipedia:Template messages/Disputes">dispute</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_Maintenance_1bee.html" title="Wikipedia:Template messages/Maintenance">maintenance</a>, or <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_messages_Cleanup_ae6e.html" title="Wikipedia:Template messages/Cleanup">cleanup</a> tag, which will bring the article to the attention of people who like to look after such things.</li>

<p>Entire article consists of "<b>Michael Smith</b> was an ethical realist." This doesn't give me enough information to find out more about someone with such a common name to expand the article.

<li>From Amazon.com: "Michael Smith is Reader in Philosophy at Monash University, Australia, having taught previously at the University of Oxford and Princeton University. He is the author of several essays in ethics and moral philosophy." In 2000, Smith's book <i>The Moral Problem</i> received The American Philosophical Association's first APA Book Prize for excellence in scholarship. I would say that is pretty notable, but this is one of the worst legitimate stubs I have seen yet. Why do people do this?

<li>My problem with keep votes is that, without other qualifications, "normative" legal thought is inherently a POV concept. Common law (Anglo-American, the Commonwealth) and Civil Law (mainland Europe and former colonies) are too vastly different to be subsumed in a single "Legal thought" article, imho. This is in addition to any problems with "normative" concepts generally. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 21:22, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I disagree. We have articles on certain ethnic slurs, for example, which are inherently POV, but the article addresses the origin and use of the term itself. Clearly there are people who believe that certain legal thought is indeed normative. We should have an article examining the origin and use of that concept, much as we examine <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurocentrism.html" title="Eurocentrism">Eurocentrism</a> not from the perspective that Europe is the most important continent on earth, but from the perspective of examing why Eurocentrists think that it is, and how this bias has affected the wider world. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 20:20, 2005 Jun 10 (UTC)

<li>I have no problem with your suggestion, except that I am unaware of serious scholarly (or even widespread common) criticism of "normative legal thought" as such. The closest I can come to such an argument would be one frequently encountered in law schools, that the common law is inherently and blindly capitalist, materialist, and acquisitive. If I ever become really bold, I might write such an article myself, because it would be a useful one; but, I would call it "Criticisms of the Common Law" or "Socialist Criticisms of the common law." In any case, I would happily entertain such content, but it isn't here now. Even if it were, it would have a bad title -- one simply cannot speak of "normative legal thought" unqualified -- the article must at least be renamed "normative common law thought" or "normative Anglo-American legal thought." Otherwise, this article will be the equivalent of writing an article on "normative philosophy" and discussing only thinkers from England -- a gross misnomer. In short, I'd love to see loads of criticism of conventional legal thought, but it needs better classification. Given that this piece is both ranting <b>and</b> under a horribly imprecise title, I see nothing of value in it. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 10:57, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. If an article of this name is to exist, I can't think of anything NPOV to put there. It is unlikely that the POV rant currently there can be reworked into something worthwhile, so it's better to delete for now with the possibility of starting afresh sometime later. <a href="../../../a/r/j/User%7EArj_a0cf.html" title="User:Arj">arj</a> 22:36, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> -WP:MUSIC are rough guidelines, and not meeting them exactly does not mean the article should be deleted. In particular I think DarkMateria has established itself as notable, first of all for spawning an internet phenomenon with the Picard Song and the accompanying animations/music videos others have made, but also for the unique combination of music they make which in my opinion is rather notable. Please remember Jimbo Wales comments on tolerating trivial articles if they are factual and have some inherent notability, and arent harming Wikipedia as a whole. -<a href="../../../c/u/n/User%7ECunningLinguist_5ed1.html" title="User:CunningLinguist">CunningLinguist</a> 23:38, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The reason <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> was created is that every band thinks they have a distinctive "sound" everyone should know about, and as for creating an "internet phenomenon"âgive us a break! â<a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahoofive_09c2.html" title="User:Wahoofive">Wahoofive</a> (<a href="../../../w/a/h/User_talk%7EWahoofive_6e5c.html" title="User talk:Wahoofive">talk</a>) 04:58, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What do you mean give you a break in reference to the internet phenomenon? The Picard Song and its various animations/music videos were widely distributed and known about. I was in fact introduced to it by my Economics teacher, which shows just how wide its audience was. I dont see how this article is flagrantly non-notable. In my opinion I agree with those that beleive trivial articles should be kept and I think that when deciding what articles stay and what articles go, it is a matter of proving an article merits deletion, not proving that an article merits inclusion (assuming the article is factual). -<a href="../../../c/u/n/User%7ECunningLinguist_5ed1.html" title="User:CunningLinguist">CunningLinguist</a> 06:33, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What I meant is that everybody claims they have buzz on the Internet, so that's an inherently suspicious statement. I have no knowledge one way or the other. I will change my vote if you have evidence beyond your Econ teacher that this Picard Song is notable.

<li><b>Delete without prejudice</b>. I disagree with R3m0t's judgement of "not notable" especially as frankly a lot of Wikipedians tend to prejudge Japanese series as not notable without actually knowing anything about whether it is or not (the classic of this tendency, I think, being when an entire 50+ episode TV series was dismissed as a "minor character".) However, this is an exceptionally uninformative stub, written in poor form, and I have to think that any good article written on Gransazer would be just as easy to write starting from scratch as from this stub. so, I vote delete, but a cleanup would probably change my mind. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 19:54, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Don't merge. This is <i><b>not a fetish</b></i> but a very interesting form of discipline that, fortunately, seems to be in relative disuse today.

<li>You have obviously never been in a leather bar. Many fetishes involved being "punished". In this case, the fetish is for an ancient punishment that seems to have beenr revivied. Anyway, this article is just an advertisment for a site the celebrates this fetish. It's amazing all the different ways people can get off, but I don't think every little one rates its own article. ----<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac R</a> 19:32, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>But the point is that this is actually used as a real punishment. It can easily be compared to spanking: Though it is used in an erotic form, it is also used as real discipline on children. The question is whether this deserves its own article like spanking, or should be merged as a section of the fetish article. <a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESonic_Mew_f169.html" title="User:Sonic Mew">Sonic Mew</a> 20:13, Jun 5, 2005 (UTC)

<li>There are many stories of parents punishing a child caught smoking by forcing them to smoke a large amount; likewise with drinking alcohol. Do these all warrant encyclopedia articles?

<li><b>Keep</b>. Lovely subject but it needs to be NPOV'd a bit. Petticoat punishment is a prominent feature of transgender erotica and D/S roleplay, and is a lot of fun and an excuse to dress up. It has probably been attempted in real life also, but I'd like to see references for that. There are plenty of anecdotes by fetishists who claim they were started by being petticoated but this isn't enough because obviously everybody likes to make up fantasies about their fetish. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 21:30, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Bob Ripley, presents an all-Irish program, appropriate to the approach of St. Patrick's day on his "Believe It Or Not" program over the NBC-Red network on Saturday, March 12, at 8 p.m., E. S. T.</dd>
<dd>The guest star will be Rev. Thomas J. Wheelright, half-brother of the Irish patriot Eamon de Valera, who will tell an hitherto unrevealed story about the latter.</dd>
<dd>The Ripley players will dramatize the story of nine Irishmen sentence to death for treason in the middle of the nineteenth century. Pardoned by Queen Victoria, they were exiled to Australia. The amazing destiny of each one will be revealed during the dramatization.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Appears to be copyvio. I note that the text from which the article was copied referred to an Attorney-General of Australia being occupied by Morris Lyne and Michael Ireland being Attorney-General and Sir Charles Duffy as Prime Minister of Australia. The Commonwealth of Australia was not formed until 1901. <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Duffy_d342.html" title="Charles Duffy">Charles Duffy</a> was Premier of Victoria in 1871 not 1874. However, he was jailed as part of the Young Ireland movement but freed after his fifth trial. He served a term in the House of Commons from 1852 to 1855 but became disillusioned and migrated to Victoria in 1855 where he was elected to Parliament in 1856. On the other hand, the Australian Dictionary of Biography does not have entries for either Morris Lyne and Michael Ireland. If they had achieved any notability in colonial Australia such as being Attorney-General of Victoria, the Australian Dictionary of Biography would have an entry for them. You could possibly justify an entry as a prominent hoax but it should clearly note that it is a hoax not factual. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 01:20, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

It is undisputed known fact that East Asians, Whites, Latinos and Blacks are equally good at playing basketball. White men can jump and do jump very well. ...

<li>I did not nominate it just because it was POV. I nominated it because it has no hope of becoming a neutral article, since the article's title itself sets up a premise that it will try to 'prove' a relationship between race/ethnicity and intelligence, and such a relationship does not exist. <a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevoluci%C3%B3n_5794.html" title="User:RevoluciÃ³n">RevoluciÃ³n</a> 00:06, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>If you define "intelligence" a certain way and define "race" a certain way, then you can find and state correlations between the two. The real question is whether it is a <b>revealing</b> relationship, and, if it is "revealing," then <b>what</b> it reveals. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 02:50, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>"it has no hope of becoming a neutral article, since the article's title itself sets up a premise that it will try to 'prove' a relationship between race/ethnicity and intelligence" - This is simply not so. The article's name implies a discussion of a relationship between race/ethnicity and intelligence, which includes the topic of whether such a relationship exists. If you think that the article doesn't adequately discuss this possibility, that's a problem with the article that should be fixed by editing, <b>not</b> by deletion. <a href="../../../d/a/e/User%7EDaekharel_1ab6.html" title="User:Daekharel">Daekharel</a> 15:30, Jun 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I dont beleive I ever stated this article had anything to do with Right-Left politics. I was referring to something Revolucion pointed out himself: that this article begins with the premise that there is a correlation between race and intelligence and attempts to prove it.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Thoroughly referenced NPOV article. Far from being racist, it highlights what might be considered racial bias in intelligence testing methods.

<li>Keep. Even though I am <b>acutely</b> uncomfortable with the article and <b>deeply</b> question the validity of unstated assumptions that serve as the foundation of the studies upon which the article reports, disappearing the article will not make the issues that the article attempts to discuss go away. To make a satisfactory article would require that we engage in original research, or, at a very minimum, that we deeply think about and critique the fundamentals of the field. To do so, however, involves doing what I have been told over and over again is forbidden to us. If we are forbidden even to <b>think</b> about issues rather than to just report on what others have <b>written</b> about issues, then to make a more satisfactory article would require finding articles to cite that would go into the fundamental problems with this field. In brief, the article shows that if people define "intelligence" <i>a certain way</i>, and if people defines "races" <i>a certain way</i>, then certain correlations can be stated. My reaction to that report is, "So what?" But I have little hope that the anti-intellectual biases can be hedged well enough to permit a more penetrating article.</li>

<dd>Ideally, the article should point out the lack of a fundamental critique that goes beyond finger pointing, and the fact that regardless of the good intent of some of those involved in the field, the assertion (true or false) of a correlation between race and intelligence very definitely serves racist purposes. I support the <b>feelings</b> of RevoluciÃ³n -- I just don't think that scrapping the article is the way to straighten things out. And you can blame me too, because I've been through too many partisan and mean-spirited debates in Wikipedia to barge in where I have no depth of research knowledge and where the simple act of <b>thinking</b> is met with vituperative responses.<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 02:39, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Sorry, but if the guy you cited stands as an expert in the field it only strengthens my impression that the field makes assertions that "aren't even wrong." I can see why RevoluciÃ³n goes ballistic, but his problem would seem actually to be with the field and not to the article (that only reflects the field since that is all good Wikipedians are permitted to do). I'm feeling extremely grumpy, but please do not take it personally. <b>You've</b> never told me to stop thinking or to stop trying to explain things to people like RevoluciÃ³n who have (IMHO) the right idea but the unclear way to put it. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 05:05, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I guess it's an important "issue"....<b>to racists</b>. The facts are, no connection exists between race/ethnicity and intelligence. The articles on "Boston Red Sox" and "George W.

<ul>
<li>In a way I agree with you, and in another way I disagree. First, suggesting that this person or that person is a "racist" isn't likely to get us to anything except defensiveness. Second, the conceptualization of [race] is so murky, with hardly any two identifiable people actually defining the word "race" the same way, that it is difficult to think about clearly -- especially since people are generally unwilling to dig down to brass tacks and then build back out. To make things worse, [intelligence] is not conceptualized clearly either. It has regularly been used in these discussions as though it were a <b>thing</b>, no? It is an abstract category and a moving target depending for its actions on who is pointing the gun, and yet it is discussed <b>as though</b> it is a simple entity "out there somewhere" just waiting for somebody to take a snapshot of it. It's even been given a "true name" to identify the ens realissimus behind all manifestations of [intelligence] -- the simple letter <big><b>g</b></big>. So now people are trying to correlate two "entities" hypostatized out of subjectively determined abstract categories. There's nothing particularly immoral about that approach. It's just (IMHO) stupid. But it does give racists a golden opportunity. The only good thing (from my point of view) is that white racists are beginning to have to deal with a their own reactions to a cartoon in which the white guys are second string (or maybe third rate, who knows since its dependent on how you play the game). <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 05:05, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I think you, RevoluciÃ³n, are as just as narrow-minded as those "racists." There clearly is a racial gap that exists in the United States, and whether it is due to "genetics" or "environment" is of another matter --they are both very arguable as seen with statistics. Even though this article is controversial, there is no reason to delete this page for its controversy. We do not delete articles on Adolf Hitler or Stalin or Andrew Jackson, just because of the controversy that surrounds those two figures. The "connection between race and intelligence" has not been disproven completely, nor has the connection between environment and intelligence been completely proven; and thus, there is an argument for both that exist. There are clearly very educated and intelligent --perhaps more open-minded than you-- people who argue for one or the other, and to ignore one or the other is very dilletante. I believe you, RevoluciÃ³n, are as narrow-minded as those "racists" whom you claim you are against. Just because this article is extremely controversial, it does not mean that it should be deleted. One should be open-minded to all view points of a matter, and this matter is very important and very visible in the United States.Bezant</li>

Jensen (1998, p. 357) estimates that in a random sample of equal numbers of US Blacks and Whites, most of variance in IQ would be unrelated to race or social class.</i> From one POV, this research is a strong reason to treat people as individuals, rather than members of a group. --<a href="../../../r/i/k/User%7ERikurzhen_bafb.html" title="User:Rikurzhen">Rikurzhen</a> 20:01, Jun 9, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. The extremely controversial subject of racial differences in IQ has been electrifying public debate for decades and deserves its own entry many times over. Rather than being deserving of deletion, I consider this article to be one of Wikipedia's finest, precisely because it demonstrates that Wikipedia is willing to present the facts as they stand rather than running in terror from those facts out of the fear that someone, somewhere, may become offended by them.

<li><b>Keep</b>. There exist studies showing statistical correlations between race and IQ; there is controversy over the interpretation of these results; there are various POVs on this subject. Therefore, it is a valid subject for a wikipedia article. Whether it is currently POV is utterly irrelevant. <i>Maybe</i> it should be renamed to <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_IQ_6375.html" title="Race and IQ">Race and IQ</a>, but that won't happen while it's on the VfD list, will it? <a href="../../../d/a/e/User%7EDaekharel_1ab6.html" title="User:Daekharel">Daekharel</a> 15:30, Jun 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. NPOV dispute. And that's really all I need to say about it, isn't it? NPOV disputes are not VfD material.<br />
But I'm going to say some more anyway. Saying that an article has "no hope of becoming neutral", when it's established that the topic itself is notable enough to merit inclusion in an encyclopedia, is tantamount to saying Wikipedia just can't handle it. That's one opinion, but it's not something we're qualified to judge here. Surely you're not arguing that <i>all information in the article is false and/or irrelevant</i>, that is, the sources we quote don't really say what we report or none of them express notable viewpoints. That would mean the article is a complete hoax, and it would be the <i>only</i> reason you could justify outright deletion with. <i>Wikipedia does not report on what is true, only significant views on what is true</i>. Claiming that "race" and "intelligence" are unrelated concepts is just another POV, one that can and should be addressed in the article itself. It does no good to pretend that the POV that race and intelligence <i>are</i> concepts that can be meaningfully related is not significant. The article clearly establishes that it is. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> Â· <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 23:40, 2005 Jun 11 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. "Race" is an arbitrary term used to denigrate groups different from the groups in power in a given society. Once knowing that, however, one can say studies like this are not wholly irrevelent; these sorts of inquiries show how disenfranchised members are affected by prejudiced societal institutions, poverty, and other related social issues. The article should shed more light should be put on the fact that race is not an absolute construct but one based on subjective perception. RP 0:42, Jun 12, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. I'm worried that this page will become ammunition for racists. I realize there are good arguments for not censoring, but consider this: was it right for the United States to censor or withhold information about the atomic bomb? Of course it was. In the wrong hands it could be deadly.

<li><b>Keep</b> Surprisingly well written and balanced article. I would vote to definitely keep this article. I learned a lot reading it and it would be a shame to delete a piece that is so comprehensive and well documented. You know, plugging your ears and going "neener, neener, neener...," is not a way to engage in scholarly debate. IQ is interesting but not the complete measure of man. I just took an IQ test online and it differed not a whit from my IQ converted from an SAT score from 1973, fascinating... an anecdote that is supported by evidence. So there will never be a bumper sticker that says, "Don't like your IQ, then change it." so what? But there might be one that says "People not smart enough for you? Then change the world".

<dd>The background info starts out noting the objections to classification by race (which is a pretty good summary of the objections). However the rest of article then treats races as well defined meaningful things. At the very least there should be some acknowledgement that since most of these studies occurred within the US they don't accurately portray Hispanic intelligence or European intelligence, but rather the subpopulations of the United States that are identified as White or Hispanic. --<a href="../../../c/y/p/User%7ECypherx_7316.html" title="User:Cypherx">Cypherx</a> 10:43, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I guess I still question the racial labels employed in many of the studies cited (how do they determine who's of what race? why is it treated as if there is some clear cut standard?) but I guess that falls into the domain of academic argument rather than something universally accepted. --<a href="../../../c/y/p/User%7ECypherx_7316.html" title="User:Cypherx">Cypherx</a> 10:52, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Why don't you do a "pure english" against "pure german"... Are Rusians asian&#160;? What about Filipinos&#160;? And Mongols&#160;? Where are the Arabic&#160;? What about the hispanic/Peruan&#160;? and the hispanic/Argentinian&#160;? Which date will you use to determine the purity of a German, an English or a French? Considering the black, how many mixes of black/white/asian/hispanic are enough to stop considering him black&#160;? Is a single black in the tree enough to consider all below black&#160;?

<dd>Copied from the article: "People labeled Blacks have most of their ancestors from...". Well, "most of their ancestors" doesn't sound very scientific to me. Does it to you&#160;? Where I said "I think", you can actually remove it, because these days that's a fact. If you like the article, name it something like "What_we_think_are_American_races_and_IQ". Because you can't neither make asumptions about races on countries you haven't made studies on. And I have to remember you that people from different countries refer to the wikipedia for information, and you can't make universal asumptions on that. Have you considered distance and motive why people from different races is there&#160;? Really, you have to be joking if you want to make something like this look like serious. I mean, I would keep the article in a different place and with a different name. But this is meant to be an Encyclopedia. Refer to the meaning of that in case of doubt.

<dd>Hi Jorge, this VfD page really isn't a good place to learn about genetics. Maybe you want to take your objections to the talk page? Anyway, I found <a href="http://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/001321.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gnxp.com/MT2/archives/001321.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> to be a good overview of the basic arguments one should be familiar with; do have a look. Maybe the current article should make a better job of explaining this, even though it basically belongs to <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race.html" title="Race">Race</a>. The tacit American assumptions about race that permeate the article are one of my own few concerns with the current state of the page (I'm European), and as you can see I have put that very issue on the Todo-list yesterday. I would be happy if you kept a look on this page and see if it evolves in the right direction. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbor_06ec.html" title="User:Arbor">Arbor</a> 16:11, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Hi Arbor, was the people subject of the IQ test also subject of a genetic mapping&#160;? I don't doubt about the science of genetics. I doubt about the article's based-on "science". And sure, we can move to talk. I'm European too. Copied from the link you posted: "No serious scientist, in fact, believes that genetically pure populations exist." There can't be real science on such a thing like "white/hispanic/black/asian" races. Thus, until such a study exists this article cannot be considered science or knowledge. -- [<a href="http://www.drqueue.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.drqueue.org/" rel="nofollow">Jorge Daza</a>]

<dd>Jorge, I wrote the sentence you're discussing. It is a painfully simplistic summary of a very complicated topic.

<p><b><del>Delete</del> (see below)</b>. Wikipedia is not a soapbox.

<li>Wait, what? How is this a soapbox at all? As you pointed out, its empty. I wonder what this VfD hopes to accompish. Its clearly an important topic, it's part of the {{<a href="../../../r/w/a/Template%7ERwandan_Genocide_88fd.html" title="Template:Rwandan Genocide">Rwandan Genocide</a>}} series, and clearly a work in progress.

<li>Why is <a href="../../../r/w/a/Template%7ERwandan_Genocide_88fd.html" title="Template:Rwandan Genocide">Template:Rwandan Genocide</a> a series instead of a single article?

<li><b>Keep</b> - this isn't vanity! Howard Brown is the character used in the Halifax (UK bank) adverts in the UK (as the article states). He's a real bank employee, I believe, rather than just an actor used. Modern day ad's use a cartoon version of Howard, older ones used the real person. Article could do with more content, and it's never going to be the most notable entry, but has the potential to be made quite interesting, given a rewrite methinks. I can't see a reason to delete, the person is quite well known in the UK, and certainly don't delete as <i>Vanity</i> as stated in the article. <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a> 20:54, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I would leave this to users like UkPaolo who are more familiar with the notability of the person than I am, but generally speaking, a person who appears in an ad for a single company does not seem any more notable to me than many local musicians, writers, college professors and other individuals we have deleted. <b>no vote</b> - <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 21:36, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It appears that we are verging on consensus that we want to keep the content. So, this is really a vote not to merge and redirect. I only like redirects when it is obvious to someone following it why they were redirected. SCOUT eh! is a movement that is trying to reform the current administrative structure of <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scouts_Canada_cecd.html" title="Scouts Canada">Scouts Canada</a>. With a redirect, this point would only become clear when they read the section of issues, which will likely always remain at the bottom of the article. It does no harm as a stand-alone article, yet it could provide clarity to some. -- <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesTeterenko_c1e2.html" title="User:JamesTeterenko">JamesTeterenko</a> 20:21, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Precisely. What harm does it do to have this short direct explanation of what <i>SCOUT eh!</i> is on its own page? If someone is looking for an encyclopedic answer as to what it is, I would hope and think they would come to Wikipedia for it. To be redirected to <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scouts_Canada_cecd.html" title="Scouts Canada">Scouts Canada</a> seems unnecessary and slightly irrational. They surely already know what Scouts is and, if not, the wikilink on the article will tell them. The article is a stub and it is so indicated. It needs expansion on what the position, goals, issues, controversies, disputes are and how successful or unsuccesful it is so far but that it is fine. Let it expand. The Scouts Canada page links to it and can even discuss the dispute but what's appropriate and encyclopedic for an article about SCOUT eh! may not be for Scouts Canada and relegating it as a subsection there would, I believe, limit growth. My question for VfDs is what harm does it do to keep it and what harm does it do to move/lose it? <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoubleBlue_f889.html" title="User:DoubleBlue"><font color="darkblue"><b>Double</b></font><font color="blue">Blue</font></a> (<a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoubleBlue_3ebb.html" title="User talk:DoubleBlue">Talk)</a> 21:13, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Notable enough, and like DoubleBlue and JamesTeterenko, this is a vote to keep rather than merge and redirect. While its members are all, in turn, members of Scouts Canada, this does not automatically equate SCOUT eh! to Scouts Canada. I vote not to redirect because I believe SCOUT eh! is a seperate organisation from Scouts Canada and notable enough to warrant its own article. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 19:49, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I've made some changes, and (I hope) improvements. Googling yields numerous entries, and, if nothing else, Piss Koran was at the very least something of an internet phenomenon (many of which have entries on Wikipedia). <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 20:43, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comment - the clean-up is good - but my issues are 1) verifiability 2) notability - can you answer those??
<ul>
<li>Seems notable to me. Piss Christ and the attendant controversy received a great deal of media attention, and it's seen by many (particularly angry Christians) as a major moment in the Red America/Blue America slagging match. Piss Koran seems to be part of that ongoing slagging match. Certainly more notable than a thousand other Wikipedia articles. As for verifiability, Piss Koran is clearly verifiable as a concept: the echo or rhetorical "answer" to Piss Christ that many Christians (at least many online) viewed as a challenge to liberals and/or non-Christians to be consistent in their defense of artistic freedoms. If the actual photograph cannot be found/verified, I think this would not require the article to be deleted, but rather rewritten as describing a concept discussed and envisaged by some Christians as a response to Piss Christ. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 23:38, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s>On reflection I'm going to suggest that we don't merge. This article is not about the <i>concept</i> of a Piss Koran, it is about an actual artwork, the existence of which no-one has verified. <b>Delete</b> this - if the concept <i>is</i> impotant in debate then that can be discussed as a 'reactions' section in the Piss Christ article. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 16:01, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</s>

<li><s>That's fine, it amounts to much the same thing.
