However, allow me to explain the reasons why I had the opinion of weak delete. Firstly, one must take note that the above criteria is currently a <i>propsed Wikipedia guideline</i>. The criteria here is not yet official. Secondly, in <a href="http://72.14.235.104/search?q=cache:hmrhRplHwE4J:www.highwaygames.com/body.php3%3Faction%3Dnews_st%26view%3Ddetail%26news_id%3D1967%26pg%3D7+%22Robo+basho%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=sg&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=16" class="external text" title="http://72.14.235.104/search?q=cache:hmrhRplHwE4J:www.highwaygames.com/body.php3%3Faction%3Dnews_st%26view%3Ddetail%26news_id%3D1967%26pg%3D7+%22Robo+basho%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=sg&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=16" rel="nofollow">this webpage</a>, it is stated that the software in question would be presented around the exhibition scene of AMOA and FunExpo, which admittedly, I am not sure of their notablility. Thirdly, this article meets <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> barely, which <b>is</b> an official policy of Wikipedia, thus presenting a strong case here for inclusion. However, this in itself is not sufficient condition for an article to be included here. The key statement to be considered here for this article is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">WP:CRYSTAL BALL</a>. It does not meet <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a> as well. Thus, considering all sides of the argument here, this article should be deleted. --<font style="background:gold"><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/i/v/User%7ESiva1979_25a6.html" title="User:Siva1979">iva1979</a></font><sup><a href="../../../s/i/v/User_talk%7ESiva1979_3c9b.html" title="User talk:Siva1979"><font style="background:yellow">Talk to me</font></a></sup> 03:23, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm going to have to agree with Lina. The information is concise, well presented, sourced (if not in a preferrable style), and some items are used in as many as as twenty episodes.

As long as it's well done and out of the way of the main articles (so as not to overwhelm), why list a handful of examples of common 2x4 Tech when we can show all the common devices?

<li><b>Strong delete.</b> It's original research, the C.S. Lewis quotes need to go, not be merged, there's no evidence that zoe means "spiritual" life. The Greeks used the word "pneuma" for spirit. This stuff sounds way too New Age. "Spiritual" means relating to the supernatural, not relating to life. Also, this is the root word for zoology, the study of <i>animal life</i>. Yes, I know Greek, yes, I've read the NT in Greek.

<li><b>Comment</b> The sentence <i>the Septuagint (LXX), uses the Greek word zoe as the word for "life" in the Book of Genesis along with a derivative of the same word to explain that man "became spiritually alive in his behavioral life-function of the soul."(Genesis 2:7)</i> is unsourced; and reads like somebody's theological claim (perhaps Lewis's, although "behavioral life-function of the soul" is not Lewis's usual English).

<li>Note that <a href="../../../a/s/s/Associated_Press_9ff2.html" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a> is one of the world's largest and most trusted news agencies. Also, Soobzokov played a large part in CIA coverup as the CIA continually misled U.S. immigration officials in the mid-1970s about the role of Soobzokov and his connection to Nazi war crimes. As for the New York Times link, the article does talk about Soobzokov, but (as with all Online New York Times articles) you'll have to register and subscribe first to read the whole article.--<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_dd8c.html" title="User:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font style="background:red" color="#FFFF00"><b>TBC</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_76cf.html" title="User talk:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font color="red">TaLk?!?</font></a></small> 02:36, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm not questioning whether the AP is a trusted news agency, I'm pointing out that you just flooded us with a bunch of links to the <b>exact same news article</b>, each of which gives him 1-sentence treatment.

<li>First of all, note that not <i>all</i> of the links are duplicate articles, such as the links to <i>New Jersey Jewish Standard</i>, <i>Boston Globe</i> and <i>World Socialist Website</i>. Also the New York Times article basically states that the FBI concluded that the Jewish Defense League may have bombed Soobzokov, as based from external sources referencing the article.--<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_dd8c.html" title="User:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font style="background:red" color="#FFFF00"><b>TBC</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../t/r/e/User_talk%7ETree_Biting_Conspiracy_76cf.html" title="User talk:Tree Biting Conspiracy"><font color="red">TaLk?!?</font></a></small> 02:56, 10 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>as based from external sources referencing the article</i>? Are you seeing the same thing I'm seeing? Doesn't matter anyway, I'm still voting delete. As for the other stuff, I admit to ignoring the Boston Globe link because it was taking too long to load. I didn't read the NJ Jewish Standard link because it's not a major news org (and I'd just gotten done closing about half a dozen of the <b>exact same article</b> that you linked me to, and assumed it'd be more of the same). As for the World Socialist Website, I didn't bother checking that because I don't really consider them to be a news source. <a href="../../../m/y/_/User%7EMy_Alt_Account_c155.html" title="User:My Alt Account">My Alt Account</a> 03:05, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm being stubborn because there's no basis for an article here. I imagine if I were a neo-nazi, I would <b>prefer</b> for this info to be in the JDL article because that might be a better way to smear jews. The Washington Times link there just repeats the info that's in all the other news articles, and does not mention the bombing. I couldn't open the fas.org pdf.

<blockquote>
<p>Generally speaking, the perception that an article is fancruft can be a contributing factor in its nomination and deletion, but it is not the actual reason for deletion. Rather, the term fancruft is a shorthand for content which one or more editors consider unencyclopaedic, possibly to the extent of violating policies on verifiability, neutrality or original research.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Nothing on this page strikes me as violating policies on verifiability, neutrality or original research. Is it of value? Obviously not to those not interested in KND. But that is true for almost all television based wikistuff. I find KND to be well-written and immaginative, offering interesting paradoies of other television concepts. So much so, that I have made passing references to the show in courses I teach. Having a comprehensive list of episodes and technology references would be of value to me (and possibly others). I don't want to overstate this--obviously it is still basically a kid's show and I think its ultimate penetration into the marketplace of ideas will be limited. <a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdclevenger_e059.html" title="User:Jdclevenger">Jdclevenger</a> 17:52, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> as well, for the reasons Jdclevenger describes. There are plenty of other such lists in Wikipedia, I don't see why this particular one is so much worse than the others.

<li><b>Comment</b> I see 18 papers, not 8, and he is first or senior author on 8 of those papers. Also, listing of authors goes from both ends, so if someone is near the back of a list of authors, it usually means they played a more senior role in designing the research.Mattlewis777 23:58, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> He's certainly not <b>the discoverer</b> - his own site says he was <i>a key player</i> in the identification of the gene and probably all that means in practice is that his lab did some of the work.

<li><b>DELETE</b> There is no encyclopedic value and regards a group whose size and impact are culturally insignificant. It reads more as advertising for The Opie &amp; Anthony show and contains information which is difficult to verify thereby making it an unreliable resource. Wikipedia's value is that its contrinutors and editors value accuracy and truthfulness highly. With no way to verify the claims made by this entry's author, and through the insignificance of the subject, it serves as a blight on Wikipedia's reputation.</li>

<p><b>Strong Delete</b>- This page is nothing more then a branging Trophy for these Pests. Their actions are an utter disgrace to be displayed on Wikipedia. Many of the problems they have caused are illegal also. This content has no encyclopedic value and should be removed by all means necessary. JPJ 05:21, 11 September 2006</p>
<p><b>Strong Keep</b>-Thus far the article has survived, even though there is no such army particularly in a smaller form on the main Opie and Anthony page. The "Pests" as they are, are a major part of the show and have grown to such a degree that they have recieved attention in national publications and even warranted a mentioning on O&amp;A's David Letterman Appearance.

<li>Aah, but it does. This article is longer than many other articles and includes a lot of information on the particular topic of "The Pests." One may take an interest to looking them up, based on the fact that they may have read aboot them in a publication, heard aboot them on Opie and Anthony, or may have seen Pest activities on the streets. It has encyclopedic value, and many articles tend to promote things.

<li>No, I wouldn't, depending on how well it was written. If you went off on the Pests, calling them full of shit and all fuckheads, maybe I would because that's certainly not encyclopaedic.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>Whether you like the pest or not, they are apart of a national radio show and have been mention in numerous publications. if you get rid of the PESTS then go to anything else that isn't "encyclopiedia worthy".</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The O&amp;A Army is a group of fans that are a part of the Opie &amp; Anthony Show, and often times are guests of the show, in and out of the studio. They are an integral part of the show, and they're growing. The links above demonstrate same. They should be treated with the same respect as any guest of the show, if not more. For example, Richard Dreufuss was a guest of the show. Shall we delete his article as well? Likewise for any other guest who's appeared on the show, and has their own article. This deletion request is clearly motivated by personal reasons, as opposed to professional ones.</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> The pests only exist on the Opie and Anthony show and articles related to them should be in the wiki O&amp;A article. No legitimate reason for them to have a seperate article except for them to try to get their names mentioned on yet another internet space.

<p>If you would pay more attention to earlier notes, the reason this article came into true existance when I found it and cleaned it up was because the O&amp;A article was already over 80kb long, which is FAR longer than the recommended (or sometimes allowed) amount of content for the O&amp;A Main Article.

<p><b>Strong Keep</b> So since this article should be deleted, I guess all articles about fangroups and fanbases should be deleted as well, correct?

<p>Stop trying to deflect attention from the fact that you've lost ground in this argument. Give us a valid reason that hasn't been addressed and debunked to prove that your motives aren't personal. We've already presented plenty of articles and coverage of the Pests' exploits to warrant the existence of this article. Heck, there are fangroups who have less coverage and attention paid to them that have their own Wiki.</p>
<p><b>Pests advertising and soliciting meatpuppets</b> Wiki editors should consider Dugout Doug's solicitation of outsiders to this discussion in making their decision about this article.</p>

<p>It is considered highly inappropriate or unacceptable to advertise Wikipedia articles that are being debated in order to attract users with known views and bias, in order to strengthen one side of a debate. It is also considered highly inappropriate to ask friends or family members to create accounts for the purpose of giving additional support. Advertising or soliciting meatpuppet activity is not an acceptable practice on Wikipedia. On-Wikipedia canvassing should be reverted if possible.</p>
<p>The arrival of multiple newcomers, with limited Wikipedia background and predetermined viewpoints arriving in order to present those viewpoints, rarely helps achieve neutrality and most times actively damages it, no matter what one might think. Wikipedia is not a place for mixing fact and opinion, personal advocacy, or argument from emotion. Controversial articles often need more familiarity with policy to be well edited, not less.</p>
<p>If you feel that a debate is ignoring your voice, then the appropriate action is not to solicit others outside Wikipedia. Instead, avoid personal attacks, seek comments and involvement from other Wikipedians, or pursue dispute resolution. These are quite well tested processes, and are designed to avoid the problem of exchanging bias in one direction for bias in another.</p>

<p>And what if those people go on to have extensive Wikipedia backgrounds? Are they still meat puppets then? I actually do have a Wikipedia account and have edited several articles in the past including this one (I added the "O&amp;A Army Vs. O&amp;^A Pests" section), but forgot my password. And even if I recovered it, using my account now would give the impression that I was doing sock puppetry by posting anonymously at first and then under my Wikipedia account after.</p>
<p>You're capable of sock/meat puppetry as much as we are, all you need is an IP Spoofer or a few pals. How do we know you haven't been doing it?</p>
<p>And you don't think we see what you're trying to do? It seems that you're upset because more people seem to be opposed to your request for deletion than there are approval of it, so you're trying to get the Wikipedia people to become suspicious that there are meat/sock puppetry going on to discredit the opinions of people opposed to you who have been alerted to your request to delete this article on OA Experience. I, for one, have not been doing sock/meat puppetry, all Wikipedia has to do is check my own IP to see all my posts are coming from the same place. But alas, there's that darn IP Spoofer strategy, and the circle of suspicion goes around and around. Your attempt at breeding suspicion to get your way is so transparent. Accusing us of sock/meat puppetry doesn't change the fact that we countered your request for deletion with articles of the Pests' activities and other instances of loyal fanbases like the Pests getting their own Wiki, and whether or not this Wiki is deleted shouldn't be decided on sock/meat puppetry, but on the facts we've presented.</p>
<p>And furthermore, being someone with "extensive Wikipedia background" means nothing also. Just as it is capable of people having more than one account through an IP Spoofer, it is possible for someone to have more than one account with "extensive Wikipedia background" as well. Stop trying to discredit others' opinions because they haven't posted on Wikipedia as long as you. It's in the same vein as the false superiority people get when they have a huge post count on a message board and they see a newbie with a diminutive post count. High or low post counts mean nothing, extensive or limited Wikipedia background means nothing. As long as you make valid points, how much time you spend on a board or how many posts you have means nothing. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.188.117.67.html" title="User:205.188.117.67">205.188.117.67</a> (<a href="../../../2/0/5/User_talk%7E205.188.117.67.html" title="User talk:205.188.117.67">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_205.188.117.67_dcc7.html" title="Special:Contributions/205.188.117.67">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Payneos, why must every discussion related to O&amp;A always inevitably end up with a comparison to something related to Howard Stern? Some of those Stern wikipedia articles should be afd as well. Why bring them up here?</p>

I think the fact that the O&amp;A Army/Pests have been mentioned in numerous news stories makes a strong case for relevance.

<p>If you get rid of the "pests" or the "army" then you should never have anything for other large fan bases, such as trekkies,and the Browncoats. Not to mention, where will it stop. is there gonna be a discussion everytime someone doesn't like the topic. can i start a discussion on removing any thing have to do with conspiricy theories around 911 or the theory of evolution. whether people like it or not, fans of anything have a voice and when they are mentioned in Forbes magazine, or as a parody on SNL then they have become a bigger part of a wider picture.

<dd>You can, but it's obvious by your writings you stand for those entries for being in Wikipedia for the same reason that I do. To delete those articles is as much of a detriment to Wikipedia as to delete this one. The Pests have achieved enough notoriety to warrant a large scale article such as this one, and the evidence has been shown in cited articles from FMQB, Foundry, Orbitcast, and even Forbes Magazine. This isn't your average fan-following, to some it's a way of life (which was parodied once by the Church of Opie, since shut down to waning interest in the joke.) <a href="../../../p/a/y/User%7EPayneos_9fd3.html" title="User:Payneos">Payneos</a> 14:56, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Strong Delete</b> The comparison between the "Pests" and Trekkies is odious and when you compare the two it doesn't hold. Trekkies have been around for decades, have had documentaries based on them, have contributed to making Star Trek a household name, and number in the millions the world over. The O&amp;A Pests are just a handful of hardcore O&amp;A fans by comparison, and O&amp;A are far from household names. If this article were to stay then it would open the doors for Wikipedia to be cluttered with "articles" (I use that term loosely) for every drive-time morning DJ/crew in the country. I am not saying that O&amp;A shouldn't have an article, they most certainly should no matter what I think of them, but not their fans.Shemps 14:43, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That, however, does not explain the existance of Browncoats on Wikipedia, whom have only been around since 2003. Sometimes, that "Handful of fans" is noteworthy, particularly when they make major news media outlets (Like the Pests) or can drastically manipulate DVD sales (like the Browncoats). <a href="../../../p/a/y/User%7EPayneos_9fd3.html" title="User:Payneos">Payneos</a> 14:54, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I don't agree that the Browncoats are very noteworthy, but at least they didn't include a section on "Famous Browncoats". This pest article is just a way for some clowns to put their names on another website.Water Boy 15:28, 14 September 2006 (UTC)Water Boy</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Because the Browncoats are a different entity than the pests. What the Browncoats do is stat petitions and attend Conventions to support the fallen show, <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firefly.html" title="Firefly">Firefly</a>. Pests, however, are frequently mentioned on the show and in the articles they appear in, by name. Thus, some have earned notable individual recognition. <a href="../../../p/a/y/User%7EPayneos_9fd3.html" title="User:Payneos">Payneos</a> 15:43, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b> - The Pests are a force in their own right. They often act without the permission of the Opie and Anthony show. All of thier attacks are well documented. They definitely deserve to have their own article. GA. <a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardnug_8cb6.html" title="User:Wizardnug">Wizardnug</a> 11:39, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I don't think the "Browncoats" should have an article either. Firefly is not a relevant enough show, at least not yet. Perhaps a blurb about the Browncoats on the Firefly page, but most definately not an entire page. Hell, I didn't even know what a Browncoat was until just now. The same for the Pests, a blurb on the O&amp;A page would be just fine. I also have to agree with the folks who are taking umbrage with the "Famous Pests" section. If you take a poll anywhere except an O&amp;A gathering, I'll bet the vast majority of folks will not know who "Dugout Doug" or "General Bam" are. As a group they may have a tiny bit of noteriety (as far as the O&amp;A Universe is concerned) but as individuals they have none at all.Shemps 23:04, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Again, disagree. Browncoats were largely responsible for Serenity (the movie) being able to be filmed at all, and have been a massive force behind the sales of Firefly/Serenity DVDs, even organizing certain days where everyone will buy a copy off of... say... Amazon.com, in which it will force sales for the week into teh #1 or #2 slot. But enough aboot Browncoats, that's for another time. The point is, sometimes a fan following has become large enough and notable enough to a point where it can no longer be ignored by even Wikipedia. Trekkies, Browncoats, The Wack Pack, The Pests, in the end, they all have their own reasons for being on Wikipedia, but they all belong here. <a href="../../../p/a/y/User%7EPayneos_9fd3.html" title="User:Payneos">Payneos</a> 23:50, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>"Sportspeople/athletes who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport such as swimming, or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports, including college sports in the United States."<br />

"Above is user's first contribution to Wikipedia." How is that in anyway relevent? It's actually sommi, and he's making a fair, and calm comment.<br />
"Notable actors and television personalities who have appeared in well-known films or television productions." - Sommi has appeared in various Counter-Strike movies including "AusLegacy 2006", "PIL Season 1 (pantheon invite league)", each with countless thousands of downloads. If you require a link, I will find you it.<br />
"Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events" - As already stated, sommi has achieved renown or notoriety in his field of expertise.<br /></p>

<p>Alt Account, i'm sorry if i did delete your comment, the page was laggy for me, perhaps your comment didn't update for me? I'm not sure, i didn't mean to delete anything. Furthermore, all i did to the comments was add their ip to the show you that they are separate users from across the country. I asked them personally to give me their ip from www.whatismyip.com and i added the ip on the end as some of them weren't fimliar as to how to add comments properly.</p>

<p><small>There are many Steve Nguyen out there such as myself. And I know I've done a lot more than this guy ever will. He's not a famous actor. He's a want to be famous actor with an unsuccessful company as far as I can tell. This is for his own self glorification and commercialization. I'm a CEO of my own company. Does that mean I get a Steve Nguyen page too? No, it's ridiculous. I've been googling for his company. It's not even an important company. It's his own two bit startup operation.

As for the TV appearances, all his acting credits are as obscure extras<a href="http://www.tv.com/steve-nguyen/person/235308/appearances.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tv.com/steve-nguyen/person/235308/appearances.html" rel="nofollow">[31]</a> - "crowd member", "Asian kid") and his small company are certainly not encyclopedically notable based on the article details. We also have no evidence that he is a prominent young entrepreneur (has he been profiled in <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fast_Company_b7e2.html" title="Fast Company">Fast Company</a>?

I checked out his personal and corporate websites - I came away with the impression of a guy with a huge ego, rather than indications that his company is a serious enterprise. IMDB profile only lists non-notable short films mostly yet to be released (no, an IMDB profile does NOT guarantee notability - their control for entries (esp. for in-production entries) is not stringent... one of the films listed as a production credit is <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_1_Second_Film_a9a9.html" title="The 1 Second Film">The 1 Second Film</a> which is a gimmicky way of raising money by letting anyone sign up as a producer in exchange for $ (there are 5000+ producers) ).

<li><small><b>Followup</b> Regarding Steve's game credits, here is listing under that nameon the game credits database, Mobygames:<a href="http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,15606/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,15606/" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>, which shows that Steve has primarily worked as a <a href="../../../p/l/a/Playtester.html" title="Playtester">playtester</a> ("quality assurance") - which is about as far down the video game developer food chain as you can go. His single production credit is of dubious signficance, as he is also credited as a playtester on the same game (any game producer for a major company worth their salt does not get credited for "quality assurance" on his/her games, though obviously he playtests them). In any case, the video game career as a whole is not notable enough for a video games trade magazine, and certainly not enough for an encyclopedia. As for the voice acting, he was involved with sound on a couple of games - as the dwarf voice in Stonekeep<a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/stonekeep/credits" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/stonekeep/credits" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> (along with 20+ other people doing other roles. dwarf appears near the bottom of the voice credits). He was also one of three people on the sound effects team for Battle Chess 4000<a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/battle-chess-4000/credits" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/battle-chess-4000/credits" rel="nofollow">[34]</a>.

<dd><b>Followup on films</b> I looked into this further, and I think this article's Steve Nguyen is the same person listed on IMDB. However all the films are crappy independent films, and when I looked up the film "Star Child: The Beginning" for which he has an associate producer credit, I found that <a href="http://www.rodeohard.com/view_category.asp?cat=55" class="external text" title="http://www.rodeohard.com/view_category.asp?cat=55" rel="nofollow">I too could be associate producer on this film for the modest sum of $49.95</a> (scroll down linked page).

<li>There's been a lot of claim of "Fancruft" but no specific cited example. This article mirrors that of the <a href="../../../w/a/c/Wack_Pack_9f36.html" title="Wack Pack">Wack Pack</a> Article almost to a T in its' purpose, it will be made again in some form when it grows large in the main Opie and Anthony article. Deletion is whole-heartedly unnecessary, redundant, and destructive. And so far, I have seen no evidence to the contrary. <a href="../../../p/a/y/User%7EPayneos_9fd3.html" title="User:Payneos">Payneos</a> 19:05, 11 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then maybe we need to whack the <a href="../../../w/a/c/Wack_Pack_9f36.html" title="Wack Pack">Wack Pack</a> next.

<ul>
<li>I'm arguing on precident. The articles I've cited have been around much longer with little or no scrutiny. I think the articles all SHOULD remain, as I would fight for the Wack Pack as well, despite my not liking them personally, because it is a major part of Howard Stern's Show. That aside, there still has been no specific attempt to make the article better, just claim fancruft and move on. <a href="../../../p/a/y/User%7EPayneos_9fd3.html" title="User:Payneos">Payneos</a> 01:59, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> 1) No legitmate (Cambridge, Oxford, UL, UK, IE) accredited British institution appears on the lists. 2) Three state agencies note they are unaccredited. 3) We have NO <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> on what this is. 4) No notablity is offer with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. 5) One US state government called this a diploma mill. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 16:36, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> There is one good reason for keeping these sham institutions: since Wikipedia has such a high google ranking, anyone looking for information can see the WP page and learnt that it is, indeed, an unaccredited diploma mill since it's page will appear as # 2 or 3 probably. They can then further find out what a <a href="../../../d/i/p/Diploma_mill.html" title="Diploma mill">Diploma mill</a> is by following the links and, if truly ambitious, discover the entire shady world of such "institutions." That said, Wikipedia is not here to provide <i>caveat emptor</i> services and this place should be expunged.

<p>Contested Prod (of a contested CSD). Basically, if the title doesn't speak for itself I'm rather stunned. More seriously, there's no assertion of notability anywhere in the text (which is why it was originally CSD-listed), which has some elements of an attack page every now and then - consider, for example, the title of the image. Before anyone says <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> to me, the only reason why this is here gumming up the works is because the editors have a tendency to remove tags before admins get there. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_BigHaz_4c1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/BigHaz">Review me</a>) 09:23, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Please see the history before making a decision</b>. Somebody has come in 3 times to delete either part or all of the article. I suspect it's Mr. Sutherland himself.

<li><b>Comment</b> Is the fact that Mr Sutherland doesn't want an article about himself grounds for deletion? I do not believe so.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I am part of the art development team for this project. How would the administrator want it proven that this is real? Look at the history of this page. It has been vandalized almost every couple days. Some people feel threatened by this game and do not want it to come out, so it will be attacked often. It is an idea that people love or hate fanatically but it is not being made to upset people though we know that will be hated by insecure belief systems. It is being made to educate and promote free speech, an equal forum, and that people need to chill out in general and laugh. The attention negatively or positively proves its relevance. <small>—<i>the preceding comment is by</i> 68.5.137.93 - 19:24, 10 September 2006 UTC: <i><a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">Please sign your posts</a>!</i></small></li>

<li>Wikipedia is not a crystal ball. Articles about future events or products should assert the notability of said topic. As this is not a sequel to a notable game or a release by an established software house that makes the burden of proof especially important to establish. Reviews in mainstream gaming publications (PS3fanboy appears to fall someway short of that) would be a good start. You can find more info at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>. It may well be that this topic falls short of the standards demanded by Wikipedia and you should wait until the game has been released and enjoyed commercial success. As noted above, the subject matter and anecdotal opinions of unknown individuals are unimportant in the process of establishing suitability for inclusion on Wikipedia. <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> <small><a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk</a></small> 20:51, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

There are actually around 200 members of the Sideshow Freaks message board that have signed a petition to have that Medieval Kurgan created. That may be to low a number for Wikipedia, but that number has come in just 3 months. The importance is that Sideshow release a "modern" Connor Mcleod, "Origins" Connor, "Modern Duncan McLeod, "Origins" Duncan &amp; a "Modern" Kurgan...The one obvious omission is "Origins" Kurgan...Or Medieval Kurgan as we like to call him. All told Sideshow has sold around 3,000 of the Highlander based figures. WIth the creation of a Origins Kurgan the line would be complete.</p>

<p>The terms "virtual record" and "virtual album" are <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologisms.html" title="Neologisms">neologisms</a> coined by the one artist mentioned in the article header. Yahoo and Google searches show results for each term, but most, if not all of the results use the terms to mean something else. Virtual album hits mainly refer to photo albums, while virtual record hits refer to music, but not specifically to albums only availble online - some hit "virtual record labels" and some refer to "virtual records" as any digital version of an album (whether it is released in CD for as well or not). While the list of internet-only albums is a fair list, the actual purpose of the article, to define the terms "virtual album"/"virtual record" is the problem.</p>

<dd>I should note that the article is being used as a reference on pages for such albums which is what caught my attention. Album types are being changed to "virtual album" and "virtual album" is being replaced in the intro paragraph of the articles, while it is pretty unnecessary since almost every such article also includes the description that the albums can only be downloaded(such as most of the <a href="../../../i/t/u/ITunes_Originals_4591.html" title="ITunes Originals">iTunes Originals</a> articles) which to me is a problem since the term is not recognization by most people and isn't even a real term that is recognized by the industry or public - it's simply a term that this one artist coined (the person who created this article seems to be a fan and also created the article for the same artist's virtual album). Perhaps the article should be moved instead to List of downloadable-only albums or something like that, but I think that references to the terms virtual album and virtual record don't belong on wikipedia since they are not actual terms recognized by the public or any official music body that I can find. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheHYPO_6e9a.html" title="User:TheHYPO">TheHYPO</a> 21:53, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First of all...I understand people have the right to edit content as this is an "open source"...but I take serious issue with someone editing the description of my site, talking about is financial status (which is inaccurate, and to be completely honest no ones business), and someone's demand that they want the content deleted unless they are made a moderator of my forums. A basic Alexa search of our site notes a ranking of 190,000 (we all know Alexa is worthless) and for a site thats been active 9 months, we are doing quite well. I find it comical that someone (who obviously has an alterior motive here) has taken the time to find my site, and ask for its deletion. I also take issue with th editing done. The page was obviously hacked as content was deleted and inaccurate information, and blatant lies were posted. I also take strong exception to people demanding to be made mods of our site.....There is absolutely nothing being sold on HL, and in fact we only exist to help people make good buying decisions<small>—<i>the preceding comment is by</i> 70.189.173.65 - 03:19, 13 September 2006: <i><a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">Please sign your posts</a>!</i></small></p>

<dd>Hi. We are not discussing the discussion of the deletion of your site, just the article on Wikipedia. As <a href="../../../y/u/r/User%7EYurimxpxman_2f94.html" title="User:Yurimxpxman">Yurimxpxman</a> recognized, <a href="../../../m/y/_/User%7EMy_Alt_Account_c155.html" title="User:My Alt Account">My Alt Account</a> was kidding when he offered to change his vote; we'd tar and feather him if he actually did something like that. And Alexa rank when you're that low is pretty volatile; it's now at <a href="http://alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=hardwarelogic.com" class="external text" title="http://alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=hardwarelogic.com" rel="nofollow">272,631</a>.

But that's why we have <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">this review process</a>. I'm glad you're feeling you're doing well, and encourage you to keep it up.

<li><b>Comment (and Strong Keep)</b> It's interesting that the general concensus thus far is that HardwareLogic fails WP:WEB (Notability), but one of the criteria (and only one needs to be met) is that "The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster." HardwareLogic's content is, in fact, distributed via online publishers that are both well known and independent of the creators. Some examples include [H]ardOCP, PlanetAMD64, PCStats, TechReport, ReviewsHQ, ViperLair, Bjorn3D, TechPowerUp, TechArp, TheInquirer, MadShrimps, NTCompatible, and a number of other well known tech sites to the DIY (Do-It-Yourself) PC community. All one needs to do is Google some of the reviews posted on HardwareLogic and a list of multiple independent sites appear. Taking that into consideration, this clearly should qualify under #3 in the WP:WEB criteria. <small>—<i>the preceding comment is by</i> HL Supporter</small></li>

<p><small>Is it possible to find out who edited our content before we were nominated for deletion? I'd be interested in finding out who vandalized our site and added dishonest and inaccurate content</small></p>

If something is wrong, just fix it. BTW, do you see why find it odd that you don't know about checking page history, but you do feel qualified to argue about whether or not wikipedia policy suggests that HardwareLogic should be deleted? Why don't you stick around the place for a while, and learn the ins and outs, before you accuse so many people of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">bad faith</a>? <a href="../../../m/y/_/User%7EMy_Alt_Account_c155.html" title="User:My Alt Account">My Alt Account</a> 07:51, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

<ul>
<li><small><b>Strong Keep</b> i personally believe that hardawrelogic is a legitimate Wikipedia entry as is clearly meets the following criteria:</small></li>
</ul>
<p><small>1. the entry clearly meets the first entry in the Wikipedia criteria for web content which states: "The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself. This criterion excludes: Media re-prints of press releases and advertising for the content or site.[4] Trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that simply report the internet address, the times at which such content is updated or made available, a brief summary of the nature of the content or the publication of internet addresses and site or content descriptions in internet directories or online stores. This criterion includes reliable published works in all forms, such as newspaper and magazine articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations." To prove my point, do a Google search for any of the hardware that the site has reviewed in the past 9 months and you will get thousands of hits of reviews. that clearly falls under "This criterion includes reliable published works in all forms"</small></p>
<p><small>2. The entry also meets the third requirement under the Wikipedia criteria for web content which states the following: "The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster." planet amd64, tech report reviewshq.com and the modding den have all posted links of HardwareLogic's work on their site. In fact if your feeling froggy, do a search for a review for the Seasonic M12-500 modular power supply. HardwareLogic is the ONLY site that has currently reviewed this piece of hardware (as of September 13th 2006)</small></p>
<p><small>In closing I believe that this was a direct attack on HardwareLogic's credibility as an honest home-grown review site for the beggining computer enthusiast. I feel that this was purpotrated by a larger and more influential site that has began to lose ground and its credibility in the begginer's audience. Such attacks are childish and only prove the maturity level of "other" sites.</small></p>
<p><small>To those who support us, we thank you for your continued support and dedication to the HardwareLogic community. <small>—<i>the preceding comment is by</i> 65.191.49.254 - 07:48, 13 September 2006 UTC: <i><a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">Please sign your posts</a>!</i></small></small></p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I cannot believe someone on wikipedia would do this. Completely ublievable/</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> While I don't claim to know the ins and outs of wiki editing I find it difficult to believe that so much attention and discussion has ensued over such a harmless wiki page. Regargless of whether it "qualifies" according to these statutes written in legalese, who cares? It's not hurting anything. It's just a biography of a review website. The only people that should really care at all about it are the creators and members of the site. To be honest,and though I don't speak for everyone, I don't think it really matters if this page gets deleted or not, it's neither helping nor hurting us. What gauls me is the fact that people will expend so much effort into either discrediting us or removing us entirely from here. To me it seems that the wikipedia community is less focused on being an open vessel for knowledge as much as it is a contest to see who has a better grasp of the "policies and guidelines." 71.70.182.15 14:41, 13 September 2006 (UTC)Drew-and-not-U</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> If a site is going to be deleted, let's make sure some of those [i]really[/i] crappy sites get booted, not Hardware Logic.</li>

<p>This is a very good site for beginners such as myself. I fail to see the logic in deleting this site. There is a active community and reviews of the latest hardware available. JokerHL 16:12, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>If HardwareLogic is under consideration for being deleted for not conforming to Wiki's requirements, then shouldn't <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HardOCP" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HardOCP" rel="nofollow">HardOCP</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anandtech" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anandtech" rel="nofollow">Anandtech</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toms_Hardware" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toms_Hardware" rel="nofollow">Tom's Hardware</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameSpot" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameSpot" rel="nofollow">GameSpot</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p>HardawreLogic is like most all the other computer enthusiast review sites on the internet in the sense that it reviews computer hardware not for profit, but for the education of readers. HardwareLogic, however, focuses on helping beginners get their feet wet in computers as a hobby, or just to help answer questions for someone with a problem. Computer enthusiasts of all levels gather in the forum community to discuss the review articles, guides, and whatever else may be relevant technology. I see no reason why HardwareLogic should be deleted if the other other "identical" sites are allowed to stay. 66.227.222.173 21:53, 13 September 2006 (UTC)HL patron</p>
<dl>
<dd>No. Those review sites are NOT identical in that they're each about 100x bigger than HardwareLogic. If HardwareLogic rises to the same kind of prominence those sites have, it, too, will have an article. Hope this makes sense. If not, read <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. <a href="../../../m/y/_/User%7EMy_Alt_Account_c155.html" title="User:My Alt Account">My Alt Account</a> 21:57, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>So it's not the content and criteria that matter, but the 'size' of the site? I don't know, on my monitor, both HardwareLogic and those others look the same size. Or if by 'size' you're referring to popularity, then where in the WP:WEB does it state a specific hit count for a site to eligible? My interpretation of the WP:WEB is that there are content requirements, not popularity requirements...HL Supporter</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for registering; that makes things easier to follow. They are <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">notability</a> requirements, not content requirements. Popularity is different than notability, but related: <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> tend to cover things that are popular more than those that are obscure. This is unfortunate; you can look at <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kennedy_Toole_e946.html" title="John Kennedy Toole">John Kennedy Toole</a> to see how fickle fame and notability can be. Had events gone only a little differently, his <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulitzer_Prize_e802.html" title="Pulitzer Prize">Pulitzer</a>-winning novel could have been lost forever. On Wikipedia we don't document things that should be notable, but only those that have been noted sufficiently that we have enough <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> from which we can <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> the information that we provide to our readers.

<li>Hi. As you can see on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/HardwareLogic" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/HardwareLogic" rel="nofollow">other website AFDs</a> we generally let all and sundry participate unless they're egregiously ill-behaved. In this case, the previous AfD was too messy to call, so we've restricted this to established editors. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADeletion_review%2FLog%2F2006_September_5&amp;diff=74912717&amp;oldid=74911128" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ADeletion_review%2FLog%2F2006_September_5&amp;diff=74912717&amp;oldid=74911128" rel="nofollow">[53]</a> That seems regrettably necessary to me, as those commenters didn't seem to take time to understand how or why we make these decisions. Speaking of which, if you'd like to persuade people to change their votes, your best bet is to find <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable information</a>, hopefully showing that the site meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.

<p><b>Keep</b> Was a reasonably popular webcomic at one point. The fact that the artist updates much less frequently today (and that therefore the site is not visited as much) should not take from the notability that it had. When looking at alexa ranks, please note that loserzcomic.com is a relatively new url, &amp; the comic has been accessible by multiple urls since it left keenspace.--Isocyanide 16:20, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>OK, but, first, I don't understand why an infobox constitutes an encyclopedia article. Second, as far as availability of information goes, the info in the infobox came from somewhere (probably on the Internet), and it would be just as easy for users to find that info on the Internet as on a WP article. Why not do something like the following: make the names of the asteroids listed at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_asteroids.html" title="List of asteroids">List of asteroids</a> link to an external webpage where the info can be found, instead of a WP article that copied the info from that webpage? <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 17:38, 10 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There are plenty of external web pages that contain the same information as in <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geography_of_Italy_c5fa.html" title="Geography of Italy">Geography of Italy</a>. That is no reason to simply link from that article to those web pages, rather than having the information in the encyclopaedia article. We are here to write an encyclopaedia, not to make a collection of external links. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:20, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>But we should question the value of a WP article where, as here, <i>everything</i> can be found in a single external link. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 18:49, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>(1) The qualitative difference is in their notability. I'm not suggesting that the "single external link criterion" should solely determine whether a WP article should be deleted.

<li>I would add that info in the infobox doesn't address the question of notability. That the asteroid's eccentricity is x and its perihelion is y are details that simply aren't any more compelling than the size and weight of rocks in the Grand Canyon. <a href="../../../a/s/t/Asteroid.html" title="Asteroid">Asteroid</a> is a notable topic, and should have its own article. <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_%28geology%29.html" title="Rock (geology)">Rock (geology)</a> has its own article. But neither individual asteroids nor individual rocks on Earth should get their own articles, unless there's something notable about them. For example, the asteroid with the largest, or smallest, known eccentricity could get its own article. But having an eccentricity of 0.0294383 just doesn't assert notability. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 17:58, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's because your concept of notability is entirely subjective. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">Notability is not subjective</a>. We don't include or exclude articles on the basis of what individual editors personally find "compelling".

<ul>
<li>First, I have to <s>point out</s> argue that my concept of notability is in line with the consensus concept of notability that is central to many policies at WP, such as <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, and articles are deleted all the time on WP because of lack of that notability. <s>And the fact that the WP community has come to a consensus on what's notable and what's not in many categories (such as businesses), is evidence that notability is not entirely subjective.</s> Second, conceding for the sake of argument that the my concept of notability of many topics and facts is subjective, I would simply disagree that the data at issue <i>here</i>--numerical values of certain physical properties of a given asteroid--is even arguably notable. Such information has no relevance, or even potential relevance, to anybody (unless for example the asteroid is hurtling towards Earth, in which case I would certainly agree it's notable). <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 18:49, 10 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The concept of notability embodied in our guidelines such as WP:CORP is <i>not</i> the concept of notability that you are employing. I repeat: <i>Your</i> concept of notability, based around what you think is "compelling", is entirely subjective. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">Notability is not subjective</a>. Your argument that the data have no potential relevance to anybody is unsubstantiated, and I'm sure that there are astronomers who will disagree, just as there are entomologists who will disagree with those who, like you, might state that articles on obscure species of beetles have no potential relevance. We aren't here to judge knowledge. (The concept of notability employed by WP:CORP et al. doesn't involve Wikipedia editors making personal judgements, notice.) We are here to collect and to summarize it. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:58, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks for clarifying your earlier statement about notability, and if I had properly understood your earlier statement, your clarification wouldn't have been necessary. I apologize for that, and I have amended my response above appropriately. I submit that the concept of notability I am applying to 1826 Miller, is not subjective, but in line with the concept of notability embodied in WP:CORP and other established guidelines. Those guidelines rely, as you write in your essay, on the axiom that "A subject is notable if the world at large considers it to be notable," and the world at large doesn't deem data notable about an obscure asteroid, per my earlier points and the following replies to your response re: potential relevance, astronomers, and entomologists:</dd>

<dd>Re: potential relevance, I would argue that the burden is on the other side to demonstrate the potential relevance of data about an asteroid, one of &gt;100,000 listed here at WP. Re: astronomers and entomologists: It's the job of some astronomers to catalogue and publish data about asteroids, but even they wouldn't consider (would they?) that data "notable" in the sense required here. Likewise, it's the job of workers at government and other bureaucracies to compile and publish data about local businesses, but even they wouldn't consider (would they?) that data "notable" in the sense required here. In the latter case, WP:CORP has already spoken: that data's not notable. Likewise, a WP article containing nothing but the information about the classification of a species of beetle, should be merged with a list of beetles. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 14:53, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I should think we would be well served if someone wanted to put all that information in wiki - because the more facts we have, the better a reference tool we become.

The article had been vandalized, and the vandalized version then speedily deleted, twice, by administrators who hadn't checked far back enough in the article's history to see the non-vandalized version. I've undeleted and reverted to the non-vandalized version, which is about the Mark Barry who is a member of <a href="../../../b/b/m/BBMak_8b42.html" title="BBMak">BBMak</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:03, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I can't say that I'm quite familiar with the football fan scene in the UK, but this is surely a hoax article. It starts out by claiming such things as "the killing of a police horse in Glasgow which dared to stand on his foot", "the night he copped off with Kate Moss" and then just devolves into further nonsense. This explanation is probably much more than the article deserves. <a href="../../../b/j/a/WP%7EBJAODN_1a71.html" title="WP:BJAODN">WP:BJAODN</a> with it. --<a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbsolutDan_8213.html" title="User:AbsolutDan">AbsolutDan</a> <a href="../../../a/b/s/User_talk%7EAbsolutDan_d238.html" title="User talk:AbsolutDan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:46, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is absurd. Wikipedia's coverage of law is lacking. Why is big law defined yet small law is not defined at all. XOXO, vault, and jdjive which most members of the legal community read is totally ignored on wikipedia. I added Martindale Hubbel peer review which was also lacking. Most members of the legal community are familiar with toilet law--especially in New York and New Jersey where so many are prevalent. It's hard to believe that Wikipedia supports the dearth of information provided for the legal community and practice areas. Also the article about PIP was rediculous and so obviously wrong. Any toilet lawyer could tell you that. But I see noone even trying to edit this. Are any of the people who proposed deleting this even lawyers? I saw one law student and can only say that law students know absolutely nothing about the law.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Njlawyer06 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Njlawyer06_3d97.html" title="Special:Contributions/Njlawyer06">contribs</a>) 02:10, 11 September 2006 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s><small>One "vote" per person, please.</small> The way that your site screens terms is rediculous. First, laywers use Lexis and westaw and this isnt going to show up on google or whatever flavor of the week search engine tool you web geeks decide to use. This is reflected by the quality and amount of legal terminology used on this site, which is sparse at best. Second, the popularity of a term on the internet does not always correspond to its popularity in real life. Most lawyers regularly use the term toilet law. It is prevalently used on legal discussion boards and is as much a part of the legal community as the term Big Law. Third, I also see plenty of slang on wikipedia. Just the other day I was reading about a "nanny state." They even have such absurd categories as 9-11 conspiracies. Yet with all the absurd subjects that do not get deleted because some rube has a web page, basic legal terms and categories are totally ignored. Fourth, why would I update your legal listings if I am going to have a bevy of myopic web geeks censoring my posts. It is especially disheartneing to know that these "editors" have limited and sometimes no legal knowledge. I find it highly ironic that some of your legal terms have glaring errors and omissions. Why is it that the greatest interest on this term is not in verifying that terms are correctly defined; rather the singular focus seems to limit the breadth of terms defined on wikipedia. This sort of snobbery leads to an abridged exchange of ideas and circumvents any exercise int he free exchange of ideas.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Njlawyer06 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Njlawyer06_3d97.html" title="Special:Contributions/Njlawyer06">contribs</a>) 06:09, 11 September 2006 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>* It is a term widely used in well-traveled internet forums in the legal community. It is also a term widely used among young attorneys in communications <b>not</b> on the internet. The New York Times and other mainstream media publications routinely publish skewed articles like <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50D1FF8355A0C728CDDA00894DE404482" class="external free" title="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50D1FF8355A0C728CDDA00894DE404482" rel="nofollow">http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50D1FF8355A0C728CDDA00894DE404482</a> that portray attorney salaries as astronomical, when in fact less than 10% of young attorneys even see six figures. Most young attorneys start in the $40k and $50k range, but no one knows the truth. Wikipedia should keep the free exchange of ideas open, so the truth can be heard. As to the pronouncement that "toilet law" is "juvenile," allow me to point to other terms on Wikipedia like "DVDA," which is a slang term for "double vaginal, double anal," a sex position that has never been used. And as to slang terms not known to the general public, what about "hyphy," which is a term to describe an underground hip hop dance form originating from San Francisco? If "big law" is an entry, so should "toilet law," as "toilet firms" outnumbed BigLaw firms 50 to 1, yet the public readily associates attorneys with names like Skadden, Cravath and Wachtell, when sadly, that association is not based in reality.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 160.79.85.226 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_160.79.85.226_0466.html" title="Special:Contributions/160.79.85.226">contribs</a>) 15:31, 11 September 2006 (UTC).</small></li>

<li>I move for a <b>Speedy Delete</b> to end this agony.

<li><b>Keep</b>, although usage of the term "toilet" to refer to a sub-par firm or institution didn't originate with JdJive. It originated much earlier, years ago in fact, on the Princeton Review boards. There is common usage of this term among the ranking-obsessed overachiever crowd, who are all trying to "gun" for the top schools, top firms, and top credentials (see xoxohth.com - which arose from the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princeton_Review_c6c9.html" title="Princeton Review">Princeton Review</a> boards), although it might seem juvenile to outsiders. If we have commonly used terms on Wikipedia used by other subcultures, such as underground hip-hop and techies (as mentioned earlier), I don't see why we can't keep an open mind about this term. <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotoriousbhc_2455.html" title="User:Notoriousbhc">Notoriousbhc</a> 13:08, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> One of my most trusted correspondents in the yoga world writes, "I've never heard of this form of puja.

It would be a <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tantric.html" title="Tantric">tantric</a> practice, obviously." Which leaves me firmly sitting on the fence.

<p>Well-advertised but not notable festival in Louisville; only three years running and based on a film of narrow following. The idea that any well-advertised festival would be considered encyclopedic material would cause the Wikipedia to be flooded with articles that don't belong here. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevietheman_a9e5.html" title="User:Stevietheman"><font color="green"><b>Stevie is the man!</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevietheman_47c4.html" title="User talk:Stevietheman">Talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stevietheman_ecb3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stevietheman">Work</a></sup> 19:58, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The nom. begs the question by describing the festival as "not notable." How is the Big Lebowski, one of the most popular movies of the last decade, "a film of narrow following"? Now, a festival may not deserve its own page simply because it is "well-advertised," but why should that fact be held against it absent evidence of how many people attend? <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a>Allon Fambrizzi</li>
<li>Comment: As a Louisville resident, compared to many other events in town, I never hear of anyone talking about this one--I see signs, but no local news reviews or chatter.

<li>Paris Hilton is notable for being a member of a well-known American family, and has appeared in movies and tv shows.

I'm not very fond of the film myself, but they are correct in calling it a cult classic.

<li>The question of whether the film <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Big_Lebowski_a300.html" title="The Big Lebowski">The Big Lebowski</a> is hugely popular or largely unknown has no bearing on this discussion.

The 2 year old New York Times article comes close to establishing notability, but if you actually read the article, it's David Edelstein using the Lebowski Fest (noting "I suspect this will grow old pretty quickly...") as an excuse to talk about the movie.

<li><b>Keep</b> The nom makes the case for retention. In a mass media culture, anything well advertised becomes notable for that fact alone. This festival may not be covered in local newspapers, but it has gained international recognition by being featured in <i>The Guardian</i>, which is a UK national paper with a good reputation for covering the arts. It would be a disservice to wikipedia if google searches let The Grauniad (as it is popularly known) monopolise the field and wiki was nowhere to be seen.

<li>KEEP: The movie's oft-repeated, well-known catchphrases, all across the country ("the dude abides," "nice marmot," etc, etc. Tee-shirts, bumper stickers, and the like), attest to its status as a cult classic film with a small, but noteworthy subculture attached. Not just a following, but a subculture, I'd say. And Lebowski Fest is connected to that subculture. The movie's status as a cult classic would give credit to the entry of Lebowski Fest within the encyclopedia, as it serves as a reference point for those wishing to further study the subculture associated with the film. And I suspect that as the subculture grows into a long-standing and popular trend (akin, perhaps, to Deadheads?), the removal of the entry would only prove to be a mistake, as it would need to be re-added once the festival proves without question to be a notable event. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Lkmerc02 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lkmerc02_53e6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lkmerc02">contribs</a>)  21:53, 14 September 2006 - User's only edit.</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It is in poor taste to talk about casualty lists in terms of "notability."

<li>I don't believe it is in poor taste. We're not talking about the value of someone's life, but rather whether it was important enough to warrant inclusion in an encyclopedia. Sadly, 99% of the people in the world will lead normal, boring, regular lives and will not get to see their name in an encyclopedia, however tragic their death may have been.

<li>I deny that this article is a "memorial." In considering what is and isn't a memorial, intention is key: something ordinarily meaningless can become a "memorial" if done with a certain intention, like shooting free throws with your left hand instead of right see: <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hank_Gathers_3bdf.html" title="Hank Gathers">Hank Gathers</a>. The policy says, "Wikipedia is not the place to <i>honor</i> departed friends and relatives" (presumably by creating a biographical article about them). But this article is not intended to "honor" the victims but to simply state who in fact died. It thus falls outside the prohibition.</li>
<li>But there is one sentence from the policy which needs to be addressed: <i>Subjects of encyclopedia articles must have a claim to fame besides being fondly remembered.</i> But the "subject" of this article is not the individuals by themselves, but the individuals as a group. I agree with you that an article about any of them individually would not pass muster, but the prohibition by its terms does not reach casualty lists, which are not biographical in nature. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a>Allon Fambrizzi

<li>I've already voted, and here is where I will give my reason why. None of the people were in Wikipedia before August 27th (date of crash). It is possible that some of them will become notable, because their work may be "undiscovered" at this point. There is also the possibility that, as a result of the NTSB investigation, a person or persons may become notable (though unlikely). I voted the way I did <b>because of their notability as a group</b>. I already stated my reasons on the Comair page a long time ago, if this page is deleted, then <b>all</b> the names need to be deleted from the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comair_Flight_5191_aa8e.html" title="Comair Flight 5191">Comair Flight 5191</a> page, except perhaps the two pilot names since their names are the only one likely to be mentioned in the NTSB reports in the future. If this page is deleted, then I immediately request that the editor justify why all the other names will remain on the Comair 5191 page. Likewise the names of the rescuers would be non-notable. <a href="../../../m/f/i/User%7EMfields1_d689.html" title="User:Mfields1">Mfields1</a> 15:17, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Some names are necessary to help complete the narrative. Otherwise we have a lot of pronouns. <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 15:20, 11 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>None of the passenger names are needed in the narrative in the second paragraph of the "Victims" section. It is not titled well anyway - you cannot name 3 "victims" and exclude the 44 other victims, including mentioning the nationalities of 5. All the activities mentioned, exclusive of the crash, happen in this country every day - people from UK, Chicago White Sox minor leaguers, married people, persons on their honeymoon, Habitat ofr Humanity people, and yes Canadians and Japanese - they all fly every day. People meet other people at the airport every day - why is that shown as notable? The memorials are now past events - why is that a historical note? If it is, then it would be more important to list the names of those memorialized than the event itself. The section was incorrectly headed a long time ago - the section should be "passengers" or "Fatalities" or whatever - and other than a simple statement such as "47 passengers and 2 crew members were killed in the accident, with a lone survivor, the First Officer James Polehinke" I can't see all the other items as being encyclopedic. If they are, they we need to tell all the other stories too - the couple who were going on a 2nd honeymoon, the woman who was in Lexington to buy a horse, the man who missed the flight on Saturday and took the Sunday flight, etc. The problem is a few people early on embelished the section with their own prose, then when other editors wanted to add to it, they are being smacked down. <a href="../../../m/f/i/User%7EMfields1_d689.html" title="User:Mfields1">Mfields1</a> 22:13, 11 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My comment was limited to the names regarding pulling the first officer out, and the sequence of events leading up to the crash. Those names are not a big deal, because they complete the narrative regarding what happened. The list of names of everyone else in the crash doesn't do much for the article or the story of the Comair 5191. <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 22:15, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I entirely agree that the "human interest" stories about the couple on their honeymoon, etc., don't really belong either. I think it's in the article because CNN covered the honeymooner angle pretty extensively, but to be honest, the reason CNN covered it was to make money by playing on people's emotions, plain and simple. I don't need some manipulative human interest piece from CNN to remind me that when 49 people die that it's a horrible tragedy. Every person on that plane had hopes and dreams that were crushed. The fact that CNN decided to focus on the hopes and dreams of one couple, just in order to get more eyeballs, doesn't mean it should be included in Wikipedia.

<li><b>Delete</b> Many disasters have their own articles, and victims are not generally listed, because they were literally "just along for the ride" and had little or no role in causing the disaster. The pilots deserve mention by name as part of the narrative sequence of this story, when their action or failure to act is likely causal. Likewise if a passenger in an air crash shot the pilots or otherwise caused the crash like the 9/11 hijackers, they are an important part of the story. There is a victim list for the <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donner_Party_90ba.html" title="Donner Party">Donner Party</a> and the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbine_High_School_Shootings_ebd1.html" title="Columbine High School Shootings">Columbine High School Shootings</a> because their actions affected the outcome. But there need not be in general. However, see <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Airlines_Flight_77_728d.html" title="American Airlines Flight 77">American Airlines Flight 77</a> where about 12 non-notable passengers out of 54 victims get mentioned. <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabena_Flight_548_e8fd.html" title="Sabena Flight 548">Sabena Flight 548</a> mentions ice skaters and their coaches and families, and ignores the rest of the victims. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 23:14, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I can see two other articles that need to be looked at.

Granted, those may be exceptions because of the independent notability of many of the victims—the Munich disaster killed many players on a <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester_United_F.C._7c41.html" title="Manchester United F.C.">Manchester United</a> team that were two-time defending <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_League_First_Division_6af3.html" title="Football League First Division">English champions</a>, and the Superga disaster killed a <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torino_F.C._0621.html" title="Torino F.C.">Torino</a> team that had won five consecutive <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serie_A_5ded.html" title="Serie A">Serie A</a> titles.

<li>I agree with the consensus that Wikipedia isn't the place for such a list. I'd like to know what <i><b>is</b></i>. (Actually, I have a clue; you can bet there will be memorial sites sprouting all over the Net before too long.)

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion__The_Irish_Piano__ecbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/&quot;The Irish Piano&quot;">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Support for the article</span></h4>
<p>In support of keeping the article, I would like to bring up a few points. The current Wikipedia policy on the notability of films (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(films)" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(films)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(films)</a> ) is currently nothing more than a "proposed" policy. As such, it is subject to substantial future revisions, and, in theory, has no present authority. It is not my intent to disregard it completely, however, simply to note that, based on the policy being subject to substantial revisions, and that it is still not official, deleting The Irish Piano page on Wikipedia is, at this point in time, a grossly premature act based off of something not yet even official policy.</p>
<p>I do understand, however, that film notability is necessary to maintaining the integrity of Wikipedia (much like films must meet certain requirements to obtain a page on IMDb). I do believe that The Irish Piano's qualifications make it inherently notable to be on Wikipedia. The biggest qualification is that The Irish Piano is debuting at a film festival; surely film festival features are notable enough to be listed on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>As for verifiablity, most of the page doesn't really need to be verified (i.e. plot, film references, etc.). I think the only aspect that may need verifiability is that it is in fact in a film festival. The McFarland Film Festival is part of a bigger city festival in McFarland, WI, known as the Family Festival. The McFarland Film Festival is going to be a part of the Talent Show, one of several activities at the Family Festival. The McFarland Family Festival website can be found here: <a href="http://www.mcfarlandfamilyfestival.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.mcfarlandfamilyfestival.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mcfarlandfamilyfestival.org/</a> I will add in this citation.</p>
<p>As for having a homepage on myspace negating notability, that's simply denying notability to a film that does not have adequate resources to make an independent website. A myspace homepage in no way affects the quality of the film and certainly doesn't stop it from being featured in a film festival, a surefire sign of notability; in short, a homepage has absolutely nothing to do with notability. I understand the arguments against keeping The Irish Piano on Wikipedia, and for the most part feel them to be reasonable, but I respectfully feel that that point is not. Also, where does the definition of notability specify that a MySpace homepage negates notability? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Deltajuliet (<a href="../../../d/e/l/User_talk%7EDeltajuliet_951e.html" title="User talk:Deltajuliet">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Deltajuliet_404f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Deltajuliet">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> No, showing at a film festival is not enough to meet the standards. Many, many (most?) independent films (especially short films, almost universally) are screened at a few festivals and never heard from again. There is no coverage of this film from any external sources, which is the very definition of non-notable. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 21:29, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>In supporting keeping the article, I think that certain parts of the notability policy are a bit off. I mean, some smaller movies released by movie studios don't even make it to 200 theatres and don't get much, if any, advertisement. Yet, they may become huge on video or on the festival circuit.</p>
<p>And also, this film has no external sources now, but what if sometime in the future it does, and may become huge, much the way that a film like "<a href="../../../e/l/_/El_Mariachi_5209.html" title="El Mariachi">El Mariachi</a>" did. Then the argument of whether this article should be deleted, if it does get deleted, will have seemed unnessecary. So, in closing, I believe this article should be kept. --FreedomHampster 21:45, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>At this point there's nothing that puts your film even in 200 theatres, or 20.

I hope you guys are the next <i>El Mariachi</i>, and when that happens you can count on us to rewrite the article. But if we take the "one day it might be famous" approach, there's no end to it. I'm sure that before he shot a frame Rodriguez spent many hours with buddies and beers kicking the idea around. Before that, it was a vague notion he had on the bus. We can never cover everybody's sudden ideas and back-of-envelope sketches, so we've drawn some lines that we think will let us build a good encyclopedia.

<p>I added "please don't delete" but am not the creator (I'm Star Army's admin). It was likely one of my community's members. The notice said it could be removed if there was objection to deletion, so and I removed it because I objected. While my site isn't huge, I believe wholeheartedly it isn't insignificant. It has members from all over the world, from Japan and South Africa, to the U.K., Argentina, and of course home in the U.S. It recieves about fourty thousand visitors yearly and has set itself above the masses of fly-by-night crap role-play sites that give online text-based role-playing games a bad name. Our presence at conventions and close connection to the internet phenomenon that is 4chan are also significant to those involved. For these reasons, I ask that the mark for deletion be removed.</p>
<p>Thanks, Wes</p>

<dd>Unforunately, with the Internet being intrinsically international, having international members isn't much of a claim to notability. In order to merit an article, the website must demonstrate meeting criteria proposed in <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. This criteria is derived from <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> guildelines, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> policies, and the availability of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, which allow us to avoid <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. This all helps to build an informative, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> article. Remember that Wikipedia is also <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not a web directory or indiscriminate collection of information</a>. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 23:01, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First, Wes and I are not the same person. Please don't jump to conclusions.&#160;:) While I have no objections to removing the article if it indeed does not meet Wikipedia's standards, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> seems to be unduly harsh, and doesn't seem to be fully enforced. Under its strict definition, even a popular, critically acclaimed <a href="../../../w/e/b/Webcomic.html" title="Webcomic">webcomic</a> like <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominic_Deegan_6803.html" title="Dominic Deegan">Dominic Deegan</a> would fail the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> test, since the article on <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominic_Deegan_6803.html" title="Dominic Deegan">Dominic Deegan</a> itself makes no attempt to offer evidence that it passes <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> in the first place. I'm not looking to stir up trouble here, but it would be greatly appreciated if <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> could be further clarified, as it seems somewhat subjective right now.

<dd>I wasn't suggesting to prod them. (The prodding system doesn't work very well--there are people who go through the category and remove entries without explanation or good reason.) Just go straight to the deletion debate. I am familiar with that web project. If you read the first paragraph, it links directly to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">website notability guidelines, (aka WP:WEB).</a> Webcomics tend to create articles for a lot of non-notable sites.

Most of the keeps are also "no concensus keeps".

<p>[<i>from talk page:</i>] I will speak up.</p>
<p>Some SA players have discussed this issue. Though we understand, in a vague sort of way, that we are not up to snuff with Wikipedia, I find that if several webcomics, some of dubious fame or importance, are allowed stubs under their own WikiProject, why can't Star Army exist on Wikipedia as well? We've established ourselves well enough, and we are one of the few all-original RP universes that has any true depth.</p>
<p>I only ask for balance.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>I agree on this point</i>. While I stated that SA probably isnt of sufficient note to have a Wiki article, the Project Webcomics issue is a prime example of blatant stubs and advertisements, most of them with little note and little following. While a project for webcomics certainly has a place, webcomics should follow the same rules everyone else does. Nonnotable little ass-end bits of the web dont belong on Wiki. Sekiko</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
I also agree with this. Star Army has reinstated my interest in the world of roleplaying. While some might not like the level of technology present I myself feel it adds to the ability to incorperate new and exciting things of ones own creation into the game that simply wouldn't fit into so many others. I would find it difficult to find many if any other online roleplaying games that have such depth and yet are easy to get involved with and play.

<p>This has already being played on The Ohio State University campus. If you search on X3i Divinity more sites would come up on google. Its a popular internet series as well. Four episodes are finished, have been on television (and still are) and the Four episodes are online.</p>
<p>This is my first time posting on Wikipedia but I am trying to follow the guidelines as best I can (and as quickly as I can). Please give me some time.</p>
<p>The show plays on the "Buckeye TV" channel, which is already on Wikipedia. I'm just branching off on this specific series.</p>

<p>What needs to be done?? This is an Ohio State television series that is played on Buckeye TV, whhich is already on wikipedia. This is Ohio States first sci/fi drama television series. And to our knowledge thus far, the first sci/fi drama series created at Any college. Just because it didnt come up in a main search in google, shouldnt mean much. There is some dell out there with the name X3i, which makes it hard to find under google. Like I said, if u search "X3i Divinity" or "X3i Cobra Productions" more options would come up. Please do not delete this after all the work we have been putting into it all day long. Especially after this late of notice..</p>

<p>Im still lost on the whole situation.</p>
<p>I do not understand your stance that Buck-i TV as a station is of significance for your site, yet the programming on the station is not (even if the given program is on the current roster of available shows as it has been for approximately two years.) I'm sure you are aware of the vast number of persons who attend The Ohio State University, and though they may not all watch the show, it is available to them via the network. I think the popularity of this actual show is only as relevant as the popularity of the network it appears on. Again, Buck-i TV made the cut. Also, about your request for a valid or notable review, I point to Buck-i TV as our source. Any notable review of the station would naturally have an overview of the programming. If that event has occured anytime within the last two years, X3i would have been a part of that review. Although I do not have any specific article to point out to you or that information readily at hand, it seems only natural that these two things would be connected. Our popular success is not soley connected to Buck-i TV, though. Our series and upcoming movie have had various viewings and reviews from multiple websites (and forums). I understand that you have rules and regulations, but it seems illogical that these criteria would invalidate the experiences and opinions of a rather large online, interactive community. I really do not wish to be confrontational about this. Any personal investment I may have in this project witholding, I still believe that the crux of this argument is that X3i is real, it is visible and consumable, and it is part of a network/community that is, or at least should be, recognized. I thank you for your time and hope to hear from you regarding this matter once again.</p>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Revelations" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Revelations" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Revelations</a></p>
<p>This is a link to a wikipedia page for an internet fan film which did not have a national theater release. Though, I do not doubt it's notability, it does cast a shadow over the arguement made regarding X3i's non-theater release and significance. At the bottom of the linked page is a list of other such internet fan films, mostly regarding Star Wars (unofficially) that also fail to meet the release criteria.</p>
<p>Because I feel this debate is becoming circular, and I feel as though no matter what evidence or arguements I present I will be countered with continued, perhaps repetitive rebuttal, I am beginning to question the overall objectivity of this evaluation. I would like to state that X3i as a series or movie, nor its creators, are seeking this inclusion into the Wikipedia database as a means for promotion or even validation. Our own accomplishments with the network, internet viewings, and forums are satisfying enough for both of those departments.</p>
<p>I am being told now, as before, that X3i is failing to meet this or that certain criteria, but I feel I have provided sufficient evidence or argument to the contrary on all accounts. Aside from that, many of these supposed requirements being presented are not requirements even being met by other wikipedia entries.</p>
<p>-AXanderSR</p>
<p>ps - this is proof of X3i playing on many college campus's across the states. We play on OSTN</p>

<p>See, that is the sort of argument I was talking about--circular. You failed to present a case against the majority of my statements. One film being THE exception is not a valid or objective point. Who or what exactly determines what is or is not an exception? It is also untrue. I directed you to the bottom of the page where there are links to other such fan films. I guess I will have to lay them out for you.</p>

<p>SO, the series is more than a mere burb on some insignificant local college station, it aires on televisions across multiple college universities. As a courtesy of debate, I would appreciate if you would take the time and consideration to provide clear and concise reasoning for your arguements, as well as meet each point or topic within my rebuttals. I do not think that is too much to ask.</p>
<p>I never made any judgements about the quality of the other productions. The greatest concern you have brought up is a clear lack of professionalism, tact, and objectivity. I doubt Wikipedia or any other professional institution would accept your words as being representative of their own. You have failed to address several concerns and FACTS being brought up about the topic, and I do not wish to continue this "debate" with you. I would like to speak to another moderator, who, hopefully, will display the positive qualities you seem to lack.</p>
<p>I think those five people would have the sense to look at the same evidence and arguments that have been presented to you with objective clarity and worthwhile commentary.</p>

<p>The result was <b>delete.</b> The article (at least currently) describes the language as constructed, so all comments about whether or not this language is "fake" are pretty much irrelevant. I have disregarded count completely: first of all, there were too many votes, but also it was clear that some kind of promotion of this debate took place somewhere. The policies this article would have to pass are <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, just like every other article. All <i>three</i> are an issue here. Let me handle them one at a time. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> -- the issue here is how to present the substance of the Siberian language work. It's mentioned in the article that "some consider their approach unscientific," but regardless, the viewpoints go way beyond the sources, so <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> dictates that the article should at best be dramatically shortened. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> (notability) is somewhat of a problem, because without any published <i>linguistic</i> analysis of this, there's not much we can say. The <i>project</i> may be notable, as it's been covered in some media sources, though, but it's borderline, and the article is really about the language anyway. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a soapbox applies also, but <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is the biggest issue: while WP policy leaves open the idea that we can use foreign language-only sources in an article, it's a <i>bad idea</i> in a case like this one where the claims go well beyond basic description: really, until there are source in English, the en.wiki community cannot maintain a policy-compliant article on this topic. While I considered a weasely "no consensus" close here, it's <i>clearly</i> in the interests of the community to have a decision here, and move on. And consensus is important for <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> but not so much for <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> anyway. Okay. I hope that explains my reasoning: I read every comment, and looked as best as I could at every issue. I do hope that if there's a deletion review, or any further debate on this topic that those of you who came here to simply add as many votes as possible will <i>not</i> participate: you know who you are, and you're just making all this more difficult. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 14:35, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

Article may need to be re-classified, but, besides that, seems to adequately describe the cultural phenomenon (initiative on codification of dialects). It isn't OR, it's an article <i>about</i> OR.

This bears every appearance of being an astroturfing campaign; Yaroslav Zolotaryov is a leader in the web community which promotes this.

<dd>Frankly, I can't see why the references must necessarily be <i>in English</i>. Is there any policy regarding that? If so, I'd be very unpleasantly surprised, as it would show utter disregard for the non-Anglosaxon rest of the world!

<dd>Here you go - i know Russian, but i live in Israel, so i think i'm rather neutral, does that count? You'll just have to believe me that i'm rather indifferent to the politics of Moscow vs. Siberia vs. Belarus vs. Ukraine. I also know a few things about <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linguistics.html" title="Linguistics">Linguistics</a> (that's my major) and in particular about Slavic linguistics and dialectology. And based on all of the above i can say that this project is valid:
<dl>
<dd>It's true that it may be done by a small group - but the creation of <a href="../../../e/s/p/Esperanto.html" title="Esperanto">Esperanto</a> (spoken by over a millions now) and the creation of modern spoken <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew.html" title="Hebrew">Hebrew</a> (spoken by over 6 million now) were also works of very small groups.</dd>
<dd>It's true that this group has a certain "national" agenda, but it is very haphazard and i didn't see anything extremist or outright anti-Russian in it.</dd>
<dd>It's true that to speakers of Russian this language looks like Cockney or Redneck English put to writing, but they completely ignore the fact that it has a dictionary of over 20,000 words and a complete grammar.</dd>
<dd>They also ignore the fact that this grammar is rather different from Russian. The verb tense system is radically different, it has the definite article which is completely absent in Russian, and it has different phonology. All these things are very well documented as actual features of Northern Russian dialects. Now a group comes and makes a literary language out of these dialects. Let me tell you a secret - many major literary world languages started out as compromises between several dialects that were codified by scientists and promoted in schools by governments. After a few generations they became natural languages. Such are German, Indonesian and Urdu, for example.</dd>

<dd>Let me also point out that this language seems to be part of the grey area between <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_language.html" title="Natural language">natural languages</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constructed_language.html" title="Constructed language">constructed languages</a>. It is constructed, but for 100 % based on natlang stuff, and apparently made with the intention of it becoming a spoken language. Another case in point: <a href="../../../r/u/m/Rumantsch_Grischun_8639.html" title="Rumantsch Grischun">Rumantsch Grischun</a>, created in 1982 on the basis of various Rhaetoromance dialects. Nobody would deny its notability, and many living languages started their carreers the same way. A frequently used method of distinguishing natural languages from constructed languages is this: as soon as a language has second-generation native speakers, it cannot be classified any longer as a constructed language. However, no one would argue that this would be a condition for inclusion here. —<a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> <a href="../../../i/j/z/User_talk%7EIJzeren_Jan_0de3.html" title="User talk:IJzeren Jan"><font color="green"><sub><i>Uszkiełtu?</i></sub></font></a> 19:24, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Interesting analogy. What does Wikipedia say about Romansh? "Romansh is not a single language but a group of closely-related dialects, all belonging to the family of the Rhaeto-Romance languages." And: "Romansh was standardised in 1982 by Zürich-based linguist Heinrich Schmid. The standardised language, called Rumantsch Grischun, has not been very well accepted, and speakers of the different dialects tend to address one another in German." Of course, Wikipedia has an article on Romansh - as it is considered an offical "language" of Switzerland and literature in the Engadine dialect exists since the 16th century.

The references above the discussion are not fake, but they are not about this constructed language, but about real dialects of Siberia. Those dialects are spoken in villages, but not widely. So-called siberian language uses some words from this dialects, but it is still a colang. Nobody speaks it. I think you should note that <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaximaximax_5f36.html" title="User:Maximaximax">MaxiMaxiMax</a> voted "deleate".

<li><b>STRONG DELETE</b>: I wonder how this subject is again on discussion, probably people who allow it didn’t even devote a day to researching this language. Its an invented language by a couple of russophobs (or even only one). The "siberian language" is a fantasy which is only based on different dialects all over Siberia (just look at area of it and imagine how many EU countries fit in it).i underline the word DIFFERENT as sometimes met in one village is not met in another (due to very local dialect) Sometimes its not even a dialects it’s a word or phrases used in a single village for a generation or two and noticed nowhere exept that place (its like a “local slang” if we say it modern in words. But Zolotorev makes it a point even if it was used only on 0,1% of Siberian territory and only by around hundred of people living in a village (I probably will insult Zolotarev saying that every yard has its own slang but whatever). Also many of this language is based on phrases of uneducated population and what is presented by Zolotarev as a grammar or phrase building structure due to cutting endings or putting them in to the wrong plague. The bases of all this Zolotorev’s insanity is an old russian (which is no longer used and which was used ALL OVER RUSSIA and not only in Siveria), and when this platform is not enough - mr. Zolotarev takes an Ukrainian language and invents smth from this. As a greatest development of fantasy mr Zolotorev even was thinking of giving Siberean an arabian writing, but I think now he had to give it up coz its “too much”. Also some sources given here by zolotorev are not standing on his point of view or even sometimes made with his cooperation (web sources). I ask mr.Zolotarev not to comment my message (he wont get an answer anyway) because i'm sick enough of his lifejournal messages asking to vote for keeping his language fantasy in wikipedia and I will not devote my time for discussing his fantasies. 213.171.61.131 14:18, 3 September 2006 (UTC)Jaroslav S.</li>

<li><b>STRONG COMMENT</b>. People, this is nót the place to fight a world war! This is nót the place for Russian nationalists and Siberian separatists to decide upon the future of Russia. This is an encyclopedia. All that should matter is the question: is the subject significant enough to warrant an article? The emotions that it seems to evoke in certain circles seem like a good indication that the language is perhaps a tad more notable than the average conlang (which definitely would not evoke such reactions). For the record, I think all the campaigning around this AfD is a Bad Thing: trying to whip up support in the Russian wiki (where the article was voted down) and among people who voted for deletion previous, is surely not a very elegant thing to do! Oh, and please, STOP WRITING IN CAPITALS, because it reminds pretty much of shouting.

<dd>Dear Yaroslav, this your claim is just another quite fine illustration of your deeds. Nat Krause's descriptions were <b>not</b> changed (except at the single insignificant place).

I did not write anything about politics in the article, but russians did. So all this political aspect here is only your guilt. Please acknowledge, that all your speeches here is lie, and you have <b>only one motivation</b>, only one goal - you fear Siberians, you fear Free Siberia. So you want to bring your politics, your fear even to this non-political article. My friend Xcobo, he is Lojban lover, said in his LJ about all this "discussion" - "if this is simple non-notable conlang, even simple conlang like Lojban and Esperanto, so why had they come with so big accusations in big amount? They simply feel the strange power of this Language and they fear it". Such were words of non-wikipedic and non-Siberian person about all this meeting, which was prepared by ruwiki in best traditions of Stalin's "judgements".

<dd>It is quite correct, language Standard is based on them and every Northern dialect speaker can recognize the words. Just your opression makes the language movement more political - you opress by unknown reasons, so members of the movement became more angry. You can see in Wiki just top leaders of linguistic department, but in reality this is wide international movement, so all your efforts is in vain. Will the article be in wikipedia, or will not be, will be siberian wiki or will not be, this is objective process, it will develop anyway.

<dd>Ok, the refrences about project itself were given in the article. Some of them were removed by the oppisite part. I can discuss about those removed refrences for example and prove that they hav relation to the project. But according to wikimedia polices, if something was mentioned in the press, the article sholud be. But you only speak about politics, about dialects etc, when your friends try to take refrences from the article, that's all. All your speeches in this place are only demagogia with one goal - change the topic of the discussion when the answer is clear: the project is mentioned in press and the article should be in wiki --Yaroslav Zolotaryov 16:59, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, this doesn't really answer my question. I've no doubt that many Russians are very nationalistic, and some of these let it get in the way of logic. But the plain fact is there are obviously hardly any non-Russian, native English speakers who can even evaluate the sources on this article. It seems like a waste of time for us to even debate it. Either way, we are relying on the explanations of fellow wikipedians who <b>can</b> read the sources. <a href="../../../m/y/_/User%7EMy_Alt_Account_c155.html" title="User:My Alt Account">My Alt Account</a> 00:02, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I try to help as much as i can. My native language is Russian, but i live in Israel and i am very far from being a Russian nationalist. I support Siberian language out of linguistic curiosity (linguistics is my major) and the political cause of Volgota is of little interest to me. As i mentioned earlier in the discussion, this is a conlang developed by a small group, but it is rather more than <a href="../../../e/s/p/Esperanto.html" title="Esperanto">Esperanto</a> or <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slovio.html" title="Slovio">Slovio</a> - this actually aims at becoming spoken as a revived natural language. Thus i find it linguistically valid, albeit rather haphazard at the time. Think of it as a language developed by a wikimob instead of a commitee. The times they are a-changing. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmire80_66b2.html" title="User:Amire80">Amir E. Aharoni</a> 05:15, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article is nothing more than political propoganda. It's supposed to be an article about Asian people, but excludes anyone from West Asia because the Arab world has become controversial so people don't want them tarnishing the Asian name. You could make the argument that Asian has replaced the racial groups formally described as <a href="../../../m/o/n/Mongoloid.html" title="Mongoloid">Mongoloid</a> or Oriental, but then why are Indians included? It's obvious that Indians are included because the people who created this article do not want to associate themselves with their racial heritage and so choose a geographic category that trancends race, yet they arbitrary exclude the controversial West Asian (i.e. Arabs) for political reasons. They are trying to have it both ways. They include non-Oriental Indians in the Asian category because they want to associate tyhemselves with their continent of origin and not their race of origin, but they conveniently exclude West Asians because the Arab world is controversial, even though most white people can't tell the difference between an Indian and an Arab, yet can most certainly differentiate an Indian from an Oriental. This article is pure crap. Politically motivated biased POV crap. Asianpeople 23:26, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Asian is neither Oriental nor Mongoloid and it includes a different set of people. The <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_%28people%29.html" title="Asian (people)">Asian (people)</a> article had many citations to verify its claims. These citations said West Asians (Arabs) are not considered Asian, due to American English parlance and cultural reasons. Racial definitions formed by different criteria are not concordant. Anthrometric, cultural and genetic races are not concordant. It is deceptive that the user name you created for yourself a little while ago is "Asian people" (implying you identify as an Asian person).--<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Tichondrias_cd32.html" title="User:Dark Tichondrias">Dark Tichondrias</a> 23:46, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> looks notable beyond her WWE affiliation. Might I add that it's been less than a month since the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Camille_Anderson_b58b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Camille Anderson">first AfD discussion</a> on this article, which I feel is too soon to be renominating. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaDark_fa76.html" title="User:VegaDark">VegaDark</a> 01:22, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Having bit parts in a few movies and being in a few magazines doesn't make her much more notable (if that) than anyone else, and with the 6 articles/examples I have shown, some of them had more creditentials than she did and were still deleted. It is not too soon to renominate, based on the examples and precedents set by those listed above. And some of the other <a href="../../../w/w/e/WWE_Diva_Search_8465.html" title="WWE Diva Search">WWE Diva Search</a> contestants are also protected and speedied. <a href="../../../r/e/n/User%7ERenosecond_03c0.html" title="User:Renosecond">Renosecond</a> 03:56, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> per source verifying some of the claims. Still needs a rewrite deleting some of the original research but it does appear as if this pastry is one of the city's claims to fame.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - I have de-yumified the article and included a number of citations. It certainly could use more re-writting but it is less sugary. It is very clear from Google that the Persian is available at a large number of establishments in town and has been around long enough to have a number of competing claims to its creation. So it is not a simple promo/vanity by a single baker. Also, interestingly, there is a claim that it is named for Blackjack Pershing (I have included this on the page). Regarding the relability of sources, it appears in a goodly number of different "what to do" pages about Thunder Bay. This is about what one should expect in a not-so-media-dense place. I'm sure the next time that Frank Bruni or Johnny Apple from the New York Times is in TB they will do a write-up. Til then, I think the voice of the locals is sufficient. Finally, I think is exactly the sort of regionalism that is important to preserve and document. <a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdclevenger_e059.html" title="User:Jdclevenger">Jdclevenger</a> 02:18, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> - I appreciate your realization and support. I'm a former resident of the city (born and raised) and I can tell you that the pending inclusion of the Persian to the Wikipedia database has many locals raving. Not only is it the city's claim to fame, with the dying pulp &amp; paper industry in the region it seems that the emerging industry is tourism - and the Persian is just one more thing that the local economy thrives on.--Quaresimaj 20:48, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I have rewritten the entry again. I think it now has an encylopedia tone. I need to add one or two citations within the text, although the external links are basically what will be used.
