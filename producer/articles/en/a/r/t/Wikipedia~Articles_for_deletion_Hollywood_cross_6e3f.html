Something like the <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_Cathedral_6dbd.html" title="Crystal Cathedral">Crystal Cathedral</a> is worthy of an article because it's a notable monument about which people will seek information.

<dd>Well, your attitude is disapointing. There's nothing 'random' about it. It's a public monument. I don't see why you get to choose what people can read about, and I don't see anything about 'notability' in the deletion policy. Sure its an encyclopedia, and anything that is verifiable and real should go into it. Not just what you feel is important. Your approach leads to huge disputes over what is or isn't important to different people. To someone living in the area the monument is probably more notable than something like Slashdot. To someone who browses slashdot, that is more notable. Both are verifiable, so let them stay. For great justice. 23:43, 4 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b>. My attitude is irrelevant. Wikipedia is about a consensus. You seem to think your opinion alone should take precedence. Wikipedia was designed not to be a giant repository of every known fact in the universe -- and to achieve that, information would necessarily be random -- but like any encyclopedia it was designed to encapsulate more notable information. You say, <i>Sure its [sic] an encyclopedia, and anything that is verifiable and real should go into it.</i> I'm sorry, that's <i>not</i> what Wikipedia is. That approach is in direct contradiction to Wiki's stated purposes. Have you read <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">what Wikipedia is not</a>? Your arguments strongly suggest you have not. I live in metro LA; I've never met anyone who said the Hollywood cross was a notable monument. No one seems to have linked anything here which verifies that it is, in fact, a notable monument. It is your <i>opinion</i> it is a notable monument, but opinions are not fact, and your opinion carries no more weight than anyone else's. If you think this is a notable monument, where is the proof that it is notable? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidHoag_23c6.html" title="User:DavidHoag">David Hoag</a> 02:48, 5 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The definition of notable is subjective. I can't 'proove' it's notable any more than I can proove that I want to keep it. That's the problem with your attitude. You don't like it, so you think no one else should have access to that information. That's wrong. For great justice. 05:15, 5 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b>. Of course notability can be proven or disproven. Others have already done so in this very discussion. That's what the whole AfD process is about, to review collectively the notability of flagged entries. And nowhere did I say "I didn't like it" so please don't put words in my mouth. You're making value judgments about me out of thin air. And it's not about restricting access. You're free to start your own free webpage on Geocities and talk about this particular cross, where you can provide all the information and photographs you want, which will be found via search engines. The entry simply is not encyclopedic nor is the subject notable at this time, as the consensus here seems to be showing. That's not to say it might not be notable in the future, although I do find that hard to believe, considering how small this particular cross is and how difficult it is to see. So please stop trying to make this into some martyr issue or some free speech issue, when it is neither. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidHoag_23c6.html" title="User:DavidHoag">David Hoag</a> 05:52, 5 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The issue is that 'notability' is a concept that does not appear in the deletion guidelines. It means nothing more than 'things I don't like or don't approve of', and, if a majority of people who post on AFD are also not interested, then no one can look it up here. That's a terrible editorial policy. In fact, if you read the deletion guidelines, it ISN'T Wikipedia's policy. For good reason. For great justice. 06:56, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Nothing special about it. It barely has anything about it on google. It's only claim to prominence is that the cross originally on the LA seal was actually a picture of it. The problem is that all the sources I have seen which claim the cross was included on the seal to represent the "Holywood cross" seem like they'd do anything to strongly push forward a certain point of view( namely that evil atheists are trying to take over the country). What seems a better source, <a href="http://lacounty.info/old%20seal.htm" class="external text" title="http://lacounty.info/old%20seal.htm" rel="nofollow">the LA website's page for the old seal</a> claims that the cross on the seal represents, "the influence of the church and the missions of California." This would seem to mean the seal of LA has nothing to do with the holywood cross, thus destroying it's one claim to notability. If anybody can show otherwise (through a reliable source), I'd be willing to change my vote. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowoftime_3763.html" title="User:Shadowoftime">Shadowoftime</a> 22:26, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
