Though never fully published, it has wielded a powerful influence over a long line of students and teachers of philosophy."</i> Wolstein then goes on to say that the evaluation of AWM has been difficult because his papers were not made available to him. He concludes: <i>"His place in American philosophy, when assessed by his meagre writings, definitely hinges upon what becomes of the experimental naturalism of which he was a founding father."</i> I will leave to someone else to read the whole article, but this seems at the very least to be a case where "<a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_paper_aa2d.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not paper">Wikipedia is not paper</a>" can be applied. / <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 19:10, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> -- Similar problems like this one are going to turn up. The Wikipedians who have been writing articles on the various notable movies and TV shows have been creating separate articles for each and every actor. So every once in a while, there will be an actor that can only be summed up in 1-2 sentences. So what should we do about it? <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> 00:03, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>I believe there should be an official policy of expanding existing articles instead of creating new ones.

The only thing resembling a "popular book" that Amazon knows about is <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 9971509393</a> <i>Neural Networks: Computers With Intuition</i> by S. Brunak and B. Lautrup (i.e. he's not the senior author). Amazon sales rank is #3,254,333 which is definitely non-notable. All of the other contributions indicate a very solid level of achievement in the academic world and perhaps would merit a mention in whatever would be the Danish equivalent of "Who's Who in Science and Engineering," but not an encyclopedia article.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. A published (and translated) book, a reasonable number of scientific publications in refereed journals, and also having been chairman for a (small) research centre for more than 10 years makes him notable enough for Wikipedia. More notable than the average (American) professor. But just as has been suggested before, we could use a rule that is easier to apply and less prone to differences in education terminology than the "average professor test". <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlarm_3336.html" title="User:Alarm">Alarm</a> 10:57, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hey there BWF89, how do you do? It's sad that your first article has fallen right into the VfD, but don't worry, it's nothing personal. Sooner or later you will <i>get</i> what is generally considered notable and what is considered non-notable around these parts. There are different criterias for different areas. It can be confusing at times. But basically, when it comes to software, everything that isn't quite notable is considered advertising. Since we are on the internet, that happens quite frequently, so a more rigid criteria has to be adopted on these instances. If you feel that a certain article about a software isn't notable enough to be on the Wikipedia and you have some degree of proof to back you up, you can nominate it and we will vote on it on the same manner. Don't feel discouraged. --<a href="../../../s/n/0/User%7ESn0wflake_8d39.html" title="User:Sn0wflake">Sn0wflake</a> 01:06, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Certainly notable and should be expanded, but if not: <b>merge</b> with <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodor_Herzl_a77f.html" title="Theodor Herzl">Theodor Herzl</a> and <b>redirect</b>. It can always be recreated later with more content. (However, the Herzl article already has a link to an English translation of <i>Der Judenstaat</i>.

<li><b>Speedy Redirect</b>. It's all very well saying expand, but are you going to do it? Whoever created this article appears to have done it purely to advertise their website.

<li>I don't understand the concern over the link. It's not to a commercial site. It just links to the plain book. But, since it troubles you, I'll wikisource the book (now done). This seems like one of the most influential books ever written as far as its impact on modern geopolitics. A redirect discourages any future development, better to simply delete than that. In contrast, a brief stub encourages development. <a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolfman_124d.html" title="User:Wolfman">Wolfman</a> 17:58, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Having just read the entry for <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">Fancruft</a>, I reluctantly agree that a musical tour of a big name artist is an event large enough to justify its own page. However, I favour retaining information about future tours within the artist's main page and only forking off a separate page after the tour has occured and the level of detail has risen sufficiently for the separate page to be clearly larger than a stub (and for there to be no doubt that it's not promotional in nature). I'm not familiar with Wikipedia procedures; If it's deleted now can it come back later? <i>...at 08:33, 2005 Feb 16 <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKrisjohn_8e7f.html" title="User:Krisjohn">Krisjohn</a> forgot the twiddles</i></li>

<li>Information about major tours by popular artists would fit nicely in a music encyclopedia, and I don't think it says anywhere that WP limits itself to being a "general" encyclopedia. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 10:44, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> as unnecessary detail for insufficiently notable performer; speculative, with no verifiable content except a schedule of future events; and for the not-quite-policy reason that WP has already VfD'ed other Ashlee-excess-detail breakout articles. This has already gotten into past rounds of Requests for Comment and I hope it ends instead of leading to feuding. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 14:51, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>And appealing to precedent doesn't make much sense.

<li>Fine. We can consolidate all the information on her concerts past present and future onto this article if it gets kept. But there's no sense in deleting it.

<ul>
<li>Wouldn't it be easier and more productive to create a new page such as List of Ashlee Simpson tours and use the existing information as a starting point? I'm not sure how keeping this article (US tour, 2005) would be helpful to readers or editors. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarrp_dc22.html" title="User:Carrp">Carrp</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarrp_aa18.html" title="User talk:Carrp">Talk</a> 15:15, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We can always just move it to another title if we decide to do that. But keep in mind this is her first real tour <i>per se</i>, although I could still write some stuff about her 2004 concerts. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 15:22, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Concur with Carrp, make one such list, under the most generic title (i.e. not one ending in US. 2005).

<li>Just as with all other musicians, and indeed all other articles in general, breaking out discographies/tour lists/biographies is only warranted when the size of the relevant section in the main article becomes unwieldy. This is most definitely <i>not</i> the case for a musician's <i>very first tour which hasn't even occurred yet</i>. <b>Delete</b> this groundless fork, and let the already existing tour section of <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashlee_Simpson_fc55.html" title="Ashlee Simpson">Ashlee Simpson</a> expand in the normal way. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:03, 2005 Feb 16 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, or <b>merge</b> back into the main article if more detail is required there. The tour hasn't even had its first performance yet. An article <i>may</i> be warranted if something particularly noteworthy (in the context of popular music, not just Ashlee Simpson) happens on the tour.

<li>Putting this specific VfD aside for a moment, I strongly disagree with the idea of creating an article with the intention of deleting it in the future. If an article's subject is encyclopedic today, it won't become unencyclopedic in the future. Even if it was no longer notable in the future, it would still be encyclopedic because it <i>was</i> notable at one time. Getting back to this VfD, I don't like the idea of such a specific article. Are there going to be separate articles if there are tours in 2006 or 2007? What about tours in countries other than the US? I support the creation of <b>one</b> article, such as List of Ashlee Simpson tours. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarrp_dc22.html" title="User:Carrp">Carrp</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarrp_aa18.html" title="User talk:Carrp">Talk</a> 18:09, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>And if you vote keep, that's what we'll have. But if this deleted, then the precedent will be set not to have articles on tours, which I think is ridiculous. Think how many people will go to these shows, and how many of them there are. Not only that, but it's going to be featured on the reality show, which makes it even more notable. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 18:43, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well, how many articles on tours do we currently have?

Nobody seems to have bothered to put up articles about any of the enormous single-artist insternational tours that have happened every year for decades. If major world tours don't get articles, then why should this single-country tour have one? If all tours should have articles, then we should focus on the major tours by the likes of Madonna, U2, Elton John, The Rolling Stones, etc. before we bother with Ashlee trivia. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 19:13, Feb 16, 2005 (UTC)

<li>We have a paltry stub on the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blond_Ambition_Tour_45ad.html" title="Blond Ambition Tour">Blond Ambition Tour</a>.

<ul>
<li>See, you seem to be assuming that tours don't have articles simply because nobody has had time to create them yet. Instead, I'd say that tours don't have articles because most people feel they're not encyclopedic. Example: Madonna's Re-invention Tour was probably the most important tour of last year (certainly the highest-grossing) and the folks over at the <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madonna_%28entertainer%29.html" title="Madonna (entertainer)">Madonna (entertainer)</a> article have discussed the tour in the main article, complete with two pictures, rather than spinning it off. If any recent tour should have an article, it should be that one, but it doesn't, because it's just plain not necessary. Think about it: imagine somebody really did want to use Wikipedia to research Ashlee's tour. Which is more logical... that they'd look for it on the Ashlee Simpson page, or that they'd type in "Ashlee Simpson U.S. tour, 2005"?

<li>According to the article it is indeed her <i>only</i> tour. It began <i>today</i>.<br />
We have a <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_writing_better_articles_3c0a.html#Long_article_layout" title="Wikipedia:Guide to writing better articles">guide to writing better articles</a>, which recommends forking sections when they grow too big. We also have plenty of examples of this in action, such as <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>.<br />
<a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashlee_Simpson_fc55.html" title="Ashlee Simpson">Ashlee Simpson</a> <i>already has</i> a section for what she's intending to do in 2005. It hasn't grown anywhere near large enough to warrant a fork, given that this is an artist with exactly one tour ever that hasn't really happened yet. Indeed, the fork is barely longer than the section in the main article itself, and the main article already has nearly all of its content. This fork is groundless.<br />
In other cases where there has been an edit war in the main article, followed by one of the participants then forking off xyr own private articles on sub-sub-topics that are simultaneously being edited collaboratively in the main article, we stop them. The creationism/evolution, Zionism, eastern Europe, Pakistan, China, big bang, and other debates may be higher profile than a debate about a singer on MTV that most people have never heard of, but they are all the same when it comes to article forking.<br />

<li>Ooh, good point regarding a "throwaway" article. That would be a rather ugly precident. Still, the more I think about it, the more I feel this should stay as part of a larger list. I like the idea of a List of Ashlee Simpson tours beginning with the info in this article if this is her first tour. We have a lot more ephemeral info than this floating around this site and the info might be better served as part of a larger list.

It is an encyclopedia, not a dumping ground. That means we have a duty not to mindlessly compile facts but to present them in a consise and usable manner, making judgments about which facts are important and which are not. Concert tours even by notable artists are largely non-notable, and even when they are notable, a short summary in that artist's article will suffice. The profliferation of articles on this insignificant singer who will be largely forgotten in a couple of years shows that detached, objective judgment is not being applied to this matter. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 19:06, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>There's plenty of judgment and objectivity. I consider a tour which will involve thousands of spectators and will attract some media attention (at least from MTV) to be notable. I do not philosophically agree with you about summarizing and making things concise. Regardless of what you say, that philosophy is the very opposite of the "wiki is not paper" notion—it's the mentality of the editor of a paper encyclopedia. Things should exist in a concise format to suit the general reader, but there are also readers who will want detail who need to be satisfied as well. On the other hand, I am not trying to fill Wikipedia up with trivia. I believe non-notable content should be removed.

<li>The problem is, of course, almost nobody -- and I <i>do</i> mean almost nobody -- agrees that the unvarnished raw boosterism trivia you dump into any article connected with Ashlee Simpson qualifies as "notable content". That you haven't understood this, that your invariable reaction to it is to wave your hands and pout, "I guess we disagree about that" instead of trying to understand that, and that you treat the slightest disagreement about or distaste for Ashlee Simpson as if it were a personal attack leads me to say: get help.

<li>Personal attacks? For God's sake <b>read what I wrote</b>. Step back and compare your behavior with the analogous behavior I cited.

ArbCom made some findings on your behavior and imposed sanctions less than a month ago, and you've been blocked <b>three times</b> for violating them.

<ul>
<li>No, no, Calton, I've never said I'm 100% right or anybody else is 100% wrong. My "misbehavior" has been awfully mild—I haven't told anybody to "get help" yet, for one thing—but when I have reacted too strongly to things I have apologized. Behind all your demonization of me is a simple content dispute regarding inclusion and notability, and yes, I do think I'm <i>basically</i> (not 100%) right in my positions there: so sue me. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 09:39, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>More strawmen. Of course you've never <i>said</i> you're 100% right: you merely <b>behaved</b> as if you're 100% right, and offered thin rationalization after thin rationalization for it. That, coupled with mischaracterizations and distortions (both of people's postings and of the situations) so wild that they can only be either pathological or deliberate leads me to seriously say -- not as a horrible insult as your snide little passive-aggressive line above tries to make it out to be -- get help.

<li>If your misbehaviour has been so mild, then why did it lead to an Arbitration case and sanctions against you just last month? The fact is that you've been defying consensus (one of the central principles of WP) on just about everything Ashlee-related. The landslide victories of the last four VfDs against Ashlee articles surely must tell you something. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 14:52, Feb 18, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well, it's just politics. I try not to let that get to me. Of course the accusation that I defy consensus is absurd, too absurd to even bother refuting. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 16:36, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Okay, that last statement is breathtaking in its audacity. And what political games would ArbCom be playing, exactly?

And have you therefore filed your appeal with Jimbo Wales? --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> 23:13, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Surely you would consider that the enormous landslide victories of the VfDs against the last four Ashlee spinoff articles represent a consensus that WP just doesn't need or want more of the same? <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 19:06, Feb 18, 2005 (UTC)

Just another president, just another war, just another natural disaster, just another nation-state, just another chemical element, just another classic of world literature, etc. Every national tour by a platinum selling artist is different, but they are all alike in that unifying characteristic. In the same way, every U.S. president is different, but all alike in that they are U.S. presidents. So the question is whether you care enough about the differences to notice them or place a priority on them, right? How can that be a determining factor in notability? If I happen to think, well, they all held the same office and governed the same country, so we don't need these articles, would that make them any less notable? No, because they are <i>famous</i>. If two things are independently famous, then they are each notable in their own right, regardless of whether you think they are similar or not. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 07:45, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>By comparing Ashlee to presidents and the like, you've mostly proved everybody else's point... So far, you've created at least 10 or so Ashlee articles, all told. How many world leaders have that many articles on WP? How many literary classics? How many nobel laureates? How many philosophers? How many inventors, research scientists, chemists, mathematicians, professors? I don't care if you listen to me or not, but for your own sake, listen to consensus: the Ashleecruft has gotten way out of hand. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 00:43, Feb 24, 2005 (UTC)

<li>It was a theoretical comparison. Most of the things you name deserve far more coverage than Ashlee and her music do, so if they're lacking, somebody needs to get to work.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. Given that no one is likely to go through a dictionary listing the tens of thousands of words that would be needed to make this list comprehensive, it ought to be deleted under the "no potential to become encyclopedic" criterion. These lists are a joke and it's good to see someone taking the bull by the horns and listing them for deletion. If Wiktionary want to do something like this good luck to them, but this will never become a decent Wikipedia article. We have <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Latin_phrases_e36e.html" title="List of Latin phrases">List of Latin phrases</a> for phrases like "inter alia" lifted straight out of Latin and used in English. That I can cope with, but not a comically half-hearted attempt at a list of all words of Latin origin in English. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> <a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">(Talk)</a> 14:46, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>"I don't use Wiktionary, therefore all Wiktionary articles belong in Wikipedia." is not an argument that I find compelling. This sort of etymology is <i>exactly</i> what Wiktionary is for. I note from the edit history comments that on the day of its creation an editor of the article xemself found the article somewhat dubious. It should have been made a pointer to Wiktionary there and then. <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">Wikipedia is not a list of words</a>. <b>Wiktionary</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:22, 2005 Feb 16 (UTC)

<li>Comment: I could imagine some distant future where wiktionary is very complete, even including etymology for every word, and lists of this form could be automatically generated by the wiki software. Not just for Latin words in English, but for any kind of words in any language. I think that would be really cool, plus it really illustrates to me how this sort of thing properly belongs to the dictionary, not the encyclopedia. I suppose I'm going to change my vote. The only problem is, there are at least <i>dozens</i> of articles of this kind here on wikipedia, and moving them all to wiktionary would be an enormous effort. Even moving the hundreds of words in this Latin list will take a long time, I expect. I was actually the creator of the corresponding article <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_English_words_of_Greek_origin_bc84.html" title="List of English words of Greek origin">list of English words of Greek origin</a>, which has just as little right to exist as the article under discussion. <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_ae09.html" title="User:Lethe">Lethe</a> | <a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" title="User talk:Lethe">Talk</a> 19:24, Feb 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> There are way too many. This would certainly include thousands and likely tens of thousands of words. Even the "A" section is barely a beginning. And when you're done, what have you got? You want this indexed the other way around, the way an ordinary dictionary does, in the etymology section for each word. This list is not even fun to contribute to or intriguing to contemplate.

<li>Wikipedia is not paper, size is no restriction. For some people, Latin words in English are far more interesting that Quechua words in English, the former showing a lot of the interesting history and development of the English language (Roman, French, Norse, Norman), the latter just being isolated borrowings. However, I think Uncle G's comment above is compelling. Etymological listings belong in the dictionary. The point is, if this article shouldn't be here, then neither should the corresponding Arabic article, or the hypothetical Quechua article. I wonder if it would be possible to vote on a policy for the whole concept, instead of singling out this article. Is that possible? -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_ae09.html" title="User:Lethe">Lethe</a> | <a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" title="User talk:Lethe">Talk</a> 19:35, Feb 16, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I disagree with your assertion. Quechuan-derived words in English are notable by virtue of their rarity. (I have no idea whether there are <b>any</b>). So, such a list would not be on a par with this one. And I don't think we need policy until the submission of lists like this becomes a frequent phenomenon. I don't see any problem whatsoever with voting on things like this on a case-by-case basis. But by all means add "lists of English words that are all derived from a particular language" to <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat%27s_in%2C_what%27s_out_7f38.html" title="Wikipedia:What's in, what's out">Wikipedia:What's in, what's out</a> and say they're out.

<ul>
<li>Which assertion is it that you disagree with? That some people would find etymology of Latin words more interesting than etymology of Quechua borrowings? This assertion is demonstrably true: for example, <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_ae09.html" title="User:Lethe">Lethe</a> finds the etymologies of Latin words in English more interesting than the etymologies of Quechua words in English. Imagine someone who traces how words change meaning as they went from Greek to Latin to Old French to Anglo-Norman to Middle English to Modern English. See for example, the etymology of the word <i>nice</i>. You don't think that some people would find that more interesting than Quechua words? For example, the word <i>llama</i> entered Spanish from Quechua, and English through Spanish. It is the name of an animal indigenous to the Quechua areas. That simply isn't all that interesting. There might be a half-dozen other examples, and they'll all be equally uninteresting. You are, of course, correct. Rarity makes them more notable, but rarity is not the sole criterion of notability. History is another. -<a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethe_ae09.html" title="User:Lethe">Lethe</a> | <a href="../../../l/e/t/User_talk%7ELethe_54bf.html" title="User talk:Lethe">Talk</a> 21:43, Feb 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Extreme Delete</b>, what a ghastly notion. In practice, English is etymologically way over 50% Latin. No list could ever even approach being complete. Further, etymology is a tricky business. Words that "seem" Latin but aren't would inevitably wind up here. I don't think the other lists are encyclopedic either, but a Latin one would be even more vexsome because it can be used to <i>construct</i> words in English.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Perhaps replace with a list of Latin words that have been in English since the Old English period, if somebody wants a list. The later Latinisms aren't very interesting, and any good dictionary will provide information. In general, the "list of English words of ...etc." articles are interesting and useful, but this one isn't. Also, after it's deleted, somebody should start articles describing in more detail the routes by which different Latin words entered English (very early borrowings; or via french; or latinisms) over the centuries. A thing people should remember is that most of these Latinisms are international, and you'll find many of them even in Russian if you look. Decius 08:31, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, changing vote. There's not even any reason for a redirect. If we ever get a reasonable article on Keane, Inc., anything that mentions a subsidiary can use a pipe to name the subsidiary and link to the main article. There's no need for the redirect unless Keane India is notable in its own right.

<li>The article has been completely rewritten and has been submitted only as a <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stub.html" title="Stub">stub</a>. The page was not created for any advertising purposes. It was noticed that when one searches for <a href="../../../g/u/r/Gurgaon.html" title="Gurgaon">Gurgaon</a>, Keane is mentioned in the text of the <a href="../../../g/u/r/Gurgaon.html" title="Gurgaon">Gurgaon</a> submission.

Stuff about Zapffe has also been added to <a href="../../../p/e/s/Pessimism.html" title="Pessimism">pessimism</a>. I will admit that I had never heard of Zapffe before seeing him pop up on Wikipedia; and I am fairly well read on philosophical pessimism. Spelling his name "Peter" boosts his Google hits to above 2000, pretty good for a Scandinavian philosopher. If Zapffe is so minor a figure that his "best-known work" shouldn't have a page, the rest of these articles should perhaps share the fate of this one.

<li><b>Comment</b>. "Virtual studio" is actually a term that's gaining currency in the industry for software (or a hardware/software combo) that allows studio work to be done without everyone having to be in what we traditionally think of as a "studio."

<li>Urrbrae is not misspelled, it's Australian. Genuine school. Terrible article, though. I believe this is one of those specialist schools (in this case, agriculture). Looking at the address at the bottom of their website, I'd suggest a merge of the useful information to <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherby%2C_South_Australia_2c6f.html" title="Netherby, South Australia">Netherby, South Australia</a> if that article existed. A google suggests that it is adjacent to part of the University of Adelaide and a number of agricultural research institutes, so it probably should be mentioned in an article on the local geographical area. Since we don't appear to have an article on Urrbrae, <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherby%2C_South_Australia_2c6f.html" title="Netherby, South Australia">Netherby, South Australia</a>, or <a href="../../../m/i/t/Mitcham%2C_South_Australia_3665.html" title="Mitcham, South Australia">Mitcham, South Australia</a> it looks like a mention in the Educational Institutions section in the main <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide.html" title="Adelaide">Adelaide</a> article is currently the only option for a merge. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 13:43, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Thoughts from inside the LGBT community: this organization has been around for awhile, despite its rather small size. The lack of attention, membership, and funding is probably due to the fact that the bisexual community is the poor bastard child of the gay rights community -- that is, they get respect neither from the straight community nor from the gay community -- for various reasons. Ergo, their size and reach as determined by Google and Alexa (admittedly low) is not necessarily reflective of their notability, longevity, and importance. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperzonk_e38e.html" title="User:Hyperzonk">HyperZonk</a> 17:10, Feb 16, 2005 (UTC)

<p>Some unverifiable pseudo-science speculation and nonsense. The whole alleged "theory" is explained in "layman" terms with lots of "superfluous" quotation marks.

The result of the debate was ambiguous. I count 3 clear "delete" votes (including the anonymous nominator whose vote is discounted somewhat), 5 clear "keep" votes (one of them discounted as a troll) and 4 clear "merge/redirect" votes. There is not concensus to delete. However, the majority opinion is that this should not remain as an independent article.

<li>Comment: If someone had listed it as a copyvio, then I would have been obliged to do this, yes. IMO we are not at all consistent as to whether this is important or not.

<li>Comment: That's the procedure for listing a copyvio. Whether to do that was a line call IMO. The best thing would have been to list it as a copyvio in the first place, and not here. It was after all the <i>first</i> hit in the most obvious Google search! But the process already being off to a bad start, I don't think I was obliged to list it as a copyvio, although I did call people's attention to that fact just in case someone else wanted to.

That page's resolution process will now remove the offending history, and now it has been listed there that's the way to go IMO.

<dd>Eh. So? I bet the same can be said for most games. Or any number of topics.

<dd>Point 1: "Syberia II" might be the official title, but it isn't necessarily the only way to search for mentions of this game. A site might legitimately mention it but call it "Syberia 2" or "Syberia, Part II" or "the sequel to Syberia", etc. Point 2: Even 96K hits is not a small number. I recall VfDs with less than 20 Google hits getting kept. Point 3: I would think that the fact that this game is widely reviewed, widely advertised, and widely sold would be a point for it, not against it. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 15:46, Feb 21, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Like the other alternative medicine Lists on VfD, this List happens to be part of a set of 5 Lists called the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiproject%7EAlternative_Medicine_ce35.html#Core_Project_Lists_and_Articles" title="Wikipedia:Wikiproject:Alternative Medicine">Core Project Lists and Articles</a> of the Wikiproject on Alternative Medicine.

A list can include items that do not yet have an article, and can also show series or groups where the items would be completely separate on the category page.

<li>Quoting the main project page for the Wikiproject on Alternative Medicine: <i><b>This List is "a master list, of all the articles currently existing on Wikipedia that have been identified as being related to CAM; or that are about an alternative position on health, healing, and/or illness; or are related to these topics.</b></i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikiproject:Alternative_Medicine#Scope" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikiproject:Alternative_Medicine#Scope" rel="nofollow">[21]</a></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: No, we won't have articles on state senators unless they're exceptional in some regard; they have smaller constituencies and less impact on national policies. But winning a major party nomination for high-level office means notability in my book. Also, I've somewhat expanded the article. Please look over the new version, future voters. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 19:00, Feb 17, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The expanded article still doesn't give much useful information; the minor details of the campaign that are given can basically be said about every race in the country. Being outraised in contributions is, as the article says, conventional, as is accusing the incumbent of being out of touch with voters, as is a Democrat receiving money from labor unions. And working as a laywer before running for congress is pretty run of the mill too. Nothing here really. I still maintain that <i>running</i> for an office like Congressman (whose constituencies aren't that big, really) does not make one notable. I think time spent expanding stubs would be better spent on current and past House members, not the people they defeated. And I think someone who actually serves in a state legislature is at least as significant a figure than someone who merely ran for Congress.

<li><b>Delete</b> I believe some candidates can be notable just because they're candidates, but IMHO, in 99% of cases, the following guidelines should apply:
<dl>
<dd>Is the election itself particularly historic (for example, almost all defeated candidates who were even marginally significant in the Iraqi election should probably have a stub, as it was the first. In contract, another significant election, the california recall of 2003, probably only merits page creation for relatively major defeated candidates)</dd>
<dd>Did the candidate do anything groundbreaking as part of the campaign? (Can't think of an example right now, but what if Howard Dean had revolutionized fund raising methods by running for state senate? That sort of a guideline)</dd>
<dd>Does the fact that this person was a candidate push them over the threshold for notability when you look at all merits as a package? (for example, semi-notable business leaders who run for office)</dd>
<dd><b>If none of the above apply, no dedicated apply, they may deserve mention on another relevant page, but not their own article</b></dd>
<dd>While I'm relatively new as a registered user, and my opinion might carry less weight than most, I'm thinking of the long term future of the wikipedia namespace -- you don't want to establish precidents that make the quantity of articles required in 50 years completely unmanagable, but you want to credit truely notable individuals, still. Obviously, you all can disagree, but I feel like more explicit standards to resolve this issue are badly needeed.<a href="../../../e/g/g/User%7EEggplantWizard_fc4d.html" title="User:EggplantWizard">EggplantWizard</a> 03:16, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I don't think we generally keep authors who have written one book unless that book was particularly notable. Am I right? Literally millions of people have written books. Also, writing a book is, in a way, more notable than running for office in that a book may survive for centuries, but once someone's race for office is over, it's over, they're not really leaving anything behind. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 16:29, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The way I see it, is that a category of people (such as actors or politicians or whatever) is probably notable as a group, but the people in there aren't notable as individuals. Within the group, there are usually certain people that stand out as the leaders, or the famous ones, or the misfits. Those are notable within their group and should be included in WP. Few individuals are notable simply because they are part of a group, and the larger the group, the less likely that is. In other words, the more politicians there are, the less the likelyhood that they all are notable simply by virtue of being a politician. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 09:19, Feb 18, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><strike><b>Don't Delete</b>. "Hey, it's that Charlos character who is not-notable enough to be on Wikipedia. I'm dumb." is going to be in my book when I write an autobiography of my totally awesome life. People will laugh at you for saying that and say, "What a loser!"</strike>

<li>FYI: According to the page history, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_172.168.33.110_ba40.html" title="Special:Contributions/172.168.33.110">172.168.33.110</a> made that previous comment. <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> 05:23, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>First off, this is not an encyclopedia. This is a haven for scrabble players who think they have gigantic brains that would crush a mortal child. Ignorant teenagers may frequently use wilkpedia as a source during arguments on live journal but no adults respect you guys. Come on. Half the stuff on here (a conservative estimate) is written by people less qualified than a baby. You guys aren't society's elite. You are hippies. Get over yourself and quit polluting the Internet with random crap passed off as factual information. Nobody respects you. Everyone thinks this place is trash the minute they figure out that anyone can edit it. You guys are no better than the other editable "encyclopedias" like that urban dictionary and whatever. Grow up.</li>

<li>I completely agree with everything 172.152.133.228 says. Wikipedia is crap and personally I am a hippie with an overinflated ego. However, none of this is germane to the VfD discussion of this particular article, which should be <b>Deleted</b> as unencyclopedic, vanity, possible prank or hoax, but in any case a biographical article on a non-notable person. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 14:43, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)
