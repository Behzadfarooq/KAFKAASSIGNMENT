<p><b>Keeley</b>, outside of the <a href="../../../p/a/g/Page_3_girl.html" title="Page 3 girl">Page 3 girl</a> fame, is not notable enough to have her own entry on Wikipedia. The lack of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable data</a> also renders this page worthless. Unless she's done something of notability, the entry on the <a href="../../../p/a/g/Page_3_girl.html" title="Page 3 girl">Page 3 girl</a> article regarding Keeley is sufficient.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. A Google search for "Brent Walters" and "Nicene" yielded 17 hits and "Brent Walters" and "Didache" yielded 20. That's more than one, but still pretty low. However, his 1991 book on the Didache did have some favorable reviews and no negative ones that I saw. Given the apparent recognition he has within narrow focus of his scholarship (ante-Nicene), I'll give an article on him the benefit of the doubt, barely. The lack of details (name of his book and other publications, where he went to college, etc...) lead me to believe that this is not self-promotion, contrary to Hoary's conclusion. <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 04:43, July 27, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b><s>keep</s></b>. While a search on either Yahoo! or Google might not produce many noteworthy results, typing "Brent Walters" along with terms such as "Didache", "Church", "Christianity", "Nicene" will certainly result in more hits. Also, there were results when I typed "Brent Walters" and "radio" into a Yahoo! search. It quickly showed that he was in fact on a radio show as a guest. Lack of hits on search engines can likely be attributed to the obscurity of his scholarship, as mentioned above. (ie: how often does the term "Didache" even get mentioned in any church?). Nonetheless, a quick search of amazon.com quickly produced a title published by him along with some very positive reviews. He was also quoted in at least one other book as a scholar (once again, through an amazon.com search). --Wenwen2099 06:54, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

Please note that the most significant and wonderful organization in the world does <i>not</i> lead to biographies of every person in the organization. A biography is required when the biography itself is notable, when the person is known outside the organization. Otherwise, you'd say something of the person in the article on the organization and simply redirect the name to that article. In <i>this</i> case, we have an organization that is not significant enough for an article and some dude in it. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:53, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>What exactly would you consider "notability or legitimate references"? The Pæthieon of Imovinn is Incorporated by the state of Ohio, and is in the process of being recognized as non-profit under the fedreal 501c3 statute. I happen to be ordained by the Church of Spiritual Humanism and the Universal Life Church, and am registered with the state of Ohio to perform services in all Ohio counties. I hold Doctorates in Divinity and Metaphysics, and am a Certified Reiki Master. How much more "legitimate" would you like? - Luna Faye</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Lots of things are incorporated by the state of Ohio, but they are not all notable. Perhaps it's not entirely fair to rely on numbers - but numbers are, at the end of the day, the best way for the Wikipedians to judge impact, and impact is what speaks to notability, in my view. And yes, the internet-ordination-giving <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Life_Church_e3fe.html" title="Universal Life Church">Universal Life Church</a> is notable, though I wouldn't know if I would say that about the Church of Spiritual Humanism - Google indicates that far fewer people have even heard of it, its impact is likely less. But this is beside the point, Luna Faye. The notability of your religious affiliations won't convince people that another religion, which you are also interested in, is notable.

<li>For me, it's less about numbers, and more about impact on the world at large. Your group might be important and interesting to its own members, but otherwise, no one is likely to care.

<li>As I said, WP is not an indiscriminate collection of info.

<ul>
<li>Good first rule of thumb. As I said, from my perspective it's rarely really about numbers, numbers are just often a good indicator of underlying impact.

<li>There is no concrete number. Inclusion is determined by community consensus. We have set standards for some things, but not for religious groups (or so far as I am aware).

Quote "when it's time for someone to submit an article for a religion, it won't be the founder submitting it." Well that doesn't make much sence. Who better than the founder of something to understand and describe it's ideas and principals? - Luna Faye</p>
<dl>
<dd>Answer: An objective, disinterested, outside observer. We don't want Oprah writing the article about Oprah, for example. As harsh as that might sound, we dedicated Wikipedians apply the same standard here. If you are a scientist, a religious movement, a politician, a corporate executive, or a professor, your impact and accomplishments have to be well-enough known for other people to write about them. Read the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Neutral Point of View</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">What Wikipedia is Not</a> guidelines for more info.</dd>
<dd>Honestly, no one is discriminating, except in the sense of making choices. It is no reflection on the validity or worthiness of the religion as a belief system. When we say not notable, we mean it hasn't had a broad effect on the world yet, and one of the Wikipedia guidelines is that you don't get to use this encyclopedia to help it achieve that notability. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidH_d410.html" title="User:DavidH">DavidH</a> 05:22, July 26, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>National Lampoon</i> -- remember that? Back when your parents were your age -- er, no, a bit further back than that -- it was an amusing magazine. Then the name was applied to a succession of movies that usually got terse descriptions such as "bomb" or "dud".</p>
<p>So what's this about then? A film that hasn't been issued, starring Paris Hilton. But Wikipedia is not a crystal ball; wait till this is released. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 04:56, July 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>PS Gosh, this really turns out to exist and to be coming soon. I must have misread "2005" as "2006", or perhaps I even more sleepily misread my position in the space/time continuum as 2004 rather than 2005 (I had a hard night last night): either way, I got the impression that the celluloid muse was promised to grace us with this opus over a year from now. I take it all back. The IMdB synopsis makes the film sound terribly thrilling, and I bow to <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a>'s judgement when he says (below) that it "has <u>a notable star</u> in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Hilton_9740.html" title="Paris Hilton">Paris Hilton</a>" (my underlining for emphasis).

<li>Hmm, I don't think this is important enough to be one of five items under "Notable stories and events", let alone the first listed. If the consensus of this vote is delete and not merge, I propose deleting it from the <i>Daily Show</i> article. If all jokes of this magnitude or greater were given equal space, the <i>Daily Show</i> article would take up hundreds, if not thousands, of pages. --<a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPagrashtak_1a5a.html" title="User:Pagrashtak">Pagrashtak</a> 13:45, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Oh come on, how many people do you think actually looked up Mr. Reameduptheass? Pfükke sounds like a real person. There are certain jokes that attract a level of curiosity that would warrant at least a simple explanation. Now we are complaining about the SIZE of the potential encyclopedia? Is the internet full? Thousands of pages on just one topic would be a true research oasis.--Y2Kevbug11 11:17:45, 26 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am not complaining about the size of the <i>encyclopedia</i>, I am complaining about the size of an <i>article</i>. My comments above are intended to counter the proposal to merge. My argument is that is if we are compelled to include Mr. Pfükke, then we must also inslude Mr. Reameduptheass and Mr. Shaft and anyone else mentioned. Now look at the size of the current text for Pfükke and multiply that by three to include the other two I've just mentioned. This is conservatively small, as this was just a small part of a longer segment. Now, multiply that size by the number of segments on a typical <i>Daily Show</i> episode, say three to pick another conservative number. Now multiply that by the number of <i>Daily Show</i> episodes that have aired since its first episode in 1996. What we arrive at is too lengthy for an article, hence merging is not a viable option in my opinion.<br />
Perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself, though, as this argument may be completely moot. I believe the central question is (or should be): <i>Is Rufus Pfükke encyclopedic?</i> A fictional name invented for a one-time joke on an episode of a comedy show. Not notable, not encyclopedic. --<a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPagrashtak_1a5a.html" title="User:Pagrashtak">Pagrashtak</a> 15:55, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It is to my mind deeply unencyclopedic to set the precedent for adding every gag on a comedy show to its article and creating a redirect for that gag. Whilst it is permissible to force the redirect, as you have during the VfD while the discussion continued, it is not the done thing. Now, the VfD is basically redundant along with all the non-redirect votes that had been cast. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 17:04, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm one of the few remaining fans of correspondence virtual-<i>anything</i> games. For instance, I'm playing a play-by-mail/e-mail game of Breaking Away, a game of team bicycle racing such as a sprint stage of the Tour de France. Nonetheless, I'm not sure any of this character's wrestling "e-federation" has encyclopedic importance, and by WP policy and precedent, no player character in games should have an article kept unless it somehow becomes very well-known through widespread coverage by major media. <b>Delete, throwing out of the ring</b>. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 00:47, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

A Google search will get you about 1,700 hits, but none of the first few have anything to do with difficulty level.

<li><b>Reply</b>: I've posted the bulk of my view below, but with regard to this particular statement I would like to say that appearing in a smaller number of more successful films (as opposed to cranking out some gonzo crap once a month) IS the main criteria for separating a notable actresses from a nobody. SteveAtlanta 17:22, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> because her name is one of the relatively few which can help sell an adult film or magazine. She is possibly the best-known Latina star, also is well-known in mainstream, and is sometimes seen under the Asian category. As for Quale's comment, it's a <i>good</i> thing that she hasn't been in more than 59 movies in so many years in the industry. Slap-em-out cheapies are the least notable and least prestigious films, and actresses who do many films a month will usually be burned-out and Not Notable within a couple of years, even if they avoid getting a drug habit. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 01:05, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I cannot help but take note that every aspiring unknown actor and college garage band in North America and Europe has a Wikipedia entry, and everyone is fine with that... yet half of all adult industry articles have had Votes for Deletion or comments in the discussion tab about their lack of appropriateness. I suppose it's possible that some person or persons are devout "porn connoisseurs" and want to ensure that Wikipedia takes the most scholarly posture possible with its adult industry articles. I suspect that it's more likely, given the patterns I see, that some person or persons have trepidation about the subject matter altogether and would like to eliminate as many articles as they can manage to persuade the community to go along with. Regardless, a chief strength of Wikipedia is its documentation of popular culture... it is THE place to go for information on a person of note who is unlikely to be featured in Encarta or the Encyclopaedia Britannica.<br />
<br />
In this specific case, I find it laughable to say Adriana Sage does not meet the critera of "notable". She has been the best known and most successful Latina adult actress of the past five years, and is one of the few individuals in the industry who has risen above the sea of anonymous faces and is used to sell product based on name-recognition. I agree that this article needs improvement... starting with the removal of her "shoe size" and so forth, then proceeding with more information about her career and contract-status-slash-professional relationships. However, making such improvements is not possible until this silly round of voting is over with. Bottom line, of course this article is 100% appropriate for Wikipedia, and I would strongly suggest to anyone suspecting otherwise that they carefully review Wikipedia's deletion policy at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy</a>.<br />
<br />
The community memmbers who have spoken up on this issue have voted overwhelmingly in favor of "keep". Can we please hurry up and move past this nonsense?<br />

<p>Regards,</p>

<dd>Well, yeah, the idea was originally to merge the article, but, an unsigned person made me think about that because the person said that the Miss Universe Organization article is very inaccurate, and I think it actually is. A merge is a very soluble solution but I don't know exactly how much can be merged from the Miss Universe Organization article, and under what name should we merge it. Both Miss Universe and Miss Universe Organization are real good names, although I myself think , well, Miss Universe is more popular, but then again, the bone behind it is the organization so the name would be a tossup I guess. As for not being bold, just check me out Friday nights at <a href="../../../a/p/p/Applebees.html" title="Applebees">Applebees</a> when the waitresses ask me to strip dance on the table!!! LOL!!!!

<li><b>Delete</b>, neologism, but mostly because I'm a language stickler. Heterophobia combines the prefix hetero- (other, different) with the suffix -phobia (fear, dislike). Thus, heterophobia <i>should</i> mean "fear of things that are different", or something similar. Heterosexophobia (or something similar) would be a more appropriate term. Sadly, homophobia (which <i>should</i> mean fear of things that are the same or uniform) has taken on the meaning that should be covered by homosexophobia and is wide-spread enough that we must be forced to adopt the new meaning. Heterophobia, however, is not a wide-spread word and I don't see the need for an article promoting the misuse of the word until general use has forced us to.

<li>Good point. In fact, <a href="../../../-/p/h/-phobia.html#H" title="-phobia">-phobia</a> defines heterophobia as fear of the opposite sex, as did a few pschology-related sites I found after a google search. --<a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPagrashtak_1a5a.html" title="User:Pagrashtak">Pagrashtak</a> 17:53, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm familiar with this term (or thought so, at least). I was planning to vote keep or transwiki, as I thought it was a fairly common or easily understood term, but then I read the article, which says that it means to hide one's face in fear. The definition I'm familiar is <i>to irrationally ignore a problem out of fear</i> and often indicates a lack of judgment. It stems from the popular misconeption that an ostrich, when frightened, will bury its head in the sand and ignore the problem, rather than dealing with it or taking a wiser course of action, such as running. So I'm going to "ostrich" right now and withhold a vote. --<a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPagrashtak_1a5a.html" title="User:Pagrashtak">Pagrashtak</a> 15:35, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. A nationwide tour for a hardcore band in the UK with no recordings usually means getting in a van and playing a few opening sets at shows with 4 or 5 other bands (in front of an audience of perhaps 80 people), losing money the whole time.

<li>Keep Persia and Iran - I think you are all looking at the wrong end of the stick. They both describe different things. Iran was always used by the locals to refer to the land (hence the word LAND) of Persians (Parsi's), in similar fashion to United Kingdom being referred to as the land/kingdom of the British people. The people of Iran have always been known as Parsi's (english translation being Persian) since the nomadic roots. However, during the islamic conquest, the Arabs attempt to take out the letter P from the Persian alphabet resulted in most people referring to Parsi as Farsi. To sum everything, Iran is the name for the land of Persians/Aryans. In the same respect as the people of UK being referred to as British people, the People of Iran should be referred to as Persians. This is the only geographic and historically correct term. Infact, the term Iranian is incorrect in many ways although ignorantly being used. Some similar examples to help you grasp this fact, are Dutch people from the Netherland (You wouldn't call the Netherlandis or Hollandians), the British etc. --Sina7 00:31, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Really Useful and correct information which is of great importance for those who are confused by two names for the same country. In times when a political regime named "Islamic" is trying to delete the old and rich history of a nation from the memory of the international community and to replace it by a fundamentalistic feature, it is more important than ever to show that the terms "Iran" and "Persia" depict the same nation and to hint at the European origin of the term "Persia" for this country. See articles by Prof. Ehsan Yarshater and among others "Encyclopaedia Irannica".</li>
<li>Comment - Not sure yet. My first impression is that this is useful information, but might be more appropriate for a talk page. If it could be a section of the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a> article, its plausible that it could become an article in its own right. Clearly the title would have to change to fit guidelines. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolipsist_66d1.html" title="User:Solipsist">Solipsist</a> 16:41, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That issue is completely different, and there is really no dispute that "Persian" is the proper and standard usage in the English language. The continued usage of "Farsi" by some in the West (including some Iranians) is primarily due to ignorance of this, rather than out of any political agenda. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">SouthernComfort</a> 19:10, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Start over, this begins with a question! Also the point is moot. Persia refers to a historic area that encompassed both Iran and Iraq. The historic name has been superceeded by the current nomenclature, if the author would look at that high tech device known as a <i>map</i>, especially one produced in , oh, say the past 50 years. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamster_Sandwich_8577.html" title="User:Hamster Sandwich">Hamster Sandwich</a> 18:03, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well he has one point. Despite current political boundries many people who emigrated from the region prior to it becoming Iran refer to themselves as Persians and take offense to being called Iranian.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 18:48, 26 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This is false. Iraq (Mesopotamia) was never part of Persia - it was, however, at various times part of the Persian Empire. Iran has always been the native name, and Iranians have always called themselves such, so I think you would be hard pressed to find an Iranian who feels "Iranian" is offensive. The word "Persian" specifically refers to the Persian-speaking groups of Iran, who make up half the population. The other half is made up of non-Persian groups who have never referred to themselves as being Persian, but rather Iranian. The relevant articles explain these points sufficiently, and editors who lack knowledge of this subject are encouraged to learn the facts. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">SouthernComfort</a> 18:56, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> so what you're saying is that Baghdad was never at any time the Persian capital, you're saying on one hand that Iraq was never part of Persia, yet at various times it was part of the Persian Empire. I just want to understand because, well your arguement seems a little fuzzified. I'm trying to be kind. And last time I looked on a map, Iran was Iran, and Iraq was Iraq, and most sentient people will back me up on this. The article begins by asking the reader a question. This in itself is not encyclopedic. It is asking for help, on a simple issue.

<ul>
<li>My argument is not "fuzzified." Armenia was once part of the Persian Empire, but was it part of Persia? There is a difference between "Persia" (the core of the empire) and "Persian Empire." Historians apparently understand this difference. Iran is Iran, but was known in the West as Persia. Iraq is Iraq, and was known in the past as Mesopotamia. Most educated people would agree. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">SouthernComfort</a> 20:29, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well I can put you incontact with several Persian-Americans that would kick you if you called them Iranians or Iranian-Americans.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 19:34, 26 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your hostile tone aside, you seem to not have understood my earlier response. "Persian" is an ethnic and linguistic term - it is not a nationality. The nationality is "Iranian." Those who call themselves Persian-American (as I do) do so because that is their ethnic background - Persian being the ethnicity, American being the nationality. This is too obvious to even require mention in this discussion. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">SouthernComfort</a> 19:45, 26 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hostile tone? Where do you get that, I do know several Persians that loathe the term Iranian? And it is debateable whether it is a nationality or a ethnicity we are discussing here. I've not heard anyone in Iran refer to themselves ethnically as "Persian" in 50 years.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 19:57, 26 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You could have said that they would "strongly disagree with me," but instead chose to say that they would "kick me." That you know several Iranians who loathe being called "Iranians" is original research. You haven't heard anyone in Iran refer to themselves as ethnically Persian in recent years? Don't insult my intelligence please. How do you think people differentiate each other? Iran is diverse - Persians, Azeris, Kurds, Bakhtiaris, Armenians, Assyrians, Arabs, Turkmen, etc etc. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">SouthernComfort</a> 20:02, 26 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The point was that my phasing was not "hostile". You chose to make it such in your head. And now who's resorting to being condecending. As I said, they aren't "Iranian" they are "Persian". They left the region before Iran was established and as such choose to deny the nationality, that's not "orginal research" that's fact among some Persians. Also I stand by my statement that Iranians from the Iranian government (the highest authority in Iran) today have stated to the world that they are to be referred to as Iranian, not Persian.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 21:50, 26 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are free to your opinion, but they are not grounded in the facts, nor are they credible. I am an ethnic Persian myself, and have a very good understanding of these matters, and there are other Iranian editors here at WP that you may consult. Nonetheless, if you feel so strongly about your statements, then I suggest that you provide some relevant sources. <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">SouthernComfort</a> 23:15, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

Quintessential examples are <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxism.html" title="Marxism">Marxism</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazism.html" title="Nazism">Nazism</a>, but totalitarianism is not a requirement (eg <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-liberalism.html" title="Neo-liberalism">neo-liberalism</a> can be analysed as a political religion). I would urge all those who voted to delete on grounds of <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a> or original research to reconsider. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> 17:32, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd wager that the presence of the term in that academic journal is more of a coincidence than anything else. "Political religion" is not an established term in political science or anywhere else. Furthermore, it carries an inherent POV (the association of some ideologies with religion), which obstructs good discussion of the real issue at hand: the <i>dogmatism</i> of those ideologies. "Political religion" assumes that (1) being dogmatic means being religious, and (2) dogmatism is the KEY element of all religions, while other things - like, I don't know, <b>belief in a deity and an afterlife</b> - are just unimportant details. -- Mihnea Tudoreanu 22:07, 29 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's not a coincidence, and the rest is your interpretation. The fundamental analogy with the cultish aspects of religion by using the term is perfectly valid, I think - there's no need to get hung up on the spiritual element - that's what the political qualifier distinguishes. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> 23:32, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Vs <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_religion.html" title="Civil religion">civil religion</a></b>: although some scholars use the terms as equivalent, others see a useful distinction, using "civil religion" as something much weaker, which functions much more as a socially unifying and essentially conservative force, where a political religion is radically transformational. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> 17:38, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Vs <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theocracy.html" title="Theocracy">theocracy</a></b>: nothing to do with it. There need not be any conventionally religious or spiritual element at all - eg (atheist) Marxism. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> 17:42, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's kind of the whole point. Calling something with no conventionally religious or spiritual element at all a "religion" is inherently POV at best and utterly absurd at worst. If spirituality isn't necessary for a religion, then what <i>is</i> necessary? -- Mihnea Tudoreanu 22:07, 29 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's a sociological term. Ergo what is of interest are the sociological aspects of religion, and it is these which the analogy implicit in the term is drawing on. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> 23:35, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Change to keep</b> This is an article that has some encyclopedic points, but for me to make a definative Delete vote, I'd have to research the topic in depth, and compare it to what has been presented. As the article is in some sections incomplete, perhaps this is more of a work in progress type thing. The section on Japan initially swayed me to vote for deletion, but the more I considered it, the more it seemed to fit with the thesis. Certainly in recent history certain political movements have sought to ally themselves with an existing religion, or to create a religion to suit their purpose (ie Nazism), An interesting topic, it probably just needs some fleshing out. <a href="../../../h/a/m/User%7EHamster_Sandwich_8577.html" title="User:Hamster Sandwich">Hamster Sandwich</a> 18:11, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Much of the information itself may be correct and encyclopedic, but placing it all together and writing an article on <i>Political religion</i> is original research and inherently POV - not a proper way of presenting that information. Mihnea Tudoreanu 19:36, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Not a useful article, treating what appears to be a newly recoined term (possible ideologically inspired) as if it was an established political concept. I can't see much of a future for it, not without further sources at least. A google search doesn't seem to support the idea that this is an established term with a defined usage. In fact there seem to be a number of usages, and the one portrayed in this article seems to be a rather politically loaded one to me.<a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> 19:07, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. I'm not comfortable with the neologism, but the subject matter genuinely exists. I could be persuaded to change my vote to delete if someone could show me an already-existing term that covers the same territory. <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFernando_Rizo_ef9f.html" title="User:Fernando Rizo">Fernando Rizo</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFernando_Rizo_69e0.html" title="User talk:Fernando Rizo"><i>T</i></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fernando_Rizo_71a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fernando Rizo"><i>C</i></a> 21:04, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've found this article problemmatic for a long time, as it seems to have originally been written as a pro-christian/anti-communist polemic, and since then it has evolved into original research.

<li>Actually it is a very good reason for deletion, for the simple reason that original research has no place in Wikipedia, and the related subjects which are <i>not</i> original research are already represented by well-written articles. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Poole_836b.html" title="User:Gene Poole">Gene_poole</a> 00:37, 4 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I repeat, that's not a reason for deletion, it's a reason for cleanup. If it's a valid concept - and it is (please see article, I've changed it a bit) then if necessary make it a stub, but don't delete, which causes potential aggravation if somebody comes along wanting to improve it and then is told it was vfd'd and needs to go through an undeletion process to be allowed to do that. NB The modern sociological concept goes back to 1938, when <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Voegelin_d466.html" title="Eric Voegelin">Eric Voegelin</a> published a book with that title.

<li>And I repeat, original research does not belong in Wikipedia. Given that everything from the name of the article down is original research, the only possible way to "clean up" this article is to delete it. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Poole_836b.html" title="User:Gene Poole">Gene_poole</a> 06:50, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Even so, the article is original research and quite worthless in its current state.

<ul>
<li>Oh come on Mihnea, I've made it perfectly clear that I don't think Political religion is a neologism. I just meant that if the thresholds for vfd are so high that the other article can survive, this is easily old enough and established enough to do so.

<p>Completely non verifiable. May be a hoax. Found on new page patrol. After wikifing this I checked some of the stuff out hoping for more info. There is exactly 1 google hit on the name, and that seems to be for another person, a member of the Institute of Management Accountants. There are no google hits for the books cited, and Amazon doesn't list either. There is a Golden Marble Award, but it isn't for books and no "Santos" is listed among the winnners. There are more "Quill Awards", "Golden Quill Awards", "Silver Quill Awards" and the like than I can shake a pen at, none of those I found seem to be for printed fiction, and none list a "Santos" among their winners. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> 19:11, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I got here after following an anonymous editor placing info that Charles Moffat was allegedly an expert on Lilith mythology on a disambig page and then tons of completely incorrect information about the character added to mythology articles by the same anon user. I looked at contributions and, suprise, same person creates an article claiming that Charles Moffat is an expert on that and being an influential artist, and further made several edits to articles related to his supposed expertise. A Google search for this individual, narrowed to the include the term "artist" because many people have thebase name, shows only 750 links, many of which are sites where people can create their own links so presumably were hit by the person in question just like Wikipedia does. I see no independent links indicating that others find his work influential or that he is an expert in any of the areas he claims to be, and further his website <a href="http://www.lilithgallery.com/gallery/charles_moffat.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lilithgallery.com/gallery/charles_moffat.html" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> shows what appears to be extremely amateurish work.</li>

<li>If you're familiar with <i><a href="../../../b/e/o/Beowulf.html" title="Beowulf">Beowulf</a></i>, you may have heard of the <a href="../../../g/e/a/Geats.html" title="Geats">Geats</a> as <i>a tribe in southern Sweden which were conquered by the Swedes and disappeared from history</i>. Well, they did not disappear from Scandinavian history, and today a small number of modern Geats have created this revisionist theory according to which the Swedes were <b>also</b> Geats, so the Geats were not conquered by the Swedes. It is a strange logic, but they try to make it sound reasonable by placing the ancient locations of the Swedish heartland in the core province of the Geats.--<a href="../../../w/i/g/User%7EWiglaf_0500.html" title="User:Wiglaf">Wiglaf</a> 09:45, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I share Wiglaf's concern. The academic consensus is indeed totally against this theory (or rather, fantasy).

<li>Everyone is assumming its notable because so much is written in the article. Can anyone link me to any non wikipedia or wikipedia mirror sources that verify this contraversy? Also, to editors of this article: remember that a big NPOV trap is that minor crackpot theories can't just be countered by an obvious counter argument unless you can find and cite that argument being used (otherwise its original research which is verboten). Too often editors just write counter arguments to create balance but create original research in the process. (68.127.166.133)

<li>No, I don't assume it's notable because the size of the article (how would you know what I am assuming?). I think it's notable because I've heard and read about it in a lot of different medias during a long time. Take for example <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_Guillou_952e.html" title="Jan Guillou">Jan Guillou</a>'s books about Arn, or Dag Stålsjö's book and tv-series, or any of all foras where the question is dicussed. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Elisson_10de.html" title="User:Johan Elisson"><font face="fixedsys">Elisson</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johan_Elisson_6c3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johan Elisson">•</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohan_Elisson_e39b.html" title="User talk:Johan Elisson"><font face="fixedsys">Talk</font></a> 12:53, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Jan Guillou's work of historical fiction concerns a much later time period (the <a href="../../../1/2/t/12th_century.html" title="12th century">12th century</a> and the <a href="../../../1/3/t/13th_century.html" title="13th century">13th century</a>) when it is uncontested that some Geatish families played an important part. Concerning Dag Stålsjö his TV-show was shown once in the 70s. It was ridiculed, rejected and has not been shown since.--<a href="../../../w/i/g/User%7EWiglaf_0500.html" title="User:Wiglaf">Wiglaf</a> 13:00, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Jan Guillou still touches the subject, even if the series doesn't cover the correct period. You said everyone was assuming the article is notable because it is long. I proved you wrong. You wanted sources that verified the controversy. I gave you Dag Stålsjö (doesn't matter that he was ridiculed, he is a proof that the theory is and was alive). Need I say more? You may also note that there are 12 keep votes and no oppose, except for your strange nomination. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Elisson_10de.html" title="User:Johan Elisson"><font face="fixedsys">Elisson</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johan_Elisson_6c3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johan Elisson">•</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohan_Elisson_e39b.html" title="User talk:Johan Elisson"><font face="fixedsys">Talk</font></a> 21:21, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I guess we have a believer in the Götaland theory at Wikipedia, and that I have stepped on your toes! I know Jan Guillou personally, and I think he would be insulted by being associated with this fantasy. Note that the fact that this belief is notable in <a href="../../../v/%C3%A4/s/V%C3%A4sterg%C3%B6tland.html" title="Västergötland">Västergötland</a>, where you live, does not make it notable on the level fitting for Wikipedia.--<a href="../../../w/i/g/User%7EWiglaf_0500.html" title="User:Wiglaf">Wiglaf</a> 21:26, 1 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, you insult me by saying that I am a believer of the Götaland theory. It is your <b>ignorance</b> I dislike. And you are an admin? What the... What is happening with Wikipedia? I don't care if you know Guillou, his books have been interpreted by many as supporting the theory, no matter what Guillou personally thinks about it. The theory is not only known in Västergötland, which you should know, but in the whole of Sweden. Notable or not in your opinion doesn't make a difference, we have 12 keep votes and no delete votes. You might be able to figure something out of that. As <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">User:JIP</a> on a page far away from this once said: "Have you ever considered that the reason why everyone says you are wrong might be that you are wrong?" -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Elisson_10de.html" title="User:Johan Elisson"><font face="fixedsys">Elisson</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johan_Elisson_6c3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johan Elisson">•</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohan_Elisson_e39b.html" title="User talk:Johan Elisson"><font face="fixedsys">Talk</font></a> 11:36, 2 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, I am an admin due to my concerns for the quality of Wikipedia, as I am now. Perhaps, you have noticed that the keep votes stopped after 68.127.166.133's post. The previous nominators assumed that it was notable due to the article's length, and the length was due to a <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilmer_T_3a4d.html" title="User:Wilmer T">User:Wilmer T</a>, an original researcher who is usually cut to pieces every time he appears on a discussion site, such as Skalman. Sorry, but I still think that Wikipedia would be better off without it. When I saw the great editor <a href="../../../j/a/l/User%7EJallan_8e41.html" title="User:Jallan">User:Jallan</a> be influenced by this article, I realized that it does more damage than good.--<a href="../../../w/i/g/User%7EWiglaf_0500.html" title="User:Wiglaf">Wiglaf</a> 13:22, 2 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As a non-admin, I'd prefer admins of Wikipedia to be more humble than you are. Assuming a lot of things about other wikipedians is not humble. All votes stopped after 68.127.166.133's post. I still see no delete votes. I don't care how ridiculous the theory is, and how cut to pieces <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilmer_T_3a4d.html" title="User:Wilmer T">User:Wilmer T</a> is on <a href="http://forum.skalman.nu/" class="external text" title="http://forum.skalman.nu/" rel="nofollow">Skalman</a>. There are articles on subjects even more ridiculous. Why would Wikipedia be better off without it? Wikipedia is not a place for "the truth", Wikipedia is a place for articles about truths and lies and ridiculous theories, as long as they are notable. <a href="../../../g/%C3%B6/t/G%C3%B6taland_theory.html" title="Götaland theory">Götaland theory</a> is notable.

<li>That is unfair!

<ul>
<li>What is unfair? That people tend to not agree with you in this particular question? I don't see any <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a> in the article. You may want to read what the policy says. <i><b>Original research</b></i> <i>refers to original research by editors of Wikipedia. It does not refer to original research that is published or available elsewhere (although such research may be excluded if editors consider the source to be disreputable or inappropriate).</i> The Götaland theory; 1. is not a theory created by editors of Wikipedia; 2. has been published elsewhere (Dag Stålsjö's TV-series, for example). I agree about the sources, though. But that is not a reason to delete the article. As for its notability, then why have Brits, Americans, Australians and Germans voted keep? And don't keep on repeating the "long article" argument... -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Elisson_10de.html" title="User:Johan Elisson"><font face="fixedsys">Elisson</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johan_Elisson_6c3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johan Elisson">•</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohan_Elisson_e39b.html" title="User talk:Johan Elisson"><font face="fixedsys">Talk</font></a> 16:24, 2 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is unfair that you call me arrogant, since I have allowed the information to stay so far. Since Wilmer T did not provide any references, I would consider most to be his own original research. Even if there were references we would have to weed out self-published material and authors resorting to <i>spiritism</i> and <i>faked quotes</i>.

<li>I don't know that the factual nature of religious beliefs should really be called in question. However this is clearly a stub article. I'm aware that the Orion material and its author has been active for over twenty years now. I know they have a book published and still have semi-regular workshops in Washington DC. The article as it stands is woefully underinformative and does not read like an encyclopedia entry, but I don't think that's grounds for deletion. Alkzndr 12:42, 27 july, 2005
<dl>
<dd>Well, of course the factual nature of religious beliefs should be called into question - that's called intellectual inquiry. But I wasn't supporting deletion of this article because I thought the belief was <i>untrue</i> (I do think that, but that is irrelevant); I supported deletion because the article is both <i>content-free</i> and <i>unintelligible</i>. Maybe the article could be rewritten and expanded, by someone with knowledge of the, um, belief system, to include encyclopedic material - though having looked at the <a href="http://www.orionwisdom.us" class="external text" title="http://www.orionwisdom.us" rel="nofollow">website</a> I'd have to characterize that as content-free as well. But more fundamentally, the purpose of an encyclopedia is to assemble information from multiple sources and to synthesize it into an article that provides more information than the reader could obtain from any single source. Does any information exist about Orionwisdom besides that website, such that any content in the article other than an external link to the website wouldn't be superfluous? -<a href="../../../e/d/m/User%7EEDM_5af9.html" title="User:EDM">EDM</a> 17:40, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>If primes are notable, even though there are an infinite number of them, by definition non-primes must be equally notable for not being primes.

<li>You have a curious definition of 'by definition'. Primes are not notable because they're infinite, they're notable because they have a notable quality. Infinity is a side argument. Saying non-Primes are notable because they're not-this-notable-thing would mean I'm notable as a non-John Travolta.--<a href="../../../d/n/i/User%7EDNicholls_483e.html" title="User:DNicholls">DNicholls</a> 23:47, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>There is a difference: The <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardinality.html" title="Cardinality">cardinality</a> of the prime numbers is bounded by the cardinality of the integers (aleph nought), but the cardinality of non-prime numbers is greater than aleph nought, as all real numbers in the interval (0,1) are numbers that are not prime. Thus, prime numbers and non-prime numbers have an infinite number, but there are more non-prime numbers. --<a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPagrashtak_1a5a.html" title="User:Pagrashtak">Pagrashtak</a> 02:36, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Subjects of biographical articles don't get to control whether they appear in Wikipedia. That is a principle that we strongly adhere to in <i>both</i> directions — where a subject wants xyr biography deleted and where a subject wants xyr biography created. I presume that the subject of this biographical article mailed 162.83.238.217 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_162.83.238.217_f972.html" title="Special:Contributions/162.83.238.217">contribs</a>), the creator of the article, since it is that user that has blanked it twice and then nominated it for deletion here. (<a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">CSD criterion G7</a> does not apply. Others have edited the article.) It is difficult to understand quite why the subject has expressed xyr "displeasure", given that the article says much the same as do the autobiographies in the by-lines to <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/merlin10112003.html" class="external text" title="http://www.counterpunch.org/merlin10112003.html" rel="nofollow">xyr own stories</a>. But we should ignore such displeasure in any case. I've added some references to the article (It had none.) to help editors in deciding whether this writer for <i><a href="../../../c/o/u/Counterpunch_%28newsletter%29.html" title="Counterpunch (newsletter)">Counterpunch</a></i> satisfies the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria.

<li>I don't have circulation figures for <i><a href="../../../c/o/u/Counterpunch_%28newsletter%29.html" title="Counterpunch (newsletter)">Counterpunch</a></i> available, but the Wikipedia article on it leads me to infer that it is popular enough that the "published author in periodicals with a circulation of 5,000 or more" criterion might well apply.

<li>OK, OK, I over-exagerated all. I just wanted to make it worth reading. Lakes contamination would have been fine, but don't tell me that the experiments thing is not atractive and funny. The man who found the first specimen was not mad. He was australian, but the fact that he supossedly was mad make the text more cinematographic.

<li><b>Delete.</b> And you will have about 600,000 other online resources to find info about whichever pornstar or adult model you are researching. This is not Porncyclopedia. Considering the staggering number of pornstars, nude models, and adult "actresses" that have or will exist, I think a pretty high bar of notability is needed to be considered for inclusion here. For example, <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kristi_Myst_e46e.html" title="Kristi Myst">Kristi Myst</a> (VfD below) seems to have been able to move into non-porno entertainment, which is relatively rare, and her involvement in pro wrestling has raised her notability greatly.

<li><b>Comment</b>: You are arguing against the inclusion of pornography-related topics in general. Porn actresses can have a high notability for their career alone. For example, in Germany <a href="../../../g/i/n/Gina_Wild_b20c.html" title="Gina Wild">Gina Wild</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dolly_Buster_d287.html" title="Dolly Buster">Dolly Buster</a> were widely known (even by those who did not watch their flics) even before they retired from the porn industry. Regardless of that pornography is its own field of interest and thus porn actresses needn't be known much outside that field, just as most computing and physics theories are not known much outside their fields. I'd wager more people know about various porn actresses than about the theories of quantum physics. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmodai_1a4e.html" title="User:Ashmodai">Ashmodai</a> 05:25, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The article has a severe <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiability</a> problem, that is endemic to people in the pornography industry. The biographies that accompany the pictures are well-known for being made up, and, by the nature of the industry, there are often no other sources of biographical information at all. The secrecy that these people surround themselves with, as a consequence of what they do, makes them too secret for Wikipedia. Moreover, as <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuale_0e6d.html" title="User:Quale">Quale</a> says, a pornography actress does not satisfy the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria for simply being a pornography actress. There is no evidence that this person has been on a magazine cover, caused a legal controversy or a scandal, starred in a mainstream film, run a major business, written a book, or been first in a field. All that we verifiably know about this person, once the "I went to school with her." information is subtracted, is her pseudonym, purported age, and job. If those alone were enough to satisfy the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria, everyone with a <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_card.html" title="Green card">green card</a> would qualify for a biographical article. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:12:19, 2005-07-27 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Considering that there are more types of information than just the biography about such actresses and models (e.g. a filmography, a list of studios they have worked for, magazines they have appeared in, etc etc) biographical data makes up only a part of the information -- and if no (serious) biographical data is available, then we can't put any biographical data online. Besides, the private data released by porn studios about their models isn't usually much more fabricated or questionable than that released by other, non-porn, agencies -- except for the entirely fake stories you find next to girls on page 3, but everyone knows those are made up based on the photo, not the girl herself anyway (besides, they aren't intended to be taken serious)&#160;:P <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshmodai_1a4e.html" title="User:Ashmodai">Ashmodai</a> 18:46, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, as notable with 263 (known) titles to her credit; again, <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allie_Sin_b0f1.html" title="Allie Sin">Allie Sin</a> only has under 20 to her present credit. As for the lack of a biography, there's just not much information is available for one -- doesn't mean that it should be deleted. For notability, Google has 400,000 results under "Shay Sweet" (note the quotes, which make for more precise searching); "Allie Sin" has just under 20,000 -- which are mainly dupes, AFAICT. -- <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe_Beaudoin_Jr._f03b.html" title="User:Joe Beaudoin Jr.">Joe Beaudoin Jr.</a> 10:55, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> I've just noticed this page is not on the VfD's for 26 June 2005. I'll correct it when back from work, in the hopes that this nomination can receive the proper exposure. Or, unless someone actually wants to follow the <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">how to list pages for deletion</a> guidelines, I wouldn't mind.&#160;:-) -- <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe_Beaudoin_Jr._f03b.html" title="User:Joe Beaudoin Jr.">Joe Beaudoin Jr.</a> 10:55, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
