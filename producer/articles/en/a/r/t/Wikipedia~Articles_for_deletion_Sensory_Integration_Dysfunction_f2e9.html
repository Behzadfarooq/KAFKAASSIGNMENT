<li><b>Keep</b> this article has an edit history dating to 2003, it reads sensibly, maybe an issue with some reverts in the history, but otherwise I can see no problem with this that cannot be sorted out by collective agreement on the articles talk page. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiki_alf_522c.html" title="User:Wiki alf">Alf</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWiki_alf_56f1.html" title="User talk:Wiki alf"><font color="green">melmac</font></a></sup> 11:31, 12 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem is that they make wild claims about hypersensitivity and hyposensitivity that they cannot backup with evidences. I cannot see anywhere published research that says sensitivity differences would be related to dysfunctions in integration of sensory information. This seems to be a wild guess only. There is no DSM entry either for SID --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 14:06, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>keep</b>The term is well-known, nearly 80000 Google hits should be sufficient proof. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 13:12, 12 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think Google is much of an indication, especially since the individual words are quite commmon. A search on sensory+integration+dysfunction on PublMed gives 4 hits and none of them give evidences for the theory presented in the article.--<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 14:06, 12 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I was searching for the phrase, <i>i.e.</i> "sensory integration dysfunction". Even if it isn't in the DSM and not backed up by science it's at least a popular phrase that is much being thrown around. sensory+integration+autism gave 24 PubMed hits. Besides, for pseudoscience PubMed isn't the best source. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 14:30, 12 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If it is pseudoscience, according to <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a> policy it should be deleted or at least the article should describe it as such. Another problem is the links, that goes to a company selling treatments for autism. Advertising isn't allowed on WP either --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 16:17, 12 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not up to us to condemn the research as bogus, what matters is that it is <i>popular bogus</i>. Our job is not to judge but to report what the arguments on both sides are and who supports the theory and who doesn't. The linkspam must go, of course. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 18:09, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You'd better present it here as well then. AFAIK, what you presented was evidence that the treatment that predated the theory of SID is well established.

<li><b>Delete</b> as neologism. Doesn't actually say what the alleged condition <i>is</i>. Mentions what "sensory" means (several times). but never specifies what this neological, sorry, neurological, disorder, manifests as, apart from a sudden leap to autism. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonywalton_6afa.html" title="User:Tonywalton">Tonywalton</a> <a href="../../../p/e/n/Image%7EPentacle.svg_e6ae.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/b/b6/Pentacle.svg/15px-Pentacle.svg.png" alt="" width="15" height="15" longdesc="../../../p/e/n/Image%7EPentacle.svg_e6ae.html" /></a>&#160;| <small><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETonywalton_f58c.html" title="User talk:Tonywalton">Talk</a></small> 22:47, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Can't vouch for the content but apparently is a well-known term. See, <i>New York Times,</i> "Not All Swings Are Created Equal," Sept. 4, 2005. pg. 14.6 (story about a child with "Sensory Integration Disorder"); "Psychotherapy of a Dissociative 8-Year-Old Boy Burned at Age 3," Bradley C Stolbach. <i>Psychiatric Annals.</i> Thorofare: Aug 2005.Vol.35, Iss. 8; pg. 685 (child had been receiving treatment for, among other things, "sensory integration dysfunction."). <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 05:07, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> with {{not verified}} tag (my edit) as a request for further sourcing and verification. This <i>looks</i> like reasonable biomedical science (to my layman's eye), but if relatively newly identified and accepted in the scientific community, there will be acceptable references, although they might take a while to percolate from the world of journals to the publicly-accessible Web. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 07:15, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There are several pubmed hits for "Sensory integration dysfunction" (see, e.g., <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=14730839" class="external" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=14730839">PMID 14730839</a> and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=2468631" class="external" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=2468631">PMID 2468631</a>) and many more for sensory integration therapy, which I agree seems to be a separate thing. Rdos, please read the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a> policy more carefully, as I am not sure that you understand it yet. If you need help understanding it and have questions, please feel free to drop by my talk page and ask me; I'll be glad to help.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Much of the information in this Sensory Integration Dysfunction article can be confirmed in a book called "The Out-of-Sync Child Recognizing and Coping with Sensory Integration Dysfunction" by Carol Stock Kranowitz, M.A. Rdos, I am aware that not all people who have autism have Sensory Integration Dysfunction as a co-morbid condition and this article does not imply they do. However many do, including several members of my family as well as myself. It is a good thing to have a thumbnail article about Sensory Integration Dysfunction like this for laymen. Regards, Aspens (newly registered user) 18:50, 14 September 2005
<ul>
<li>The point is not whether your family have the <b>symptoms</b> of SID. The point is that it has not been verified that these symptoms are <b>caused</b> by integration issues in the brain. --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 09:31, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I have SID, so this article's quite important to me. In regards to copyright or advertising, we can clean it up. <a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_8141.html" title="User:Sean"><b>Sean</b></a> (<a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESean_064f.html" title="User talk:Sean">talk</a> || <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sean_b423.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sean">edits)</a> 11:29, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I also have SID. I refer people to this page because it the only convenient summary of SID on the internet. In regards to Tonywalton's comment, this article says exact what it is.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Reservations about the validity of SID can be discussed on the talk page or in an added section in the article, but this is a legitimate topic worthy of an article. There should also be an article about <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sensory_diet.html" title="Sensory diet">sensory diets</a>, a popular trend in treating <a href="../../../p/e/r/Pervasive_developmental_disorder.html" title="Pervasive developmental disorder">Pervasive developmental disorders</a>, and these articles should link to each other. --<a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">Woggly</a> 06:56, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
