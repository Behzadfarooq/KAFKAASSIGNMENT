<p>Arthur Henderson was born in <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow.html" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1863.html" title="1863">1863</a>, the son of a textile worker who died when Arthur was only 10 years old. After his father's death, the Hendersons moved to <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newcastle_upon_Tyne_155c.html" title="Newcastle upon Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a> in the North East of <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>.</p>
<p>Henderson worked in a locomotive factory from the age of 12. After finishing his apprenticeship at seventeen, Arthur Henderson moved to Southampton for a year and then returned to work as an iron moulder (a type of foundryman) in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. He converted to <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodism.html" title="Methodism">Methodism</a> (having previously been a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congregational_church.html" title="Congregational church">Congregationalist</a>) in <a href="../../../1/8/7/1879.html" title="1879">1879</a>. This had a major impact on Henderson and he became a Lay Preacher. In <a href="../../../1/8/8/1884.html" title="1884">1884</a>, Henderson lost his job, and concentrated on his education, and preaching commitments.</p>

<p>However by <a href="../../../1/8/9/1892.html" title="1892">1892</a>, Henderson had entered the complex world of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_Union_af21.html" title="Trade Union">Trade Union</a> politics, when he was elected as a paid organiser for the Iron Founders Union, and was also a representative on the North East Conciliation Board.</p>
<p>Henderson believed that strikes caused more harm than they were worth, and tried to avoid them whenever he could. For this reason he opposed the formation of the General Federation of Trade Union, as he was convinced it would lead to more strikes.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Henderson_b5e4.html" title="Edit section: The Labour Party">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Labour Party</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/0/1900.html" title="1900">1900</a>, Henderson was one of the 129 trade union and socialist delegates, who passed <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keir_Hardie_8823.html" title="Keir Hardie">Keir Hardie</a>'s motion to create the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_Representation_Committee_fa30.html" title="Labour Representation Committee">Labour Representation Committee</a> (LRC), and in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1903.html" title="1903">1903</a>, Henderson was elected treasurer of the LRC, and was also elected <a href="../../../m/e/m/Member_of_Parliament_22d1.html" title="Member of Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> (MP) for <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barnard_Castle_0d3a.html" title="Barnard Castle">Barnard Castle</a> following a by-election.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/0/1906.html" title="1906">1906</a>, the LRC changed its name to the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_Party_%28UK%29_3e02.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a> and won 29 seats in the general election of that year (which was a <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landslide_victory.html" title="Landslide victory">landslide victory</a> for the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_%28UK%29_4ba9.html" title="Liberal Party (UK)">Liberal Party</a>).</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/0/1908.html" title="1908">1908</a>, when Hardie resigned as Leader of the Labour Party, Henderson was elected to replace him, and was leader for two fairly quiet (from Labour's perspective) years, before resigning in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1910.html" title="1910">1910</a>.</p>

Henderson was elected to replace him, and in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1915.html" title="1915">1915</a>, following Prime Minister <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_Henry_Asquith_45f9.html" title="Herbert Henry Asquith">Asquith</a>'s decision to create a coalition government, became the first member of the Labour Party to become a member of the Cabinet, as <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_Board_of_Education_051c.html" title="President of the Board of Education">President of the Board of Education</a>.</p>

It is doubtful that Henderson was one of the plotters, but he himself resigned in August <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a> when his idea for an international conference on the war was voted down by the rest of the cabinet; shortly afterwards he resigned as Labour leader.</p>

<p>Henderson lost his seat in the "coupon election" of December 14, 1918, an election announced within twenty four hours of the end of hostilities in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> that resulted in a landslide victory for a coalition formed by presiding Prime Minister <a href="../../../l/l/o/Lloyd_George_55bd.html" title="Lloyd George">Lloyd George</a><a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/electionspast/story/0,15867,1450370,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/electionspast/story/0,15867,1450370,00.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Henderson returned to Parliament in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a> after winning a by-election in <a href="../../../w/i/d/Widnes_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_b4a4.html" title="Widnes (UK Parliament constituency)">Widnes</a>. After his election, he became Labour's <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whip_%28politics%29.html" title="Whip (politics)">chief whip</a>, only to lose his seat in the <a href="../../../1/9/2/1922.html" title="1922">1922</a> general election.</p>
<p>Again, he returned to Parliament via a by-election, this time representing Newcastle East, however he lost this seat in the <a href="../../../1/9/2/1923.html" title="1923">1923</a> general election, but returned to Parliament two months later after winning a by-election in <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burnley_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_6e95.html" title="Burnley (UK Parliament constituency)">Burnley</a>. He was appointed <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_of_State_for_the_Home_Department_a1db.html" title="Secretary of State for the Home Department">Home Secretary</a> in the first ever Labour government (led by MacDonald). This government was defeated in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924.html" title="1924">1924</a>, and lost the following election partially because of the infamous <a href="../../../z/i/n/Zinoviev_letter.html" title="Zinoviev letter">Zinoviev letter</a> printed in the right-wing tabloid the <i><a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Mail_c8b4.html" title="Daily Mail">Daily Mail</a></i>.</p>
<p>Unusually, Henderson was re-elected in 1924, and he refused to challenge MacDonald for the party leadership, despite being apparently begged by other MPs to do just that. Worried about factionalism in the Labour Party, he published a pamphlet called <i>Labour and the Nation</i>, in which he attempted to clarify the Labour's goals.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a>, Labour formed another minority government, and MacDonald appointed Henderson as <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_of_State_for_Foreign_Affairs_5a9a.html" title="Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs">Foreign Secretary</a>, a position Henderson used to try to reduce the tensions that had been building up in Europe since the end of the War. Diplomatic relations were re-established with the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">USSR</a> and the <a href="../../../l/e/a/League_of_Nations_d214.html" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a> was given Britain's full support.</p>
<p>The government was able to function properly, even without a parliamentary majority. However this did not last. The <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> plunged the government into a terminal crisis.</p>
<p><a name="The_MacDonald_.22betrayal.22" id="The_MacDonald_.22betrayal.22"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Henderson_b5e4.html" title="Edit section: The MacDonald &quot;betrayal&quot;">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The MacDonald "betrayal"</span></h2>
<p>The crisis began in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1931.html" title="1931">1931</a> when a key committee discovered that the budget was facing a serious deficit. This generated a crisis of confidence in the British financial system which threatened the Pound's position on the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold_Standard_f2c7.html" title="Gold Standard">Gold Standard</a>. The Labour Cabinet agreed that it was essential to maintain the Gold Standard and that the Budget needed to be balanced, but divided seriously over some of the measures proposed. Henderson found himself at the head of a minority of nearly half the Cabinet who could not accept a cut in <a href="../../../u/n/e/Unemployment_benefit.html" title="Unemployment benefit">unemployment benefit</a>. With the Cabinet so clearly divided it decided to resign office. On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_24.html" title="August 24">August 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1931.html" title="1931">1931</a> it was announced the MacDonald was forming an emergency <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_National_Government_c29e.html" title="UK National Government">National Government</a> with members of all parties in order to tackle the crisis. However the Labour Party repudiated this government, and the National Executive expelled from the party MacDonald and all other Labour members who supported him (Henderson cast the only vote against this). Henderson now became leader of the party as it became ever more hostile to the Government. With the economic and political situation still uncertain, the National Government decided to call a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1931_1edb.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1931">general election</a>, and in the largest landslide in British political history, it won an overwhelming majority. Labour was reduced to just 46 MPs, and yet again Henderson lost his seat. The following year he relinquished the party leadership.</p>
