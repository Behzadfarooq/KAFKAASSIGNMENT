<dd>I note that the comments have been separated into "delete", "mixed" and "merge" sections. I think this is counterproductive, as it does not show the evolution of the discussion on this topic chronologically. Please note also that this is not a "vote" process: it is a "discussion" process. I therefore request that this is restored to the normal chronological sequence, and the term "vote" is deleted. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 12:38, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed that this is not a truly democratic <i>voting</i> process. It can more accurately be described as a process to try to generate a consensus. I have seen many AfD's in the past structured this way. In fact, this whole process used to be called <i>Vote for deletion</i>. I think that the name may have been changed to better reflect the greater desire for consensus rather than for division which is the most common outcome of a <i>vote</i>. In my restructuring I have retained all timestamps so the sequential evolution of the dialogue can be noted. Restructuring it this way helped me to follow the commentary structure. In the spirit of the new <i>renaming</i> of this discussion, I will retitle the sections to <i>Suggestions for... this or that</i>. If you want to revert it back to the previously more random structure, that's fine with me. -<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottperry_5cbd.html" title="User:Scottperry">Scott P.</a> 12:49, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the offer. I am not going to over-ride the decision for splitting points of view, but I do think it makes it harder to follow the conversation. I think "suggestions" instead of "votes" is a good change, and makes things less rigid. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 13:56, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for your patience with me. The last time I was involved in AfD discussions, roughly a year ago, the format was as I had first refactored it. I see the benefit of the newer format and have since refactored this discussion back to the current norm.</dd>

<dd><b>Regarding the "<i>Idiosyncratic non-topic</i>" accusation:</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Course_In_Miracles_1d56.html" title="A Course In Miracles">A Course In Miracles</a> is <i>not</i> "<a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Age_1b86.html" title="New Age">New Age</a>" and it is not merely "a book." There is nothing in ACIM about crystals, auras, chakras, meditating, incense, UFOs, aliens, etc. ACIM is a self-contained spiritual thought system that blends non-dual views of God (akin to ancient Hindu teachings) with modern day psychological insight in the tradition of Freud and Jung. It was first published in 1975 and has since sold over 1 million copies; its sales show no sign of slowing down, and it has been translated into dozens of languages <a href="http://www.acim.org/translation_section/translation_program_intro.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.acim.org/translation_section/translation_program_intro.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. And it was the basis of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marianne_Williamson_28c0.html" title="Marianne Williamson">Marianne Williamson</a>'s book "A Return to Love" <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0060927488/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0060927488/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, which sold about four million copies in the US, and millions around the world. "A Course In Miracles" is projected by many to be as widely read as the Bible at some point.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>This issue was the centerpiece of a high profile lawsuit</b>. I'm sure that most of you, who appear largely to be uninterested in this whole genre of non-mainstream spirituality, as you have made snide and unfair comments about it, are completely unaware that this issue of authorship of ACIM became the focalpoint of a very high profile court case between <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foundation_for_A_Course_In_Miracles_a5a3.html" title="Foundation for A Course In Miracles">Foundation for A Course In Miracles</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endeavor_Academy_b302.html" title="Endeavor Academy">Endeavor Academy</a> <a href="http://www.acim.org/news_items/copyright_news.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.acim.org/news_items/copyright_news.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a><a href="http://www.endeavoracademy.com/courtcase/helenauthor.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.endeavoracademy.com/courtcase/helenauthor.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.</dd>

<dd>Lastly, this article does not contain "original research" as it links directly to comments from other sources. At this point, the article is not fully developed. Not being fully developed doesn't qualify this article as an "idiocyncratic non-issue," but as a <b>stub</b> -- and that's hardly a reason to delete the article.</dd>

<li><b>Mixed</b> I read this article and wanted to nominate it for BJAODN, but ACIM is notable nuttery and the lawsuit over "cannot hold the copyright to a work that was 'channeled from a disembodied entity'" probably makes this a notable topic. The parent article is very large, so I'm not sure whether some material on this topic should be merged into it. As it stands, all the unsourced references to "some people believe" ... "it is claimed that" ... make the majority of this article appear to cross <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. I would point out that this whole controversy is nothing more than solipsism, but the underlying topic seems to meet the same description. <b>neutral</b>, leaning toward <b>merge</b> (a sentence or two about the controversy, and most of the lawsuit paragraph). <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 02:57, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. The problem with the merge suggestion is that, as someone else noted, the main ACIM article is rather long. And though this article is itself only a stub at the moment, I anticipate it will grow a great deal after some time.

<dd><b>A History of this article: It actually <i>began</i> as a part of the main article</b>: Did you all know that this article actually <i>did</i> begin on the main page ... where it was debated and edited into non-existence? The topic of this article is so controversial that many people within the "Course community" do not want to discuss it, and therefore if it is merged back into the main ACIM article it will just disappear. Are those of you who are voting for it to merge willing to keep an eye on the main page and make sure the whole thing isn't just deleted?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The history of this article has been quite frustrating. First, I introduced it as a brief paragraph in the main article. In the main article, it was debated - rather hotly - until I decided to move it to its own article. Soon, it was suggested (by someone unfamiliar with ACIM) that it be merged <i>back</i> into the main article ... and now someone is suggesting it be deleted, and in response to the deletion request it is being suggested that it be merged again.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I suppose we can just go round and round with this one. We can merge it back, it can disappear, and I can start another article on this topic.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The main problem here is that most of you voting on what to do with this article are not ACIM students and therefore can't grasp that this issue has any importance. The other problem is impatience. Doesn't it take <i>time</i> for a stub to develop into a good article?</dd>

<dd>That's not the case at all. How can this be POV when I present two different opinions? I just don't get where you people are coming from. I make the claim that some people think Jesus is the literal source, THEN I SOURCE THAT CLAIM. Then I make the claim that some people think Jesus is the symbolic source, THEN I SOURCE THAT CLAIM. You all just don't "get" what the article is about because the topic is out of your league. So frustrating to have people vote on a topic that they don't even understand or care about.

<dd><b>Please also note:</b> Many of you have commented on my use of the words "some people" and on an apparent lack of sources.

<dd>Such comments are indeed sourced. Read the damned articles I link to.

<dd>To start, the term "original research" as used on Wikipedia is imprecise. I am currently taking a college class on writing research papers, and the bulk of the class is devoted to understanding how to list the sources upon which one's research paper is based. Explicit in this class is the rule that in doing research <i>one must cite one's outside sources</i>. It's odd that on Wikipedia the term "original research" is apparently used to denote an article lacking reference to outside sources. But I'll set that argument aside.</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b> ACIM seems to me to most certainly be a topic of note. This aspect of ACIM seems to me to so far be a topic that has not yet shown to be of great interest to many, yet there does appear to me to be some potential for future interest. I vote to merge as suggested on the article's discussion page at <a href="../../../j/e/s/Talk%7EJesus_Christ_as_source_of__A_Course_In_Miracles__5eab.html#AfD_discussion" title="Talk:Jesus Christ as source of &quot;A Course In Miracles&quot;">the article's discusison page, AfD section</a>. -<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottperry_5cbd.html" title="User:Scottperry">Scott P.</a> 12:31, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Mixed</b> , <b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b>. It's not fair to condemn it as NOR, as there are 7 references given and this is obviously a topic of debate that exists beyond the authorship of this article. Describing it as "BJAODN" and "notable nuttery" is completely POV. Wiki is here to record what other people are saying, not how we see things, and a lot of people take this seriously. Is any "religious" topic "notable nuttery?" Some might think so. Comments such as "some people believe" are weasel words, which may or may not also fall foul of NOR, but do not necessarily do so. They may merely indicate the author is not entirely familiar with writing guidelines. OK, so it needs to be cleaned up. There is no intrinsic bar to solipsism, as far as I know. It does indeed concern a "single new age book", but one which was a best-seller in its field, popular and influential. Negative comments about this topic can also be included in the article, provided they are properly referenced. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 03:49, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>The <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> policy applies to article content, not to project discussions. Nonetheless I apologize for mixing personal opinion with editorial discussion. As a person (not in my role as editor) I consider all religions large and small to be nuttery. As a WP editor I consider those religions which have verifiable notability (regardless of illogicality) to be worth serious attention, including balance against POV editing by adherents. The fact remains that I got a good laugh out of "copyright to a work that was 'channeled from a disembodied entity'", and almost as much from the underlying argument. The improvements in documentation would lead me to change my vote to "neutral, leaning toward Keep" if a partisan editor hadn't refactored this AfD discussion contrary to the AfD norm. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 14:24, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, then you may be interested to find that <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Course_In_Miracles_1d56.html" title="A Course In Miracles">A Course In Miracles</a> is not a religion. It is merely a book that you read. Some people have started churches around it, but there is nothing in the book that talks about the need to start churches. The book designates itself as a self-study book intended for the individual to read on his own. Further, the Course has little resemblance to any religion because it denies a creator God; I attended a workshop with Kenneth Wapnick two years ago at <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foundation_for_A_Course_In_Miracles_a5a3.html" title="Foundation for A Course In Miracles">Foundation for A Course In Miracles</a> wherein he referred to A Course In Miracles as being "<a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheistic.html" title="Atheistic">atheistic</a>", because the Course says God did not make the physical world and has nothing to do with it. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 06:04, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. This article is not a "POV fork". It caused controversy on the original page because it is a controversial issue, which you and the others would understand if you were to read the links I provide in the article and above. It was later decided that it was <i>too</i> controversial, and therefore too expansive, for the main page. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversy.html" title="Controversy">Controversy</a> is not the same as a POV fork. There are many controversial issues that are given their own pages. And as this issue (whether Jesus is the source of A Course In Miracles) resulted in a lawsuit between a major publisher (Penguin) and two non-profit organizations (<a href="../../../f/o/u/Foundation_for_A_Course_In_Miracles_a5a3.html" title="Foundation for A Course In Miracles">Foundation for A Course In Miracles</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endeavor_Academy_b302.html" title="Endeavor Academy">Endeavor Academy</a>), and is important to tens of thousands of people around the world, it is indeed a notable issue. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 11:40, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I also propose that there be a section added that presents why some people believe it is literally Jesus, the lack of that section, while having an entire symbolic section makes this a POV fork.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. That's exactly what I was thinking.
