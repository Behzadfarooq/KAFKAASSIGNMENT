<li><b>Keep</b>: Although poorly cited, it is certainly not 'fancruft': the issue is a central theme to Rowling's novels, and the article describes how and why that is so, and the features and effects of that in the novels.

<blockquote>
<p><b>unpublished facts</b>, arguments, concepts, statements, or theories, or any <b>unpublished analysis or synthesis of published material</b></p>

(emphasis added) For information to be included here (on Wikipedia), it must be published elsewhere, in reliable sources, first. Just saying "<i>I read it all in the books</i>" doesn't cut it here. Wikipedia <i>does</i> have room for articles about novels but that doesn't mean we need an article about every idea in every novel. As this article doesn't seem to deal with the symbolism of the whole concept it isn't even an exceptionially good article about a novel. It appears to be mainly a collection of facts about the characters in the novels. Also, "fewer people write about the Bible"? I sure hope you are just referring to Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr.Z-man_cef0.html" title="User:Mr.Z-man"><font color="maroon">Mr.Z-man</font></a><b><small><a href="../../../m/r/2E/User_talk%7EMr.Z-man_a62d.html" title="User talk:Mr.Z-man">talk</a></small><i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mr.Z-man_8ed1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mr.Z-man"><font color="navy" face="cursive">¢</font></a></i></b> 23:59, 6 April 2007 (UTC)

<li>Actually, as an contemporary absolute, it is likely that more people currently write about Harry Potter than about the Bible - there are fewer fan-forums discussing whether John the Divine will kill off his hero in his next book, for example. Naturally, more people <i>have</i> written about the Bible, and more people currently write worthwhile reading about it than about HP; nonetheless, wikipedia is written by everyone, and, in this world, the collective <i>everyone</i> is at present more interested in and capable of writing fluently about the relevance of purity of heritage in the works of JK Rowling than of St Paul. More to the point, you appear to be contradicting yourself above: OR is unpublished or synthesised material; yet you also claim that material from the novels (in this case, the very epitome of non-OR) is not appropriate. I suggest that you, and anyone who believes the article contains OR, sweep through it applying <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> labels; show us what you believe is OR, since quite obviously an article about one of <i>the</i> central issues of the novels is extremely relevant to the coverage of the novels by this encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelsanders_fc38.html" title="User:Michaelsanders">Michael</a> <a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaelsanders_ec6a.html" title="User talk:Michaelsanders">Sanders</a> 01:16, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

<li>"<b>unpublished analysis or synthesis of published material</b>" This seems to be the majority of the article in question. While much of the article simply reports facts from the books: <i>Lucius Malfoy is known to be a Death Eater.</i> That is a fact that anyone can see by reading the respective book.<i>When Bellatrix says "sons" it must be taken in context - in the scene her sister Narcissa weeps that her son Draco Malfoy has been given a terrible task by Voldemort. Bellatrix would likely make no distinction between a son or daughter, pressing either into Lord Voldemort's service.</i> That would be considered original research by <a href="../../../s/y/n/WP%7ESYN_b7b5.html" title="WP:SYN">synthesis</a>. This article seems to primarily base itself on primary sources (ie. the books). However, <i>"Wikipedia articles should rely on reliable, verifiable, published secondary sources wherever possible. This means that we present verifiable accounts of views and arguments of reliable scholars, and not interpretations of primary source material by Wikipedians."</i> <a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr.Z-man_cef0.html" title="User:Mr.Z-man"><font color="maroon">Mr.Z-man</font></a><b><small><a href="../../../m/r/2E/User_talk%7EMr.Z-man_a62d.html" title="User talk:Mr.Z-man">talk</a></small><i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mr.Z-man_8ed1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mr.Z-man"><font color="navy" face="cursive">¢</font></a></i></b> 02:59, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

There's a difference, as Madman mentioned, between original research and what this article is. It is <i>not</i>, in the real world's definition, original research, but by Wikipedia's definition, it is, because, apparently, it is not referenced. Please note that not being referenced is not a reason to delete an article, <i>if it can be referenced</i>, and this article can be referenced through the use of various interviews with Rowling, the books, and a number of scholarly essays (I own a book with at least two, and there are probably loads more online). Consider that this article is not deletable material, but rather just in bad shape. <b>Also</b>, <i>please</i> do not go out of control with the fan-hatin' and the comparing-to-other-articles-which-you-deem-more-important, as usually happens in a Harry Potter AfD… just keep to Keep, Delete, or whatever, and leave the "überfancruftism" extremes out of it.&#160;:-) Just a friendly comment to keep things within reason here. Harry Potter has just a place as any in this encyclopedia, and sometimes articles can get a little carried away with text and a little lacking in references. We are trying to clean that up.

<li><b>Comment</b> As it seems this is going to be kept, I must bring up another point that I said earlier but was buried in another comment. The reason that this appears to be a "fan article" is because it reads like one. It simply describes a concept used throughout the series, making no reference, that I can find at least, to the literaty significance of said concept. It gives a <i><b>ton</b></i> of facts about the stories (way too many) without delving into the symbolism <i>behind</i> the concept. It just doesn't "look" encyclopedic. It looks like the kind of thing I would expect to find on a Harry Potter fansite, not in an encyclopedia. As it stands, this isn't an article about a <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theme_%28literature%29.html" title="Theme (literature)">theme</a> but about a simple <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literary_technique.html" title="Literary technique">idea</a> used in the books. <a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr.Z-man_cef0.html" title="User:Mr.Z-man"><font color="maroon">Mr.Z-man</font></a><b><small><a href="../../../m/r/2E/User_talk%7EMr.Z-man_a62d.html" title="User talk:Mr.Z-man">talk</a></small><i><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mr.Z-man_8ed1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mr.Z-man"><font color="navy" face="cursive">¢</font></a></i></b> 18:49, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
