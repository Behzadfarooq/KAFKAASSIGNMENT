<p>Hopefully this is a no-brainer not deserving the space and attention needed to present my complex evidence on the, arguably, bad faith I think the article was created in. I present several reasons why this page does not deserve its Wikipedia space:</p>
<p>(1) Accuracy dispute. I could not find a source that specifies the existence of the school (at least under the name "Ohio Womens Methodist Seminary"). The burden of proving the existence of such a school should be on the article's creator, not me, though. Online searches show no results under this name...which merits the suspicion, that even if such a school did exist under this name, it was so non-notable that it isn't cited in any documents by anyone these days.</p>
<p>(2) To begin with, there is no source that specifies Ohio Womens Methodist Seminary as the actual name of a school in <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delaware%2C_Ohio_93b3.html" title="Delaware, Ohio">Delaware, Ohio</a> at that time! This violates the rationale for pages not to be "too secret" (i.e. "Secret societies are unverifiable and often non-notable". Wikipedia articles must be verifiable. Almost by definition, the world cannot verify things about secret societies). This is not a "secret society" per se, but the existence of the school should be verifiable through paper or online sources.</p>
<p>(3) The article was created by a user <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStude62_1ae3.html" title="User:Stude62">user:Stude62</a> who had created several other articles that violate, or are on the border of vilaoting, the vanity policy of Wikipedia ("vanity" is a shorthand for "This page is about a person, institution, or organization who Wikipedia's guidelines suggest does not merit an article"). On his user page he states <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Stude62" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Stude62" rel="nofollow">of recent times find myself up to my eyeballs in Methodist Episcopal Church history (my gr gr gr great grandfather was an M.E. circuit preacher in central Ohio) and defending it from those who should know better, but are too wrapped up in their own feelings and perceptions to know any different.</a></p>
<p>Several other article created by the same user are Monnett Weekend, <a href="../../../o/r/r/Orra_E._Monnette_1f5e.html" title="Orra E. Monnette">Orra E. Monnette</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Monnett_Bain_da3f.html" title="Mary Monnett Bain">Mary Monnett Bain</a> <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monnett_Hall_4446.html" title="Monnett Hall">Monnett Hall</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monnett_Bain_Davis_4965.html" title="Monnett Bain Davis">Monnett Bain Davis</a>. All of them debatably non-notable and written with the sole purpose to "defending it from those who should know better". The Monnett Weekend page was recently listed on VfD and removed. The article listed on here honor the exact same topic and should be removed as well.</p>
<p>(4) There is a separate page about the real name of the institution at the time: <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_Wesleyan_Female_College_2014.html" title="Ohio Wesleyan Female College">Ohio Wesleyan Female College</a> which no longer exists but is nevertheless legit. I suggest that some of the information be moved to that page as it was the official name of the female college.</p>
<p>(5) This is a "POV fork". Debatably the most notable part of the article is about <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Monnett_Bain_da3f.html" title="Mary Monnett Bain">Mary Monnett Bain</a>. That article already presents the arguably "notable" part on there.</p>
<p>(6) Several Wesleyan alumni have agreed that such a name <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_Womens_Methodist_Seminary_3891.html" title="Ohio Womens Methodist Seminary">Ohio Womens Methodist Seminary</a> is not notable even among the <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_Wesleyan_University_7bf4.html" title="Ohio Wesleyan University">Ohio Wesleyan University</a> "family".</p>
<p>(7) Finally, one can argue that <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Monnett_Bain_da3f.html" title="Mary Monnett Bain">Mary Monnett Bain</a> is arguably worthy an article herself vilating notability ("non-notable" or "nn" are shorthands for "Something that (the voter thinks) is unimportant due to its obscurity or lack of differentiation from others of its type"). There was a separate VfD on that article but it is not the objec of this VfD.</p>
<p>If the article is related to something more common or well-known like the <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_Wesleyan_Female_College_2014.html" title="Ohio Wesleyan Female College">Ohio Wesleyan Female College</a>, consider merging it with that.</p>
<p>My job is done here.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> to confirm details. Monnett Hall, Monnett Weekend and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Monnett_Bain_da3f.html" title="Mary Monnett Bain">Mary Monnett Bain</a> all check out in external sources. The entry on Leroy A. Belt on the official history page of Ohio Northern University, <a href="http://www.onu.edu/onuhistory/" class="external text" title="http://www.onu.edu/onuhistory/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, says he "served as financial agent for Monnett Hall, an independent women's academy, which merged with Ohio Wesleyan in 1877." So you're alleging this article that centrally claims <i>the quickly provable</i> fact that Monnett Hall, an independent women's institution, merged into Ohio Wesleyan University is "bad faith?" The only things that would need further research are whether Ohio Womens Methodist Seminary <i>was a name or the formal name</i> of Monett Hall. There's no comprehensive information about historical schools on the web, but this obviously could be referenced with printed sources in libraries and maybe even an historical plaque onsite. Patnaik, what is your "complex evidence" of bad faith? Btw, the article is by the apparently credible <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStude62_1ae3.html" title="User:Stude62">User:Stude62</a>. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamaritan_f083.html" title="User:Samaritan">Samaritan</a> 15:28, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Fascinating article, fascinating topic. That's assuming the current article is accurate, but that hasn't been questioned above.

<li>Comment: Thank you. Having skimmed the RfC, and noting that there is nothing on the article's <a href="../../../o/h/i/Talk%7EOhio_Womens_Methodist_Seminary_d59c.html" title="Talk:Ohio Womens Methodist Seminary">talk page</a> about any accuracy dispute (perhaps I should have said that before), I reluctantly conclude that this VfD nomination was made in bad faith. I nearly said that before too, the term <i>no-brainer</i> is a portent. No change of vote. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 16:19, 12 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Comment: Dear me, what a mess has now been made of the discussion above. Is it coincidence that the argument Patnaik has obscured by his carelessness is against him?

<li>Thanks for your efforts, and they have addressed some of my concerns.

<li>Isn't it entirely possible and believable Ohio Womens Methodist Seminary either co-existed with <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_Wesleyan_Female_College_2014.html" title="Ohio Wesleyan Female College">Ohio Wesleyan Female College</a> or was an original or alternate name name of OWFC? (For anyone else wondering about the Wesleyan/Methodist distinction, <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_Wesleyan_University_7bf4.html" title="Ohio Wesleyan University">Ohio Wesleyan University</a>, per its article Patnaik was the last to edit, was founded by <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodist.html" title="Methodist">Methodists</a> in 1841; the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wesleyan_Church_3704.html" title="Wesleyan Church">Wesleyan Methodist</a> church formally split from the Methodists in 1843.) Comparing a rural 19th century women's college to a "secret society" because Google provides no hits overstates and assumes bad faith. It's certainly verifiable one way or the other with hard copy sources, and we should <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a> on the part of the creator. The article doesn't mention any man, so it doesn't seem "glorify" Stude62's great+grandfather as the nominator charges.

<p>I've dropped back in for a moment and would like to thank all for voted to keep the article, as well as those who voted against it as an <i>impartial</i> act. I have kept out of this debate because I had become very disilluioned about Wikipedia and group of user. This vote has redeemed that faith.</p>
<p>I would like to thank those who have called others on their bad faith action against me and this article.</p>
<p>This matter could have been settled from the very beginning had certain Wikipedian's allowed primary, factual information held in the OWU archives to stand. They did not. I also suspect that a number of users whose only activity exists to manipulate the information regarding OWU have chimed in on this VFD; their trails can be viewed through their account history.</p>
<p>I also call to question any Wikipedian claiming to have attended OWU who has not heard of Mary Monnett Bain, Monnett Hall or the Ohio Womens Methodist Seminary. To think that they could have spent meaningful time on the OWU campus and have no historical background on the University seems very strange. To any uninvolved party who is a legitimate Wikipedian, not a shill or sock puppet, - this information may be verified through the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archives_of_Ohio_United_Methodism_06ca.html" title="Archives of Ohio United Methodism">Archives of Ohio United Methodism</a> which are held at OWU.</p>
<p>Wikipedia should be about correct information, not something that is simply a validation of Google, or other web sites. Wikipedians who think that Google, Yahoo and other high level web sites are the only acceptible sources for information will undermine not only the sharing and growth of information, but will also doom Wikipedia to nothing greater than a parrot for web based knowledge.
