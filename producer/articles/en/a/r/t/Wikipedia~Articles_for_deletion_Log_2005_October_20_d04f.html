<li>Well...<b>delete</b>. But only for the reason that he appears non-notable by WP standards. His contributing his own article does not <i>neccessarily</i> mean that we have to delete it.

Alex Makin is a publically known activist- just a couple of days ago I was reading an article about him in the Age, the most respected newspaper in Melbourne <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/new-bus-routes-on-way/2005/10/12/1128796587896.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/new-bus-routes-on-way/2005/10/12/1128796587896.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. He is also mentioned as a key player in official parliamentary hansard <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=alex+makin+hansard&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=cr%3DcountryAU" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=alex+makin+hansard&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=cr%3DcountryAU" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, showing that he does not necesssarily need to be elected to be notable.

<p>This is just a thinly veiled attempt to merge a series of FOSS articles without consensus. It's a duplicate of content that already exists in the other articles. One reason cited to create the article was that the other articles were POV, but that's not a valid reason to create a new article. The title of the article itself is POV, as many would disagree that one is necessarily an alterntive term for the other. <a href="../../../n/j/y/User%7ENjyoder_568f.html" title="User:Njyoder">Nathan J.

<dl>
<dd>I beg others to check what Njyoder is saying. The talk page for the article never says anything about other articles being POV. The Talk page says that this article is a consolidation of other articles, so yes it currently duplicates info on those articles. The reason for creating this page is that the other pages duplicate a lot of information (sometimes with inaccuracies, and those differ from article to article), and a secondary issue is that quality of the other pages seems to suggest that have few wikipedians caring for them (and this is a situation which has not been changing over the years) - merging to one article would combine their efforts. I plan to suggest a merge of the articles in question, when I've finished making this page. On the issue of POV, which has not been raised by me, but since it has been raised by the person requesting deletion of this page, combined efforts will bring more eyeballs to this page and more eyeballs should lead to less POV.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The articles which I've suggested merging into this article are <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libre_software.html" title="Libre software">libre software</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/o/FLOSS_260c.html" title="FLOSS">FLOSS</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/s/FOSS_b963.html" title="FOSS">FOSS</a>, and <a href="../../../o/s/s/OSS_FS_9f9e.html" title="OSS/FS">OSS/FS</a>. There may also exist others (of lesser size / of less known terms). Each is an alternative name for <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_software.html" title="Free software">free software</a>. Some can be thought of as an alternative name for "both free software and open source software", but, "open source software" is, by definition, an alternative name for "free software" <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-source.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-source.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. So I maintain that this page and it's name are accurate and would be an improvemet over the current situation. Finally, I would like to note that I only started this article a few minutes before it was suggested for delection, and I have commented that it's not yet ready, and I have continued to improve it since. It is therefore a work in progress (although a good one, IMO) and can of course me modified by anyone. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGronky_aa0a.html" title="User:Gronky">Gronky</a> 17:03, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You said: " Current pages for such terms are fairly thin, and go through phases of being biased." Correct me if I'm wrong, but 'biased' means POV. You've conceded that you've done a unilateral merge without consensus. The names "open source" and "free software" are associated with philosophies and movements as well, they're not just definitions for licenses, so it's misleading to classify them as that. <a href="../../../n/j/y/User%7ENjyoder_568f.html" title="User:Njyoder">Nathan J.

<dd>They go through phase of containing POV. POV isn't a persistant problem, but consistancy is a persistant problem. It appears that not many people are caring for these pages, and when edits are made it's by one person and it an go weeks or months without review. Also, I have not done any merge - not unilateral or multilateral. I have made a page which I hope will reach (or has already reached) a quality and usefulness where I can propose it for a merge. The philosophies put forward by FSF and OSI are indeed different, but this does not make FLOSS different from free software. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGronky_aa0a.html" title="User:Gronky">Gronky</a> 17:44, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So you admit you brought up POV then. You did merge the content, you took it from the articles and you stuck it in this one. That's called merging, it seems like the only means you have to counter my argument is some very weird semantic argument using a bizzare version of English that only you speak. And the philosophies are different, which means the associations between the terms are different, which means you can't just blindly substitute one for another as an "alternative." Meanings of words go beyond just what they are formally defined as. For example, the dictionary definition of "propaganda" is benign, but anyone who speaks the language knows it has an obvious negative connatation/meaning attached to it. And the idea that some of the terms are alternatives to others implies a certain inferiority as well. <a href="../../../n/j/y/User%7ENjyoder_568f.html" title="User:Njyoder">Nathan J.

<dd>"Merge" is a wikipedia term, as well you know. It means, approximately, to stick on a tag that suggests replacing many articles with 1. My page is not a merge. On the word "Alternatives", I've already agreed to remove the word. And you know this too. To steer clear of philosophical implications, in the article I try to talk about software "<i>that is covered by the names discussed in this article</i>". I can't think of a fairer method than that, and now that you've advertised this on the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open-source_software.html" title="Open-source software">open-source software</a> Talk page, that one side of the debate can contribute to the article if they feel there's misrepresentation.

<dd>They're new sections with duplicated content from other sections. The types of licenses covered, the history of the definitions/terms, the attempted registering of the trademark and so forth are all covered by the other articles. You're still using semantics to twist things. It's disingenuous to suggest that because other articles haven't used those specific headers that the content in those sections is new. I also noticed that you're already POVifying the article, trying to portray the term "free software" as if all they did was co-opt the term and renamed it (like they were just some copy cat movement), ignoring any kind of philosophical and pragmatic disagrements. <a href="../../../n/j/y/User%7ENjyoder_568f.html" title="User:Njyoder">Nathan J.

<dd>The bit up to the first comma is probably mentioned in an article somewhere, as is the bit between the first and second commas. The bit between the 2nd comma and the first full stop is new. The last sentence is also new, as far as I know. But, more than the newness of individual words, phrases, or sentences (and even if I'm not correct about the above, at least under the scrutiny you've been tracking me with of late), the arrangement of this information is new - rather than it being spread across multiple articles, each one with a different wording - here it is consolidated. It is undeniable that a non-zero amount of newness exists there - and you asked only for newness - so I think this is the conclusion on this issue. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGronky_aa0a.html" title="User:Gronky">Gronky</a> 21:46, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm certainly open to a change of name. I don't see "altenative" as being POV - but that could be just me. I think "Free Software terminology" changes the scope greatly. "terms for free software" would be good though. (the difference being that the latter says what the terminology is for, while the former says what it's about - which a hard to define relationship.) Another title I thought of was "suggested replacements for free software" - but FLOSS, FOSS, and OSS/FS weren't suggested as <i>replacements</i>, they were just suggested. "other names for free software"? Just "names for free software"? or "terms for free software"?

Keep in mind that it was proposed for deletion only minutes after I started making it, so it's not yet as complete as it will be. For example, I hadn't written the <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_terms_for_free_software.html#Licenses" title="Alternative terms for free software">Licenses</a> section when this was proposed for deletion, but I think that's a good section now and it doesn't completely fit under the topic of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_software.html" title="Free software">free software</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGronky_aa0a.html" title="User:Gronky">Gronky</a> 22:56, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I certainly see that this article, as is, can hardly be put verbatim into <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_software.html" title="Free software">free software</a> because it's just too long. However, I personally believe that, if it belongs anywhere, a very much more concise list in <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_software.html" title="Free software">free software</a> would be best.

<dd>Ok, I see where you're coming from. The list of terms can certainly be made more concise, and this is something that I plan to do (I just didn't get time to do this before an Afd suddenly appeared). I did the list first because it's the easiest, but I think the more important things are the bits I'm working on now such as the "Definitions and meanings" and the "Licenses" sections. If this article was just/mostly a list of names and blurbs about each, I'd agree that it should be merged - but please check back in a day or two and see where the article has developed to.

<dd>The Talk page was not meant to indicate that. The page is not supposed to have anything about the "GNU/Linux" naming stuff, and it shouldn't have Anything Vs. Otherthing. It's not about controvercy or disputes. This is the history of the names that have appeared, the reasons for each name, the meaning and associations of each name, and other factual stuff. Emotional stuff is for another article.

<dd>No, merges need to be voted on by people of all relevent articles. This isn't a merge, it's just a page.

<li>I think the book is notable, even if it didn't make any best-seller lists.</li>
<li>I think we need to recognize that there is a difference between an article that is POV, and an article that reports on a book, whose contents are POV. Articles on books that are POV are not necessarily POV themselves. If the article is NPOV it clearly belongs on the wikipedia.</li>
<li>If a book is notable enough to belong on the wikipedia, but the contents are agreed to be POV, then surely the next step is to rewrite it, or to add a {npov} tag?</li>
<li>The person who nominated this for deletion put a note in the talk page that the article was an <b>"inaccurate summary"</b> of the book. I haven't read the book.

<li>Wikipedians can differ on how much credibility they allow Dr Frank. But the book was widely reviewed and is regularly quoted and cited. And that, IMO, makes it worthy of mention in the wikipedia.</li>
<li>As to whether the information about the book should be merged with the George W. Bush article... I think the wikipedia is better served with the information about this book staying in an article of its own. I gather that the GWB article is beset by unending edit wars. IMO the current contents are NPOV. And it will be easier to keep them NPOV if it is a standalone article. Or restore it to NPOV, if you disagree about it being NPOV now.</li>
<li>IMO standalone ancillary articles make the wikipedia easier to use than huge, monolithic, omnibus articles. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 21:12, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>My keep vote is not based on an assessment of the accuracy of Dr Frank's views, but on widely the book has penetrated the public consciousness. I have a google news alert on "Justin Frank". Over the last year it has generated, on average, more than one hit per week. That is not an enormous presence. But I think it is enough to justify an article.

<p>"Calchas Street is an as-yet incomplete manuscript by the British writer Alistair Davie", the article informs. The phrase "Calchas Street" itself gives no Google hits; the name of the author Alistair Davie gives one pertinent hit - <a href="http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/documents/news/May05_phpDwGhJl.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/documents/news/May05_phpDwGhJl.pdf" rel="nofollow">the website</a> of the British Arts Council informs that Alistair was awarded GBP 600 to support a manuscript reading to secure a literaty agent for his piece "Waiting Room". Alistair's name does not return any hits in the catalogue of the British Library.</p>

<li>I know this person very well. She might not have enough google hits... but her name is not common. for example, John Smith could be the editor, and no duh it would have a lot of google hits.

<li>Maybe in 100 years, there will be many editors of this paper and they need to be remembered.

<li>Tremont30 is not a sock puppit of me. Just to clarify that. Keep this article for one of the other reasons why... She was the first editor of those papers to start the layout electronically. She also interviews Adrienne Clarkson, a huge achievement for a local community editor. Can you name anyone else? Carolyn is knwo across New Edinburgh that a majority a residents in New Edinburgh were saddended tha she was leaving. If you keep this article, more people can learn about her. A lot of musicians weren't known until they died. Just keep that into consideration. Will in world</li>

<li><i>She was the first editor of those papers to start the layout electronically.</i> This is not a criterion that makes her notable. If she'd been the first newspaper editor in the <i>world</i> to <i>ever</i> use electronic layout, you'd have a point, but being the first one at a specific local community paper simply isn't encyclopedia-worthy.</li>
<li><i>She also interviews Adrienne Clarkson, a huge achievement for a local community editor.</i> This is not a criterion that makes her notable. Lots of people have interviewed Adrienne Clarkson over the years; it's not a feat that automatically makes someone deserving of their own article.</li>
<li><i>Carolyn is knwo across New Edinburgh that a majority a residents in New Edinburgh were saddended tha she was leaving.</i> This is not a criterion that makes her notable to anyone <i>outside</i> of New Edinburgh. This is a worldwide encyclopedia, not the encyclopedia of New Edinburgh.</li>

<li>Maybe she was the first on to start the layout electronically. Do you know anyother papers that started their layout before 2003, most likely but you don't know.A lot of people who interview Adrienne Clarkson are mainly people who work for big papers, but is it really often for a person working for a community paper? Can you answer me that? Maybe she is not known, but maybe in the future she will be known. Her husband works for the Canadian Foreign Service, maybe their will be an article on him, and might need one on his wife. So instead of looking at the present, think about the future. There are a lot of articles on wives of famous people. Also, (i know i told you this), but read the article. She is a diplomat, mother, activist, defender and newspaper editor. Does she more than that to get on to Wikipedia? Tell me. I really want to know.</li>

<li><i>Do you know anyother papers that started their layout before 2003, most likely but you don't know.</i> Um, I <i>personally</i> worked at a newspaper that was using electronic layout in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>. And, ironically enough, it was in Ottawa, which means Carolyn's paper wasn't even the <i>local</i> leader in that regard, let alone a worldwide one.

<li>A runner-up in a national Idol series is a very liberal application of "promiently featured in major music media," and that <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criterion is rarely interpreted to include people who appear on game shows.

<li>AFD results have changed. Quite a number Idol finalists have been kept (or often not nominated, based on acceptance). Generally those outside the top 10 have been kept out. If you re-read the nomination, the current version of the article in question, the show article, the person's web profile, the show web site, do a google on him, look at more recent AFD precident, you'll see it's a slam-dunk keep. Also, this is not a 10 minute appearance on price-is-right. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 09:50, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

(Anything that isn't an obvious {{<a href="../../../n/n/-/Template%7ENn-bio_82c9.html" title="Template:Nn-bio">nn-bio</a>}} candidate I Google before nominating.) I was making a distinction between cast and contestant, not comparing him to a one-time contestant on a typical game show. (I just couldn't remember the word "contestant.") The term "television personality" is generally not used to refer to the latter. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 09:58, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I suspect you're using the criterion of who is *worthy* of notability, and not who has generally been found to be notable. Wikipedia shouldn't be picking who it thinks is worthy of notability. Rather, if somebody has been widely found to be notable (media coverage being one factor), that means there is a) sufficient sources of reliable information to make a good article and b) sufficient number of people with an interest to read and edit the article. The fact any of us don't think they "deserve" it, is quite irrelevant. Your views on what a television personality is are a leftover of the 1980s, and no longer apply. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 10:06, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

I'm wholly indifferent to Australian Idol or its contestants. I suspect keeping this article will mean it's a stub forevermore or filled with the sort of silly "contestant profile" trivia one finds on Idol fansites, however.<br />

<p>Completely unnecessary and useless disambiguation. No one's going to reach it unless they actually type "Gloss (disambiguation)" into the Search box. <a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.17.48.241.html" title="User:24.17.48.241">24.17.48.241</a> 07:23, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> No big deal now, but as new uses come up, it would be more useful. <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloss.html" title="Gloss">Gloss</a> is not, and should not be a disambig page, so a link to this is reasonable, even though there's just one laternate meaning right now (that I know of). --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 07:30, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b><s>Weak</s> keep</b>. This article is linked from the main <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloss.html" title="Gloss">gloss</a> page. If there are more than two plausible articles with the term "gloss", the disambig should definitely stay and those articles should be added to this page. If there are only two, we might satisfy ourselves with changing the disambig header on the gloss article to point to the alternate one. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 07:32, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: There's now five uses, although only three would seem likely (lex,material,lip). So, that justifies a disambiguation page easily. The only question is whether to have <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloss.html" title="Gloss">Gloss</a> or <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloss_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Gloss (disambiguation)">Gloss (disambiguation)</a> be the disambig. Given, the large number of links directly to <a href="../../../g/l/o/Gloss.html" title="Gloss">Gloss</a> for the intendended meaning, I think the way things are now is fine. No changes are needed. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 07:43, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I don't know what the policy is. Let me clarify that my vote is indeed "delete, do not redirect" and such votes are commonly accepted as valid AfD votes and which are acted on by closers. Common sense says that changing an article to a redirect should not magically protect it against deletion. The issue is not the "cost" of the redirect, but what course of action is most calculated to discourage the insertion of bogus material into Wikipedia. Leaving the redirect <i>might</i> be interpreted as an endorsement of the term and lead to the insertion of bogus material into the article. For example, someone might decide that "Googoloctodeciplex" belongs in the article and write something about it there, which might then lead to a table of bogus entries (Googolseptemdeciplex, etc.), which might get wikified, and the resulting redlinks might encourage creation of further bogus articles. Bogus entries are sometimes left as redirects specifically in order to <i>discourage</i> re-creation, and are sometimes even protectedm but I don't think this is appropriate here. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:24, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree it should be wikified (put in encyclopedic format). I also hope it will become something very different from a government document as people edit it. Maybe a way to view it is as being at the same stage of completion as a stub, but instead of starting from a sentence or a paragraph, it starts out as a government document. <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 11:21, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. This article uses material from another article, <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_A._Bonacci_ef3e.html" title="Paul A. Bonacci">Paul A. Bonacci</a>, which originally was a long, rambling, POV essay full of conspiracy theories about satanic ritual abuse, mind control, etc. I posted quite a bit on that article's Talk page, then edited that article severely to remove all the POV stuff. The author then re-inserted it; I reverted twice, then posted on his Talk page with a request not to re-insert the material. He then took the material and created the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_DeCamp_2bc0.html" title="John DeCamp">John DeCamp</a> article, leaving only a wikilink to it on the <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_A._Bonacci_ef3e.html" title="Paul A. Bonacci">Paul A. Bonacci</a> page. Sigh. Needless to say it is no more appropriate or encyclopedic there than it was in the first article. That said, I think a case can be made for a keep for the article itself, in that John DeCamp is probably a notable person for his elected official status, and his involvement in a crusade of sorts about all this stuff. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 22:00, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>- Sorry people for making you feel that way. The whole approach was meant to present the inner workings of multilingual lexicographical projects and an approach to IT tools that need to be in place to get things done. To my knowledge the resources in this field are rather limited and a person that is looking for information about lexicography might be interested in an external link of this sort.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Once again, a case of listmania. In addition, there are many errors in this list, and in essence, just a group of repeated names.</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Why do so many people want to delete lists of Jews? The fact that there are several such lists, many of which are frequently edited, shows that many in the Wiki community want them. If there are errors, let people correct them or at least flag the article for attention. If we deleted every article with errors in, where would Wikipedia be? Unlike the previous editor, I am happy to sign my vote.<br />

<li><b>keep</b>. I don't know where, but there was a discussion about using lists instead of categories for Jews. I was pointed at this when I was voicing against such lists. But I was explained, and witnessed myself that Jewish categories bringg huge flurry of vandalism and trolling into pages of persons that categorized as Jews. Lists are not so visible to random vandals.

<li>Comment: Well, we have gotten to the point where we're creating every album by any semi-notable artist. While interest may not be with religious books these days, over time there has been tons of exegeses about every single Bible verse (Qur'an too for that matter) and by people more notable (Aquinas, Augustine, Lewis, Maududi, Qutb) than all but a select few recording artists. I'm not advocating creating every verse of course, but I do think in perspective this is no less sane than creating albums when you have nothing more than an album box and a track listing. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 12:02, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Comment on comment: The articles on the verses in <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_4.html" title="Matthew 4">Matthew 4</a> are rather nice, because they not only quote the verse, but also explain its significance in various aspects and what people feel about it. <b>This</b> verse article, though, is nothing but a verbatim cite of the verse. Keeping it without expanding would set a precedent that <b>everything</b> in the Bible is automatically notable, regardless of whether anyone cares about it any more than anything other in the Bible, or of whether anyone actually has anything to say about it. It would feel like a pro-Christian bias to me. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP">— <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 14:08, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I was considering suggesting making Bible verses into redirects to <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a>, but then I realized that would be extreme overkill. On the other hand, we may eventually have to protect these, as there have been many. I don't suggest a blanket protection of the creation of all Bible verse articles (if that were possible, and it's probably not), however, because there are some particularily "notorious" Bible verses that people could write about. (And I bet there are some good ones out there. Perhaps someone could comment and show me one.) I am trying to think of what a user wants when they enter that search term.

<p>Don't Delete it. I am from Greenwood, SC, and the author of this article e-mailed me to tell me he had written it. I was at the concert mentioned in this article, and being from Greenwood, I can tell you that the Greenwood Jaycee Hut was actually quite a popular venue subsequent to Omar playing there. It should be noted that both Chip McKenzie and members of Elf Power were part of the Greenwood music scene that Omar was a pioneer member of. I think that this is a valid article, despite the fact that it may not appeal to a mass audience. Please see: <a href="http://www.flagpole.com/articles.php?fp=5543" class="external free" title="http://www.flagpole.com/articles.php?fp=5543" rel="nofollow">http://www.flagpole.com/articles.php?fp=5543</a> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.216.113.2 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.216.113.2_5b3d.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.216.113.2">contribs</a>) 15:16, 20 October 2005.</small></p>
<p>How many people must an article be meaningful to in order for it to enter the Wikipedia? This is a factual article about a music group which was once quite popular with numerous people in the SC music scene in the mid-1990's. There certainly is a need for articles like this in the Wikipedia. True knowledge is true knowledge, regardless of the number of people who may be in search of it.

<dd>I disagree that Omar &amp; The Spitmonkeys does not meet the requirements set forth by <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, please see requirement #6: "Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city..." To people in New York or L.A., the most prominent member of the Greenwood, SC music scene of the mid-90's may not be a big deal, but Omar was important to a lot of people, and other bands, in this region at this time. If you ask people who were part of the scene, even today, to name the band that best represents the Greenwood Scene at this time, the answer will almost universally be Omar. I continue to think that this is a valid entry, that people may well look for, and enjoy, and find informative. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.216.113.2 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.216.113.2_5b3d.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.216.113.2">contribs</a>) 09:08, 21 October 2005.</small>

<dd>Well if that were the case, don't you find it odd that the "most prominent representation" of their style doesn't return a single google hit. Given google is not the end all be all of knowledge or notability, but I still don't think that this band is the "Most prominent" their style, (remember "style" doesn't necessarily mean "scene"). Also please don't confuse popularity with notability. -- <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalo_c828.html" title="User:Malo">Malo</a> 17:02, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By invoking requirement #6 of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, I wasn't attempting to argue that Omar was the "most prominent representation of their style" (though their improvisational comedic satire and tight focus on their immediate environment as sources of inspiration is not something I've come across anywhere else), rather I was putting forth Omar as the "most prominent representative of... the local scene of a city". I think that what I said above is true, if you ask anyone about the Greenwood, SC music scene, the first name that you will hear is Omar. I realize that being the most prominent representative of the music scene of a city that most people have never heard of is not like being the most prominent representative of Manchester, England; or even Athens, GA (to use an example closer to hand); but I don't think that the lack of size or current notoriety of a cities' scene should cause it to be ignored. Athens wasn't Athens until R.E.M. and the B52's (and later Neutral Milk Hotel) made it such. Just because Omar (and the other great Greenwood bands of that time, like the ones I mentioned above, and the J.J. Kids, Cumeadus, etc.) didn't put Greenwood on the map, doesn't, in my opinion, mean that the scene deserves no reference of its existence. I hope that Wikipedia is the place for that reference. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.216.113.2 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.216.113.2_5b3d.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.216.113.2">contribs</a>) 14:14, 21 October 2005.</small></dd>
<dd>As for Google, please bear in mind that this is a band that formed in the early nineties, and broke up pre-2000. I remember that they had a website while they were still active, but I imagine it folded around when the band did. Although the tiniest local band may have a web presence in this day and age, it wasn't necessarily so at the time when Omar was at the height of their popularity. I think that may explain why, despite the fact that Omar had such a loyal and rabid fanbase in their region, they don't show up as a result of a Google search today.

Don't delete the Omar article! I was at the concert at the Jaycee Hut, and it really was a landmark performance for the Greenwood rock scene, many members of which have gone on to fortify the legendary Athens, GA music scene. Anyone who says that Omar &amp; the Spitmonkeys is not a notable group is just being snobbish.</p>

<p>All of this discussion about Omar &amp; The Spitmonkeys has made me get out the old CD's and listen to them again for the first time in a few years. How dare you say this band is non-notable! As a teenager growing up in Greenwood in the '90s, Omar and the other bands of the scene meant so very much to me. The memories and emotions that came back while listening to the CD's made me think of a time and place that was shared by many people. Omar &amp; The Spitmonkeys sold tapes &amp; CDs, played concerts, and were well-known and loved in the local scene. As the Wikipedia grows and becomes more pervasive, people will search for Omar &amp; the Spitmonkeys. Personally, I do most of my factual searches on Wikipedia first, not Google, so that I can hopefully find somewhat obscure articles. Do not delete this article. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.88.74.66 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.88.74.66.html" title="User talk:24.88.74.66">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.88.74.66_45e9.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.88.74.66">contribs</a>) 14:51, 21 October 2005.</small></p>
<p>This concert was put on by Omar and the Spitmonkeys and began as a small one band show with only a few select guests. Once word spread that Omar and the Spitmonkeys were putting on a show, the entire Greenwood music community seemed to appear from nowhere and begged to play the Jaycee Hut with Omar. As an alternative to pop bands such as Eleven Day Trip or cover bands such as Dropchord, Omar's comedic satirical songs about relevant Greenwood issues brought out many Indie rock bands such as Shutter whose founding members are now the band The Disease on the Van's Warped Tour. So this article is factual, helpful, and deserving of being kept in place. Please do not delete this article. Big Dave the sound man67.76.97.57 17:35, 25 October 2005 (UTC)DT</p>
<p><i><b>KEEP</b></i> Well, being from Greenwood, I can attest to the accuracy of the article ...even if you did not like the music ...it is all true, plus the comments from other folks from Greenwood above. The band did exists, did play, and had a loyal following. The members have all gone on to different parts of the state/country/world, but the facts of the article are true.

<li>To expand on my reasons for voting delete: this is an encyclopedia, not a place where up and coming young artists, writes, painters, play-writes will be published after getting one work onto a small scene where it impresses a handful of first-hand aquintances and the people in their immediate community. If Sai is in fact the next Van Gogh or Samuel Beckett, then he will make his way here <i>eventually</i>, but does not belong here now. THis is nothing against Sai Ho or his work, but he fails at this point to meet the criteria for notability as a playwrite to warrant inclusion here. Once his work has drawn enough attention that articles, books, etc are made about his life and work, then it would be reasonable for him to have an article here. Having produced one play that has drawn recent attention in the theatre community in in Melbourne area is justnot enough. My first article submitted to WP was on a good friend who was a philosopher, writer, incredible story teller. I wrote it not long after he died. He was a great guy, but the article was deleted. This article reminds me of that one. Sorry but he just does not meet the criteria for notability.<em>—<a href="../../../g/a/f/User%7EGaff_a634.html" title="User:Gaff"><font color="Indigo">Gaff</font></a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../g/a/f/User_talk%7EGaff_697b.html" title="User talk:Gaff"><font color="MediumSlateBlue">ταλκ</font></a></b></small></sup> 00:28, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</em></li>

<p>I'm suggesting that the claims put in place by the author are somewhat unsubstantiated and appear nothing more than ego padding. You aren't supporting your argument by not addressing the point - 'avant garde' seems like a throwaway line especially since the summary seems rather formulaic. Admittedly the comment was flip, but I hardly think parody or misspelling 'twaddle' an avant garde artist make.</p>
<p>You are assuming that I am Sai Ho. I simply helped create the Sai page. Actually, as far as I know, he has no idea that the page about him exists. --202.158.212.34 05:06, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't think that Sai Ho's inclusion in Monash Alumni is particularly relevant to this page being a vanity article. I am a keen patron of the Melbourne underground theatre scene and he is a very active and well regarded theatre-maker. The very nature of an avant garde arts scene is not one of mass popular appeal, and it is absurd to delete this article because Sai Ho is not famous in the wider "Hollywood" sense of the word. Arguing about the spelling of words is also irrelevant to the claim that Sai Ho is not avant garde. The title "Clockwork Blue" is not derivative; it is using a literary technique called <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pastiche.html" title="Pastiche">pastiche</a> to draw upon other works, using them to create a "mish-mash" of new characters and scenes. It is an important element of postmodern literature, as it acknowledges the inescapalbe mass of discourse to which any new text is simply added. (211.28.129.240 05:23, 20 October 2005 (UTC))</li>

<p>It appears that many of the above comments are based upon the sands of misperception. No, I do not believe that the artist in question wrote the article about himself. I have met Mr Ho on a number of occassions at underground events (in Melbourne) over the past few years. He shuns publicity and the media -- information concerning his work is often attributed to aliases, which means that those who search for his name on the internet will be largely unsuccessful -- and, from my knowledge of his work, it would be beneath his artistic integrity to write such a piece about himself -- take the fact that he refused to graduate as evidence of this. I would strongly argue that this piece is <i>entirely unauthorised</i>, and hence should be acquitted of the charge of "vanity".</p>
<p>However, even if the writers of the previous comments deny this to be the truth (for how much does truth weigh when written on a computer screen?), and that, in some way, the artist was complicit in the article's writing (or, for that matter, any of the comments on this page, including the "twadle/twaddle" comment above), the article's value should still be apparent. If it were not for fora such as this, admittedly obscure, yet still <i>culturally important works</i> in the unwritten media will be lost for good.</p>
<p>Hence, I do not believe that this article should be deleted. But the complaints levelled at the article should not go unheeded. From my knowledge of the artist's work, the article is far from completion. I hence urge those unnamed forces at work behind it to finish their task, but to do so in a s<i>anguine manner that puts forward the weaknesses in the artist's work as well</i>, in the true spirit of the democratic quest for knowledge. We should accept that initial enthusiasm may later require adjustment and clarification, but it does not mean that we should remove its work for good.--<a href="../../../1/3/0/User%7E130.194.13.102.html" title="User:130.194.13.102">130.194.13.102</a> 05:41, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Sorry, I feel that I need to write again in response to new comments posted. I can't take seriously the claims from Melbourne residents that Sai Ho is not notable as an artist simply because they haven't heard of him. He is an underground artist, not a game-show host. It is patently absurd for people who seemingly have no intimate connection with the fringe theatre and arts scene in Melbourne to claim that they know who is noteworthy simply because they live there. It's also common knowledge that avant gardists hardly achieve fame as their work is not considered to be popular and is socially challenging. As the arts scene stands in Australia, it is very rare for any artist to become even remotely famous, let alone those who produce work outside of social acceptance. You can't judge Sai Ho against big budget musical theatre productions and touring companies, because in reality they play very different roles within the wider umbrella of the Melbourne arts scene. Anybody with any credibility in their knowledge of art in this country is aware of this, and it would be a disgrace to Wikipedia to delete this article simply because Sai Ho does not appear in "TV Week". This is the sort of attitude that almost resulted in the works of Vincent van Gogh being lost to history- he could barely give away a painting, let alone become famous in his lifetime. I am not saying that Sai Ho is the next Vincent van Gogh, just that one of the great things about Wikipedia is that it allows for obscure yet highly respected social contributors to be recorded.

<li>Van Gogh was not lost to history. Nor was he discovered by an <i>encyclopedia.</i> Sai Ho's work, if it is as importnat as you all suggest, will then get written about and noted elsewhere, in the alternative press perhaps only for the time being. Having published one play one year ago, dropped out of college, and acted in some community theatre does not a super-star make, even if he is brilliant beyond comprehension. Wait until he has garnered some acclaim and then submit the articel, with some references to back it up (maybe a list of newspaper articles about his work) rather than references to the theater where his play was put on.<em>—<a href="../../../g/a/f/User%7EGaff_a634.html" title="User:Gaff"><font color="Indigo">Gaff</font></a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../g/a/f/User_talk%7EGaff_697b.html" title="User talk:Gaff"><font color="MediumSlateBlue">ταλκ</font></a></b></small></sup> 00:38, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</em></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: According to the WP criteria for biographies, "Painters, sculptors, architects, engineers, and other professionals whose work is recognized as exceptional and likely to become a part of the enduring historical record of that field" are merited inclusion. It is my honest belief that Sai Ho fits this description, and that his notability falls under the category of "cult following" also in the WP guidelines for biographies. It is a misinterpretation of my previous comment to say that nobody has heard of Sai Ho, he is a very respected man. And, in response to Haleth, there is some truth in describing Australia as "a philistine country where everything non-mainstream is ignored", or at least in reference to the arts. Although widely respect and posessing a cult following, many of this country's great artists, such as Sai Ho, do not recieve widespread popular media exposure. Also, the article is as yet incomplete, and there are other works to be added, and I do admit that the page requires some editing. I give my word that this is not a vanity piece!

<p>I nominate <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_Baker_d397.html" title="Sean Baker">Sean Baker</a> for deletion because it is essentially a non-notable, vanity piece about a fellow that filed a law suit last May against Rumsfeld and the US Govt. There is very little about Sean Baker in the article. The first version of the article had no sourcing whatsoever. I asked the author to clean it up and now it has several news articles as sources. One of those sources mentions that there is a pending motion to dismiss. Should every plaintiff that files a lawsuit against Rumsfeld have a Wikipedia article? Or should we wait to see what happens in his case. <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaquin_Murietta_3d07.html" title="User:Joaquin Murietta">Joaquin Murietta</a> 15:42, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>keep</b> Disclaimer - I am not the person who started this article, although the person who listed this article for possible deletion thinks I am.

I am happy to have my contributions vetted and peer reviewed by any wikipedian who can be civil and fair in their criticisms.

<li>IMO opinion Baker's case is significant because there has been a debate as to whether the treatment of the prisoners at Guantanamo Bay by their guards is overly brutal. So, when a guard volunteers to act as a prisoner, in a training exercise, and is beaten so severely that he has a dozen seizures a day, this is a significant, verifiable fact that can play a role in the public forming their own decision over how much force the guards should use.</li>
<li>JM, the lister, has been making unwiki personal attacks on my grammar, judgement, maturity and intellectual honesty, in addition to violating wiki procedures by nominating articles for deletion over their perception those articles are POV. See the article on <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carolyn_Wood_7b70.html" title="Carolyn Wood">Carolyn Wood</a>, which they nominated for deletion, over POV issues, without even putting an NPOV tag on first, or stating any specific POV concern. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 21:07, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I wrote this article about a form of poetry I invented. As far as I know, very few people other than me have written in this form, and it has only been published in a college newspaper. I didn't really think about/understand the implications of pushing my own bit of obscure poetry onto the wikipedia when I wrote this, but of course I see now that this is really promoting my own agenda (zany and noncommercial as it may be) and not creating encyclopedic content. Someone nominated this page for deletion long ago, and I agreed to it as well as everyone else, but it never went away... so here I am nominating it again. Unless some well-known poet, unbeknownst to me, picked up this form and published a book using it, I don't think this belongs on the wikipedia. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Mills_Hinkle_81e0.html" title="User:Thomas Mills Hinkle">Thomas Mills Hinkle</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/o/User_talk%7EThomas_Mills_Hinkle_5fd1.html" title="User talk:Thomas Mills Hinkle">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Thomas_Mills_Hinkle_d22c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Thomas Mills Hinkle">contribs</a>) 11:19, 12 October 2005 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>Give me a chance guys! 213.106.176.209 was so keen to defend this article s/he got there before me and caused an edit conflict. <s><b>Transwiki</b> to Wiktionary</s>. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlapdragon_8659.html" title="User:Flapdragon">Flapdragon</a> 22:55, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Incidentally "tavern" is neither a good translation of <i>Ταβερνα</i> nor a good definition of the word <i>taverna</i> as used in English. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlapdragon_8659.html" title="User:Flapdragon">Flapdragon</a> 23:03, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>I suppose what I meant was that it would be good to have an entry on Wiktionary for taverna, it's just not an encyclopaedia entry, but you're right that this isn't any use in its present form, and so I withdraw the transwiki vote. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlapdragon_8659.html" title="User:Flapdragon">Flapdragon</a> 00:32, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I am sure that an encyclopedic article could be created about this and its role in Greek life, cuisine and culture despite its current dictdef status. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 01:22, 21 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>No doubt, but that can happen even if the current article is deleted. I haven't seen much evidence that inferior articles on a topic promote the writing of good ones later on. OTOH if the AfD motivates someone to write an encyclopedic article before the end of its time period, then it's done its job. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 02:05, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. It's difficult to judge the notability, but the way this article is presented (there's a little splurge about the band and then a much longer section about the history of each band member) really makes it seem like they don't have much of a history and are just a typical bar-band.

<p>It is not blog spam. I have gotten many requests from readers of our blog to make an entry on Wikipedia because so many of our readers use this website. We even have a link to Wiki on our blog page. There are also no ads on our blog and we do not earn any money from it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:KMuniz" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:KMuniz" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>--KMuniz 15:19, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> blogspam. Don't know how the "many requests from readers" have come in but as of this moment there's exactly one comment on all the articles shown on the main blog page.

<li><b>Delete</b>... non-notable blog. Sorry if this hurts the bloggers feelings, but a blog has to be notable in some way to warrant an article. 0-4 posts in discussions per day, no mainstream media references, 57 hits on Google... almost no non-automatically-generated linkbacks... that just doesn't come close to the threshold for notability for me. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 15:47, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>'Sorry if this hurts the bloggers feeling'...nice, only a little insulting. How can something be notable if it can't be placed in an avenue that a lot of people view on a daily basis, I.E. Wikipedia. You place spam alongside advertising in your deletion policy, as I said, we do not earn any money from this site. It was created to be informative and generate discussion. Ans using comments to gauge readership is laughable...not everyone has the time to leave comments or want to leave a comment. The speed at which you decided to delete this page is incredible - have you ever considered leaving something online long enough to see if it generates any hits? And the comments from W.marsh are written in a very egotistical, self-satisfying way. --KMuniz 15:53, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

The argument that "This page might be notable if Wikipedia publisizes it enough!" is not very good. I really am not going to get into a flame war here though...

<p>W. Marsh is taking things out of context as I was not implying that it should be advertising. And don't quote me if you are going to make up your own words - that's NOT a quote. The deletion policies for this website are convoluted and deceiving. 'Anyone can start an article', but only if it complies with the Deletion or Notable police.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Anyone <i>can</i> start an article. If other people disagree that it should have been started, then a debate ensues, and the person who started it gets the opportunity to explain why it should be included. This is the process we are undergoing now.</dd>
<dd>The problem is that this is an <i>encyclopedia</i>. You cannot add your blog to an encyclopedia just because you think it <i>should</i> have lots of readers, any more than you can add a word you made up yesterday to a dictionary just because you think it <i>should</i> be part of the English language. You need to find readers by other means: advertise on other blogs, or in web directories. Write posts that everyone tracks back to. Gain mindshare. When you're well known, we'll be queuing up to write the article for you. At present, however, your article falls into the situation where the vast majority of Wikipedia users will agree that it does not belong here. Therefore it is likely to be deleted, not because we're trying to deceive you or because we're a police state, but simply because you have mistaken Wikipedia for something it isn't.</dd>
<dd>Our policies for deletion often seem convoluted to people who haven't bothered to find out what they are, but they are perfectly straightforward. You have already been referred to our page on <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">what Wikipedia is not</a>: I draw your attention to the fact that it is "not a web directory". I will also refer you to our proposed guidelines for the inclusion of <a href="../../../w/e/b/Wikipedia%7EWebsites_fbda.html" title="Wikipedia:Websites">websites</a>. This suggests that "an article discussing a website should be able to demonstrate that the website has had some impact on people beyond its core user base", and proposes a number of criteria by which this can be judged. Unfortunately your blog does not meet any of these criteria, so, until such a time as this ceases to be the case, the article should be deleted.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> KMuniz, I'm sorry your introduction to Wikipedia had to be this way. It seems to me that you created this article in good faith. Unfortunately, this is not the kind of thing that Wikipedia is for. I am also sorry that you had to come to AfD so soon -- Wikipedia is a very large site, gets a lot of contributions every day, and therefore has a large amount of these processes to go through. We all try our best to be polite, but we have a lot of work to do and our debates may seem short and unclear to those unused to them. Please try to understand that this isn't an attack on you or the website you have written about. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_8a0c.html" title="User:Jacqui M Schedler">Jacquelyn Marie</a> 18:33, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Here are a couple of messages I posted to the discussion area of this article, requesting sources for the claims regarding the "Clutchbone". The authors have not replied.</p>
<p>Read them - I think they're pretty self explanatory as to why I think this article may be fraudulent.</p>
<p>/.../</p>
<p>Talk:The Clutchbone From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.</p>
<p>To whoever wrote this article...</p>
<p>I am very interested in both folklore and cryptozoology/forteana, and the subject of the Clutchbone is completely new to me. I am curious about this, and I would greatly appreciate if you let me know what source(s) you have used for the article, plus any additional material that provides information on the subject. I am especially keen on learning more about this because of the statement that there have been alleged sightings in my native Sweden.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Jonas Liljeström, Gothenburg, Sweden [edit]</p>
<hr />
<p>Monika Zetterlund??? Sources please!</p>
<p>Again I must ask that whoever has written and/or edited this article provides some sources for it. I am particularly surprised by the claim that "some insisted" that the recent demise of Monika Zetterlund was caused by the Clutchbone. Who has made these claims?</p>
<p>I am a Swede and fairly well versed in folkloric matters (including postgraduate studies at Gothenburg University), so I'm quite surprised that I have never heard of this creature before.</p>
<p>I'm starting to suspect that this entire article might be an elaborate hoax and I'm considering the possibility of reporting it, so please respond and answer my questions! Normally I wouldn't take this matter seriously enough to ponder the possibility of requesting the deletion of the article - but when a hoax/joke begins to involve spurious claims about authentic deceased persons, it has gone far beyond decency.</p>
<p>Jonas Liljeström</p>
<hr />
<p>Hi Jonas, I have no idea if this is a hoax or not, but I removed the claim about Monika Zetterlund. Wikipedia is not the place for speculations, and my personal opinion is that this is a rather distasteful one. If you consider it to be a hoax, please feel free to list it at Articles for Deletion. If you'd like some help with that, I'd be happy to help you. Regards, JoanneB 12:53, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Yes it is blatant promotion, of a generally unknown individual. A 'Tom Cruise' already has mass interest, so it's silly to even compare.</li>
<li>so mass intrest is the criteria for an archive of accurate information? I think at least a fair level of local intrest is enough for an article. This "Crabtree" may be the next Tom Cruise and the fact he may not or never be is no reason to erase the archive of his work.</li>

<li>Well, Milli Villi are infamously known worldwide...so that's another bad comparison. Why not compare this Crabtree to my neighbor Bob?

<p>Isotope23 should know that the Crabtree can also do sock puppets very well,and i also love The Wombat. i don't think others can judge becouse thay do not know him or have never read the Gentlemen, its is truly one of the funnest thigs EVER! kept this and the overall site would be much better!!</p>
<p>for the information of those confused by the ID number of those numerous comments, several people we know do share a server together. though as most of the comments were by various friends and admirers of "The Crabtree", I suppose that is up to debate whether these admirers should be considered puppets or not. Nonetheless, for the record, only the comment that explicitly states as being by "The Crabtree" was actually written by him. The rest were different people operating on a connected server.</p>
<p>Again, as a longtime Wikipedian lurker, I offer my vote for the Crabtree as I see great things in his future. 24.53.141.174 19:12, 21 October 2005 (UTC)Brandywine</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> nn bio. Look, if he has great things in his future, then he will deserve a great article in the future. But he doesn't deserve an article until he's <i>done</i> the great things.

<p>I for one would have loved to have read an article about Einstein before his fame rose. I could say I was a fan from the beginning. Besides, potential needs to be recognized, not just demonstration of what it can do. This provides for a more creativly nurturing international environment. I would have felt quite the fool to write Einstein off before I can see what he can do. Also, with such interesting projects as his soon-to-come comic book and film-role, not to mention (as I've heard now) the rapidly developing and brain-storming comedy team the "Gentlemen", I think it would be beneficial to leave this page up. Give it a few months at least, I think, to give him a chance to complete his projects and put them into circulation. then we'll see if this Young Einstein will wow us with his prowess. 24.53.141.174 21:14, 21 October 2005 (UTC)Brandywine</p>

<li>If "The Crabtree" stays the Jimmy stuff will most likely get removed. It seems irrelvent now, but originally it was going to have a page on Jimmy too. They're both into this "Gentlemen" project and from what I've heard that should be up and running in a couple of weeks and from what I know it sounds pretty funny. Sort of a "Stella" type of thing. If "The Crabtree"'s page is taken, it's doubtful "the Gentlemen", as a group or separatly, will have any further Wikipedia-listed info.

<li>Mach, if you'll re-read this discussion you'll notice that it has already been mentioned numerous times that the "creator" here posted from a proxy server and cannot be responsible for the content posted by others using the same server.</li>

<li>I've checked the contributions of the proxy server, and I must say some of the things done on it were rather shameful acts of vandalism. I, on my own behalf (and on behalf of "the Crabtree" by his request) apologize for those acts of vandalism (though I say again they were more than likely not committed by those we know personally and therefor also not those involved in any way in "The Crabtree"'s page or this discussion.) Nonetheless, we apologize for whoever did it. Obviously idiots.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, "The Crabtree" (with myself in agreement) wishes it be known (he doesn't actually have home access to the internet and he's a bit reluctant to use that server now) that there should be no hard feelings if the majority votes out his article here. He and I both have great respect for the Wikipedia community and the accuracy and wonderful service it provides. "The Gentlemen" apparantly finish up their work this week and begin actual filming on the coming weekend. If this goes anywhere (as they have some real plans for it that may come into action at any time after the editing) I personally will try again a page for it if it has some degree of success or notoriaty at home or elsewhere. We can all have that one out in discussion when the time comes. Many thanks to the wonderful regulars here at Wikipedia who pledge their time and effort into keeping this place accurate and bountiful.</p>

<li>I don't mean to encourage 'systemic bias', but the problem seems to be that this journalist is notable only in Turkey (if indeed he is even notable; I wasn't able to find any articles by him on <i>Radikal'</i>s website, although I admittedly can't read much Turkish). If someone can stubbify and expand this article, great.

<p>This seems pretty much to be a <b>vanity page</b>.
