<p>This article is based on a biased view of the Algerian war of independance. It is a confusion between the Setif massacre that took place in 1945 where between 15,000 to 45,000 (figures vary between sources)people were killed and the event of Algerian war of independance. In addition, France has formally accepted its responsabilities in the Setif massacre and presented its apologies to Algeria via its ambassador. The author distorts the words of president Abdelaziz Bouteflika who said that French colonisation was a genocide of Algerian identity, language and traditions, but never said that France perpetrated a genocide as in exterminating people. He was implying that the effect of colonisation was the destruction of the cultural identity of algerians. This also has to be replaced in the context, as president Bouteflika was replying in anger to a law that was voted in French parliement recognising the beneficial effect of colonisation. This law has been repelled since. The author also distorts his references as the Scotsman article referred to DO NOT claims that France killed 1.5 million Algerians so it is a false reference. I suggest this article should be deleted, as there are already some articles on the massacres perpetrated by the French rulers in Algeria, the article is just the point of view of the author and is full of inacuracies. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlastwizard_4fdf.html" title="User:Blastwizard">Blastwizard</a> 14:41, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete it because the genocide committed by a Western white nation and against a non-Western nation.</b> Anybody may genocide Arabs or Africans and get no punishment. Even you cannot name tha massacres as genocide. The Algerian President and his people say it was a genocide. And the article clearly reflects the French opposition. I started the entry and I had put the info to Algeria and France pages. However the user Blastwizard deleted all of my contributions. I think this is another type of vandalism. He says that there is no court verdict about the Algerian genocide. Is there any verdict on Armenian 'genocide'. But there is an entry called 'Arzmenian Genocide' on Wiki pages. And we cannot change this article because it is under protection. Please and please delete it. Show once more how the world is as usual we know here.David Falcon 20:11, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The Algerian president said it was a genocide of Algerian culture not people, obviously you don't get the subtlety of his language or more exactly you don't want to understand as it does not fit with your opinion. The exact words of president Bouteflika were <i>Colonisation brought the genocide of our identity, of our history, of our language, of our traditions</i> so it is your misinterpretation of this sentence that brought this article to existence, in addition the number of victims you wrote is unsubstantiated by any sources you gave. Would president Bouteflika go to receive medical treatment in a military hospital of a country that has comitted genocide on his people? Your contributions are in breach of neutrality of point of view. You are accusing me of editing the page of Algeria which is not the case. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia not a forum for personal opinion, I had nothing to do with the article on armenian genocide I just pointed its existence which obviously upsets you. If you read carefully my post on the subject you will see that I pointed at that there was no indictment of the ottoman empire because it collapsed before international courts of justices ever existed (I suppose Nuremberg trial makes a precedence), but several parliements in the world have voted a law to consider it as a genocide. You may have an issue with the atrocities the French did in Algeria, and I said I didn't condone it, what I say is it does not qualify as a genocide they took place at a time when France could have been condemned it is not the case, and you are distorting the official opinion of Algerian authorities. It is not because western people killed masses of non-western people and in the case you are pointing that it qualifies as a genocide and I'm rather upset because your light approach to the use of the word genocide belittles some real genocides. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlastwizard_4fdf.html" title="User:Blastwizard">Blastwizard</a> 22:29, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>First of all a genocide is not only committed against the people but also their culture, identity, language etc. Just look at the conventions and treaties. Secondly the Algerians do not only say that the French committed genocide only against their identity. More than 1,5 million people were massacred according to the Algerian official records. OK. This is Algerian perspective. So add the French perspective but maintain the 'Algerian Genocide' title. Third I am not a full-Turkish.</li>

<dd>First of all please add your comments at the end, not to hide the reasons why I nominated this article for deletion. You seem unable to read the articles you cite. You say the figure of 1.5 million victims is the official Algerian records, cite your references where did you find this&#160;? Strangely enough when you use references to support this affirmation the references do not contain this information. Your affirmations seem to be very distorted by the prism of your opinion. As I said before I don't care whether you are Turkish, Chinese, English, Papu or whatever, what I care about is well referenced articles in Wikipedia not peoples' personal opinions. Now if you can provide a well documented research work by historians and scholars instead of reporting words from politicians I will reconsider my stance. And no genocide is a crime against people not against culture, president Bouteflika hijacked the word in the purposes of his political agenda. If you take the etymology of the word, <i>geno</i> is the greek root for race and <i>cide</i> comes from latin cidere killing it does not mean killing people's culture. And for your records I am not denying that colonisation has altered the identity of colonised country, but your articles are really far fetched in that matter <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlastwizard_4fdf.html" title="User:Blastwizard">Blastwizard</a> 11:19, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Congratulations</b>. You have have just decided against what the Algerian people had to go through in their independence war. You have just denied that they have been maasacred by the colonial French Army. Shame on you Genocide deniers! User: Samothrakis</p>
