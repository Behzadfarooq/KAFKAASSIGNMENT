<li><b>Strong Delete</b> In its present form it has virtually no informational content, no evidence of notability, little hope of being extended, appears to fall in the vanity category, and demonstrates POV bias. If the author would do an extensive edit and expansion, writing it in more neutral language, giving a lot more factual information, and most importantly demonstrating why it is notable, I would of course reconsider. But as is it is a strong delete from me. -- <a href="../../../g/l/e/User%7EGlen_Finney_c6cd.html" title="User:Glen Finney">Glen Finney</a> 16:04, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Any high school basketball team is by definition linked entirely to the high school, so the only possibility for a separate article would be if one regularly created NBA stars and news articles for major high school championships (I'm assuming the US has some form of inter-state high school championships here) to the level where the high school article had more about the basketball team in it than anything else. This, on the other hand, is complete and utter POV drivel. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 17:58, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I tried searching under Nicholaas Bakker on google as well, got a few hundred pages in Dutch, couldn't see any that were obviously applicable. Also searched with the name of the religion and the person and even in combination with several Dutch terms for religion; nothing. Nothing about this has been posted on the Dutch or Spanish versions of wikipedia either, which one might expect given the claims of its areas of activity. If the author wishes to keep these pages, he or she needs to better document the movement and give some tangible dates. Links to pages that can verify the page would help.

<li>Are you a mind reader, Kappa? You're speaking for me now? This has nothing to do with this nonsense being "embarassing", and all to do with this being nonsense.

<li>Well I said "often", this is my interpretation of a lot of "non-encyclopedic" votes around here. I'm try to help this outsider to understand the situation, and what they need to do/show to get this article kept. In my opinion it will be more difficult because the topic will sway people to vote "nonsense" or "non-encyclopedic".

<li>I noticed that the previous deletes are per'ing the other's reason, which is that they can't seem to google it. Is Wikipedia just a googler's yellow pages as it were? I affirmed this because I've heard of it. But I wonder if this makes it hard for other instances whereby there isn't sufficient coverage on a topic due it's obscurity. If Jim Bruer makes reference to it, and he is a wiki article, then by extention, does this become encyclopedic because it's a theme on his show? Think before you just bandwagon! â <i>This comment by User:68.246.35.33.</i>

It's thoroughly implausible that a group of modern sportsmen will sniff the winning team's asses while they growl as a rite of defeat in public. And the author provides no evidence that it exists. On the other hand the author, who says "he doesn't give a fart" about this entry, has spent far too much energy monitoring, editing, recruiting and arguing this entry. It doesn't add up. It could only be an April Fools practical joke. Dump it.

<li><b>Delete</b> I have to agree, that as written now this probably qualifies as a vanity page. If the author can edit to include information that would make the subject of the article notable, would reconsider. Failing that, if the author were the designer herself, she might want to consider starting a user page and writing the information there (I think that is valid, right?). Also, if the page is deleted, the designer's link should be removed from the list of designers.

<li><b>DO NOT Delete</b> I have been getting yelled at for putting a site on vanity, or it "littering" wikipedia. Why is this littering? The idea behind wikipedia that it is an open source enyclopedia bringing articles that wouldn't be anywhere else. The policy is so ambigious, as it should be, to only define legitamate articles for deletion. This entry does not violate any of them. This isn't vandalism, for I am providing a biography. There is no policy on what defines someone as important enough to have their article here. The website has copywrited information, so officially it has some sort of publishable content that people might want to search. Why is Ozzy Osbourne featured? What about Paris Hilton? She doesn't do anything but cause her family bad publicity. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killers" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killers" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killers</a> has no content except to say that it is the second album by Iron Maiden. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E%21" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E%21" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E%21</a> Why is E! entertainment channel listed. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Schiavo" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Schiavo" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Schiavo</a> She was a poor women that the media used for their political gain.

There have been a number of significant archaelogical discoveries in recent years shedding new light on Scythian art. There was a major exhibition of Scythian jewellery called Scythian Gold from Ukrainian museums that toured North America in the past few years and a quick search shows that there have been a number of books written by reputable scholars on Scythian artwork in recent years.

<li><b>Keep</b> Salient is a notable student magazine. it has been nominated for the Qantas media awards which are usually reserved for mainstream media. It has been an influntial magazine throughout its history. The article on Critical Critic should go (and as the person who created it, I think I talk with some authority). Prehaps creating a new article for VUWSA (Victoria University of Wellington Students Association) with a section on Salient would be a smart move. VUWSA funds Salient and is its main base. VUWSA is also highly influential and has a proud history (they even nought a tank for the Viet Cong, so they might technically be a terrorist organisation). So keep it, or merge into a VUWSA article. --<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregstephens_dcb5.html" title="User:Gregstephens">Gregstephens</a> 04:51, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>A very weak <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keep.html" title="Keep">keep</a>. This should be honed down to the basics, plus a link. Possibly move to Salient (periodical) and mention other periodicals called "The Salient", such as <a href="http://hcs.harvard.edu/~salient/" class="external text" title="http://hcs.harvard.edu/~salient/" rel="nofollow">The Harvard Salient</a>. --<a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">Woggly</a> 07:44, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I've mentioned some reasons above. But Salient is the longest serving student magazine in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>, it is the most known, it has regularly broken news items which other news sources have had to feed from, it has been nominated for mainstream awards and constantly clears out the ASPA awards (Aotearoa Student Press Association). It has press gallery reporters for the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_House_of_Representatives_846d.html" title="New Zealand House of Representatives">New Zealand House of Representatives</a>. In all, it is actually a reasonably important journal. I should add I have a bias towards it as a columnist (From the Left). The best solution in my mind would be to create a Victoria University of Wellington Students Association article and to put the info into that/ --<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregstephens_dcb5.html" title="User:Gregstephens">Gregstephens</a> 08:55, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, in all honesty there is absolutly no reason for the deletion of this article. I believe everyone has the right to write about what they want as long as it does not insult, degrade, or offend another person or organisation. Personal opinions are alson not to be disregarded. Hence i believe that there must be a balance between free speech and offence to another. This article has minimal offence to "Korektphool" while informing the responder of this young rapers beginings. As the only reason i can see for deleting any article is offencive language, and this article certainly contains none, i must conclude that there is no reason to delete this article. 11:18, 1 Apr 2005 DGayed

<li><b>Comment</b>: To put it bluntly, no one here cares if you see or don't see any reasons besides from "offensive language". We have guidelines. Take a look at them. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarg_cafc.html" title="User:Sarg">Sarg</a> 13:35, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: And by those guidelines, what is the reason for deletion? The two reasons given have been 'vanity' and 'not notable'. It is a stretch to call it 'vanity' as the article does not glorify the artist, and his music is available outside the 'playground' via the WWW. And to quote <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page">Wikipedia:Vanity page</a>, "lack of fame should be completely ignored in deletion debates." Dpherson 06:43, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: You almost caught me there&#160;:) But I think the concepts of fame and notability are not exactly the same. This subject is non-notable because no one is going to look at WP searching for it (except for Korektphool and his college budies). This makes the article practically useless. If WP had to have an article for every teenager who had a music group, it would be a failure as an Encyclopedia. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarg_cafc.html" title="User:Sarg">Sarg</a> 18:31, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Calling him a "young raper" (rather than "rapper"), as DGayed did above, might be considered offensive. VfD isn't about free speech issues, it's about meeting guidelines including established significance. Somebody who's talented but so fresh they haven't signed a recording deal, completed a national tour, or garnered reviews in major publications is <b>not yet</b> WP-worthy. Resubmit the article when Korektphool gets his own TV series. <b>Weak delete</b> pending evidence of noteworthiness beyond his high-school buddies. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 14:22, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><i>Unsigned comment by 211.31.46.110.</i> That is beside the point. When people call the article "vanity" here, they mean that it was probably written by Korektphool himself, or a personal acquitance of his. This implies that you would have to know Korektphool personally to even have heard of him or his rapper career. He is not objectively notable enough to be mentioned in an encyclopedia. The Wikipedian term "vanity" is not limited to putting in a good light, critical or insulting pages count as vanity as well. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"></a> â <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 09:31, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, It seems to me this guy has some talent, perhaps people should listen to his music before calling him vain! In adding to this comment I made before, I must also respond to others which have said that this artist does not have a record deal. In regard to commercial success, there are many reason why this cannot be obtained, clearly talent is not the largest factor in it! There is also how the artist is appealing to people (that is, how they look) and sadly it is a fact of life that people of other nationalities may not be as recognised as 'majority' races; this guy is just honestly trying to get a break in life. Iâm, of course, not blaming anyone for this, its just how the life works. And Iâm sure people donât need to be reminded of the likes of Ashlee Simpson to question if she should be called vain.

<li>It is not the first time an article has been kept when a count of the explicit votes showed a 2/3 majority to delete. So? SimonP obviously judged that <i>in this case</i> 5:1 was not a "rough consensus to delete," and has given what seem to me to be well articulated reasons. VfD is not based on a mechanical vote count. It is based on <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_guidelines_for_administrators_a507.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators">Wikipedia:Deletion_guidelines_for_administrators</a>, which is very good reading BTW. I notice that it currently does not even mention the fraction "two-thirds," which was never more than a rough guideline. It does say "when in doubt, don't delete." Anyway this is VfD, not RfC, and I think we should discussing the article, not a sysop's decision. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:09, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Article is nothing but one fact + speculation. As we all know, 1 fact + speculation &lt; encyclopaedia article. Since there's a distinct possibility still that this is a hoax, I'm not certain that an article with 1 fact, 1 bit of speculation and 6 external links is worth keeping. On the other hand, the previous VfD does seem strange - plenty of delete votes, one keep, and "the result of the debate was - kept". Last vote on VfD timed at 5 days before this one tabled, so suggest that nominator waits a few weeks before trying again, to allow things to settle. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChriscf_462b.html" title="User:Chriscf">Chris</a> 20:07, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Frequently articles are created for subtopics when those subtopics may contain too much information for the main article or don't fit well with the main article. Antisemitism in the arab world today is different than, say, historical antisemitism. It requires us to think about different sorts of questions, such as when does criticism of Israel constitute anti-semitism and these questions should prompt a longer discussion in the article. As for your complaints about the content of the article, feel free to add to the article so long as your additions aren't original research or POV as your changes of yesterday were. Furthermore, I don't see how a general "counterclaim" section is particularly encyclopedic. Certainly, specific claims of antisemitism in the Arab world may be "exagerated or manufactured" as you say, but it seems to make more sense to challenge those specific claims rather than the existence of antisemitism in the first place. I would suggest including a discussion of when criticism of Israel constitutes antisemitism (Sharansky laid out a test for this that I think is somewhere on wikipedia) <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 23:16, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>As a relative newbie, I have a question about this "process," which SqueakBox is so concerned with protecting. The <a href="../../../v/f/d/Template%7EVfd_41cd.html" title="Template:Vfd">VFD</a> tag says "Please do not remove or deface this notice or blank, merge, or move this article while the discussion is in progress. " Wasn't turning it into a redirect during the discussion itself a violation of process? The <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_Votes_for_Deletion_c9d4.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to Votes for Deletion">Deletion Policy</a> page says</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>You must not blank the article, turn it into a redirect, or merge it into another article.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>(It seems to happen with some regularity, however.) (BTW, I have nothing to do with this Honduras page and couldn't care less whether it's deleted.) â<a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahoofive_09c2.html" title="User:Wahoofive">Wahoofive</a> | <a href="../../../w/a/h/User_talk%7EWahoofive_6e5c.html" title="User talk:Wahoofive">Talk</a> 01:48, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I'm surprised Guide to Votes for Deletion says that. Redirect during VfD process is not that uncommon, but usually only after a strong consensus has developed, which cannot happen in 3 hours from 3 people. Similarly, moves also sometimes happen by strong consensus. Merging is almost always a bad idea while discussion is still in progress (because it's hard to undo), and blanking is just disruptive. Genuine editorial efforts to improve the article are fine, though. Plenty of articles are salvaged that way during the VfD process -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 01:55, Apr 6, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>BTW there is a much fuller list of parties at <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Honduras_e30b.html" title="Politics of Honduras">Politics of Honduras</a> which no-one has bothered to update. So this is an out of date duplication of Politics in Honduras. I think Cesar and I acted in good faith, where i think Electionworld did not. All he needed to do was restore the Vfd. instead of which he ignored the fact that there was a 3 majority against him and reverts to his version,--<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 01:58, Apr 6, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Whether this was up to date has nothing to do with whether the breakout is a good idea. &amp; I don't really care why Electionworld did what he did. This was newly placed again on VfD, I didn't notice it last time, and I'm voting on the merits of such an article existing, not on an issue of its current text, which is not generally a VfD matter. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 02:00, Apr 6, 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Maybe I acted wrongly to revert the merger, but one cannot say that there is a consensus when only 3 hours of discussion were allowed. I argued my reason in the summary when I reverted: <i>(RV. The debate on the delete page was only open for some hours. This page is part of an extensive series on parties by country, so do not delete it.)</i>. Sorry, I thought that that would be enough. It might have been better when I would have restored the VfD template. Whe had this discussion on several pages about political parties in xxx. There was never a majority for deleting of these kind of pages. There is a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_political_parties.html" title="List of political parties">List of political parties</a> that directs to pages on political parties in every country around the world. Where the Politics of xxx pages are generally meant to provide informtion about politics in a country, the political parties are meant to lead to a more comprehensive information about parties in a country. When I started editing in Wikipedia, these pages were already existings (Honduras was already existing in 2003). Deleting this page would damage a complete and balanced information system on political parties in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilfried_Derksen_4ed6.html" title="User:Wilfried Derksen">Gangulf</a> 06:44, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and expand this school article. Notability is subjective.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>, without regard to the controversy over GRider's nominating pattern. Conlangers usually strike me as hobbyists whose efforts are no more significant than my own hobbies such as play-by-mail strategy games, but the article indicates this person is among the most influential in his field.
