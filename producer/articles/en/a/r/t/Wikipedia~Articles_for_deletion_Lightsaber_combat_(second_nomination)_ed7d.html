<dd>I agree. I've removed the "speedy" from my "keep" since it certainly doesn't apply anymore, but since this was nom'd w/o discussion and is more than a year old, with many different editors having contributed to it, I think it deserves a chance to be cut down (by <b>a lot</b>) rather than being completely erased out of hand. Real-life content <i>is</i> possible; I assume the actors (if there were any real actors in the prequels) performing the stunts did have to learn all that stuff. If the fan fiction stuff can be reduced to a minimum and replaced with reality, it could have a place here. The rest can move to Wookieepedia. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 19:39, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree strongly as well. This is utterly terrifying in its degree of absorption in its subject, and I find myself hoping that somehow a compromise can be found in which I, when reading it, am reminded at least every few pages that the whole thing's <i>fictional</i>.

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Cite</b> as per Nscheffey. This page is extremely useful to my Star Wars: Jedi Academy clan, it's no worse than some other sci-fi entries, it just needs citations! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.127.85.149 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.127.85.149_a129.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.127.85.149">contribs</a>) 20:26, June 14, 2006 (UTC) (UTC)</small></li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> -- This is a great article on the Star Wars extpanded universe. As for all the lack of citations, I guess people just missed all those "according to the MMRPG..." and "____ novel clearly states..." The sources of some statements could be clarified, but it's really a wonderful article! Also, what happened to Form III??? Did someone already try to take that part down?????? -interested reader, wcdeich 14, June 2006 Wcdeich 20:35, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> -- This article does have citations as stated above and most of the information available here is not available elsewhere, It would be a shame to lose such an informative article that is used regularily. Metroidragon Wednesday, 2006-06-14 23:00 UTC</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Cite</b> also. There's a treasure trove of information here, and from the descriptions of lightsaber combat I know from games and several books, a lot of it is accurate. It just needs citations. The page reminds me of how the Force Powers page used to look, but the Force Powers page is pretty clean now ever since we started enforcing citation. We just need to work at it. There is no need to throw out the entire article. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolberg_69b8.html" title="User:Solberg">Solberg</a> 07:43, 15 June 2006 (UTC)Solberg</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Clearly this article is well written and articulate enough to be included in Wiki. Citation is possibily needed for some areas. The main point is it is a extremely reliable and valid source that only need a "bibliography" so to speak. The fact that it revolves a fan-based media and also offical statements is evidence enough to further preserve and uphold this article's existence.
