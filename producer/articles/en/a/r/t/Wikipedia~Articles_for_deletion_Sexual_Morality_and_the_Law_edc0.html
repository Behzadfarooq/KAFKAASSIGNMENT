Additionally, the article is notable because it demonstrates the role of <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michel_Foucault_7519.html" title="Michel Foucault">Michel Foucault</a>, Jean Danet, and Guy Hocquenghem in attempting to promote pedophilia, and relates the chapter to a pro-pedophilia petition that Michel Foucault had signed:
<blockquote>
<p>The issue was brought to debate while a reform in the French Penal Code was under way in the Parliament. Many French intellectuals [1] - including Foucault, Danet and Hocquenghem - had signed a petition addressed to the Parliament in 1977 defending the decriminalization of all consented relations between adults and minors below the age of fifteen.</p>
</blockquote>
The article is quite useful in understanding the "intellectual" basis upon which pro-pedophilia movements that pose a continuing danger to public safety have attempted to justify their perversions. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn254_98f8.html" title="User:John254">John254</a> 04:00, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Surprisingly deep coverage of a lesser work of a highly influential philosopher but <i>This article is surprisingly good</i> is hardly a good criterion for deletion. Article is long enough to justify itself.

Article is well-referenced with no obvious fluff, and is split from parent article <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michel_Foucault_7519.html" title="Michel Foucault">Michel Foucault</a> because of size. Eagle's suggestion of merge to Politics, Philosophy, Culture – Interviews and other writings, 1977-1984 doesn't work because there's no article about that book at present.

<li>Comment: Foucault is significant, but this is a chapter. There should be an article on the book, perhaps, but Foucault is not at the same level as Hegel, and we haven't articles on all his works, nor on the level of Nietzsche. What is written is good, but it's far too summary, far too "remember this for the test," for my tastes. It's not actually localizing the philosophical themes. Just because Foucault is significant, that doesn't license misnamed, free floating summaries of his speeches. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:53, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think there should be <i>any</i> limits on articles that are in the realm of academics, even if the result is a disproportionate amount of information on a second-tier philosopher (it's one of my soapboxes that I use over and over). If someone wants to write 30kb on an obscure conversation regarding a famous philosopher, that's fine with me. What harm is there in this? When we sit at our computers and wistfully imagine Wikipedia in 30 years, don't we all dream of having so much knowledge on a such an obscure yet dignified topic? AfD is for deleting articles like "List of guns in Halo 2", not anything with such intellectual merit as this.</li>
<li>And regarding the style of the article, I have some qualms about the style being a bit on the OR side ("main ideas of the text"), but this can be edited and toned down to read like any other enlightened and neutral explanation of a text. I'll probably do it myself at some point today. So, although the organization is a bit superficial and non-encyclopedic, it can be changed to fit quite well in our encyclopedia. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 16:02, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, This is a conversation broadcast on the radio. Where is any evidence this had any sort of broad implications beyond the initial broadcast? I've heard several nationally broadcast discussions of sexuality and law on morning radio broadcasts in the U.S. Should we start articles for all of those? Best case scenario for those wishing to retain this info would be to move this to Politics, Philosophy, Culture – Interviews and other writings, 1977-1984 and expand it beyond that one chapter. As a standalone article about a radio conversation with no evidence of any broader impact or implications it doesn't pass muster in my opinion (and Wikipedia should never be "cliff notes).--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 15:35, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Umm, the large, pile of citations in the article to other articles (in 4 languages) about that very conversation, is evidence that the conversation got far-reaching attention. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 16:06, 24 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>From what I see it is by and large trivial mention in other works, one reprint (translation) and a mention in the context of a summary of <i>“Politics, Philosophy, Culture”</i>... which is where this article should be moved to if it is retained. I don't see any evidence that the "conversation got far-reaching attention..."--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 16:51, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't suppose that many philosophical works recieve as much attention as, say, <a href="../../../o/o/p/Oops%2C_I_Did_It_Again_990a.html" title="Oops, I Did It Again">Oops, I Did It Again</a>, but that certainly does not limit their notability, especially being that it is from a well-known and highly notable philosopher. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 18:08, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> An Encyclopedia should cover all unique and relevant information on every issue. This information is undoubtedly unique and Michel Foucault is a renowned philosopher. His opinions expressed in this chapter are really relevant to the debate about "abolition of age of consent laws", once he brings other point-of-views that nobody else has thought of. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulo_Andrade_6777.html" title="User:Paulo Andrade">Paulo Andrade</a> 23:00 July 24, 2006 (GMT)</li>
<li>It doesn't matter if it's a chapter or a book or a whole collection of books. All information in Wikipedia should be subdivided into articles enough to show all different and relevant points of view. The relevance of this radio talk is evident.

<dd><b>Comment</b> To hide relevant information from the public is simply dishonest (no matter if it's right-wing or left-wing) and disqualifies the intentions of those who oppose the content of the text. One may not agree with Foucault, but at least one should agree that it is the right of other people to know what he said. My impression is that some people are desperatly seeking any motive to hide a piece of relevant human knowledge from others. I live in a country where a whole generation of intellectuals fighted against censorship during military dictatorship for over 20 years, so I know how it looks like. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulo_Andrade_6777.html" title="User:Paulo Andrade">Paulo Andrade</a> 23:45 July 24, 2006 (GMT)

<dd>It probly isn't anything so malicious - english speakers in general are typically fairly unaware of Foucault's importance. In this discussion Foucault is called <i>less</i> important than Nietzsche, or Hegel - Whiskey Tango Foxtrot - his philosophy is referred to as an <i>indiscriminate collection of information</i> - anglos just don't know much about him because he isn't as accessible as Hume <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 02:01, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> After looking at the talk itself, I've moved a little closer to Geogre's view that the article is mostly summary and could be made shorter, but that's just an editorial issue, the topic is still fine and deletion is not appropriate. Editorial issues should be discussed on the article's talk page, not afd. Simply moving the article is inappropriate since it's a split-out from <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michel_Foucault_7519.html" title="Michel Foucault">Michel Foucault</a> about the specific topic. Further editing at <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michel_Foucault_7519.html" title="Michel Foucault">Michel Foucault</a> might change that, but not something for afd to deal with. I'd rather leave it up to the article's regular editors who know something about the subject matter.
<p>I'm not worried about having an article about a chapter of a book in and of itself. We have lots of perfectly good multi-page articles (e.g. <a href="../../../o/z/y/Ozymandias.html" title="Ozymandias">Ozymandias</a>) about 14-line poems. Also, we can't count on the talk being online all the time (for that matter, the reader might be using an offline copy of wikipedia), so having a non-copyvio summary of the talk in the encyclopedia helps the parent article considerably. See <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Saga_Begins_a709.html" title="The Saga Begins">The Saga Begins</a> for another example. <a href="../../../p/h/r/User%7EPhr_0563.html" title="User:Phr">Phr</a> (<a href="../../../p/h/r/User_talk%7EPhr_8dfe.html" title="User talk:Phr">talk</a>) 08:19, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
