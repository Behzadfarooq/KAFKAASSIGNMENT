<p>This is a pretty minor character from a pretty large series. The page just expands upon a five episode period that the character was around for (out of around 300 total episodes), and throws in some other junk.. There is really no reason the page should should exist besides for the sake of existing, so it should be redirected to it's place on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Saiyans_in_Dragon_Ball_30bf.html" title="List of Saiyans in Dragon Ball">List of Saiyans in Dragon Ball</a>. <a href="../../../t/t/n/User%7ETTN_1fb9.html" title="User:TTN">Nemu</a> 13:34, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is the kind of thing you do when people close to the article think otherwise. This helps get a better opinion of the situation. It's hardly because I'm petty.

<ol>

<li>He sparked the beginning of the DBZ series with a bang</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't think it is about the joy of deleting an article. If <a href="../../../r/a/d/Raditz.html" title="Raditz">Raditz</a> is the main article, it's supposed to go into greater detail than the list entry... it's not doing that. It's supposed to give an out-of-universe perspective on the character... it's not doing that either. How about info on the creation of the character? Details of the appearances in other media?

Beyond a plot synopses of the first few episodes (excluding Gohan's adventure in the woods), what is there to say about the guy besides that he was Goku's brother and that he's a bad guy? He kills a farmer, punks out Piccolo, Reveals Goku's origin and smacks Kuririn, kidnaps Gohan, eats a deer, thumbs his scouter, fights off Goku/Piccolo, dodges the Makankosappo, has his tail grabbed and tricks Goku, gets hurt by Gohan, gets grabbed by Goku, eats Makankosappo, DONE.

<li><b>Merge</b>. Raditz was, IMO, a minor character and more of a plot device then anything else.

<li><b>Delete or Merge</b> Regardless of his relation to the protagonist, Raditz is a minor character found in one section of the whole series, and the only people who would oppose this are merely die hard fans who have a biased viewpoint.

<li><b>Merge</b> I believe that Raditz's relevence to the start of Dragonball Z is important, but beyond that, he's done nothing to directly influence the series. He isn't a major character, and even his relation to Goku isn't really that important. There honestly isn't enough direct info on him that should be considered for a full article. Perhaps just him being listed on the list of Saiyans (or whatever that article is called) is enough, I think it is. Raditz's relevence could be easily summed up in a simple five or six sentences. --<a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajinvegeta_a129.html" title="User:Majinvegeta">Majinvegeta</a> 05:19, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Granted that there are a lot of DB and DBZ character articles that should be merged. But to declare that Raditz is more important then Nappa, Dodoria, and Zarbon, that's just beyond silly. --<b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">Farix</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheFarix_f893.html" title="User talk:TheFarix">Talk</a>) 03:38, 22 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The long-term impact that Nappa, Dodoria and Zarbon had on the DBZ storyline is minimal. Nappa served to further show the strength of the Saiyans, and also the strength of the resurrected Goku. Zarbon and Dodoria served to illustrate the strength of Frieza's army and also as fodder to illustrate the strength of Vegeta. Isn't this the same role Raditz played, to kick off the saga and show the strength of the Saiyans? (This is of course ignoring the fact that, if not for Raditz, Vegeta and Nappa would likely have not even come to earth in the first place.) Their pages are basically carbon copies of Raditz's page anyway: a short summary of their story with some other "useless" info thrown in. These pages could thus easily be merged or redirected, like the rabble seems to want to do with Raditz... Nonetheless, they are minor characters no matter how you spin it, and either all the minor characters get their own pages or none of them do. Otherwise you're just splitting hairs.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'd just like to say that Napp and Zarbon were far more of a presnece in this series than Raditz (Dodoria's arguable). The fact that Raditz dropped the opening plot twist has absolutely no bearing on whether or not he deserves his own headline here at Wikipedia. What is important is the content of the article. Nappa was in far more episodes, was the personal trainer and right hand man of one the first major villains and was pretty much the face of the "Saiyan threat" for most of the battle (responsible for the deaths of 3 of the Z senshi and incapaciting two others before Goku showed up). Zarbon and Dodoria showed similar presence as Freeza's top men, and Zarbon is present in most of what FUNimation dubbed the "Namek Saga," even handing Vegeta a severe thrashing during his tenure. Raditz really just showed up, dropped a plot twist, bit off more than he could chew, and faded into obsucurity. Giving him a full article is like giving King Cold a full article. <a href="../../../o/n/i/User%7EOnikage725_5479.html" title="User:Onikage725">Onikage725</a> 14:42, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Nappa killed three of the Z warriors and was in more episodes, yes. But Raditz' actions led to the death of the main protagonist, Goku. Raditz's presence also was the catalyst for Piccolo and Goku joining forces (a fact that has not been yet mentioned, but is still a very significant turning point in the series). If Goku had not died during Raditz's incursion, he would not have met King Kai, done all of that training, yadda yadda. Zarbon's biggest feat was whipping Vegeta. But so what? Raditz was one of the only villains to ever punk out Goku like he did. Does that make him more worthy of an article? Apparently not. Like I said, people now are just splitting hairs -- either give the minor characters all their own pages, or put them all in separate, collective lists. Not to mention, the same junk that people are complaining about on Raditz's page (voice actors, video game info) all exists as filler on Nappa's, Dodoria's and Zarbon's pages which are barely longer than Raditz's page. If you're going to start merging and redirecting, do it accross the board, don't just pick and choose characters here and there. It'll keep things consistent and tidy.

<li><b>Comment</b> So far, the "keep" comments have only pointed that the character was the first villain, albeit short-lived, of the DBZ storyline and that he is the brother of the main protagonist of the series. First of all, we don't extend notability to family members simply because they are family under any of the notability guidelines. Also, there really isn't much to say about this character. And while he does start the ball rolling for DBZ, he is no more important for that then <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_minor_InuYasha_characters_9beb.html" title="List of minor InuYasha characters">Kagome's cat</a> who was likewise <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Buyo_%28Inuyasha%29_162b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Buyo (Inuyasha)">merged</a> into a list. --<b><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">Farix</a></b> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheFarix_f893.html" title="User talk:TheFarix">Talk</a>) 03:54, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
