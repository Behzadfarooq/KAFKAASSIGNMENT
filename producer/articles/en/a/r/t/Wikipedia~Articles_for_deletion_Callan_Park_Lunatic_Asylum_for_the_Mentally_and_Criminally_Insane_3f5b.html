<li>KEEP. The article <a href="../../../c/a/l/Callan_Park%2C_New_South_Wales_6970.html" title="Callan Park, New South Wales">Callan Park, New South Wales</a> relates only to the Callan Park precinct, whereas this article contains information on the asylum itself. The asylum is the most significant feature of the area, and its importance should not be marginalised. The article must remain. Socratis57 of Balmain.</li>
<li><s><b>Nom withdrawn</b></s> Something happened to this discussion. It once was much longer. Not sure what. I was the original nominator; I tripped over it while doing some catagorization work. The article has been substancially fixed, and I now think it should be kept. It DOES need some references to make it better, but it seems to assert its own notability now. I have no idea what happened to the original debate. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 21:04, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The article still asserts that it is a mental hospital and that its future is unsure, yet <a href="../../../c/a/l/Callan_Park%2C_New_South_Wales_6970.html" title="Callan Park, New South Wales">Callan Park, New South Wales</a> asserts it closed in 1994. Are you sure this is not a copyvio from some old source. I still think it should be deleted, or rather redirected to <a href="../../../c/a/l/Callan_Park%2C_New_South_Wales_6970.html" title="Callan Park, New South Wales">Callan Park, New South Wales</a>. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 23:09, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I doubt a currently operating psychiatric hospital would still be called an "Asylum for the Criminally and Mentally Insane", so I think a title change to the facility's most recent name is in order (Callan Park Mental Hospital, I believe). Yes, the article seems to imply that it's still operating, and according to <a href="http://www.records.nsw.gov.au/archives/asylum_records_2339.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.records.nsw.gov.au/archives/asylum_records_2339.asp" rel="nofollow">NSW State Records</a>, Callan Park ceased operating in 1976 when it merged with Rozelle Hospital. <a href="http://www.callanpark.com/history.html" class="external text" title="http://www.callanpark.com/history.html" rel="nofollow">Friends of Callan Park</a> says that there were still patients in the facility until 1994 when they were moved to other buildings and it was taken over by Sydney College for the Arts. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 01:12, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Merge</b> - to Callan Park as per other views. There's no need for two articles on the same thing.</s><b>Weak keep</b> - the information covered has now changed so there's less overlap, but I'm still sceptical over whether we need two separate articles. This article could well be merged to provide a good article of FA status in the future about the suburb itself and its history, both as a mental hospital and about the redevelopment plans. <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 04:46, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I have thoroughly updated and modernised the article. Again, I draw your attention to the obvious fact that this article deals with the Asylum itself in great detail, whereas the other article merely contains general information on the site that is Callan Park. The Asylum is an important part of the history of the state of New South Wales and of the treatment and care of the insane, and therefore this article is important. I suggest that the other article <a href="../../../c/a/l/Callan_Park%2C_New_South_Wales_6970.html" title="Callan Park, New South Wales">Callan Park, New South Wales</a> be deleted or linked to this article and re-named Callan Park Grounds, New South Wales. I hope that the gangs of ne'er-do-wells that lurk the pages of this online information source will accept this. <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESocratis57_8dad.html" title="User:Socratis57">User:socratis57</a> 19 October 2006.</li>

<dl>
<dd>The proposal for renaming the other article would be inconsistent with suburb naming conventions on WP. I have to disagree with that. <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 04:47, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I agree the subject is historically notable enough for an article, and I've dug up some references which I will add shortly. <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESocratis57_8dad.html" title="User:Socratis57">User:socratis57</a>, thanks for your work on the article, but please don't insult other users as "gangs of ne'er do wells" - it's not <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civil</a> and doesn't help your case. Actually, can someone close this AfD and tag it for cleanup? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> has withdrawn the nomination (see above). --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 04:39, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Don't know what happened to the original nom, but I re-nominated it this time round. Even though some additional information has been added to the article, there are parts of the <i>History: Bedlam in Balmain</i> section which are basically copyvios from <a href="http://sydneyarchitecture.com/INW/INW19.htm" class="external text" title="http://sydneyarchitecture.com/INW/INW19.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> or <a href="http://www.cs.nsw.gov.au/rozdev/history.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.cs.nsw.gov.au/rozdev/history.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> and will need to be removed or quickly rewritten. The other additions are un-referenced. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmitch_cbf2.html" title="User:Amitch">amitch</a> 08:44, 19 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> Indeed, I <i>could have</i> been mistaken on that point. Still, the discussion appears truncated. I was watching this specific Afd. I have hundreds of things on my watch list, and I only watch AfDs I am involved in. <s>I must have mad prior comments to this AfD if I was watching it. My comments are no longer here. I cannot find them in the history. I remember distinctly catagorizing this article, and thought I had nominated.</s> Wait, I PRODed it, not AFD. Now I understand. OK. I guess I wasn't the original source of the AfD. Still, my PROD means I must have at one time thought it was deleteable. I no longer think so. The building described seems notable on face value. The article still needs clean-up but no longer seems to lack notability. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 16:45, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
