<p>Mideodeok is a type of sea squirt (styela clava) that is eaten in Korean dishes, such as soups. When served in soup, the mideodeok pops in the mouth releasing the soup it has observed. Mideodeok have an appearance somewhat like that of a small brain or acorns. There is no English word for this specifically eaten sea squirt.</p>

Runner Runner was a Northeast, Pennsylvania based punk rock band from the outskirts of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Formed in 2003, the band quickly became a forerunner in the local N.E.P.A. (Northeast, Pennsylvania) underground music scene. Their main influences were bands such as Lifetime, Jimmy Eat World, Saves the Day, Thursday, Brand New, and The Get Up Kids. Originally named "Midsummer", This act featured several lineup changes thoughout it's mainstay and featured former members of local neighboring bands like Protest, Surf Party, All Hope is Gone, Passing Time, Step Aside, and Longrun.</p>
<p>The original lineup consisted of Matt Gobler (Vocals), Chris Gill (Lead Guitar), Justin Taylor (Rhythm Guitar), Rich Stepanski (Drums), and Evan Evans (Bass Guitar). The band soon adopted a local following shortly after it's inception. In the early summer of 2004 the fivesome recorded an E.P. at Saturation Acres Studios in Danville, Pennsylvania under the engineering of Paul Smith and Brett Alexander of "The Badlees" fame. Soon after their debut self titled release, the band played with several successful underground acts such as Catch 22, Copeland, Spitalfield, and Hidden in Plain View. By the spring of 2005, the band had obtained a strong local reputation as one of the scenes most aspiring underground acts.</p>
<p>In the early summer of that same year, rhythm and bass guitarists, Justin Taylor and Evan Evans left the band. Taylor joined the local pop punk band "September Sky" becoming the band's bassist. While Evans slipped into a drug enduced haze while playing lead guitar in a short lived rock and roll band "Fiction". Former Longrun members Matt Shed (rhythm guitar) and Kevin Mulligan (bass guitar) soon replaced Taylor and Evans. The band continued to write and record while playing select concerts on the east coast but they eventually broke up in early 2006.</p>

<p>BIO – Chris Burke, Creator, “This Spartan Life”</p>
<p>Director Chris Burke graduated from NYU Film School and went on to work with some of the most creative talents in contemporary film, including directors Robert Altman, Lucio Fulci, and producer G. Mac Brown. In the 1990s, Chris started Bong + Dern, Inc., providing sound and music for more than 100 top-tier web sites, most notably AOL.com, Altoids.com and SpikeTV.com. A pioneer in interactive audio on the web, he also worked with the Beatnik audio engine on high-profile projects for Bjork and MTV Interactive. His concurrent work in videogames led him to conceive of his own project, This Spartan Life, in late 2004, with co-writer John Dylan Keith. A talk show in “game space” which uses Xbox Live and the blockbuster videogame Halo 2 as its backdrop, Burke’s This Spartan Life is at the forefront of the machinima movement. Lauded for its brilliant combination of traditional filmmaking with the creative, interactive possibilities of videogame technology, This Spartan Life has attracted the attention of countless mainstream media outlets, including Wired Magazine, The BBC, Reuters, Stuff Magazine, and BusinessWeek, and won Best Machinima Series at the 2005 Machinima Festival. In late 2005, This Spartan Life also created exclusive online content for Spike TV’s 2005 Videogame Awards, featuring an in-game interview with rockers and hardcore gamers KoRn.

Hockey Weekly and Michigan Hockey joined newspapers around Michigan and Ohio in announcing the formation of a controversial new independent Junior A-level hockey league for the 2001-02 season.</p>
<p>The Continental Elite Hockey League (CEHL) played three seasons without any affiliation with USA Hockey to create opportunities for 21-year-olds. Using many Canadians on rosters allowed the CEHL to create a strong league. A long list of CEHL players moved on to the pro ranks, including Steven MacIntyre who was signed by the New York Rangers after two seasons as the most feared fighter in the United Hockey League (UHL).</p>
<p>MacIntyre came to the CEHL after a reputation as one of Canada's best fighters in Major Junior circles. He was recruited to play for the Tri-City Hurricanes in Bay City, Michigan, who later became the Bay County Blizzard after a mid-season sale of the team by original owner Mike Killbreath and his wife. MacIntyre led the CEHL in penalty minutes and received a lifetime ban late in the season for his part in a nasty brawl with the Detroit Lightning. Banned by the CEHL, MacIntyre signed with the Muskegon Fury of the UHL and he helped them win the UHL's Colonial Cup as playoff champions.</p>
<p>The CEHL championships were won by the Detroit Lightning, Toledo Jr. Storm and New Jesey's Metro Moose.</p>
<p>The Traverse City Enforcers had the best attendance in the CEHL all three seasons by playing to near capacity crowds every game under the leadership of long-time minor league sports owner Barry Soskin. The Tri-City Hurricanes/Bay County Blizzard had the CEHL's second-best crowds during the first season, but no other CEHL club was ever to do well at the gate with the Junior A level game.</p>
<p>The first CEHL Commissioner was Kevin Shanahan and he was replaced by Gord Young. The CEHL was founded by Shanahan of Fraser, Michigan; Bob Clouston of Troy, Michigan; Barry Soskin of Chicago, Illinois; Mike Killbreath of Grand Blanc, Michigan; Carl Voelker of Fraser, Michigan; Bill Cherfoli of Fraser, Michigan; and Jamie Graves of Fraser, Michigan.</p>
<p>Voelker, Graves and Cherfoli were the owners of the Detroit Lightning, and also Great Lakes Sports Arena in Fraser. Clouston was a long-time owner and General Manager of hockey clubs, including the Port Huron North Americans of Major League Roller Hockey and many Junior A ice hockey teams. Killbreath was a long-time newspaper executive who became involved with Clouston and others in the pro roller hockey ranks. Killbreath was also one of the co-founders of the Great Lakes League in roller hockey with his team at Port Huron's McMorran Arena remaining the only USA club ever to participate in roller hockey's Major Junior version of the OHL. The league continues to play to this day, but Killbreath's Port Huron North Americans played only one season. He launched the Tri-City Hurricanes but sold them at mid-season to concentrate on establishing a CEHL team with Clouston in Mount Pleasant, Michigan. Killbreath left the CEHL instead to launch a new low-level pro league known as the International Independent Hockey League (IIHL), which began play in 2003 but ceased operations in 2004.</p>
<p>The CEHL also ceased operations after the 2003-04 season, but caused controversy when preparing for the 2004-05 season by holding tryouts and charging players to participate. The CEHL folded shortly after Traverse City Enforcers owner Barry Soskin pulled the plug on his club. Soskin resurfaced as operator again in Toledo with the East Coast Hockey League (ECHL) club he originally established as one of the most successful in all of minor league hockey under his ownership during the 1990's.</p>

The Phoenix(<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-385-50677-5</a>) is a 2001 historical novel written by <a href="../../../g/e/r/German.html" title="German">German</a> author Henning Boetius. Its central plot revolves around the 1937 <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindenburg.html" title="Hindenburg">Hindenburg</a> Disaster.</p>
<p><b>Plot</b></p>
<p><a href="../../../s/p/o/Spoiler.html" title="Spoiler">Spoiler</a></p>
<p>Fact and fiction are combined to tell the stories of two fictitious people who were involved in the catastrophe; Birger Lund, a <a href="../../../s/w/e/Swedish.html" title="Swedish">Swedish</a> journalist and passenger on the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Airship.html" title="Airship">airship</a>, who apparently suffered horrific injuries during the crash; and Edmond Boysen, a member of the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Crew.html" title="Crew">crew</a>, who was manning the controls at the time, and seems to have got away unscathed.</p>
<p>The book begins some years after the disaster has occurred, as Lund - now with a new identity due to a twist of fate - is searching for Boysen, who he hopes will provide him with some of the answers that might help him to come to terms with what happened, so that he can move on with his life. However, once the story has introduced Lund, it switches focus to Edmond Boysen, and much of the plot then unfolds against the backdrop of <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Germany_add9.html" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>, when the giant <a href="../../../z/e/p/Zeppelin.html" title="Zeppelin">Zeppelin</a> airships dominated the skies and their crew members enjoyed an almost celebrity-like lifestyle. Here the author spends a great deal of time describing the technical aspects of the airship, while its final journey and ultimate demise is told in intricate detail.</p>
<p>Birger Lund eventually catches up with Boysen towards the end of the story, and the two have a lengthy discussion as to why the disaster may have happened. They consider a number of theories, including a suggestion that the airship may have been sabotaged. Following this conversation, Lund feels he is able to get some closure and feels he can now start to rebuild his life.</p>
<p>Spoilers end here</p>
<p><b>Trivia</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Henning Boetius is the son of one of the ship's officers, and based his book on accounts his father gave of the disaster. He also did extensive research into the crash, as well as the workings of the Zeppelin.</li>

<p>Floridians are a very diverse group of people. We are from many cultures, backgrounds, and ideologies. However, someway or another we have all been brought together through a common experience: Burning Man. At heart, we all identify as BURNERS. However, Burning Man consistently means different things to different people. Thus the lifestyle, philosophy, and art of being a “Burner” is not easily defined. For many it is about sharing ourselves and who we are: our inherent arts, gifts and talents. It is about celebrating the moment together. It is about not only being free to be ourselves, but also being able to bring out the best in each other. It is about the overwhelming creativity and inspiration, the smiles and hugs, the crazy art, the antics, and the fire. Community, participation, self-expression, self-reliance; these tenets are also lifeblood of the Burning Man community. Thus, as a guide for your journey we have included a link to 10 Principles from the Burning Man website that we believe are also integral to the AfterBurn experience. Read them, and reflect on how they operate in your own life. With AfterBurn we will create our own experimental community, burn our own effigy, and PARTICIPATE in our own back yard! There are no rules about how one must behave or express oneself at this event (save the rules that serve to protect the health, safety, and the community at large). Rather, it is up to each participant to decide what and how they will contribute to our community. Whether you are new to the Burner experience or are a seasoned veteran, you are encouraged to reach into and connect with yourself to find your niche in our community. Participate! The giving of yourself is the greatest gift you can give to your community, and is imperative to the survival of this unique experiment.</p>

<p>Craft is a Swedish black metal band formed by Daniel Halen (drummer) and Mikael Nox (vocals and early guitars) in 1994.</p>
<p>Influenced by second-wave black metal bands such as <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darkthrone.html" title="Darkthrone">Darkthrone</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burzum.html" title="Burzum">Burzum</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayhem.html" title="Mayhem">Mayhem</a> and <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtic_Frost_f102.html" title="Celtic Frost">Celtic Frost</a>, Craft played raw black metal live in several Swedish venues, with songs typically about destruction and death under the name "Nocta", until 1998. In that year, the band invited John Doe of <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shining_%28band%29.html" title="Shining (band)">Shining (band)</a> (pioneers of the "suicidal" Black Metal genre) to play guitars. Nox took up full-time vocals and Joakim was enlisted as a bass player.</p>
<p>After the four-year period playing live, and with a full recording line-up ready, the band went into the Carnal Record studios to record their "Total Eclipse" demo in early 1999. Despite this being limited to 200 copies, it gained them attention outside the Swedish black metal scene, where they had been prominent and well-known figures already. Craft's first full-legnth record was released the following year, entitled "Total Soul Rape". Their second and most popular LP, "Terror Propaganda", was released by Moribund Records in 2002.</p>
<p>Drummer Daniel Halen decided to leave the band in 2005, shortly after the release of their third full-legnth album, "Fuck The Universe".</p>

<p>Combat Veterans Motorcycle Association The association is comprised of US Combat Veterans from all branches of the Armed Forces. The Combat Veterans Motorcycle Association (CVMA) is a group of riders that have two common bonds. They are Combat Veterans and ride motorcycles. CVMA reason for being is solely for the intent towards Veterans causes and issues.</p>
<p>The incorporated colors of the patch: Red represents the blood that has been shed on the battlefield. Gold (the Military gold) represents the many ethnic backgrounds in the Armed Forces. Black represents the heavy hearts possessed for those who gave their lives and for those who are considered missing in action or prisoners of war. The Skull and Ace of Spade represents the death that war leaves in its wake.</p>
<p>National CVMA: Is a non-profit association, non-territorial and not affiliated with any club. CVMA all share the common bond of being combat veterans of many conflicts and wars who also ride motorcycles. CVMA is where combat veterans can get together to carry-on the brotherhood that is shared during military service. CVMA assist veterans in any way they can. CVMA require that memebers are not dishonorably discharged and have proof of your combat service by way of your DD214. If still on active duty, proof of combat service. The headquarters is in Missouri with chapters in several states. All branches are welcome.</p>
<p>History of the Combat Veterans Motorcycle Association: In the year 1999, the Combat Vets Motorcycle Club was introduced to the internet. Up until the first part of 2001 many of memebers were led to believe it was a true and established motorcycle organization. Through many turns of events it was found out that CVMC was an internet scam to milk money from Combat Veterans. In the early months of 2001 many of the members found this scam out &amp; alerted one another. Since the memebers were all interested in the issues of Veterans, 45 members decided to form a Combat Veterans Association. After this was decided, the birth of CVMA appeared as a non profit Association on or about May 1st 2001 &amp; CVMA now will be able to continue with the main objective which is helping Veterans. The 2 main things that brought memebers together was motorcycle riding &amp; being Veterans from Combat zones or theaters. The original 45 members have adopted a patch to wear indicating that they are the original founding fathers of CVMA.</p>
<p>CVMA In Hawaii(CVMAHI): CVMAHI aim is veterans helping veterans. The CVMAHI wishes also to raise awareness for the plight of POW’s, MIA’s, and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) of veterans returning from combat theaters, and their families. CVMAHI rides for memebers therapy and to enjoy each other's brotherhood, which you can only get from being in combat. CVMAHI support all veterans' runs.</p>
<p>How CVMAHI Started In Hawaii: Bulldog was planning to start a combat veterans club in Hawaii for the brotherhood you can only find in combat. When checking on the Internet, he found Combat Veterans Motorcycle Association. So in stead of starting a club with the same principles, Bulldog and his wife She Devil joined the CVMA on Feb 14, 2004. After 3 months of proper protocol on May 15 2004 the local dominant club, The Allis Of Hawaii MC, granted Bulldog official approved to fly Combat Vets Association patch in the State of Hawaii. January 11, 2005 Combat Veterans Motorcycle Association Hawaii (CVMAHI) became a member of Street Bikers United Hawaii (SBU). On Nov 18, 2005 National Coalition of Motorcyclist (NCOM) informed CVMAHI that it had been accepted as a member of the coalition. March 19, 2006 CVMAHI State Chapter is established. On April 10, 2006 CVMAHI is incorporated, and is a registered domestic nonprofit in the State of Hawaii.</p>

<p>Sasa Illic is a legendary goalkeeper who is reputed for his extravigant or 'TV' dives. He was part of the high flying crystal palace team of the 1980's and currently is involved in coaching in the united states and sometimes is seen in england with some of the current premiership goalkeepers.</p>
<p>TV Dives</p>
<p>For some Illic is the inventor of the TV dive, which is a save that would be reletively easy to save in the first place but the 'keeper shows off by extravigantly turning it around the post instead of picking the ball up. Even today when a 'keeper like Kuzchack pulls off a TV dive it is sometimes called an ILLIC.</p>

<p>The Bronx Bunny Show was originally broadcast in 2003 on E4 in the U.K. An adult puppet show which followed the simple premise of a semi educational show for the good people of the Bronx, Brooklyn and Manhattan. The show was produced from a run down tenament building in the Bronx where Bronx Bunny and his sidekick a cigarette smoking panda named Teddy T would interview celebrities who 'done good'. Also featured on the show were pseudo educational items such as 'The Internal Gerbil' who sang songs about internal organs from inside a gay man, numbers where illustrated by pole dancing woman who contorted into the shape of that weeks number, Spanish phrases such as 'Your Mother bangs like a screen door in a Tornado' were taught. The show was braodcast sporadically on E4 and eventually on Channel 4 but ultimately got lost in the schedule, but gained quite a cult following as it featured hilarious interviews with guests such as Hugh Hefner, Jessica Alba, William Shatner and Larry Flynt.</p>

<p>Interactive novels are unique to digital space. While authors using plain paper have tried to give readers the random directionality offered by true hypertexting, it was not easily available until the development of HTML.</p>
<p>Paper novels (indeed, some digital novels) are linear, that is, read from page to page in a straight line.</p>
<p>Novels, such as <a href="http://www.nodeadtrees.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.nodeadtrees.com/" rel="nofollow">No Dead Trees</a>, however, offer readers a unique way to read fiction: choose a page, choose a character, choose a direction. By hyperlinking phrases within the novels, readers would find new ways to understand characters. There is no wrong way to read a hypertext interactive novel. Links embedded within the pages are meant to be taken -- to allow readers a choice in the novel's world.</p>
<p>There are many interactive novels on the Web. Many of the oldest ones have fallen into disuse.</p>

<p>Bigstuf is a series of annual evangelical Chrisitan camps that usually take place in the summer at <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panama_City_1cc3.html" title="Panama City">Panama City</a> or, more recently, <a href="../../../d/a/y/Daytona_Beach_608f.html" title="Daytona Beach">Daytona Beach</a>. Organized in 1988, it is is non denominational (though strongly <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charismatic.html" title="Charismatic">Charismatic</a>) nonprofit ministry based in Alpharetta, GA.</p>
<p>The camp is open to any protestant church that wishes to send a youth group. They come from all over the United States and stay in a hotel resort on the beach. During the five week stay, youth a treated to ground rumbling, loud muisc from christian rock groups and a sermon twice a day. During their free time, youth have the luxury of an always open beach, free meals and bible studies.</p>
<p>Being conservatively christian, the camp enforces a strict dress code that bars two piece bathing siuts for girls and modest dress for men. Other than that, students are asked to bring beach towels, water bottles (For free refills from the coke machines during meals!), flip flops, one-piece bathing suits, t-shirts, shorts, bibles, and journals. Shirts with spaghetti straps are prohbited.</p>

<p>Since her debut on June 1st 2004, Connie Beauchamp has been the BBC's answer to Arnold Schwarzenegger's infamous character, The Terminator. Dressed to impress the following months showed this Terminatrix systematically thrashing her way through each member of staff's personal business, only stopping to string along a few males in her quest to commit large amounts of unruly adultery. Amanda Mealing, who's previous appearence's have been in programs like Jake's Progress and GBH, is the fabulous actress who brings Connie Beauchamp to life.</p>
<p>When given a registrar, Will Curtis (played by actor Noah Huntley) Connie also made it her duty to bully and berate him through each shift, making him work extra's and driving him, along with Will adoring viewers, to insanity. Will was a hard nut to crack when it came to being unfaithful to his wife, Susan, but when Connie finally managed to make physical contact, it had viewers in uproar as she stopped just as things were getting hot, leaving Will with the taunting words, "I just needed to know I could have you."</p>
<p>But Connie wasn't all leg and lip, as we found that she had grown steadily attached to Will and that maybe she was lonely ... that insults and a cruel temper were assets she only hid behind. After not even a year of playing second fiddle to Connie, Will was ran over and crushed by an avengeful patient. In the tearful episode, viewers saw for the first time Connie bearing tears and fighting and believing she saved Will, just to see him crash once more ... our notorious heart surgeon ironically died with her hands wrapped around Will's heart as she performed internal CPR.</p>
<p>After being blamed for his death by Will's then dangerously upset widow, Connie was desperate to keep her position as Medical Director, and who better to save her career than her own husband, the equally horrific Michael Beauchamp (played by Anthony Calf). Michael was introduced in April 2005 and with him came a whole new meaning to the term 'Hospital Management'. Holby's new chairman and his foul mouthed wife manipulated the staff and left no element unturned as they fought for their dream, a 'Cardiac Centre of Excellence'. Of course, with Michael and Connie's level of naivity, their elongated, monster of a ward not only got promoted from 'Darwin' to 'Super Darwin' but managed to decrease the quality of adjacent wards like 'Keller' where managers, namingly Ric Griffin (played by Hugh Quarshie), felt it their responsibility to knock one or both Beauchamp's off their high horses and back down to earth. Super Darwin eventually collapsed and the once mighty Beauchamp's were back to square one.</p>
<p>As the hospital entered a phase of fatal uncleanliness, MRSA was diagnosed on Darwin and with this revealed that a patient, who incidently was the ward sister Chrissie Williams' father (played by actress Tina Hobley) had died of the methicillin resistant disease. Taking cowardice to a whole new level, Michael Beauchamp sweet-talked his gullible wife into covering the incident up and left the blame on her when medics did find out. The once dictator of a medical director was demoted to plain old 'Consulant' and further more got a lovely treat on top when she saw Michael and Chrissie in the early stages of doing what she does best in her ex-office.</p>
<p>Connie was depressive and all sparkle from her eyes and lips had faded as she worked off her notice, a demoted and lonely wife.</p>
<p>When Holby City contracted a new and more deadly virus, given kindly through a patient by one of Michael's old backstreet medicine buddies, Sabine Wyatt, he was on the war path and looking for a new scape goat ... Chrissie Williams. When Connie realised what Michael had done, let VRSA spread throughout the ward instead of going to jail for illegal payments, she came to what was probably the toughest decision of her life ... Darwin or Michael? Viewers were at the edges of their seats as Michael Beauchamp was escorted off Darwin by policemen, leaving Connie in a closed theatre making a puddle of tears at her feet.</p>
<p>As months passed Connie gradually grew more confidence and was back to her raving self with two new registrars to dig her teeth into; Joseph Byrne (played by Luke Roberts) and Sam Strachan (played by Tom Chambers)</p>
<p>In early 2006 we also discovered that infact Connie was bullied as a child for being "a creep, a swat, and I was plain" That experience was her inspiration to move up in the world and kick her way through the opressive streets of Peckham, London, in the fight for better things.</p>
<p>More months passed as even more holes were situated through each corridor where 10 inch Prada heels had managed to penetrate the floor until eventually, in August '06, Michael was released from prison following his appeal.</p>
<p>And so Connie's life continues as a broken hearted symbol of all which is emotional, unstable, and generally depressed middle aged woman with a burning iron rod in one hand, a tissue in the other. &lt;!– You're done!

<p>Incubus is a 2006 horror movie starring Tara Reid. The film is about six teenagers who break into what they think is an abandoned factory to seek shelter after their car breaks down. They quickly find themselves trapped and realize too late that they are not alone! Seems that in 1995 the CIA suddenly abandoned its 20-year research project into mind control, out-of-body experience and lucid dreaming. The results of the study were kept confidential and all that was left was Incubus. Suspended in a triple-locked, shatter-proof clear cube, was the comatose patient, undergoing testing and experimentation. The bizarre patient and his horrific powers hold the key to their escape and ultimately their survival. Incubus is the first Hollywood movie released in the direct-to-download model, available exclusively on AOL RED for teens at www.b-red.com.</p>

<p>In the year 2002, the League of Leagends was betrothed it's most notable contender: Ferdinand Underwood. Mr. Underwood joined the League by invitation on a train. Noted for his love for music and philanthropism, Ferdinand Underwood was recognized as a "Saint" in the League's eyes. Not only had Underwood gone from being a rich landowner to a middle class civilian by donating more than three quarters of his assests to the Daytona Beach less-priviledged, but Underwood also had an astounding love for music. During his train-ride from Lorton, VA to Sanford, FL, Underwood was approached by a gentleman in a black and royal blue suit (now the signature performance attire for the AcaFellas-his inspirational a capella group). The man sat opposite Underwood and began to hum to himself. Underwood, being the extorvert he was, began hum-harmonizing with the stranger and the two went on for several minutes making music together. When they finished, Underwood congratulated the stranger on piqueing his interest, and the stranger congratulated Underwood on his recent philanthropy work in central Florida. The stranger (who remains unidentified) then extended an invitation and saint-hood to Ferdinand Underwood in the League of Legends. Underwood modestly accepted. The League: Not much is known about the League of Legends (LOL) other than the phrase they unleashed on the Internet in late 1991 via interoffice e-mail. When referring to the league, they would type "LOL" and when questioned by a particular nameless insurance firm about the meaning behind this type, they referred to it as "Laughing out Loud" to shroud the League's existence getting out. Now, LOL is commonly used as a farce within the League because the League members actually do find it funny that a large amount of internet users do not understand the true meaning of LOL and use the term almost as a satirical pun.</p>
<p>To be continued pending approval</p>

Odyssey of the Mind is an international creativity competition that aims to develop and encourage creative thinking and critical problem solving in students from kindergarten through college. The competition was founded on the premise that creativity can be taught. Unlike most academic competitions, Odyssey does not focus solely on one subject such as math, science, history, or literature. Rather, it combines all of these and more in order to teach students the importance of original thinking. These are some more specifics of the competition: • Teams consist of five to seven students. • Teams choose one of five problems to solve over a period of six months. • The problem is solved through an eight minute skit that can include team-created sets, costumes, props, and scripts. • At the competitions, solutions are judged on their creativity. • Solutions are to be solved by the team members only. Any "outside assistance" from parents, teachers, or other students could result in penalization. • There is a regional, state, and World competition. The World finals can involve more than 15 thousand people from over 20 countries and nearly all states.</p>
<p>Here are the parameters of two past problems (problems are categorized as technical, performing arts, classics (art, literature), vehicle, or balsa wood structure).</p>
<p>Technical 2005 • Teams are to create an original dream that has three parts: cheerful, nonsensical, and nightmarish. • In the cheerful and nightmarish parts, sounds are to be made. • In the nightmarish, the team must create a monster that performs tasks. • The monster must pick something up, turn around 180 degrees, change in appearance, and perform two team created tasks. Classics 2004 • Teams must create four works of art, two being reproductions, and two being original. • At some point during the skit, something from each work of art must come to life and the objects must interact with each other. • There must be a character that cannot see the artwork when it is alive.</p>

<p>The term: "Zaxs" has in prior times not been properly understood of the correct usage in speach. It is a slang of sorts, an English term said with a European accent. When someone says, "that it Zaxs them too much!", they mean that it is of disturbing thought, idea or content, in a morbid or inappropiate way.</p>
