<li><b>Keep</b> Information about a changing online game is never going to have a solid reference. Even much more popular games, which have major web sites and published guides - these are never as complete and up to date as the games themselves. I would contest the idea that a player who uses the game is doing original research: the game is a source of information about itself. -<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldom_560d.html" title="User:Goldom">Goldom</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldom_553a.html" title="User talk:Goldom">莨夊ｩｱ</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goldom_034e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goldom">謚慕ｨｿ</a> 03:49, 29 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A game itself really can't be used as a source, in my opinion. It's not a document asserting facts with some level of evidence, it's an array of code and graphics created for entertainment. Experiencing them and then writing the experience on Wikipedia would fall under original research: research not documented anywhere else. It's like saying a person is a reference because a person can listen to them and then write it down on Wikipedia. And if there can't be solid references for 80% of the page, then it breaks the fundamental verifiability rule. —<a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMessedrocker_53b5.html" title="User:Messedrocker"><small>THIS IS</small> M<small>ESSED</small></a><a href="../../../r/_/w/Image%7ER_with_umlaut.png_0647.html" class="image" title="Image:R with umlaut.png"><img src="../../../upload/shared/a/ad/R_with_umlaut.png" alt="Image:R with umlaut.png" width="6" height="13" longdesc="../../../r/_/w/Image%7ER_with_umlaut.png_0647.html" /></a><a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMessedrocker_53b5.html" title="User:Messedrocker"><small>OCKER</small></a> <small><a href="../../../m/e/s/User_talk%7EMessedrocker_915e.html" title="User talk:Messedrocker">(TALK)</a></small> 03:54, 29 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As a comparion, think of a movie. A movie is also mostly 'graphics created for entertainment'. But certainly if someone watched a movie, then wrote an article about the movie summarizing it, this would not be original research - the movie itself provided the information. I see a game as no different. An exception would be if the writing were not merely summarizing, but inferring, such as if a user came up with their own interpretation of a movie, and wrote the article about that. But mere description I feel is fair. -<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldom_560d.html" title="User:Goldom">Goldom</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldom_553a.html" title="User talk:Goldom">莨夊ｩｱ</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goldom_034e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goldom">謚慕ｨｿ</a> 03:58, 29 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, using the film/game itself as a source is most certainly original research as outlined in <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>.--<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_Black_d709.html" title="User:Sean Black">Sean Black</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESean_Black_aa92.html" title="User talk:Sean Black"><font color="#FC0FC0">(talk)</font></a></sup> 04:05, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>In response to this comment, just so I can understand, I'm not sure what you're referring to - this part seems to me to say it is ok. "Primary sources present information or data, such as archeological artifacts; <b>film, video</b> or photographs... Research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is, of course, strongly encouraged." Where does it say not to do this?</li>
<li>In relation to this article in particular, a great deal of the facts on this article I found with little effort just looking at the link provided on the page to the official site, and surely many more such as "Endless Online features a global chat function which acts as a chat room that every player in the game world can see." would fall under "makes descriptive claims the accuracy of which is easily verifiable by any reasonable adult without specialist knowledge" - anyone who played the game would know this. While there are some facts on the page which would qualify, such as stating players motivations and feelings, and I agree should be removed, I feel there is sufficient content on the page verifiable from available sources that it should not be entirely deleted. They may not currently be cited, but there is a pretty good number of sources shown at <a href="http://www.endless-online.com/links-fan.html" class="external free" title="http://www.endless-online.com/links-fan.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.endless-online.com/links-fan.html</a>, which I found from this article, which could easily do so. I'd reccommend cleanup, and citing these pages, but not outright deletion. -<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldom_560d.html" title="User:Goldom">Goldom</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldom_553a.html" title="User talk:Goldom">莨夊ｩｱ</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goldom_034e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goldom">謚慕ｨｿ</a> 05:11, 29 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I figured I might as well just go ahead and do it myself - I've cited nearly every part of the page from available sources, and removed some that seemed inherantly unverifiable. There's only one (citation needed) still remaining, but it could also probably be dealt with by someone who knows the game. I don't play it myself, but was able to find the rest just from the links given by the game's official page. -<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldom_560d.html" title="User:Goldom">Goldom</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldom_553a.html" title="User talk:Goldom">莨夊ｩｱ</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goldom_034e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goldom">謚慕ｨｿ</a> 05:28, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>- Although many people think this should be kept, as I made point of in the discussion article, and as Messed Rocker has said before, things need to be verifiable via credible sources.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'd like to point out, for the record, that [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Self-published_sources_in_articles_about_themselves" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Self-published_sources_in_articles_about_themselves" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] actually says otherwise about the "no verifiable data." If we take the official site of a product and a product to be parts of the same entity, documenting claims a site made about itself is perfectly acceptable. Documentation of claims to the contrary, or documentation of lack of evidence, is also acceptable. Take a look at the page as it exists now; it's fairly heavily footnoted and contains links to other sources that review or provide legitimacy for Endless Online. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> 18:23, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> on the exact same grounds in the last AfD. I really don't think verifiability is a problem here. The way I see it, games and game publishers can be used as a source (and they'll undoubtedly be more than glad to provide information about their games!), that's just normal <i>encyclopedic</i> research. For example, if I state "<i><a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultima_VII_4623.html" title="Ultima VII">Ultima VII</a></i> runs in 320x200 MCGA graphics mode", I don't need a frigging game researcher to write that in a peer-reviewed paper before I can use that fact. It's written in the <i>game box.</i> ("256-color VGA graphics". There it is. I kid you not. I can provide a scan and I swear I won't modify it.) I can install the game and run it in DOSbox and by golly, it runs in 320x200 MCGA mode. This, however, would be Original Research: "<i><a href="../../../e/t/e/Baten_Kaitos%7E_Eternal_Wings_and_the_Lost_Ocean_132c.html" title="Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean">Baten Kaitos</a></i> is an example how the Japanese are moving away from cloning <i><a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultima_III_dd8b.html" title="Ultima III">Ultima III</a></i> and going toward cloning <i><a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultima_IV_0a78.html" title="Ultima IV">Ultima IV</a></i>: the player's relationship with the gameworld is affected by their choices. The game features plotlines and clicés of <i><a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_62cc.html" title="Final Fantasy">Final Fantasy</a></i> series, game mechanics of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Magic%7E_the_Gathering_c994.html" title="Magic: the Gathering">Magic: the Gathering</a></i> and marrying it with good doses of <a href="../../../b/i/o/BioWare_66af.html" title="BioWare">BioWare</a> Humour®." <i>That's</i> original research and op-edding. "New analysis and synthesis", schoolbook example of what's frigging underlined in <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. <i>That</i> belongs to my game blog, not Wikipedia.<br />
In order to provide accurate information, we <i>have</i> to accept the game publisher as an accurate source of information, as they know best what the game is about. What we shouldn't allow them to do is to write the articles. The OR policy doesn't say anything about <i>New collections of sourced facts</i>, because if those are banned, we'd ban ourselves by definition. In closing, I <i>swear</i> I'll quit now. I suck. I know. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 18:18, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>No you don't! I empathize with you. I don't want to delete it, but in the opinion of myself and MR, that is Original Research. <a href="../../../t/2E/z/User%7ET.z0n3_f4f3.html" title="User:T.z0n3">t.z0n3</a></li>
<li>This is what I was trying to say. And if an article about a primary source cannot use that source as a reference, a <b>huge</b> amount of articles would have to be deleted. I looked around, and could not find a -single- article about a book, movie, or game that cited someone else when summarizing itself. If anything, they cited the book/movie/game itself, or it most cases, nothing at all, since it should be clear that's where it came from. Again, not for drawing new conclusions, but to say what the source itself says. I know two wrongs don't make a right, but I don't think they are wrong. <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> says right out that compiling info from primary sources is encouraged. Only if that info is used to draw new conclusions is it original research. If you stated that the protagonist in <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crime_and_Punishment_8cac.html" title="Crime and Punishment">Crime and Punishment</a> is named <a href="../../../r/a/s/Raskolnikov.html" title="Raskolnikov">Raskolnikov</a>, it would be absurd to cite a book review that said so. The book is a verifiable and undeniable source for this information. -<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldom_560d.html" title="User:Goldom">Goldom</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldom_553a.html" title="User talk:Goldom">莨夊ｩｱ</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goldom_034e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goldom">謚慕ｨｿ</a> 00:00, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: To last few replies. I don't see why the company linking to these sites removes their reputabilty (if that's a word). It's not like this is an article about them, and they'd have a reason to lie to make themselves look good. But even if those are thrown out, a yahoo search for ("endless online" mmorpg) turns up 17,000 results. Just after a few minutes browsing them, I'm sure there's enough validation in there. The simple fact remains, this article now has more citations than I've -ever- seen about a video game, with the exception of a couple extremely popular titles. I would also just like to point out again, I don't want anyone thinking I have a personal agenda or bias here. I don't play this game, and I've never even heard of it before this AfD. I just think that this article has well above-average content and information to find, compared to most other non-mainstream games. -<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldom_560d.html" title="User:Goldom">Goldom</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldom_553a.html" title="User talk:Goldom">莨夊ｩｱ</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goldom_034e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goldom">謚慕ｨｿ</a> 05:40, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Here's just something for people to chew: Should the verifiability criteria put as the question "can verifiable third-party sources be found?", or the question "is there a <i>possibility</i> that verifiable third-party sources can be found?" It's almost like the question on Original Research: "Are there sources?" vs. "<i>Can</i> the statements be sourced?" I'm personally always leaning on the latter of these interpretations: It's not OR if something <i>can</i> be sourced to some work, it's Verifiable if the primary source exists, and there's a <i>possibility</i> that some independent source will show up and verify the claims.<br />
These rules are in Wikipedia to stop crackpots from pushing their theories as undisputedly valid knowledge. The rules aren't meant to stop discussing cult fictional works - that's what <i>notability criteria</i> is for! What I'm seeing here is trying to delete a work by simply stacking charges: we're proposing the article's deletion as a matter of <i>technicality</i>. "You can't verify this." The way I see is this: <i>Could</i> a reputable game magazine cover this game? (I'm guessing someone might already have.) <i>Could</i> some notable blogger review this game, for example? (Probably, and may already have.) <i>Could</i> some researcher go and conduct a methodical study of EO's player base? Now, you can ask these questions, and answer is a definite "maybe". Ask similar sort of questions about some crackpot scientific theory, and you get a definite "hell no, not even probable". --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 07:39, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You misunderstand the policies and what they are for, then. The three policies, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> are to be taken together as parts of a whole, and not to be applied separately. You also misunderstand <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> which quite clearly states articles <b>should refer only to facts, assertions, theories, ideas, claims, opinions, and arguments that have already been published by reputable publishers.</b> Not facts that should be published, or will be published, but <b>have been</b> published. Your assertion that if there exists <i>a</i> possibility <i>that verifiable third-party sources can be found</i> the information can be added and the article exist are at odds with the policy. We could hypothetically bandy about coulds all day, but at the end of the day <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> clearly states <b>The obligation to provide a reputable source lies with the editors wishing to include the material, not on those seeking to remove it.</b></li>
<li>Now that shouldn't mean stuff can't get added and then verified later, but given this article has existed since July 2005, surely that's ample time for people to find the sources they claim <b>could</b> exist. I'll quite happily change my vote if reliable, reputable, third party sources are found. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 19:43, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>However, if you go back and read <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> again closely, particularly at the end in the section on <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html#Self-published_sources" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">self-published sources</a>, you'll find that to document claims about an entity, <b>WP:V</b> allows for the source itself to provide documentation about itself, so long as that information has not been challenged by a third party. We're not using the information to document claims about another person or party, and since a lot of the information in this article is fairly basic material, the claims as they stand are fine. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 20:02, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Circular argument</b> see my statement above that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> states <b>If an article topic has no reputable, reliable, third-party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on that topic.</b> Otherwise you seem to suggest any website can be used as a reliable source on which to write an article about it, and thus every website should have an article. If that's true, I state here and now I want dibs on writing the article about my blog. You can source information from the primary source itself, but it cannot be the entire content of the article. Wikipedia is not a business directory and Wikipedia is a tertiary source, not a secondary source, which is what utilising only primary sources makes us. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 20:37, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I still don't see why the citations as listed are not reputable. Who, besides people who play the game and take the time to publish their own material on it, would know better? If you look through all the 3rd party sites, and the official site, they are all in agreement - there's no conflict of opinion on any of the information in the article, and given none of them have any reason to lie about it, let alone -all- of them lie about it, I see no reason not to believe it. Granted, self-published website may not be as widely reliable as say, a professional printed game guide, but web sites are quite commonly used as sources on wikipedia, not to mention I've seen way more errors in printed guides than I have on web sites of people who actually play the games themselves. And no, that doesn't mean every website should have an article, per notability, which this game certainly has.-<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldom_560d.html" title="User:Goldom">Goldom</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldom_553a.html" title="User talk:Goldom">莨夊ｩｱ</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goldom_034e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goldom">謚慕ｨｿ</a> 20:21, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This isn't about who would know better; after all, who would know better what members are in an unsigned band of schoolkids? Wikipedia is not a guide to the internet, it is an encyclopedia, and as such, requires third party, reputable sources on which to base articles. If this article has them, fair play, if not, well, sorry, but then it should be deleted. Wikipedia isn't the place to prove a topic's notability, it's a place to summarise it. If there is nothing to summarise, we can't have an article. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 20:57, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I still maintain that this is a slippery slope. If you start <i>demanding</i> reputable third-party sources for each and every separate assertion in Wikipedia, you end up with a lot of work. A practical example where we end up with this logic would be this: Let's see, today I read about <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deep_Impact_%28film%29_50dc.html" title="Deep Impact (film)">Deep Impact</a>; I obviously can't believe a single word about the plot, because the plot summary is completely unsourced. Further, the article cites a disreputable source (IMDB, a film database based on user submissions). And the most shocking thing is that this is not an isolated incident; articles frequently include plot summaries without providing any other source besides the movie themselves (<i>presumably</i>, as it's not even cited), and all use this highly dubious web site as a source for cast and crew information! Is there something in English language similar to Finnish National Filmography - a printed, peer-reviewed, comprehensive film reference that also has detailed plot summaries? (Cripes, we have to abandon our reputation as an instantly updated encyclopedia covering new happenings instantly - those tomes get published like every 5 years or so and are always 5 years late, or whatever!) We need to take a really great big broom and start nuking everything and everywhere! (the crowd goes "POINT well made!"). And then, after 5-10 years of waiting for the movie journal to complete their tedious work, prepare for the great question that really makes the difference: <i>what benefit would this new version have, exactly, over the version we already have?</i><br />
I believe in verifiability just as much as everyone else. It's just that I believe the world isn't black and white (No movie reference work publication delay puns intended) and that verifiability is not necessary unless it is a matter where verifiability is <i>needed</i>. Some common sense, people. And now, my favorite quote from <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>: <b>"Sources should also be appropriate to the claims made: outlandish claims beg strong sources."</b> --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 21:54, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
