<li>I don't even know what "Common Dreams" is. Anyway, the <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Horowitz_9935.html" title="David Horowitz">David Horowitz</a> article is a better place to discuss the magazine as it is a high-quality (almost GA-class) article with several dedicated contributors. —<a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDisavian_2333.html" title="User:Disavian">Disavian</a> (<a href="../../../d/i/s/User_talk%7EDisavian_f80f.html" title="User talk:Disavian"><sup>talk</sup></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Disavian_e056.html" title="Special:Contributions/Disavian"><sub>contribs</sub></a>) 18:15, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>weak keep</b> as NuclearZer0's points per notability are hard to disagree with, but might also sensibly be a section of <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Horowitz_9935.html" title="David Horowitz">David Horowitz</a>. (On the other hand, it's clearly not <i>only</i> his work, nor only notable because of its association with him.) Also, if kept, I think it should be moved to <a href="../../../f/r/o/FrontPageMagazine.com_22b3.html" title="FrontPageMagazine.com">FrontPageMagazine.com</a>. <span style="font-size: 10px">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 19:47, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> - the site's alexa rank is consistent with notable publications such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_Republic_a0ee.html" title="The New Republic">The New Republic</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Weekly_Standard_ccd3.html" title="The Weekly Standard">The Weekly Standard</a>, definitely notable.

<ul>
<li>Comparing with those two articles is akin to comparing apples and oranges; frontpagemag doesn't have a print version, so the standards for notability are higher. Also, the articles on those publications are well-developed and do a far better job of establishing notability. Finally, Alexa wasn't a measure of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> the last time I checked. —<a href="../../../d/i/s/User%7EDisavian_2333.html" title="User:Disavian">Disavian</a> (<a href="../../../d/i/s/User_talk%7EDisavian_f80f.html" title="User talk:Disavian"><sup>talk</sup></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Disavian_e056.html" title="Special:Contributions/Disavian"><sub>contribs</sub></a>) 23:07, 8 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If Frontpage gets 1.5 million readers a month, as they claim (and it doesn't seem unreasonable given the alexa rank) than they reach a larger audience than some of the most influential publication's in the US. Given their large readership and the high caliber of their contributors, I think your claim that they are not notable doesn't holds water. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 14:44, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"ATTENTION!...this is not a majority vote, but rather a discussion to establish a consensus amongst Wikipedia editors..." Please contribute to the discussion, don't just "vote". As Brighterorange noted, FPM is "clearly not <i>only</i> [Horowitz's] work, nor only notable because of its association with him" (Glazov has an article on Wikipedia as well, for a start). Further, content such as the list of contributors would unreasonably clutter Horowitz's page, which is already long enough despite undeveloped sections. The content of the current stub could be accommodated in the DHFC article...but Hipocrit has put that up for deletion too. What, exactly, is the encyclopedic purpose of shoehorning multiple notable subjects into a single article?

<dd>It is notable, but not so notable that it would not be better merged into the larger article. Merging would eliminate some redundancy, and give us one better page instead of three or four mediocre pages. It is a judgement call. Reasonable men may differ, but they should not call vandalism any good-faith attempt to improve the encyclopedia, and should not presume to lecture their fellows in all-caps. Overuse of capital letters, especially with exclamation marks, is one of the first signs of incipient jackassery. The next phase involves the use of italics, and then bold text. After the onset of tertiary symptoms, including the use of colored fonts and, in extreme cases, the blink tag, recovery is virtually unheard of. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 01:29, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Mr. Harrison didn't notice the quote markes before the capitalized word. If he looks at the top of this page he will see that I left out the enlarged text, contrasting background, red borders, and other signs of full-out jackassery that the sysop responsible for the box is guilty of. None of which got his attention, apparently.</dd>
<dd><b>I</b> apparently got his attention, but he does seem to have a problem understanding what I said. At the risk of "lecturing", let me further clarify that "discussion" is an interactive process, not just two sides spouting their views. So, first I'll respond to him: merging would indeed reduce redundancy. If the content of FPM were already in DHFC I would not argue strongly for spinning it off until it was more developed. But by "the larger article" I assume he means <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Horowitz_9935.html" title="David Horowitz">David Horowitz</a>. First, see <a href="../../../s/i/z/WP%7ESIZE_929b.html" title="WP:SIZE">WP:SIZE</a>. Second, <b>please respond</b> to the two points I made in my first response to your "vote". Then I'll respond to your response, and you can respond, and we'll eventually clarify what points we actually disagree or *GASP* maybe even come to an agreement.</dd>
<dd>BTW, I'm <b>not</b> calling vandalism "any good-faith attempt to improve the encyclopedia". Disavian's proposal is wrong-headed, but he actually shows signs of being a reasonable person who can be persuaded to see the error of his ways, and I hope will prove equally persuadable should/when I fall into error. Hipocrite is a different case. I wrote that what he was doing was approaching vandalism, and I am more and more persuaded that the assumption of good faith has to at some point be recognized as either a delusion or beside the point. I'm not his psychiatrist. He may honestly think that what he is doing is reasonable. But it isn't. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Southern_Poverty_Law_Center#Discover_the_networks" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Southern_Poverty_Law_Center#Discover_the_networks" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndyvphil_06f3.html" title="User:Andyvphil">Andyvphil</a> 12:41, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm sorry for my sarcasm. I guess there is really no reason to think you are more likely than anyone else to use bold text and capital letters. I continue to think we would do better with one good page than three less good. I would not like to see a clutch of David Horowitz pages like that we had a few months ago of pages about the life and works of <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Jones_%28radio%29_d83f.html" title="Alex Jones (radio)">Alex Jones (radio)</a>. Whatever advantage there may be to organization in having more pages is outweighed by not having relevent material on one page but having redundant material on others; by having fewer editors following each page; by changes getting out of sync; and by some pages developing as pov forks of others. That is what I think and why. Beyond that, I am content to leave it to the closer's judgement. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 18:48, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
