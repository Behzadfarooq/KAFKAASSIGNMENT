<p>Someone's true practice of vegetarianism cannot, in most cases, possibly be verified with certainty by historical means.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think it should be renamed List of famous vegetarians, or List of notable vegetarians, but it seems reasonable enough to me. It can never be completed, but that's true of many Wikipedia lists. It's unlikely that many names will end up on the list unless that person's vegetarianism is a matter of record.... what would be the point in making false claims? The section about Hitler (which I found quite interesting) shows how to deal with people who are erroneously claimed to be / have been "vegetarian". There may be disputes, of course, but that's equally true of any other article.... if that's a reason for deletion, we may as well just delete Wikipedia in its entirety. I fail to see how a simple list can be made to serve a moral agenda, but any attempt to subvert the article to this purpose should be removed, of course. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMadBaron_f496.html" title="User:TheMadBaron">TheMadBaron</a> 12:29, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Count Duckula?! Princess Daisy from Mario Bros?!?! An enormous list with zero--count 'em, <i>zero</i> references. An alternative to deletion would be to slap an {{Unreferenced}} tag on it and remove any entries without references within a reasonable timeframe (say, two weeks or so) with fair warning given on the talk page. However, I also have concerns that this list could be too broad to be maintainable (for example, every practicing Hindu who has ever lived could theoretically be included). <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 13:13, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong meat-free delete</b> for a multitude of reasons:
<ul>
<li>1) Would be better as a category, anyway</li>
<li>2) Inherently POV (as many 'vegetarians' consider eating fish/seafood ok, many do not, and call the other kind 'non-vegetarians', or people who will/will not eat products containing <a href="../../../g/e/l/Gelatine.html" title="Gelatine">gelatine</a> and other animal-derived products etc, and will end to countless edit wars, never mind the vegans chipping in).</li>
<li>3) Unmaintainable, as a massive number of notable people are vegetarian, and many people become veggie (or stop being veggie) all the time.</li>
<li>4) Difficult to research, as it is not always easy to find a verifiable source confirming a person is (or is not) a vegetarian. Potential for original research abuse. And thet {{unreferenced}} tag is ass. If an article cannot be referenced, it shouldn't exist.</li>
<li>5) Did I mention it should be a category?</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, vegetarians are always interested in learning about what famous people are/were vegetarian. They should be able to come to Wikipedia for the answers. Of course we can't verify that particular individuals <i>never</i> ate meat, all we can do is verify that they claimed to be vegetarian and were considered by others to be vegetarian. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 14:25, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That's silly...that essentially means we could never describe someone as a vegetarian. The same would go for calling someone, say, a Muslim. How can we be <i>certain</i> they didn't practice Shinto in private? What if they converted at the age of 30? Can we still say "so-and-so was a Muslim?" These issues don't prevent us from describing or categorizing people according to other labels, why should we be so prohibitively concerned about such things when discussing or listing vegetarians? <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 22:34, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For anyone who's listed as vegetarian I presume that the link to their main article will elaborate or provide context. But in order to know who was a vegetarian in particular fields or areas of society, only a list will do.

<li>Would you change to <i>Keep</i> if the title was <i>List of <b>notable</b> vegetarians</i>?

<ul>
<li>No, I'm afraid I wouldn't, for two reasons: I don't like the concept of "notability" because I don't see why a truly broad encyclopaedia wouldn't consider anything and anybody verifiable "notable" -- I simply haven't ever seen a good reason for making Wikipedia restrictive in that way; and I have a general principle that I oppose lists that cannot be sourced on the basis that they represent original research and should not be built. It's not a strongly held principle, so I don't go around trying to get lists deleted, and I rarely even bother to vote against them, so had it been "List of notable vegetarians", I probably wouldn't have bothered, although I might have urged that it only carry the names of people who have publicly stated that they are vegetarian, with each claim sourced in footnotes. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 00:26, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
