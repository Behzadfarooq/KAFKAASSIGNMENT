In case anyone has any doubt as to the notability of the article, I just added a link to the <a href="http://video.msn.com/v/us/fv/msnbc/fv.htm??g=c6714218-cb17-4f68-a5be-db40a8a2dd02&amp;f=00&amp;fg=" class="external text" title="http://video.msn.com/v/us/fv/msnbc/fv.htm??g=c6714218-cb17-4f68-a5be-db40a8a2dd02&amp;f=00&amp;fg=" rel="nofollow">On the Money</a> segment, and I added another news source<a href="http://xpress.sfsu.edu/archives/magazine/004723.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://xpress.sfsu.edu/archives/magazine/004723.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. --<a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecondSight_02d5.html" title="User:SecondSight">SecondSight</a> 21:49, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The first reference is to a general "lifestyle" (i.e., glossy puff) article which mentions this company among a number of others. The second is to a similar (if more nauseating) article in a local magazine, though it does concentrate on this company. The third (by the PR Manager of a local student magazine) is the same sort of thing, more general than the second, but focussing more on this company than the first.</dd>
<dd>So the two references that focus more on this company are local mags, and the national newspaper mentions it as one among many. I'm not impressed; others may be. (Oh, the Cable television programme; isn't it more a mark of notability <i>not</i> to be mentioned by at least one of these? There are so many of them, and so little of real significance for them to talk about.) --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 22:35, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment.</b> The USA Today article mentions other companies, but it is clearly about PickUp 101 primarily. It has a sidebar with advice from them, and only them. It describes one of their workshops, not the workshops of other companies. It even has a picture of the founder of the company. This is an article in a national publication, and clearly establishes notability of the subject. As for the other sources, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> does not exclude local magazines nor student magazines. (<a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> currently excludes student publications, but the policy is still under development and this exclusion is controversial if you read the talk page. Even if the student published article was excluded in establishing notability, the page still has enough sources, and WP:CORP still says that student publications can be used as sources.) Terms like "glossy puff" and "nauseating article in a local magazine" are merely your personal characterizations of the sources. As for the news segment, just because you don't like those programs doesn't mean that it doesn't add to the notability of the subject. --<a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecondSight_02d5.html" title="User:SecondSight">SecondSight</a> 03:58, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As has already been pointed out to you, the <i><s>News McNuggets</s>USA Today</i> mention, no matter how you spin it, isn't about the company, it's about the phenomenon.</dd>
<dd><i>I can't believe the heavily POV ladden [sic] language used in AfD</i>. As opposed to the grasping at straws, aggressive attacks, and vigorous handwaving that some people are indulging in. And God forbid I should have an actual point of view in a debate. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 15:19, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Did I forbid you from a POV? Course not, humans by their very nature will have one. At least you are now finally getting down to the point of what this AfD ought to be about. The sources themself. Naturally each of the sources mention PUA in general because the whole concept is completely foreign to most people. Thus the mention of pick up in needed for the context. <i>However...</i> all of these references mentioned start of by mentioning PickUp101/Lance Mason first and have them as the focus of the article. The mention of others in no way makes this less of a source for this article. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 20:54, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
