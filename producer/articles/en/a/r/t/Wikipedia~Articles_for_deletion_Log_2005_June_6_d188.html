<li><b>Delete</b> A google search suggests that he is an artist and <i>possibly</i> notable, but this article doesn't suggest any of that. It's also a total mess, so if no one is willing to clean it up then it might be better to just delete it and let someone who has read the guidelines and can write full sentences try from scratch--if the guy really is notable, that is. I'm not an admin or anything, so I don't know what the protocol for crappy pages of borderline notable people is. But the google search brings up some very nice glass designs, and if there is a Frantisek Janak, it needs to have pictures of those and not just his c.v. and high school yearbook photo --Mister Tattle 07:39, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A poorly written page generally should not be deleted; it should be left to be cleaned. This artist has exhibited all over and his work is in a number of museums, including at least one glass museum in the U.S. Since museums have limited funds, if more than one museum has recognized his work, then he is probably notable enough for Wikipedia (which is not paper encyclopedia and can be more flexible in determining coverage). While the page <i>is</i> poorly written, there is a lot of material to work from - just the thing a wiki is good for. <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 14:44, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Note to closer:</b> The nominator "withdrew" his VfD nomination four hours after he nominated it and removed the VfD notice from the article, so this has not really gone through the VfD process.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The stub isn't very good, but I did a little checking. Despite the quirky name, besides the work on creating the puppets, the firm, founded in 1996, appears to be a well known award-winning design firm with offices in New York and Los Angeles. In 1999, founder Peter Girardi became the youngest person to win the <a href="http://www.chrysler.com/design/design_influences/design_awards/1999/pgirardi.html#" class="external text" title="http://www.chrysler.com/design/design_influences/design_awards/1999/pgirardi.html#" rel="nofollow">Daimler-Chrysler Award for Design Excellence</a> and <i>Technology Review</i> magazine named him one of the TR100, a group of “entrepreneurs and young visionaries...most likely to make significant technological contributions in the next century." An interactive exhibit produced by the firm for the Whitney Museum of American Art - <i>Jacob Lawrence--Exploring Stories</i> - won a Gold 2002 Muse Award from the American Association of Museums. They have been the subject of numerous articles. In short, they seem to be notable and verifiable. - <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 04:29, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> and do not redirect. Having that manner of redirect would essentially be putting a pro-Toys R Us POV in the title structure of Wikipedia.

<li>Geogre and Gwalla, you are making false assumptions about Albert Kellermann in saying that the article is a libel page attacking someone the contributor knows. Everything in the article is true, if only written in a misleading manner. Geogre, if you were to read(it is too late now) a recently "vanity page" article on which you voted for deletion(and even left humorously insulting remarks about the contributor), you would see Kellermann mentioned there in passing, by first name only, yet in a way that is more upfront about his identity and that would clear up the aforesaid false assumptions. <i>unsigned comment by 209.208.117.164 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_209.208.117.164_46c9.html" title="Special:Contributions/209.208.117.164">contribs</a>)</i>

<dd>I'm looking at the rewrite, but I can't change my vote. First, it isn't bias to be the .en Wikipedia. The words we treat are English ones. Therefore, an article on German university degrees (all English words) would be a huge keeper, but an article on Hausfrau would not. Second, the article as rewritten still is definition and not discussion. There is a <i>move</i> toward discussion, but it's not really there. Therefore, I have to still say transwiki and delete. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 00:01, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Sigh. I think my rewrite addressed the dicdef issue, but the other point Geogre raises is a good one. For an English-speaking readership, it doesn't make sense to provide separate articles for all the different German degrees, especially a degree that's being phased out. A comprehensive article on German post-secondary degrees can cover all this in one place, and in a more useful format. So <b>Delete</b> my own prose. And in general, let's not be so quick to say, "It's not a dicdef, it's a stub."

<li><b>Delete</b>. I would agree with Tobycat about something this obvious. However, I have seen <i>many</i> cases where an article on a notable person was labeled "vanity" by a VfD nominator because the person was unfamiliar to the nominator and the stub was too vague to make the notability clear on its face.

<li><b>Delete</b>.

<li>Delete: 15 year old student. BTW, I'm as big a hanging judge as any, but I agree wholeheartedly that vanity articles shouldn't be speedy candidates unless they are thoroughly obvious and egregious. I.e. I support leaving their speedy deletion to official admin abuse that no one will complain of. I know that's hypocritical, but it's the best way, because there certainly <i>are</i> cases of even obvious vanity that have been potentially valuable.

<li><b>Keep</b> It was an episode of South Park, and its in an established Wikipedia Category.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I just refurbished the article. It was apparently intended to be an episode summary for South Park so that's what I turned it into. Many of the show's episodes have individual articles. There's even a navigation template between them. I've added content, added the template, and a stub notice as more could be added.

<p>allow me to respectfully make a slight correction to a couple of errors above- the entry <b>did not say the band had gone on hiatus</b>, but rather that one member had gone on hiatus in order to recieve a college education. <b>The band itself is very much hard at work</b> as demonstrated by a consistant tour schedule. Additionally, the band is an <b>indie band</b> which explains lack of entries on popular music sites such as allmusic. The record is available in independent record stores and the band currently has pending distribution deals with barnes and noble and other national distributors. The Storrow Band has listings on indie sites including starpolish, purevolume, sdam, and myspace music. Most importantly, the proof of this band's significance lies in the music itself, which will continue to take on more public relevance as the group continues to gather momentum.</p>

<p>once again previous users' comments are misinformed; as noted above, the band has distribution through several record stores. Additionally, an independent band can absoultely hold the same validity as one committed to a major label. notability is not directly about widespread distribution; if this were the case, only popular culture icons would be "notable" in this encyclopedia, and many avant garde and fringe movements would be ignored. The same cultural forces which have enabled a site such as this to exist have also reshaped the way the music industry works, and a band without major label support can still hold relevance for a large number of people. This is a real band and the information contained in the write-up is factually true. This honors the spirit of a database that prides itself in having a wide variety of knowledge and information.</p>

<p>Does trespassing at the White House make you notable enough for a Wikipedia entry? Googling for the name in this particular form gets a few hits with identical phrasing, apparently originating in a single security report. The story is probably real, but the person is almost certainly called Leijonhufvud, which is the name of a well-known Swedish noble family (a member of which was queen of Sweden in the 16th century). I don't find anything relevant, however, when googling "Leijonhufvud" in various combinations (+"white house" etc.). <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 05:48, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've never heard of this genre in my life. I thought electronic punk was called new wave or synthpunk? Seems that this is pointless. For one, any band under this genre would also automatically be eligible for one of the aforementioned punk offshoots. For two, the creator of the article can only name one band (before I deleted whoever put Green Day as a candy punk band) for this genre. And thirdly, if it is a recent genre, well... that's just dumb. Genres generally don't get their classification till about 5 years after the initial band comes out and is then copied by slews of other bands. Then someone finally thinks to name the genre. It would be impossible to name it before then since technically it would just be one band's particular unique style and a few bands imitating them.</p>

<li>Delete: I'm sure it's a <i>good</i> ensemble, but that doesn't mean that it's an encyclopedic topic. Awards are nice, but a string of awards given to a person means one thing, and that same string to a group means something altogether less (because over time good years and bad will eventually mean a pile of awards). "National" awards are similarly not really that substantial by themselves, as the categories can be narrow.

<li>(Now added my signature - oops).

However, all sites that state the grandchildren of Princess Astrid do not mention this O'Grady-Haywood, and he produces no google hits whatsoever, so I believe the probability is high that it is deliberate nonsense. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 08:09, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, the article claims that David O'Grady-Haywood was born in 1987 and is living in London as of 2005, so it's not about a person who died at birth. He seems to be either (a) completely fictional or (b) a real person whose ancestry is being misrepresented. Even if he is real and notable, the article would still need to be completely rewritten. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 05:17, Jun 7, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I came across this page on 6 June. The page had been nominated VFD by 63.173.228.51 on 25 May, though user gave no reason for explanation or nor did the user list it on VFD pages. Thus, I am following up on this as the user had begun a VFD process and I am not sure if the intent was serious or otherwise.</p>
<p>My opinion: <b>Keep</b>. Lava has been around a long time, and is notable for a number of reasons, the pumace content being part of the advertising; the fact that it is made by an industrial products company (WD-40) instead of a health care or home care products company like Proctor and Gamble (though WD-40 Company is one now, they didn't start out with that intent); and innovative (for the time, and still to some degree now) packaging design. I don't know if it's one of the major-selling soaps in the US, but I do know that it's one of the more instantly-recognizable brands out there.--<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a> 16:12, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

So there is no need to have this in English wiki, but it must be saved in Slavonic Wikies like Russian, Belorussian, Ukrainian, etc. Siberian dialects on which the language is based have a long history and are notable, but perhaps all this is only of local interest.

<li><b>Keep</b> Just because something does not interest you personally does not mean you should keep everyone who watched that episode in the dark about what it means of what was mentioned. There's two more articles (dirty sanchez and donkey punch) where the persons have had to make the articles over two pages long to avoid whiners from going around deleting them (and for another reason, one of the people who voted delete these articles is going to sneak by and delete them from the south park page in the next couple months). It's like trying to delete the movie Titanic because you thought it was stupid or a chick flick. <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThodin_0c18.html" title="User:Thodin">Thodin</a> 18:56, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I voted delete, but for information organization reasons, not to "keep people in the dark". The information is trivia within a narrow topic area (South Park). The content in the articles is not central to the show's storylines and shows up only briefly in the dialog. As a result, it is better presented in context rather than in stand-alone articles for each one. For people wanting to learn about South Park these bits of trivia may be useful. The best way for them to find them is within the South Park episode guides in which the contextual content is also discussed. I have already migrated the content of the above articles into the episode guide...so the information will not be lost if we delete the articles above.<a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobycat_72d8.html" title="User:Tobycat">Tobycat</a> 05:47, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi, this is Bromios. I just typed Infamous Adventures into a search engine and I am shocked to see that page that I've no idea existed is up for deletion. What exactly did it say? Who made it?</p>
<p>I would rather not have a page that says up for deletion then deleted itself. Could you please remove this?</p>
<p>- Bromios</p>
<p>Hello, this is Blackthorne. I don't think anyone from our team made this page. I'd rather not have one until the release is complete. Otherwise, I'd have to agree with the vanity comment.</p>

<p>OK, I am finding that there are a shocking number of invented language articles on Wikipedia that are simply non-notable, ie: they are recent, original creations of the Wikipedians who posted them to Wikipedia. Wikipedia has a strict <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policy, and Sasxsek language seems to be another one in violation of this. Googling shows that an overwheming number of hits to Sasxsek all lead back to Wikipedia--or one of its mirrors--as the original source. Wikipedia is not a platform for <i>establishing</i> the notability of anything. <a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunc_268d.html" title="User:Func"><tt>func</tt></a><a href="../../../f/u/n/User_talk%7EFunc_0951.html" title="User talk:Func"><tt>(talk)</tt></a> 18:11, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>May I ask <i>where</i> you heard about this language, apart from Wikipedia, a Wikipedia mirror, or another source that credits or that ultimately leads back to Wikipedia?

<li>Occasional browsing of some newsgroups or mailing lists. E.g., there has been quite a lot of discussion on the alt.language.artificial newsgroup. - Ar 14:31, 2005 Jun 12 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Interesting</b>. Thank you for pointing this out to me, Ar. Googling for groups turns up 68 hits. Out of those, I couldn't find any where the creator of Sasxsek, Dana Nutter, wasn't involved in the thread.

Kerman who states:
<dl>
<dd>"Gosh: 18 entire posts about SASXSEK in the last three months, none of which are archived from your vanity froup. You sent the newgroup Thu, 23 Oct 2003 09:40:29 GMT, after it was pointed out that no one was discussing your artificial language on Usenet and that you should post to alt.language.artificial. Your group hasn't been picked up beyond Easynew, Newsreaders, and Altopia which create 100% of the crap alt groups (and only a selection of the legitimate groups). Why are you here with another proposal for the same froup? You don't get to retrocharter your froup. If you want to make up for your earlier mistakes, then find some discussion for your topic.

<p>I think Earth Society should be deleted as it appears to be a self indulgent vanity article for a non noteworthy group of people. However, I am not 100% satisfied that they are non-noteworthy, as I do not know this field well, thus I have chosen to submit it for VfD rather than speedy deletion.</p>

<li>After a little bit of research, the Earth Society turns out to be a legit group. The article is written very poorly - possibly copy-pasted from somewhere else - but legitimate.

<li>Oh, my apologies if I was unclear. I would advise you to check the wiktionary 'facetious' or 'sarcastic'. A well-known aspect of some vanity creations is how they aren't wellknown because the members keep it a secret. As for your reasoning, Free Masons don't hide their existence, and Area 51 was built by the govt., which is representative of "the people", therefore it is created by "the people", who never have expressed their wishes that it remain a secret.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I don't think accountants are all that notable by default, but that doesn't matter at all, because this is actually a hoax: <i>"He became intensely interested in baseball following a curious event marking his sixth birthday. [...] When Richard's father returned home from his cashier's job at Seven Grains Market in Tallmadge Ohio he was struck in the head by a rouge [sic] black bird that had been pirched above the family's front door. The bird was reported to be in such a rage that it desisted only after consuming Vander's left eye and puncturing his right. By the time Richard reached his father, Vander had died from loss of blood. Richard and his mother buried Vander in their backyard garden and celebrated young Richard's birthday at his graveside. From that point foward, Vanderpool's love of baseball would not diminish."</i> I'm sorry, what? Someone died from loss of blood from two wounds to the eyes? And because of this incident, young Richard loved baseball? Makes sense! Furthermore, his book about the incident, named <i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</i>, was was pulled from stores when Nietzsche's great great nephew Mark sued him (never mind that the book's copyright expired ages ago), and when the book was retitled to <i>Being and Nothingness: A Phenomenological Essay on Ontology</i>, he was again sued by Sartre's "friends and publishers" and then had to give up on the whole thing because he'd exhausted every possibility for a name? Okay, I laughed at this stuff, sure, but it's a hoax. Away with it, I say.

Now, I dunno if Runner06 is his friend, a sockpuppet or a completely unrelated guy, but the point is, the original author is not a particularly credible contributor... and, more importantly, even if he were, a perfectly ordinary accountant still isn't notable enough for inclusion in Wikipedia. Of course, if he turns out to be a real person and a thoroughly extraordinary and notable accountant, I'm happy to change my vote.

<li>How is it irrelevant? I was testing to see if what was in the article was correct. The Baseball Cube has a list of <i>every</i> player ever drafted by a major league team. The article claims that he was drafted; he certainly wasn't, if the Baseball Cube doesn't have him. And of course, if the article was saying that he was playing for a team that didn't exist until three years after he stopped playing, that can't possibly be correct either. Clearly this article isn't factual. Minor league baseball teams are generally not stupid. An all-time roster is a pretty definitive resource if you want to know if somebody has ever played for that team. And this guy hasn't.

<li>Yeah, Google certainly returns a whole load of hits for that.

<li>In at least one, possibly two, ways, this is at the very least the wrong title. First, someone's shift key appears to be stuck. Second, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a> tells us that the name was in fact "Hanodaganears", which to everyone (of the bare handful that even mention the word) <i>apart from</i> Wikipedia and its mirrors apparently means "Destroyer of Towns". "Caunotaucarius" <a href="http://www.geocities.com/willow1d/factshos.html" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/willow1d/factshos.html" rel="nofollow">apparently</a> means "Town Destroyer".

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm not sure if this nickname is worthy of an article itself, since almost every prominent white person of the era who dealt with American Indians received some sort of nickname like this. <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Johnson_%281715-1774%29_a776.html" title="William Johnson (1715-1774)">William Johnson (1715-1774)</a>, for example, was Warraghiyagey, "one who does much business." But "Town Destroyer" does get mentioned (briefly) in a lot of books, and there is more to be said about the nickname -- including that it might have been originally applied to one of Washington's ancestors. All told, it might be expanded to maybe two paragraphs at most. Article worthy? --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Myers_58fc.html" title="User:Kevin Myers">Kevin Myers</a> 03:58, Jun 17, 2005 (UTC)</li>

He got regional coverage while he was alive and his passing in February, 2005 seemed to get more attention than your run-of-the-mill obituary. I'm giving it a "keep."

<li><b>Comment</b>: It's not a question of quality, but one of notability. Furthermore, I see that your username is Theblindparrot.

Are we to believe that you're <i>not</i> the same person and have instead just picked that username at random?

<dd>An article that is listed for deletion as "irredeemibly" or "inherently" POV doesn't have mere bias or POV problems—the allegation is that its very subject matter and defined scope is founded upon POV (not an NPOV reporting of notable POVs, mind you) and can't be extricated from it. An article that is incapable of being made NPOV is clearly unencyclopedic and therefore deletable. I believe it would also qualify as original research, because the content then entirely depends upon how an editor has subjectively chosen to theorize or interpret information. See <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_movies_that_have_been_cited_as_being_among_the_worst_ever_made.html" title="List of movies that have been cited as being among the worst ever made">List of movies that have been cited as being among the worst ever made</a> for a way out of this—that list functions as a report of rankings by notable judgments/standards.

<dd>If the list is too subjective then it better that it is in a separate list than in the two other articles "Tyrant" and "Tyrannicide".

<dd>It is to remove the POV from the other two articles "Tyrant" and "Tyrannicide" which can then remain clean definitions with the POV restricted to List of Tyrants. For example at the moment the list of people on whom Tyrannicide was committed includes King <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_XVI_of_France_ad74.html" title="Louis XVI of France">Louis XVI of France</a> and Tsar <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicholas_II_of_Russia_61a9.html" title="Nicholas II of Russia">Nicholas II of Russia</a>. Two autocrats who are not normally defined as tyrants. If one can argue on the Tyrannicide page that unless the victim appears in the list of Tyrants then they can not be a victim of Tyrannicide it will help keep POV out of that article. If the definition of tyrant is changed on the Tyrant page to mean only true Tyrants as defined in classical literature, then all the better because the list would cease to have any POV. But leaving aside the NPOV issue of the of list of modern tyrants for a moment, a list of classical tyrants would in itself be interesting and useful, as I am sure that like me most people do not know who they all were. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 19:48, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I may not agree with the inclusion of each and every person on that list, but I do recognize the fact that all of them are <i>commonly accepted to be</i> tyrants, which is the only thing that matters in a collaborative work such as Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'd be willing to support retention if, and only if, this was renamed to a list of clasical tyrants - or tyrants in antiquity or simmilar.

<p>There are some (a minority for sure, but they probably exist) who would consider Hitler a great leader and a savior rather than a tyrant. There's a difference between an article that currently has POV problems and one that will always have POV problems. The policies you site are not the end-all-be-all of the way things work around here. Deletions occur by consensus, not necessarily what is written down. Past consensus has typically been to delete articles that are inherently or blatantly POV. I think that is an accurate description for this article. My vote remains unchanged: <b>delete</b>.

<li>There is difference between an article name, which has NPOV the title and one which does not. "List of Tyrants" is neutral in a way that "The Tyrant Churchill" is not.</li>
<li>Explain how a title such as List of Tyrants will always have POV problems. It depends on how the introduction defines Tyrant. The introdution could define the a tyrant by using the Ancient Greek definintion or what ever. See <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_military_occupations.html" title="List of military occupations">List of military occupations</a> as an example of how the definition can be a guide for the creation of a list.</li>
<li>If "list of Tyrants" is inherently POV why is the title "Tyrant" not? By the logic being expressed by some here, it should be moved to "classical tyranny".</li>

<li>An article on&#160;?tyranny? can discuss various definitions and concepts of tyranny - the concepts will be POV but an NPOV reporting of them is possible (just like definitions of Socialism, Christianity etc). A&#160;?List of tyrants?, however, must per se apply one of those POV definitions - the selection is thus 'inherently POV'. You suggest the introduction can define tyrant - but that introduction will be POV itself - it will result in a dispute and there will be no 'neutral' ground to decide it.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The guidelines are guidelines - and an attempt to record community consensus. If you look back on the debates in VfD, you will find that there is a consensus that 'inherently POV' is grounds for deletion. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 17:39, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As I said above the title "<i>is neutral in a way that "The Tyrant Churchill" is not</i>".

He wrote "This is inherently POV" which is covered in the Policy "Procedure for deletion" under "Problems that don't require deletion"-&gt;"Article is biased or has lots of POV" with a solution of "List on <a href="../../../p/a/g/Wikipedia%7EPages_needing_attention_a7b2.html" title="Wikipedia:Pages needing attention">Wikipedia:Pages needing attention</a>."

<li>Nearly all lists are shit. They are all too often POV -- for the reason stated by Doc glasgow (they apply one definition out of many possible). One person's tyrant is also another's benevolent prince. The big problem with pages like this is that they are sinkholes for shitstirring and editwarring. If I added George W. Bush, someone would take him off. If someone else added Fidel, I'd take him off. But I daresay we could each find someone somewhere who calls both a "tyrant". However, the problem is with the modern guys. Greek tyrants, I think, are not something we're liable to squabble over. There's a case for moving to List of classical Greek tyrants or something similar and editing out the modern stuff. Banning a page title just to avoid the POV pushing doesn't strike me as a great solution. But if it's that or this page, <b>delete</b> it has to be. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 08:28, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>As I wrote on the talk page and mentioned higher up this page "<i>I have created this list to move the modern POV out of the definitions of <a href="../../../t/y/r/Tyrant.html" title="Tyrant">Tyrant</a> and <a href="../../../t/y/r/Tyrannicide.html" title="Tyrannicide">Tyrannicide</a> and to create a list of ancient Tyrants. To be listed here they ought to meet the definition of Tyrant as defined on the Tyrant page.</i>". All the modern tyrants appeared as a list in Tyrant. The list in <i>Tyrannicide</i> has been restored since I chopped it and includes <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_XVI_of_France_ad74.html" title="Louis XVI of France">Louis XVI of France</a>. It is better to have the POV in one "sinkhole" than in the defining articls. Also the list now contains many people who were classical tyrants, so only one small section at the end will have POV if the editors of the page define tyrant to include modern ones. I think this is better than the solution proposed by those who whish to delete this page. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 08:49, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually it is accurate. "Protestant heritage" (the term used in the article) is not the same as "Protestant by current religious affiliation", as you are trying to claim (many people who are not religious today are, e.g., the children or granchildren of Protestants, today they may identify themselves as non-religious but they <i>are</i> Protestant descent.) The fact is, it is indeed true that the large majority of people in the USA are of Protestant descent: perhaps 75%+ or so of US whites are Protestant or of Protestant descent, and almost all religiously affiliated US blacks are Protestants.
<dl>
<dd>By that logic you may as well say that the vast majority of U.S. white Protestants are of "Catholic heritage" since their ancestors were Catholic before the Reformation. Or of "pagan heritage" since their ancestors were European pagans before Christianization. Likewise the vast majority of U.S. black Protestants are of Muslim or animist heritage. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><sub><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">tɔk tə mi</span></sub></a> 04:47, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sounds like the Angr fellow has it in for Protestants! Even if a bare majority, that's probably because many Americans are agnostic. Nobody really debates that there are more than twice as many Protestants as Catholics, or that Muslims and Jews are at most 2 or 3 percent. I'm ok to change author's supermajority to distinct majority, but Angr's assertion that America's heritage is Catholic is ignorant and probably shows some Anti-Protestant pro-Catholic bias.
<dl>
<dd>LOL. I never said America's heritage is Catholic. I was using a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> argument against the idea that people identify with the religion of their ancestors without practicing it themselves. I don't know what "religious heritage" you would call me, since my parents grew up Baptist, converted to Catholicism after they were married, then later converted again to the Episcopal Church (i.e. neither Catholic nor Protestant), into which I was baptized and of which I am still a practicing member. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><sub><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">tɔk tə mi</span></sub></a> 07:24, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, from wikipedia, the name of your church is: "The Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America". Many protestant churches (Lutheran) use the word Catholic, but they have not joined the Orthodox church and have broken with Rome, and most folks would call Episcopals Protestants.
<dl>
<dd>Then it should be clear that I as an Episcopalian am not "anti-Protestant". --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><sub><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">tɔk tə mi</span></sub></a> 19:20, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I hardly intended to force another policy discussion by listing these articles. I only listed them as twelve different pages because past discussions on the VfD Talk page seemed to discourage bulk listing, and I only listed them at all because I happened to come across Jack W. Smith while sorting people stubs. To consider your example of the Toronto City Council, it seems to me that there is an order-of-magnitude difference between that council and the one on which Ms. Robison sits. <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cary%2C_North_Carolina_e6e9.html" title="Cary, North Carolina">Cary, North Carolina</a> has just under 100,000 people, while <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a> has 2.48 million. I have not visited either municipality, but Toronto is far more important than Cary, a significance extended to its elected officials. Moreover, the subjects of articles in the Toronto council category have, in some cases, served in that body for decades, or have run for national office, or have done other, additional newsworthy things. Ms. Robison, by contrast, has served in her office for only a few years, and has done nothing additionally newsworthy. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatusRoma_5ad4.html" title="User:NatusRoma">NatusRoma</a> 06:52, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is not a good stub because you can't tell what magazine the author is talking about. There is a design magazine with that name, still being published. There is also magazine with that name published in London for education of 0-5 year olds (EYE perhaps for "early years education"?). There have also apparently been a "a girlie magazine from the 1950s [and] a Canadian music magazine" <a href="http://www.nwfolk.com/eyemag.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nwfolk.com/eyemag.html" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>. It may be that the author is talking about <i>Eye Magazine</i> published by Hearst in 1968-1969 as their take on youth culture. Only 15 issues were published. It is difficult in any of these to see where the author came up with " published through 2001." Since there are many magazines with the name, I would delete this and wait for a real stub (or even better, a real article) on one of the magazines with that name. It's not our job to read the author's mind. - <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 00:28, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
