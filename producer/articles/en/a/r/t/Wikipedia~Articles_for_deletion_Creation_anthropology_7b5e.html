<p>Page is an example of a <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a> fork and is non-notable. While there are many things wrong with this page, primarily it isn't a real topic. While I recognize that <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationists.html" title="Creationists">creationists</a> have their own forrays relating to, for example, <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation_science.html" title="Creation science">creation science</a> or <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation_geology.html" title="Creation geology">creation geology</a>, can anybody find a work that's actually devoted to so-called "creation anthropology"? Google gives a paltry 200 and some hits for the term, and none of them appear to be about the subject. The page is a basic rehashing of creationist POV on what possibly occurred in the past history of humanity. It is not an actual statement on an actual subject. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 14:45, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Keep</b>. schroeder's argument for deletion is that the topic doesn't exist. there are 7 cited and linked articles at the end, and a cited summary from an article on the topic at the very beginning. now consider <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_JoshuaSchroeder_b799.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/JoshuaSchroeder">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/JoshuaSchroeder</a>. Then consider that <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physical_anthropology.html" title="Physical anthropology">physical anthropology</a> discusses the origins of humanity, which this article does from a creationist perspective in terms of genesis. Then <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_anthropology.html" title="Cultural anthropology">cultural anthropology</a>, which considers the origin and nature of morality, which this article does from a creationist perspective, in terms of Genesis.

<dd>It is not a real topic. It is a topic about what you think about creationism's implication for anthropology. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 00:39, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>please show me this policy, and explain how, exactly, this is a "pov fork," rather than an article describing a particular pov. <a href="../../../u/n/g/User%7EUngtss_3d2c.html" title="User:Ungtss">Ungtss</a> 16:22, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This POV-fork, which you can look up for yourself, is stating that the article's idealization is to push a POV about the subject of anthropology. You aren't describing an actual discipline, an active area of research, or anything more than a mishmash of opinions of people who don't like anthropology because they think it contradicts creationism. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 00:39, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>This does not diminish the fact that it is a POV-fork. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 15:32, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>3) since it is composed entirely of your opinion, the fact that you are on rfc for pov pushing is relevent to the credibility of your opinion.
<dl>
<dd>The fact is that is courtesy of your own action. I wouldn't call the existence of an opinion on someone else's opinion a fact worthy of consideration. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 15:18, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The fact is, your argument is based on your opinion of what is notable -- the vfd is relevent in considering how objective your opinion is in determining that. the fact that you are on rfc for pov pushing against creationism is revelent. courtesy? VfD policy requires that you discuss the vfd on the talkpage before deleting it. where's the discussion? Just another suckerpunch vfd, in direct violation of policy. Well done. <a href="../../../u/n/g/User%7EUngtss_3d2c.html" title="User:Ungtss">Ungtss</a> 15:25, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I thought you said that it didn't matter whether it was notable or not? By the way, the discussion is on the talkpage. Anybody can read it.

<dd>the sockpuppets gave up the discussion, either because they realized they had no argument, or because the one with a user name (e.g. you) decided to vfd.
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7ETHOTH_9e60.html" title="User:THOTH">User:THOTH</a> is not me, but besides that, the discussion has landed us here on the vfd where the discussion is lively and seems to be indicating that there is an argument to be made for deletion of the page. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 00:33, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It was named to parallel the other pages on the topic. it is about creationist views of anthropology. your search, limited to a single two-word phrase designed uniquely for an encyclopedia has no relevence. <a href="../../../u/n/g/User%7EUngtss_3d2c.html" title="User:Ungtss">Ungtss</a> 15:25, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, it was a page that was invented by you to maintain some of the other pages which have been subsequently deleted. Creationists may have views on all sorts of things from magic to baked beans. That does not mean we should include them in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 15:32, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>right. we should just cut out their cited and summarized views entirely, or replace them with "what schroeder thinks other people think." excellent. <a href="../../../u/n/g/User%7EUngtss_3d2c.html" title="User:Ungtss">Ungtss</a> 16:22, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Original research refers to original research by editors of <b>Wikipedia. It does not refer to original research that is published or available elsewhere</b> (although such research may be excluded if editors consider the source to be disreputable or inappropriate). The phrase "original research" in this context refers to untested theories; data, statements, concepts and ideas that have not been published in a reputable publication; or any new interpretation, analysis, or synthesis of published data, statements, concepts or ideas that, in the words of Wikipedia's founder Jimbo Wales, would amount to a "novel narrative or historical interpretation".</dd>

</dd>
<dd>please point to a single statement on this page that fits the above definition before justifying your vote with "original research." i think you'll find there aren't any. i think you'll find that the article is composed entirely of cited quotes and statements from the bible and christian writers. everything on this page is "published or available elsewhere." therefore it is absolutely, unequivally not original research. what it is is offensive to your religion. so please, when you vote delete, just back it with "heritical and must be suppressed." thank you. that is all. <a href="../../../u/n/g/User%7EUngtss_3d2c.html" title="User:Ungtss">Ungtss</a> 23:32, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>you put it up for vfd without discussion, claiming the topic didn't exist. in order to prove that the topic exists, i provided 7 links and quoted an article. you did not summarize or adjust the summary. you deleted it. find me the wikipedia policy saying that "long quotes are to be deleted wholesale on wikipedia" in order to justify your edit. my decision to boycott creationism pages is a result of your penchant for deleting everything that frightens you on these pages. I added reference to a cited scholarly article in the hope that you might begin to behave rationally. i was disappointed, but not surprised.
<dl>
<dd>Note that the idea of deleted the page was discussed on talkpage, whether Ungtss liked the discussion or not. The seven links are a nice addition but don't respond to the major point that the article is simply POV-forking, similar to having a page on Evolutionary racism talking about how evolution is inherently racist. I'm glad you've figured out my motivations for edits well-enough to basically tell the world what they are and accusing me of bad-faith edits. Fine, that's typical of your style. Moreover, your addition was typically subpar with respect to what should be included in an encyclopedia.

Yes, this article reports on original research, but it is no more original research than (say) an article on the Big Bang Theory would be. As a Darwinist myself, I obviously don't think Wikipedia should be used to <i>advocate</i> Creationist viewpoints, but those viewpoints are held by more than enough people to make them notable, and therefore worthy of inclusion in neutral, verifiable articles. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacobw_974e.html" title="User:Jacobw">Jacobw</a> 14:10, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Originally in the garden of Eden, Adam and Eve were innocent; they had no knowledge of good or evil; they were naked, and were not ashamed. They were vegetarians. They did not labor. God's only command was that they not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, because it would result in their death, which they violated.</p>
<p>Adam and Eve violated God's command, and ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Instantly, they experienced shame for the first time -- they realized they were naked and covered themselves to hide it. They also hid from God. As a result, God removed them from the garden, and cursed them. Specifically, Adam was forced to work to provide for himself and his family, and Eve was given pain in childbirth.</p>

It is fascinating that someone who is so obsessed with "reason" cannot admit that the title of the page and the contents he created was manufactured out of his own mind and not subject to anything other than his own opinion about the topic of anthropology. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 00:03, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Unscientific, and even preposterous, positions can be accepted of course in WP when enough people hold them, so there is no reason that they should not be known. But when the tactic, as seen in Ungtss arguments, is clearly to organize an invasion of just one idea by multiplying the approaches of it, articles after articles (I suppose the next article will be creation cooking recipes I see it as abusive and as an obvious npov propaganda.

<dd>I repeat that this article is a collection of cited summaries of articles by creationists on the unique topic of <i>creation anthropology</i>. This covers ideas and a point of view covered nowhere else -- it is neither a tactic nor proselytization, but an npov description of a point of view you find distasteful. it starts off with an article about "christian anthropology." The topic exists. It is widespread. The information is covered nowhere else. The article is written in npov style. your <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slippery_slope.html" title="Slippery slope">slippery slope</a> argument is baseless -- this article is NOT entitled creation cooking recipes -- it is entitled creation anthropology, and is based on a number of articles discussing the topic. as such, there is nothing in wikipedia policy to justify your vote but your distaste for this point of view. <a href="../../../u/n/g/User%7EUngtss_3d2c.html" title="User:Ungtss">Ungtss</a> 13:18, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'm afraid that argument defeated itself. your fear of "accumulation" is another way of saying, "we don't want your ideas around here.

<dd>You are talking nonsense. A synthesis is not a pov-fork is not basically manufactured. all wikipedia articles are syntheses -- they are only personal research if they are a <i>novel</i> synthesis -- which is page is not. it is not a pov fork, because it does not treat an issue covered elsewhere in a different way -- it treats the issue of "creation anthropology" in an npov way, in the only place it is treated at all. it is not manufactured. it is cited and sourced. your false analogy regarding <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hot_dog.html" title="Hot dog">hot dogs</a> requires no response. it speaks for itself. stick with your telescopes, please, schroeder. <a href="../../../u/n/g/User%7EUngtss_3d2c.html" title="User:Ungtss">Ungtss</a> 15:57, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>AG is a subset of creationism. naturally creation anthropology with reference AG. that doesn't mean that creationism can only be described on AG pages.

It's nice that you have created a subject to which a large number of groups are automatic subscribers, even without vetting your personal research essay on the topic, but this idea that it is a "unique" argument just won't cut it.

<dd>I am claiming, schroeder, that to reference AG on the issue of creation anthropology in the context of other non-ag writers on creation anthropology does not make this an AG issue -- it makes AG one of the groups who holds VIEWS on this particular issue, and are therefore useful in describing it.
